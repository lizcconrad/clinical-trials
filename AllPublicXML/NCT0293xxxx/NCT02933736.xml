  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed trial, patients will be administered ribociclib prior to surgical resection
      of their tumor. Patients will be enrolled in time-intervals sequentially (non-randomized).
      All patients will be orally-administered 5 doses of LEE011 (900 mg/d) with the final dose
      occurring at one of 3 intervals before brain tumor resection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      900 mg/d is the maximally tolerated dose (MTD), as determined in a recent Novartis-sponsored
      Phase I study for advanced solid tumor patients. The recommended dose expansion and Phase 2
      is 600mg/d for 3 weeks on and 1 week off. Due to drug pharmacokinetics, the MTD (900mg) dose
      will be used for pre-surgical dosing in order to maximize the opportunity to identify
      relevant tumor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics endpoints.

      To assess the PK, PD, and PG endpoints listed above, CSF and brain tumor tissue will be
      collected intraoperatively (for gliomas, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor tissue will be
      collected and analyzed separately). Additionally, blood samples will be obtained at 0.5, 1,
      2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the final ribociclib dose is administered.

      Patients with tumors demonstrating positive PK, PD, and PG effects will continue treatment
      with ribociclib (21 days on, 7 days off) after surgery. This will constitute the Phase II
      component of the study. Patients will be treated until unacceptable toxicity is observed, or
      until disease progression as assessed by radiographic or clinical metrics. Preliminary rates
      of progression-free survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas
      treated with ribociclib will be measured through radiographic and clinical response metrics,
      specifically Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and investigator
      discretion. Overall survival in patients with high-grade gliomas and high-grade meningiomas
      treated with ribociclib will be assessed by medical record review and survival follow up.
      Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Event (CTC AE 4.0) will be utilized to review ribociclib
      treatment effects in patients with brain tumors. The trough plasma samples of ribociclib will
      be collected at pre-dosing on each clinical visit day (e.g., days 1, 22, 43, 64...) prior to
      the administration of ceritinib on that day. Ribociclib will be administered in the clinics
      on the clinic visit days to ensure the collection of trough level samples.

          -  History of non-compliance to medical regimen or inability to grant consent.

             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.]

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate
                  post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female
                  subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner
                  for that subject.

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

               -  Note: Oral contraceptives are allowed but should be used in conjunction with a
                  barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.

        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
        appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy
        (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of
        oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
        follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

        - Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and
        for 21 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period. A condom
        is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug
        via seminal fluid.
