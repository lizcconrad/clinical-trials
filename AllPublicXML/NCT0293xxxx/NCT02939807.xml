    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II efficacy study of single agent ABC294640. Patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have experienced tumor progression with 1st line single
      agent sorafenib will receive ABC294640 500 mg po bid continuously.

      Patients will continue on therapy until the development of progressive disease per modified
      RECIST, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of patient consent or other event as outlined in
      patient discontinuation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess objective response rate (per modified RECIST) of single agent ABC294640 in second line treatment of HCC</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) at 16 weeks defined according to modified RECIST criteria in second-line ABC294640 in patients with advanced HCC who have progressed on sorafenib.</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic Assessment will be completed up to 28 days prior to registration and every 8 weeks (+/- 7 days) following registration until disease progression or other (e.g.toxicity, patient decision, etc). The baseline radiographic assessment will include CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Subsequent imaging will include only those body regions that include measureable index lesions per modified RECIST. Radiographic assessments will be completed every 8 weeks (+/- 7 days). In regards to the end of treatment visit, if the patient is taken off study and already has radiographic documentation of progressive disease, completing the radiographic assessment at the end of treatment visit is not required per study. If the patient is taken off study for other reasons such as toxicity or patient decision, it is strongly recommended that a radiographic assessment be obtained.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To estimate the time to tumor progression (TTP) in HCC patients treated with ABC294640</measure>
    <time_frame>While on study, radiographic response will be documented every 8 weeks; after discontinuation, every 3 months for a maximum of 24 months after the last patient registered</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who have not progressed by the end of the follow-up will have their TTP values censored.</description>

             risk for varices (based on the following: known history of esophageal or gastric
             varices; evidence of hepatic cirrhosis and/or portal hypertension including
             biopsy-proven cirrhosis, hypersplenism, or radiographic findings of varices) will be

             variceal bleeding, such as non-selective beta blockade. If varices are identified that
