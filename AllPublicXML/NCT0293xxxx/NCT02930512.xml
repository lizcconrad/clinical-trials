  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies show that patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) have an increased risk
      of fracture, particularly hip fracture whose complications and postoperative mortality appear
      to be higher than in the general population.

      This increased risk of fracture is due partly to an increased risk of falling, and secondly
      to an impairment of bone tissue with lower bone mineral density (BMD). A meta-analysis
      concluded that patients with IPD have lower BMD than healthy controls. Prospective studies
      also showed rapid bone loss in these patients compared with controls. The association between
      low BMD and IPD seems dependent on the severity and duration of the disease even if some data
      are contradictory. Various mechanisms may explain this bone loss including weight loss,
      malnutrition and a low level of physical activity. However, enrollments in these studies are
      often weak and it is difficult to conclude on the real impact of these factors on bone loss
      in the IPD. The main objective of our study is to assess and prioritize from these various
      bone loss mechanisms. Bone assessment by &quot;peripheral quantitative computed tomography&quot; (pQCT)
      will also assess the impact of various risk factors on bone strength parameters. The
      prevalence of vertebral compression fractures in the IPD, at this day unknown can be
      evaluated. This study will also estimate the prevalence of vertebral compression fractures in
      the IPD.
