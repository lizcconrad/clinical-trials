    <description>NCI CTCAE Version 4.0.Definition of Hematologic Dose-Limiting Toxicity (solid tumor cohort only) Any hematologic toxicity as indicated: Febrile neutropenia defined as Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever ≥ 38.5°C and /or infection requiring antibiotic or antifungal treatment Grade 4 neutropenia lasting &gt; 7 days Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting &gt; 7days Any drug-related adverse experience, regardless of grade, leading to a dose reduction of a study drug. Non-Hematologic Dose-Limiting Toxicities: Non-hematologic dose-limiting toxicity will be defined as any Grade 3, 4 or 5 nonhematologic toxicity with the specific exception of: Any grade diarrhea that occurs in the setting of poor compliance with supportive measures that last for &lt; 48 hours Any grade dehydration related to diarrhea that occurs in the setting of inadequate compliance to supportive care measures that last for &lt; 48 hours.</description>

    <description>There are 2 parts to this study: a Phase I part and a Phase II part. The Phase I portion is known as the dose escalation phase where neratinib will be tested in groups of 3-6 patients to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The phase II portion will determine whether the MTD shows a response to the tumor.</description>

    <description>Neratinib will be administered orally, or through existing gastrostomy feeding tube, once a day with food, preferably in the morning, continuously for 28-day cycles, with no rest between cycles. Dose will be scaled by body surface area (BSA).</description>
