    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of an infrared thermometer
      compared to the gold standard, mercury-in-glass thermometer. The secondary aim was to compare
      tympanic and axillary temperature measurements by evaluating agreement and correlation to
      determine whether an infrared tympanic thermometer can replace an axillary mercury
      thermometer in the emergency department.

    <description>Fever patients were measured by the infrared tympanic thermometer in the emergency department.
Their tympanic temperatures were obtained from both sides of the body three times.
Use statistical methods to evaluate the relevance and consistency between the tympanic temperatures and gold standard temperatures(measured by the glass mercury thermometer).</description>
