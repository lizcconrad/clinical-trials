  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of modified
      Sensor designs on the longevity (up to 180 days) of the Senseonics Continuous Glucose
      Monitoring (CGM) System. The investigation will also evaluate safety of the Senseonics CGM
      System usage, while in the clinic and during home use.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and Female Subjects meeting all of the following inclusion criteria will be included
        in this study:

          1. Subjects age ≥12 years

          2. Clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for ≥1 year

          3. Subject has signed an informed consent form and is willing to comply with protocol
             requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at the time of screening will be
        excluded from this study:

          1. Female subjects of childbearing capacity (defined as not surgically sterile or not
             menopausal for ≥ 1 year) who are lactating or pregnant, intending to become pregnant,
             or not practicing birth control during the course of the study.

          2. A condition preventing or complicating the placement, operation, or removal of the
             Sensor or wearing of transmitter, including upper extremity deformities or skin
             condition.

          3. Symptomatic coronary artery disease; unstable angina; myocardial infarction, transient
             ischemic attack or stroke in the past 6 months; uncontrolled hypertension
             (systolic&gt;160 mm Hg or diastolic &gt;100 mm Hg at time of screening); current congestive
             heart failure; history of cardiac arrhythmia (benign PACs and PVCs allowed). Subjects
             with asymptomatic coronary artery disease (e,g, CABG, stent placement or angioplasty)
             may participate if negative stress test within 1 year prior to screening and written
             clearance from Cardiologist documented.

          4. History of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV

          5. Currently receiving (or likely to need during the study period):

             immunosuppressant therapy; chemotherapy; anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy
             (excluding aspirin); glucocorticoids (excluding ophthalmic or nasal). This exclusion
             does include the use of inhaled glucocorticoids and the use of topical glucocorticoids
             (over sensor site only); antibiotic for chronic infection (e.g.
             osteomyelitis,endocarditis)

          6. A condition requiring or likely to require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          7. Known topical or local anesthetic allergy

          8. Known allergy to glucocorticoids

          9. Any condition that in the investigator's opinion would make the subject unable to
             complete the study or would make it not in the subject's best interest to participate
             in the study. Conditions include but are not limited to psychiatric conditions, known
             current or recent alcohol abuse or drug abuse by subject history, a condition that may
             increase the risk of induced hypoglycemia or risk related to repeated blood testing.
             Investigator will supply rationale for exclusion

         10. Participation in another clinical investigation (drug or device) within 2 weeks prior
             to screening or intent to participate during the study period

         11. The presence of any other active implanted device (as defined further in protocol)

         12. The presence of any other CGM sensor or transmitter located in upper arm (other
             location is acceptable)
