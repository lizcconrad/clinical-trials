    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter non comparative and observational study (post-market clinical
      follow-up).

      Patients operated with PASS OCT® manufactured by MEDICREA® INTERNATIONAL between July 2016
      and July 2017.

      The inclusion period will be 12 months and the follow-up 24 months
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety of the PASS OCT® system.

      The secondary endpoints are to analyze the efficacy of the system with several point of view:

        -  The quality of fusion and the time of fusion through X rays

        -  the pain with VAS

        -  the quality of life thanks to questionnaires: NDI (Neck Disability Index) and JOA for
           myelopathy

        -  the daily of the patient: return to work, sport

        -  the surgeon satisfaction.
