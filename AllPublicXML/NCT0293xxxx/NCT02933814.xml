  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to evaluate pain management regimens following ambulatory hand
      surgery. Improved pain control may be associated with decreased complications, decreased pain
      scores, decreased opioid dependence, improved patient comfort and satisfaction, and reduced
      healthcare costs. Liposomal bupivacaine is an FDA-approved local anesthetic. There will be
      two groups. One group will receive liposomal bupivacaine. One group will not. The results
      will be compared.

      Patients will be over the age of 18 ambulatory hand surgery. Approximately 40 subjects will
      participate in this study at LLU.
