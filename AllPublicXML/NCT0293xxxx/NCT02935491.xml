  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) indications are progressing rapidly as an
      alternative to conventional surgery for aortic stenosis cure. Despite a high rate of
      procedural success, some patients do not benefit from the procedure. The investigators
      hypothesis is that aortic stiffness may be of major prognostic significance after stenosis
      relief.

      The aim of this study is to test the prognostic impact of aortic stiffness estimated by the
      volume of calcifications of the thoracic aorta on the CT-scan performed systematically before
      the procedure. This prognostic value will be assessed in 4 independent cohorts issued from 4
      french cities (Lyon, Rouen, Paris, Clermont-Ferrand).

    <description>TAVI is a well-accepted method for aortic valve replacement without surgery. It is currently proposed to patients at high surgical risk or contraindicated to surgery. It consists of introducing a valve inserted inside a stent by the femoral artery in most cases.
Aortic calcifications will be determined by the analysis of the CT-scan performed systematically before the procedure. A semi-automated software (CreaTools) will be used</description>
