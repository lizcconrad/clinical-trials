    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to identify factors that may contribute to anxiety of patients
      undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy(TAH) or total laparoscopic hysterectomy(TLH) before
      and after the operation. Thus, we aimed to learn whether anxiety levels change according to
      the type of hysterectomy.

    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy is the most common gynecological procedure worldwide. . There has been a
      increasing interest towards to more minimally invasive procedures in the past decade.
      Hysterectomy operation anxiety is a complex phenomenon affected by various parameters.
      Patients' anxiety may be affected by their age, gender, educational status,type of operation
      and personality. Each patient's anxiety was measured using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory immediately before, immediately after the operation.

    <description>State anxiety (STAI-S) refers to a temporary emotional state related to a specific situation, whereas trait anxiety (STAI-T) represents anxiety as a relatively stable personality character. Each scale has values ranging from 20 to 80, with higher scores representing more severe anxiety. The STAI has no established categories, but a cutoff score of 40 has been used to identify patients with high/very high anxiety. The validity and reliability of the Turkish versions of these instruments have been validated.</description>
