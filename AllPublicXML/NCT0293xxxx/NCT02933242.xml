      This is a study measuring toxicity while making observations about the survival benefits of
      treating participants with oligometastatic disease using stereotactic ablative radiotherapy
      (SABR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess quality of life and side effects in participants with up to 5 metastatic cancer
      lesions treated with a comprehensive oligometastatic SABR treatment program. Secondarily, the
      investigators will document the disease free and overall survival.

      Rationale:

      The oligometastatic state was first defined in 1995 and refers to a stage of disease where
      cancer has spread beyond the site of origin, but is not yet widely metastatic. In such a
      state of limited metastatic disease, it is hypothesized that eradication of all sites of
      metastatic disease could result in long-term survival, or even cure, in some participants.
      Ablation of metastatic deposits can be achieved through several techniques, including
      surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or through Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy
      (SABR), a new radiotherapy technology that delivers very large, hypofractionated doses of
      radiotherapy to small tumor targets, with high rates of local control.

      Clinical evidence to support the presence of an oligometastatic state is controversial.
      However, there is emerging low quality evidence in both the surgical and SABR literature that
      this state may exist. In a study of over 5200 participants with lung metastases who underwent
      surgical resection, a 5-year survival of 36% was reported in participants who achieved a
      complete resection, much higher than would be expected for stage IV disease.3 Similarly, in
      participants treated with SABR for 1-3 lung metastases from a variety of primary tumors,
      local control with SABR was 96% at 2-years, and 2-year survival was 39%. Long-term survival
      has been demonstrated in participants treated for oligometastases with surgery or SABR at
      several other tumor sites, including liver, brain, bone, and adrenal metastases. The risk of
      further metastases after ablative treatment is up to 60-80% in some studies. SABR can also be
      used for further salvage at newly progressive sites (oligoprogression).

      Despite the apparent achievement of long-term survival with ablative treatment for
      oligometastatic disease, the level of evidence to support such treatments is weak, often
      based on single-arm studies without appropriate controls. Participants included in such
      reports are highly selected, based on good performance status and slow pace of tumor
      progression. It has been suggested that the long-term survival achieved with treatment of
      oligometastases is a result of the selection of fit participants with very slow-growing
      tumors, rather than the result of treatment intervention.

      Randomized trials are therefore necessary to establish the utility of ablative treatment of
      oligometastatic disease, and therefore the BCCA oligometastatic SABR group, recommends that
      participants be considered for a randomized control before being offered SABR on this current
      trial. In some circumstances, participants may not be comfortable with this approach, or
      their physicians do not have clinical equipoise, and therefore SABR for oligometastatic
      disease may be appropriate. BCCA has decided that given the limited evidence for SABR in this
      setting, it will not be offered off trial. The main focus of this trial is to assess the side
      effects and quality of life post SABR. This trial aims to provide a clear informed consent
      process, including the limited evidence for SABR off trial, and potential harm from SABR, for
      participants opting to pursue SABR for oligometastases.

      This is a non-randomized phase II trial where all participants will receive experimental SABR
      to all sites of metastatic disease. The investigators will accrue 200 participants to assess
      toxicity associated with this experimental treatment.

               -  Brain CT or MRI imaging (for tumor sites with propensity for brain metastasis)

               -  Body imaging:

                    -  CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with bone scan required if no PET-CT is performed

                    -  PET-CT is only required for specific evidence-based indications, and in such
                       cases the CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan are not required:

                    -  MRI spine for participants with vertebral or paraspinal metastases

               -  For other indications, at the discretion of the treating oncologists, PET-CT
                  scans may be done but are not required.

               -  Liver function tests (AST,ALT,GGT, alkaline phosphatase) for participants with
                  liver metastases

               -  Tumor marker testing as appropriate (e.g. CEA for colorectal cancer, PSA for
                  prostate cancer, etc)

               -  Pregnancy test for women of child-bearing age

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  All sites of disease can be safely treated based on criteria below

          -  For non-brainstem mets, maximum size of 3cm if using single fraction radiosurgery.

               -  If size is from 3.1 to 4cm, 25-35Gy/5 can be considered with discussions of CNS
                  ROs

               -  Maximum size of 6 cm for lesions outside the brain, except:

                    -  Bone metastases over 5 cm may be included, if in the opinion of the local PI
                       it can be treated safely (e.g. rib, scapula, pelvis)

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months

               -  - In many scenarios this is best estimated by a multidisciplinary opinion by
                  disease site experts in the site. This is often best obtained by presentation at
                  multidisciplinary tumours rounds.

          -  Not a candidate for surgical resection at all sites: surgery to all sites not
             recommended by multidisciplinary team, or unfit or declining surgery.

          -  Not a candidate for an open clinical trial at treating centre that randomizes between
             SABR and a standard treatment that randomizes between SABR and a standard treatment.

          -  Prior chemotherapy allowed but no chemotherapy (cytotoxic or molecularly targeted
             agents) 48 hours prior to first fraction of radiotherapy, during radiotherapy, or 48
             hours after last fraction. Certain chemotherapy agents may require a longer break
             prior to or after SABR if protocols dictate. Hormonal therapy during SABR is allowed.

          -  The potential treating SABR radiation oncologist reserves the right to require a
             multidisciplinary note documenting life expectancy, other treatment options and
             suitability for SABR.

          -  Patients with metastases that have been previously treated may be eligible for this
             SABR protocol:

               -  If the previous treatment was systemic therapy, the patient may be eligible, if
                  the metastases have demonstrated a complete radiologic response

               -  If the previous treatment was by a local non-radiation means (e.g. prior
                  resection, RFA or microwave ablation), then SABR may be considered for
                  residual/recurrent disease

               -  If the previous treatment was SABR, the patient is not eligible unless the new
                  site(s) was/were not previously treated

               -  If the previous treatment was conventional RT, SABR could be considered if it can
                  be delivered safely. In such a circumstance it must be presented in a
                  multidisciplinary setting for approval.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical co-morbidities precluding radiotherapy

          -  Bone metastasis in a femoral bone if risk of pending fracture is high

          -  Participants with 1-3 brain metastasis and no disease elsewhere (these participants
             should not be accrued but treated with stereotactic radiotherapy as per results of
             published randomized trials)

          -  Complete response to first-line chemotherapy (i.e. no measurable target for SABR)

          -  Persistent malignant pleural effusion

          -  Inability to treat all sites of active disease with ablative intent

          -  Clinical or radiological evidence of spinal cord compression

          -  Dominant brain metastasis requiring surgical decompression
