  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infarct size is a major determinant of vital prognosis after AMI. We recently reported that
      cyclosporine A, when administered immediately prior to PCI reperfusion, can significantly
      reduce infarct size in STEMI patients. The CIRCUS study aimed at determining the impact of
      cyclosporine on the combined incidence of (death, hospitalization for heart failure, LV
      remodelling) at one year after AMI. However, many patients may display increased adverse LV
      remodelling beyond year 1 and develop heart failure thereafter. The present CIRCUS II trial
      aims at examining the 3-year clinical outcome of all patients recruited in the CIRCUS study.
