  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence of general anesthesia is a critical period, in the same way as the induction of
      anesthesia, during which several adverse events may occur. Extubation may even be more
      difficult than the intubation, with a higher respiratory complications rate. Among these,
      cough is common and expected. It can be associated with significant complications including
      hypertension, tachycardia, increased intracranial pressure, bleeding at the surgical site or
      even wound dehiscence.

      The incidence of coughing during emergence of general anesthesia varies depending on the type
      of airway instrumentation, the population under study, agents used for the maintenance of the
      anesthesia and techniques used to prevent coughing. In the literature, the incidence of
      coughing during emergence of general anesthesia under endotracheal intubation varies from 38
      to 96%. In our center, the incidence of coughing during emergence of general anesthesia under
      desflurane and endotracheal intubation is 30 % according to a local preliminary study.

      Propofol is well-known to inhibit airway reflexes. Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is
      associated with a lower incidence of coughing compared to inhalated anesthesia. The efficacy
      of propofol at a subhypnotic dose to reduce coughing during emergence has recently been
      demonstrated in patients undergoing nasal surgery under sevoflurane. However, the most
      effective antitussive dose remains unknown and its efficacy during anesthesia under
      desflurane has not yet been demonstrated.

      Propofol is rapidly available, simple to administer and has an interesting pharmacological
      profile, among others due to its short half-life.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate if an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of propofol is more
      effective than placebo administration to decrease the incidence of coughing during emergence
      of general anesthesia under desflurane (PROPOREV). Propofol could also reduce the incidence
      of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
