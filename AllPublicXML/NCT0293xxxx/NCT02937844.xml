  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CAR T cell immunotherapy has achieved great success in CD19+ B-cell malignancies. Whether
      this new generation of cell-based immunotherapy can be applied to solid tumors remain to be
      investigated, partly due to hostile immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment which favors
      tumor growth but not immune system. Signaling pathway of programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its
      ligand PD-L1 plays an important role in suppressing immune response against tumors. PD-L1 is
      over-expressed in 88% of glioblastoma.

      We constructed a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) containing the extracellular domain of PD1
      fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of the costimulatory molecule CD28. CSR
      modified T cells are able to recognize PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and transduce signals to
      activate T cells, which results in tumor killing. A truncated EGFR (tEGFR) which lacks of the
      ligand binding domain and cytoplasmic kinase domain of wildtype EGFR is incorporated into the
      CSR vector and is used for in vivo tracking and ablation of CSR T cells when necessary. This
      pilot study is to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous CSR T cells in patients
      with recurrent glioblastoma.
