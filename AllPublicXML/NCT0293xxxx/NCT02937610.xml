    <textblock>
      PEG tubes are commonly used to provide nutritional support to patients with head and neck
      cancer. PEG insertions are typically carried out by gastroenterologists, but also
      otorhinolaryngologist - head and neck surgeons perform the procedure in some countries.
      Prospective studies on PEG tube placements in an ORL - HNS service are lacking. The
      investigators aim was to prospectively evaluate the preformance of ORL - HN surgeons in PEG
      tube insertions, and analyze the time gains and cost effectiveness achieved of the
      independency from other specialities.
