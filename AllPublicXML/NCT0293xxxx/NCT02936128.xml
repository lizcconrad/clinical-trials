          3. Index Ulcer is located on the leg, below the knee

          4. The Index Ulcer is a Venous Leg Ulcer (VLU) greater than 10 cm2, inclusive, at the
             Screening Visit

          5. The longest length and longest width measurements for the Index Ulcer are no less than
             1 cm each at the Screening Visit

          6. The Index Ulcer extends into the dermis or subcutaneous tissue without evidence of

          7. Wound is free of necrotic debris

          8. Patient has adequate circulation to the foot as documented by Ankle Brachial Index
             (ABI) or Toe Brachial Index (TBI)

          9. Confirmed diagnosis of venous insufficiency with duplex ultrasonography to demonstrate

          9. Patient is Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive or has Acquired Immune
             Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

         10. Current evidence of cellulitis, or other evidence of infection including fever or pus

         13. Patient's Index Ulcer has decreased by ≥ 20% during 1-week screening period

         14. Patient's random blood sugar is &gt; 450 mg/dl at screening

         15. Patient is unable to receive compression therapy as a part of standard of care

         19. Patient has had within the last 30 days, or is currently undergoing, or is planning
             for wound treatments with growth factors, living skin, dermal substitutes or other
             advanced biological therapies

         20. Patient is an employee, or an immediate family member of an employee, of the sponsor
             company or site research staff conducting the study

         21. Patients who have already been randomized in Protocol 352 at any center may not be
             considered for screening or for re-entry into the trial at any center, even after the
             End of Study Visit
