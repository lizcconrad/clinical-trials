  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the use of a cell phone for monitoring
      patients with heart failure. Participants will be asked questions about their heart failure
      daily and participants will need to answer them. The investigator will try to assess if the
      questions are easily understood by the participants. The investigator will also assess if the
      phone-based system for monitoring is easy to use by the participants. The investigator will
      also assess if the daily questions and interactions increase the self-efficacy, knowledge,
      and quality of life of participants related to their heart failure.

    <measure>Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>This was used from the Chronic disease self-management program scales. (http://patienteducation.stanford.edu/research). Well-validated scale rating patient's confidence in managing chronic illness. It covers several areas of chronic diseases including symptom control, role functions, emotional functioning, and communicating with physicians. The English version has 6-items, while the Spanish version has 4-items.16 Using a Likert scale with item scores ranging from 1 to 10; scale score is the mean of the items.</description>

    <measure>Communication with Physicians</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>This was used from the Chronic disease self-management program scales. (http://patienteducation.stanford.edu/research). Measures key behaviors to assess how well patients communicate with their healthcare providers. Using a Likert scale with item scores ranging from 0 to 5, scale score is the mean of the three items.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Visual Numeric</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>This was used from the Chronic disease self-management program scales. (http://patienteducation.stanford.edu/research). Assesses self-reported fatigue in the past 2 weeks. This visual numeric scale is a modified version of the visual analog scale. It uses 10 bars of different heights and shading intensity.</description>

    <description>A standard cell phone system sent web-browser messages daily to ask about their weight and symptoms of heart failure. Participants received up to 3 daily messages 15 minutes apart at a time of their choosing for 90 days. Participants were given a mobile phone for the 90 day period and a weight scale.</description>
