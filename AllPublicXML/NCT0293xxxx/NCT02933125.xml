    <textblock>
      Background: Substance abuse among children and adolescents is an important public health
      issue in Taiwan. Kaoshiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Taiwan Kaoshiung Juvenile and
      Family Court will cooperate in a counseling program for adolescents with illicit drug abusers
      in 2013, to perform a mandatory 10-week family-based group psychotherapy.

      Aims: This study aims (1) to investigate the effectiveness of the family-based group
      psychotherapy for adolescents with illicit drug abusers and their parents; (2) to identify
      whether the counseling program is effective for preventing the adolescents from relapse of
      substance abuse.

      Expected Results: The investigators expect that (1) group psychotherapy may involve
      comprehensive benefits for adolescents with illicit drug abusers, by improving the changes in
      adolescents' substance-craving symptoms and behavioral problems, and reducing stress of their
      parents; (2) this counseling program is effective for preventing the adolescents from relapse
      of substance abuse; (3) the findings in this study will not only demonstrate empirical
      evidence of treatment effectiveness for adolescents with illicit drug abuse, but will also
      provide useful clues for future implementation of policy making.

      1. The investigators plan to recruit 200 adolescents (=&lt; 20 years) with illicit drug
           abusers and their parents (100 of intervention group and 100 of comparison group).

        2. The intervention group consists of youths that participate in a program that combines a
           weekly 10-session out-patient motivational enhancement psychotherapy (MEP) program for
           youths with an additional weekly 10-session parenting skill training (PST) program for
           their guardians.

        3. The comparison group consists of youths that receive standard supervision by the court.
           All participants were followed up for a maximum of three years.

        4. The assessments for adolescents and their parents will be taken at pre- and
           post-treatment, using the Adolescents' Behavior-problem Scale, the Craving Beliefs
           Questionnaire, the Family APGAR, the Parenting Stress Index-Short From (PSI/SF) and the
           Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ).

        5. The information of adolescents' relapse of substance abuse will be collected by
           Kaoshiung Juvenile and Family Court.
