  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard, high lead and sodium channel provoked electrocardiograms of a healthy volunteers
      will be performed to observe the various ECG changes. Participants will the undergo detailed
      imaging with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and deep genotyping to identify structural or
      genetic variants which might dictate the electrocardiographic patterns at rest and with
      sodium channel provocation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit healthy subjects without a history of cardiac symptoms or a
      family history of sudden death or premature arrhythmogenic cardiac disease. Participants will
      undergo electrocardiographic phenotype assessment with standard and high lead
      electrocardiogram and sodium channel provocation. Detailed cardiac structural examination
      will be performed with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to look for any variation in mainly
      right ventricular outflow tract structure and myocardial architecture. Participants will also
      undergo targeted genomic sequencing to look for variations in genes encoding for cardiac
      sodium channel.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The qualitative and quantitative effects of ajmaline provocation on parameters of cardiac conduction in healthy subjects using the surface electrocardiogram</measure>
    <time_frame>ten minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will be undertaking quantitative analysis of the changes in cardiac conduction observed in the presence of ajmaline. This is measured in time intervals in milliseconds (ms) and magnitude of electrical conduction which will be expressed in millivolts (mv), but can also be expressed in millimetres (mm). The investigators will use the latter to quantify area changes which will be expressed as millimetres squared (mm2). A quantitive description of the electrocardiographic patterns observed will also be performed in addition to further qualitative analysis of vectors created by the variety of ECG morphologies observed, this geometrical assessment will be measured in degrees. As this is a cohort of healthy volunteers the variations observed are anticipated to be part of the &quot;normal&quot; variation, therefore the statistical analysis of these findings will be as a cohort not individual.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The influence of normal variations in right ventricular outflow tract dimensions on the electrocardiographic response to ajmaline provocation in healthy subjects using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Using existing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging modality, cardiac dimensions will be measured in millimetres (mm). This includes wall thickness and internal cavity size. Additionally volumetric assessment for chamber size will be made using millilitres (ml), this allows for a 3 dimensional appreciation. Using contrast agents, an assessment of the composition of cardiac muscle can be made and can identify the presence or absence of &quot;myocardial fibrosis,&quot;as a binary outcome measure. Further methods will be used to quantify the degree of fibrosis if observed, this will be expressed as a percentage (%) area of fibrosis divided by total area of myocardium multiplied by 100. The location of this fibrosis within the heart will also be noted.</description>
