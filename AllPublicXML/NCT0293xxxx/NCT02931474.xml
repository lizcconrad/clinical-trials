      Background:

      People who have had a traumatic brain injury (TBI) often have trouble sleeping. TBI may also
      alter hormones, which can cause poor sleep. Researchers believe that a form of growth hormone
      releasing hormone (GHRH) might improve sleep in service members and veterans who have had a
      TBI.

      Objective:

      To see if GHRH can improve sleep in people who have had a TBI.

      Eligibility:

      Active duty service members or veterans (active duty in the past 10 years) ages 18-45 who
      have had a TBI in the past 6 months to 10 years.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Getting ACTH (a hormone) through an intravenous catheter (thin plastic tube)

      Interview about their mood and alcohol and drug use

      Questionnaires about their TBI, mood, and sleep

      Participants will have 2 overnight study visits a couple weeks apart. These will include:

      Physical exam

      Urine sample

      Two intravenous catheters placed. Blood samples will be taken throughout the night.

      Two shots under the skin of the belly. The shots will be GHRH on one visit and placebo on the
      other.

      Spending the night in the sleep lab. Their brain waves will be recorded with electrodes
      placed on the scalp.

      A questionnaire in the morning about their sleep

      Participants will be called a few days after each overnight visit. They will be asked about
      how they are feeling and to rate their sleep....

      Objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the hallmark injury of deployment in Iraq and
      Afghanistan. Up to one-third of service members who sustain a TBI are diagnosed with a sleep
      disorder; insomnia being one of the most common. Currently, over half of TBI-associated
      insomnia cases remain untreated due to poor efficacy of available pharmacologic agents.
      Neuroendocrine dysfunction is an important mechanism linking TBI and disordered sleep, thus
      pharmacological agents that address this dysfunction may be effective in treating TBI-related
      insomnia. The neuroendocrine system is essential for regulating sleep and circadian function.
      Decreased neuroendocrine function, including the hypothalamus and the somatotrophic cells of
      the anterior pituitary, which regulate growth hormone secretion, likely contributes to
      insomnia. This assertion is supported by previous studies that demonstrated the
      sleep-promoting effects of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) administration in healthy
      controls, the elderly, and participants with depression. Therefore, we propose that
      administration of GHRH will address the underlying mechanisms of insomnia in service members
      and veterans who sustained a TBI, and provide a pharmacological agent more robust than
      currently available treatments.

      Study population: This study will recruit 50 active duty service members and veterans with a
      documented TBI to participate in one of two study groups. The insomnia group (n=25) will
      include participants that have a current clinical diagnosis of insomnia without obstructive
      sleep apnea. The no-insomnia group (n=25) will include participants with no current clinical
      diagnosis of insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea. Withdrawals/dropouts will be replaced to
      obtain 20 participants per group who complete the study.

      Design: A double-blind, randomized, crossover design will be used to examine the impact of
      tesamorelin (GHRH (1-44) analog) or placebo on total non-rapid eye movement (NREM) time
      evaluated during two polysomnography visits, scheduled 1-3 weeks apart. Serial blood draws
      will be obtained during the polysomnography to examine endocrine function and neuropeptide
      release.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome is change in NREM time following tesamorelin
      administration compared to placebo. The secondary outcomes are (1) within and between group
      differences in plasma concentration levels of neuroendocrine proteins following tesamorelin
      administration compared to placebo and (2) within and between group differences in urinary
      concentration levels of growth hormone following tesamorelin administration compared to
      placebo.
