  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project completed an intervention designed to teach parents of children aged 0-2 years
      of age how to prevent injuries to their child. The intervention consisted of a two DVD
      package with information on creating a safe home environment and correctly choosing and
      installing an appropriate car safety seat. The study hypothesis was that parents who used the
      intervention would score significantly higher on measures of knowledge, motivation, intention
      and self-efficacy in implementing injury prevention strategies.

    <description>Keeping Baby Safe 2-DVD package, designed for parents of children from birth to 24 months. One DVD addresses automobile passenger safety and focuses on the correct choice and proper installation of child safety seat for the age of the parent's child. The second DVD covers a core set of home safety skills: (a) preventing falls, (b) preventing fires and burns, (c) preventing poisoning, (d) firearm safety, (e) preventing drowning, (f) preventing suffocation and choking, (e) play equipment safety, and (f) animal safety. Content in the home safety DVD is based on information the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that physicians provide to parents during well-baby visits.</description>
