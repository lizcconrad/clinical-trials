      The purpose of this study is to examine measurement of unilateral neglect post stroke.
      Although a number of clinical assessments are used to measure neglect, it is unclear whether
      items from some of the most commonly used assessments are able to effectively and
      comprehensively measure neglect. This study will determine whether these assessments measure
      different aspects of neglect and whether items from various neglect assessments can be
      combined to more effectively measure neglect.

      Many individuals have difficulty attending to the affected side of their body or to the
      affected side of space after stroke (unilateral neglect). Although a number of clinical
      assessments are used to measure this inattention, it is unclear whether items from some of
      the most commonly used assessments are able to effectively and comprehensively measure
      inattention. Clinical assessments provide critical information to clinicians and researchers
      and are used to inform treatment and document patient progress. Therefore, it is important
      that investigators more closely examine these existing assessments.

      Individuals who demonstrate impaired attention to the affected side after stroke also have
      greater motor impairment than individuals who do not have impaired attention, but
      investigators do not know how inattention affects reaching movements using the impaired arm.
      This study will examine various methods used to assess inattention to the affected side after
      stroke and also examine how inattention affects reaching movements of the impaired arm.
