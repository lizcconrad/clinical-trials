  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The First Long-Acting Injectable Regimen (FLAIR) study is being conducted to establish if
      human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infected adult participants whose virus is
      virologically suppressed on an integrase inhibitor single tablet regimen (INI STR) will
      remain suppressed after switching to a two-drug intramuscular (IM) long-acting (LA) regimen
      of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV). In this study, the INI STR will be limited to
      abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (ABC/DTG/3TC). FLAIR is a Phase 3, multi-phase, randomized,
      open label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority study in HIV-1,
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART)-naïve adult participants. This study is designed to demonstrate
      the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to a two drug CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg
      regimen every 4 weeks (Q4W: monthly) compared to remaining on ABC/DTG/3TC over 48 weeks (4
      weeks oral CAB + RPV, 44 weeks LA therapy). Participants who are HLA-B*5701 positive at
      Screening may enroll into the study and receive DTG plus a non-abacavir containing dual
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimen. Eligible particpants will enroll
      into the Induction Phase of the study and receive ABC/DTG/3TC for 20 weeks (Week [-20] to Day
      1). Participants who have an HIV 1 ribose nucleic acid (RNA) &lt;50 copies per milliliter (c/mL)
      at Week (-4) will be randomized (1:1) into the Maintenance Phase at Day 1 to either continue
      ABC/DTG/3TC or to discontinue ABC/DTG/3TC and begin oral therapy with CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg
      once daily for approximately 4 Weeks, followed by monthly CAB LA + RPV LA injections from
      visit Week 4b until study completion or withdrawal. At the end of the Maintenance phase,
      eligible participants who were randomized to continue ABC/DTG/3TC will be given an option to
      switch to LA therapy at Week 100. Those participants (HIV 1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL at Week 96) will
      transition to LA dosing, beginning with approximately 4 weeks oral CAB + RPV therapy at Week
      100, and receive the first IM CAB LA + RPV LA injections at Week 104b. Participants will
      continue to receive injections every 4 weeks during the Extension Phase until CAB LA and RPV
      LA are either locally approved and commercially available, the participant no longer derives
      clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation, or
      until development of either CAB LA or RPV LA is terminated.

             and for at least 30 days after discontinuation of all oral study medications and for
             at least 52 weeks after discontinuation of CAB LA and RPV LA. The investigator is
             responsible for ensuring that participants understand how to properly use these
             methods of contraception. All participants in the study should be counseled on safer
             sexual practices including the use and benefit/risk of effective barrier methods
             (e.g., male condom) and on the risk of HIV transmission to an uninfected partner.

          -  Any pre-existing physical or mental condition (including substance abuse disorder)
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the participant's
             ability to comply with the dosing schedule and/or protocol evaluations or which may
             compromise the safety of the participant.

          -  Participants determined by the Investigator to have a high risk of seizures, including
             participants with an unstable or poorly controlled seizure disorder. A participant
             with a prior history of seizure may be considered for enrolment if the Investigator
             believes the risk of seizure recurrence is low. All cases of prior seizure history
             should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrolment.

             as follows: Participants positive for HBsAg are excluded; Participants negative for
             anti-HBs but positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for HBV DNA
             are excluded. Note: Participants positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and
             positive for anti-HBs (past and/or current evidence) are immune to HBV and are not
             excluded.

          -  Asymptomatic individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection will not be
             excluded, however Investigators must carefully assess if therapy specific for HCV
             infection is required; participants who are anticipated to require HCV treatment prior
             to Week 48 of the Maintenance Phase must be excluded. HCV treatment on study may be
             permitted post Week 48, following consultation with the Medical Monitor. Participants
             with HCV co-infection will be allowed entry into Phase 3 studies if: Liver enzymes
             meet entry criteria; HCV Disease has undergone appropriate work-up, HCV is not
             advanced, and will not require treatment prior to the Week 48 visit. Additional
             information (where available) on participants with HCV co-infection at screening
             should include results from any liver biopsy, fibroscan, ultrasound, or other fibrosis
             evaluation, history of cirrhosis or other decompensated liver disease, prior
             treatment, and timing/plan for HCV treatment. In the event that recent biopsy or
             imaging data is not available or is inconclusive, the Fib-4 score will be used to
             verify eligibility. A Fib-4 score &gt; 3.25 is exclusionary; Fib-4 scores 1.45 - 3.25
             requires Medical Monitor consultation. Fibrosis 4 Score Formula: (Age x
             AST)/(Platelets x [square root of ALT]).

             resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical, anal or penile
             intraepithelial neoplasia; other localized malignancies require agreement between the
             investigator and the study Medical Monitor for inclusion of the participant prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the
