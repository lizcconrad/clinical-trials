    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to assess the effect of school-based Human Papillomavirus
      (HPV) vaccination by comparing type-specific HPV prevalence between vaccinated and
      non-vaccinated women born in 1997. Women born in 1997, residence to Norway in 2009 (the year
      of vaccine initiation of the 1997-cohort) are invited to participate in the study.

      This cohort is amongst the first that was offered HPV vaccine in an organized vaccination
      programme globally. The women will be recruited through Facebook ads. The study will enable
      us to measure differences in the prevalence of HPV types in vagina and the mouth between
      vaccinated and non-vaccinated young women in Norway.

      The womens vaccination status will be validated by linkage to the Norwegian Immunisation
      Registry (SYSVAK) and their residence status will be validated through linkage to the
      Norwegian Population Registry.
