  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to study the role of the gut microbiome in the development of obesity, and whether
      we can change the microbiome's contribution to host energy balance through diet. We have
      created a novel model that explicitly links the effects of microorganisms on human energy
      balance and modeled weight change, and will use the power of metabolic ward studies to
      measure small changes in energy absorption, total daily energy expenditure, and/or food
      intake that affect long-term weight gain or loss. By integrating clinical measurements,
      bioreactor experiments, and mathematical modeling, we will be able to describe
      cause-and-effect mechanisms that will enable a quantification of the microbiota's
      contribution to weight gain and inspire future studies on the interactions of diet, the gut
      microbiome, and human physiology.
