      The investigators research aim to explores the optimal comprehensive treatment for TNBC and
      her2 positive breast cancer by comparing the efficacy of neoadjuvant with that of adjuvant
      treatment in improvement of RFS.

      Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NCT) is a standard treatment of patients who hope breast-conserving
      therapy (BCT) with locally advanced inoperable breast cancer or large tumor size. it is
      beneficial to degrading the tumor stage, increasing the rate of surgical resection or the
      BCT.People who are pathological complete response (pCR) after NCT have an improvement in
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), as well as better prognosis.
      Currently, breast cancer are entering into the era of molecular classification. Different
      molecular subtype of breast cancer showed a significant difference in prognosis; triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) and Her2 positive breast cancer are clinically relevant terms
      referring to a specific subtype of breast cancer with high malignant characteristics, early
      recurrence and metastasis, but sensitive to primary chemotherapy, proportion of which are 15%
      and 20% respectively. A meta analysis shows that TNBC and her2 positive breast cancer have a
      higher pCR than Luminal A/B, and the increasing in pCR rate means improvement in survival.

      The investigators previous study indicates that paclitaxel plus carboplatin with or without
      trastuzumab can improve pCR and prolong RFS in TNBC and her2 positive breast cancer Comparing
      to adjuvant chemotherapy.

      The investigators research aim to explores the optimal comprehensive treatment for TNBC and
      her2 positive breast cancer by comparing the efficacy of neoadjuvant with that of adjuvant
      treatment in improvement of RFS.
