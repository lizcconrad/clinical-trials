  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated any potential associations between two preloads offered as snacks and
      postprandial glycemic response, subjective and objective appetite and energy intake in
      healthy, normal-weight adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed at 1. firstly determine the glycemic index (GI) of a carob snack compared
      with an isoenergetic, equal weight chocolate cookie and 2. test the hypothesis that a carob
      preload consumed as snack before a meal, compared to chocolate cookie would: (a) have greater
      short-term effect on satiety measured by subsequent ad libitum meal intake, (b) induce
      greater satiety as assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS), and (c) reduce postprandial
      glycemic response.

    <description>Ten healthy, normal-weight subjects (male: 6, female: 4) after 10-14 hr fast, consumed 25g available carbohydrate from white bread and glucose, two times, in different weeks as reference foods along with 250ml water; and 25g available carbohydrates from carob snack and chocolate cookie, one time, in different weeks along with 250ml water. Fingertip capillary blood glucose samples were taken at baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min. The first glucose sample was taken exactly 15min after the first bite of food or drink.</description>

    <description>Fifty healthy subjects (male: 22, female: 28) were offered a standardized breakfast and 2h after consumed one of the two preloads (carob snack and chocolate cookie) served as snack in random order. Three hours after, subjects were given ad libitum access to a meal (lunch and dessert). Foods were weighed at the time of serving and any leftovers were weighed again after meal to determine the amount of food consumed. Fingertip capillary blood glucose samples were collected before and after foods. Subjective appetite ratings were collected using 100mm visual analogue scales (VAS).</description>
