    <textblock>
      This study is intended to measure hepatocyte growth factor levels in smokers and non smokers
      with periodontitis before and after non surgical periodontal therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was randomised prospective,interventional clinical trial. The sample size for the
      study was 40 individuals aged between 20 to 60 years,equally divided into two groups.

      Group l - smokers with chronic periodontitis (test) group. Group ll - non smokers with
      chronic periodontitis (controls)

      At baseline both the groups were analysed for clinical and biochemical parameters and
      underwent non surgical periodontal therapy( scaling and root planning). All parameters were
      reassesed after 3 months.

      A total of 40 patients( 20 somkers and 20 non smokers) from the outpatient wing of department
      of periodontics, Panineeya mahavidyalaya institute of dental sciences and research centre
      diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and willing to participate in the study.

      Clicical parameters included gingival index and periodontal index. Biochmeical parameters
      included plasma hepatocyte growth factor.

    <description>The change in plasma hepatocyte growth factor level was measured at baseline and at the end of 3 months after scaling and root planing.2 ml blood was drawn from the patient to assess the hepatocyte growth factor levels.biochemical analysis was done by ELISA test i.e., blood samples from both smokers and non smokers with chronic periodontitis were taken at baseline and at the end of 3 monthd</description>
