  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study with the primary objectives to 1) establish that PET/CT of the
      lung can reliably distinguish healthy, non-asthmatic volunteers from patients with asthma and
      an eosinophilic phenotype and 2) to examine the utility of PET/CT for demonstrating that
      reslizumab produces a reduction in lung inflammation in patients with severe asthma and an
      eosinophilic phenotype .

        Inclusion Criteria:

             negative pregnancy test at screening

          -  Females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or 2 years postmenopausal),
             have to use a medically accepted method of contraception and have to agree to continue
             to use of this method for the duration of the study and for 5 months after study drug
             administration.

          -  Subjects and patients with less that 10-pack year history of smoking.

          -  Have a previous diagnosis of asthma.

          -  Patients taking inhaled fluticasone at a dosage of at least 440 mcg daily, or
             equivalent.

          -  The patient's baseline asthma therapy must be stable for 30 days prior to screening
             and judged by their treating physician to be able to continue without dosage changes
             throughout the study.

          -  Patients with a blood eosinophil level of at least 300 cells/μL at screening or a

             included as potential subjects when:

               1. The mepolizumab or benralizumab therapy has been discontinued.

               2. The patient's blood eosinophil level meets inclusion criteria.

             active asthma.

          -  Patients with a history of concurrent immunodeficiency (human immunodeficiency virus
             or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or congenital immunodeficiency).

          -  Patients that had an active parasitic infection within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Patients with any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion (including gastrointestinal surgery).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to study drug or to FDG/contrast agents

          -  Treatment with metformin.

          -  Compromised renal function
