  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, ketogenic diet has been recognized a useful treatment strategy for glioblastoma in
      vitro.

      Therefore, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ketogenic
      adjuvant to salvage chemotherapy for recurrent glioblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diet change by limiting carbohydrates and increasing the proportion of fatty acids and
      proteins can lead to ketogenic metabolism and might limit energy production in tumor cells
      and inhibit tumor growth.

      In a pilot of recurrent glioblastoma, ketogenic diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given
      as interventional group and standard diet adjuvant salvage chemotherapy was given as control
      group.

      The study examines whether a ketogenic diet adjunctive to salvage chemotherapy can be applied
      to the patients and may inhibit tumor growth and influence the quality of life of the
      patients.
