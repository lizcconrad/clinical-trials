  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory muscle weakness and fatigue are related to clinical deterioration in patients
      with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Respiratory muscle training (RMT) is a key
      therapeutic strategy in these patients. It is necessary therefore to increase its
      dissemination on a large scale, improve patient´s adherence and optimize the control of the
      implementation of training. The aim of this project was to design a RMT device including
      light and sound incentives, digital registration application and analysis of the training
      sessions, and studying the effectiveness of a new shortened RMT scheme of high intensity that
      could provide added value to enhance the implementation of training in patients with COPD.
      From an operational point of view, researches were organized into three packages of
      complementary work focused on the design of a new portable dual valve with electronic
      lighting and auditory incentives components. The conceptualization and design of a software
      to analyze the performance and individual continuous use of the valve, and the evaluation of
      the feasibility, safety and efficacy of a shortened schedule of respiratory muscle training
      in adult patients with COPD were realized.

    <description>Defined as the ability to make a maximum respiratory effort, it was assessed using the MicroRPM® device. This test is to generate the maximum inspiratory pressure (from residual volume) and expiratory (from total lung capacity) against a road or occluded team, performing the maneuver by keeping the mouth and nose occluded.</description>

    <description>Respiratory muscle training: Inspiratory and expiratory General High Intensity Training (30 minutes in cycle ergometer) and inspiratory and expiratory training: The inspiratory and expiratory training was conducted with the Orygen® valve. Loading inspiratory and expiratory training was defined as maximum and patient tolerance. This was the optimal load that would allow the patient to perform 10 consecutive inspirations (5 sessions) 2 times a day,during 3 weeks.</description>

    <description>General high-intensity training consists in maximum effort intervals of 30 seconds duration against an equivalent resistance 0.075 kg / kg of body mass followed by a recovery period of 4 minutes cycle ergometer; the total duration was 3 weeks. They were made in this regard, five weekly sessions of 30 minutes per session, Additionally, randomly, the patients were divided into one of 3 possible groups of respiratory training, which consisted of 5 sets of 10 full breaths (inspiration and expiration) in the morning and afternoon during 3 weeks.</description>
