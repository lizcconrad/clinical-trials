      Background:

      The immune system is the cells and organs in the body that recognize and fight infection and
      cancer. The PROSTVAC vaccine might teach the immune system to find and kill certain prostate
      cancer cells. Nivolumab is a drug that allows the immune system to fight tumors. Itmight help
      PROSTVAC work better.

      Objective:

      To test the safety and effectiveness of the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab. To test
      this for people with castration resistant prostate cancer and then for other people with
      localized prostate cancer who are candidates for surgical removal of the prostate.

      Eligibility:

      Men ages 18 and older with prostate cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Electrocardiogram

      Bone scan

      CT scan or MRI

      Tumor sample. This may be from a previous procedure.

      All participants will get a combination of the study drugs over 8 weeks. They will have 1
      visit for the initial injection then 3 booster injection / nivolumab infusion visits. Blood
      will be tested at these visits.

      Over the next 4 weeks, some participants will have:

      An exam of the large intestine through the rectum.

      CT and bone scans

      Standard hormonal treatment

      Option to continue treatment every 3 weeks if their disease does not get worse. They will be

      have scans every 12 weeks.

      Other participants will have surgery to remove the prostate in week 9.

      Participants will have a safety visit about a month after their last treatment. This will
      include a physical exam, blood tests, and possibly scans.

      If their cancer progresses, participants will leave the study and may enroll in a long-term
      follow-up study. They will be contacted once a year to ask about their cancer and treatment.

      Background:

        -  Immune checkpoint inhibitors interfere with the immune system s autoregulatory
           mechanisms, allowing for a potentially expanded and prolonged T-cell response with the
           possibility of greater antitumor effects.

        -  Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 protein.
           Specifically, the antibody binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with
           PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune
           response, including anti-tumor immune response.

        -  PROSTVAC (developed by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] and licensed to Bavarian
           Nordic Immunotherapeutics, Mountain View, CA) is a therapeutic cancer vaccine for
           prostate cancer. Early studies have demonstrated immunologic efficacy and suggested
           clinical benefit. A phase III trial has completed accrual.

        -  A previous study combining the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab and PROSTVAC
           suggested greater efficacy than PROSTVAC alone. Additional studies have demonstrated the
           potential efficacy of immunologic combination therapy with the immune checkpoint
           inhibitor nivolumab.

        -  This study will aim to evaluate the impact of the combination of PROSTVAC and the immune
           checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab on the tumor microenvironment focusing on immune cell
           infiltration as the primary endpoint.

        -  US-MRI imaging technology will be employed to sample the tumor before treatment and
           after radical prostatectomy.

        -  The findings from this study could serve as the basis for future studies with this
           combination in this population of patients and more advanced disease.

      Objectives:

        -  Safety (For castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) lead-in cohort)

        -  Evaluate changes in T-cell infiltration in the tumor after neoadjuvant treatment with
           PROSTVAC and nivolumab, relative to changes seen in a phase 2 trial with PROSTVAC alone
           in the neoadjuvant setting- NCT02153918 (For the neoadjuvant cohort).

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have histopathological documentation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate
           prior to starting this study and evaluable biopsy tissue (e.g., unstained slides or
           blocks) available for analysis.

        -  For the castration resistant lead in cohort, if histopathological documentation is
           unavailable, a rising PSA and a clinical course consistent with prostate cancer would be
           acceptable.

        -  Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 1 according to the ECOG criteria.

        -  Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):

             -  Granulocyte count 1,500/mm^3

             -  Platelet count 100,000/mm^3

             -  Hgb greater than or equal to 8 g/dL

        -  Biochemical eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):

             -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl (OR in patients with Gilbert's syndrome,
                total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL), AST and ALT less than or equal to
                2.5 times upper limit of normal.

             -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN

      Design:

        -  The primary focus of this study will be to evaluate PROSTVAC and nivolumab in the
           neoadjuvant setting.

        -  Lead-in cohort evaluating the safety and tolerability of this combination in the
           castration resistant setting (CRPC cohort)

        -  Following this lead-in cohort in the CRPC setting, we will enroll a cohort in the
           neoadjuvant setting evaluating the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab.

        -  The lead-in safety cohort will require 10 patients and the neoadjuvant cohort will
           require 17 evaluable patients. In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable
           patients, the accrual ceiling will be set to 29 patients.
