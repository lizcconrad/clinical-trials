  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our participants will include 40 patients within one month of stroke, 40 patients who
      received total hip replacement or total knee replacement two to four weeks before. The
      participants will be randomly assigned to the isokinetic training group or the isotonic
      training group. Outcome measures including isometric peak torque of hip/knee at 90 degree of
      flexion, peak torque of hip/knee at angular velocity of 60 degree/s and 120 degree/s, Short
      Form 36 (SF-36), the Timed Up and Go test, the Oxford Hip/knee Score, the plasma
      concentration of hsCRP, and the level of substance P in saliva will be collected at the
      beginning and 4 weeks after the training program. Statistical significant differences will be
      determined between the improvement of outcome measures of the isokinetic and the isotonic
      training groups.

    <description>Isokinetic strengthening exercise provides muscle training throughout the range of motion of a joint at a pre-set constant speed of angular velocity. It can be performed in an eccentric or concentric way in a controlled manner, and is evidenced to be an effective and safe training method in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, burn injury, ankle instability, osteoarthritic knee, and chronic stroke in the past literatures.</description>

    <intervention_name>Isotonic strengthening exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>Isotonic strengthening exercise keeps the tension remained unchanged during the muscle's length changing. As the muscle's force changes via the length-tension relationship during a contraction, an isotonic contraction will keep force constant while velocity changes. There are two types of isotonic contractions: (1) concentric and (2) eccentric. In a concentric contraction, the muscle tension rises to meet the resistance, then remains the same as the muscle shortens. In eccentric, the muscle lengthens due to the resistance being greater than the force the muscle is producing.</description>
