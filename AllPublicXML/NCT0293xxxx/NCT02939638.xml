  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled trial aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which a plant-based
      dietary intervention causes weight loss. Using a low-fat, plant-based diet for 16 weeks,
      along with an untreated control for comparison, the study will measure changes in insulin
      sensitivity, beta-cell function, postprandial metabolism, and intracellular lipid, and assess
      their associations with changes in body weight.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 16-week trial, overweight adults will be randomly assigned to two groups. Changes in
      beta-cell function will be the primary outcome. Changes in insulin sensitivity will be the
      secondary outcome. Changes in postprandial metabolism, and body weight will be the tertiary
      outcomes.

      The Diet Group will be asked to follow a low-fat, vegan diet and will receive weekly classes
      and support.

      The Control Group will be asked to follow a conventional control diet..

      This study conducts a pilot substudy to test the hypothesis that changes in insulin
      sensitivity and beta-cell function observed in response to a diet intervention correlate with
      changes in intramyocellular and/or intrahepatocellular lipid. Another sub-study assesses the
      association between metabolic outcomes and gut microbiome. One additional sub-study is
      looking for associations between metabolic outcomes and endothelial function.

    <measure>Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) and postprandial metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to report to the laboratory within 60 minutes of waking and after a 12-hour fast. Following 30 minutes of quiet rest in a dimly lit room, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be measured. REE will be measured for 20 minutes through indirect calorimetry (Cosmed Quark RMR, Chicago, IL) utilizing a ventilated hood system. The laboratory temperature will be maintained at 23 degrees C throughout, and precautions will be taken to minimize any disturbances that could affect the metabolic rate.
For premenopausal women, measures will be timed so as to occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Postprandial metabolism will be measured for three hours after the standard meal.</description>
