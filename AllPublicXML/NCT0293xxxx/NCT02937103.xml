      The overall purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic effect of CD123-targeted
      chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of Myeloid Malignancies.

    <textblock>
      Great progress has been made in the treatment of relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies
      with CD19-targeted CAR-T cells. However, for myeloid malignancies, which has higher
      morbidity, trials of CAR-T is few. CD123 is expressed on most myeloid leukemia cells so it is
      a ideal target for CAR-T. Some researches have revealed that CD123 is a marker of leukemia
      stem cells, which indicates that the eradication of CD123+ cells may prevent relapse of
      leukemia. This trial is designed and conducted to test the safety and effectiveness of
      CD123-targeted CAR-T.

If the 3 patients don't display severe toxicity,the next patients enrolled will get infused in 2 days with respective 40% and 60% total dosage.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. CD123-expressing myeloid malignancy must be assured and must be relapsed or refractory
             disease. According to current traditional therapies, there must be no available
             alternative curative therapies and subjects must be either ineligible for allogeneic
             stem cell transplant (SCT), have refused SCT, or have disease activity that prohibits
             SCT at this time.

          2. Patients enrolled must have an evaluated score above 60 with KPS.

          3. CD123 expression of the malignant cells must be detected by immunohistochemistry or by
             flow cytometry.

          4. Gender is not limited, age from 14 years to 75 years.

          5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which
             may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by
             flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.

          6. Patients are expected to survive for more than 3 months by their physicians at the
             time of enrollment.

          7. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated need to be assured for obtaining target cell
             dose based on dosage cohorts.

          8. Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of neurologic
             symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial nerve palsy:

             CNS 1, defined as absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin
             preparation, regardless of the number of WBCs; CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/uL
             WBCs in CSF and cytospin positive for blasts, or &gt; 5/uL WBCs but negative by
             Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3 with marrow disease who has failed salvage systemic
