      This is a substudy to a randomised trial investigating the effect of liraglutide on body
      weight and pain in overweight or obese patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) (NCT02905864).
      In the parent trial, patients will be subjected to an 8-week diet intervention phase
      including a low-calorie diet and dietetic counseling, after which patients will be randomised
      to receive either liraglutide 3 mg or liraglutide 3 mg placebo as an add-on to dietetic
      guidance on re-introducing regular foods and a focus on continued motivation to engage in a
      healthy lifestyle.

      This substudy aims to investigate the impact of, and subsequent change of, joint inflammation
      and clinical symptoms, in obese patients with knee osteoarthritis following a randomisation
      to Liraglutide 3 mg or Liraglutide 3 mg placebo treatment between weeks 0-52.
