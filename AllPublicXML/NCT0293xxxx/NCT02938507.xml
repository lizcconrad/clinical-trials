      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      different formulations of orally administered solabegron in healthy male subjects. Eligible
      male subjects will be enrolled into 2 cohorts of 12 subjects each conducted in parallel. The
      study is a single blind (subjects), randomized, cross-over design in 3 study periods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg, inclusive, and body mass index (BMI) 18.0
             - 32.0 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  In good general health as determined by a thorough medical history and physical
             examination, ECG, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluation. Results of clinical
             laboratory tests must be without clinically significant abnormalities, including
             hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis.

          -  Adequate venous access to allow for repeated blood sampling

          -  Ability to understand and comply with the study requirements

          -  Provide written informed consent prior to any study procedure being performed (all
             subjects should be able to understand the informed consent form and any other
             documents that subjects are required to read).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening physical examination,
             clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, or any other medical condition or circumstance
             which would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the study based on the
             Investigator's assessment

          -  Resting heart rate greater than or equal to 100 beats per minute (BPM) after 5 minutes
             rest (as above) at the screening visit

          -  QTcF interval (Fredericia's correction factor) greater than 450 msec (males subjects)
             at screening

          -  History of drug or other allergy, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             contraindicates their participation

          -  History of smoking, including e-cigarettes, within 3 months of the study and/or a
             positive urine cotinine at screening

          -  Regular alcohol consumption averaging â‰¥ 14 drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces of
             wine or 12 ounces of beer or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor) within 6 months of the first
             dose of study medication.

          -  Positive urine drug or alcohol test at screening

          -  Any other condition and/or situation that causes the Investigator to deem a subject
             unsuitable for the study (e.g., due to expected study medication non-compliance,
             inability to medically tolerate the study procedures, or a subject's unwillingness to
             comply with study-related procedures)
