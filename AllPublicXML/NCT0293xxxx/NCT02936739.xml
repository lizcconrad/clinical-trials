  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated study. The primary goal is to evaluate the efficacy of two
      different cervical disc prosthetic devices with respect to postoperative change in neck
      disability index. The evaluation will include clinical and radiological parameters.
