  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to investigate whether a standard rTMS protocol for depression,
      including multiple sessions applied to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) results in
      reduction of depressive symptoms for adult patients with ASD and MDD (Aim 1). The secondary
      goal is to investigate and whether there is any beneficial reduction in the core symptoms of
      autism (Aim 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim 1. Determine the safety and therapeutic efficacy of left-sided DLPFC high frequency rTMS
      on MDD symptoms in patients with ASD: The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving
      the rTMS will tolerate the treatment course without difficulty and have clinically
      significant reduction of depressive symptoms after receiving all 25 sessions, as compared
      with their symptom burden prior to initiating TMS. Depression symptom data will be collected
      as pre- and post-TMS scores on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Depression scores
      will also be monitored periodically during course of TMS with Patient Health Questionnaires
      (PHQ-9).

      Exploratory sub-aim - Monitoring for durability of response: The investigators hypothesize
      that subjects receiving rTMS will demonstrate durability of response in their depression
      symptom reduction, as measured by HAM-D scores at 1 month and 3 months post-TMS.

      Aim 2. Determine the effect of left DLPFC rTMS on core symptoms of ASD: The investigators
      hypothesize that subjects will experience reduction in core symptoms of ASD after completing
      all 25 sessions, as compared with their symptom burden prior to initiating treatment. For
      social and communication deficits, informant and/or self-report evaluations will be made pre-
      and post-TMS with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), the Ritvo Autism Aspergers
      Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R) and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). Repetitive and
      restricted behavior will be evaluated using the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R),
      the ABC, and RAADS.

      Exploratory sub-aim: Determine if there are changes to functional brain connectivity during
      face and object processing tasks via functional MRI imaging in patients with Autism who
      receive rTMS: The study investigators hypothesize that there will be altered brain
      connectivity evident in patients' baseline fMRI during cognitive processing tasks prior to
      TMS reflected as both hyper- and hypo-connectivity, and that there will be some level of
      normalization of these patterns in fMRI after completion of TMS series, particularly in the
      prefrontal cortex.

      Exploratory sub-aim - Monitoring for durability of response: The study investigators
      hypothesize that subjects receiving rTMS will exhibit durability of response in their ASD
      symptom reduction, as measured by ABC, SRS, RAADS, AND RBR scores at 1 month and 3 months
      post-TMS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and active depressive symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  List specific contraindicationsUncontrolled and/or untreated seizure disorder as
             defined by any incidence of seizure within the past 6 months. Patients with diagnosed
             epilepsy, or prior seizures, will be allowed in the study if they are taking an
             anticonvulsant medication, or have not had a seizure in the past year off medications.

          -  Moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) as defined by IQ &lt; 60, determined by
             prior IQ testing or Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASC-II) if no prior
             test results available

          -  Other psychiatric or neurodevelopmental illness that is the primary area of clinical
             focus (including but not limited to primary psychotic disorder, substance abuse
             disorder, and ASD or ID which are secondary to genetic syndromes)

          -  Active suicidal ideation or suicide attempt in the 90 days prior to initial assessment

          -  Presence of any metal implants or devices in the head or neck (e.g. metal plates or
             screws)

          -  No participants who are pregnant or who are planning to become pregnant

          -  Exclusion criteria for fMRI scanning:

               -  have metal pins, plates or clips in the body or have orthodontics

               -  have surgical implants such as pacemakers or cochlear implants

               -  have permanent makeup or tattoos near the face or head

               -  have metal fragments in the body (from welding, shrapnel, BB guns) or suspect
                  that they have fragments

               -  are claustrophobic

               -  are pregnant

               -  have ever suffered a closed head injury or concussion

               -  are currently under the influence of alcohol or other recreational drugs

               -  are a smoker

               -  are currently enrolled in a course in which the PI or co-I's are instructors

               -  cannot understand the task instructions

               -  cannot lay still in the mock scanner for a period of 6 minutes

          -  Inability or unwillingness of participant or legal guardian/representative to give
             informed consent

          -  There will be no discrimination or exclusions based on race, gender, sexual
             orientation, or other socioeconomic factors. Of note, while both male and female
             participants will be actively and equally recruited using the same methods. The
             natural distribution of autism in the population skews towards significant towards
             male gender, with male prevalence being 4-5 times that of female prevalence. Our study
             will therefore likely have more male participants than female due to this trend in
             prevalence.

          -  Children (age &lt;18) are being excluded from this study for several reasons. While
             autism is a pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder with symptom onset as young as one
             year of age, it is also one that is chronic throughout adulthood. Both children with
             autism and neurotypical children undergo periods of rapid change in brain size,
             structure, and organization as they age, and the interaction between a full rTMS
             series and brains that are still involved in periods of very active development and
             whom may also be at different points along their own developmental timelines may skew
             or alter the data that is collected. Additionally, due to both brain growth and
             increases in skull thickness, children of different ages may have significantly
             different &quot;scalp to cortex&quot; distances, which can result in very different patterns of
             cortical stimulation despite uniform coil positioning. This will be an added,
             unnecessary variable which would compromise the attempt at performing a standardized
             protocol. Finally, while high frequency rTMS is an FDA approved treatment for
             depression in adults, it has not yet been FDA approved in children and adolescents.
