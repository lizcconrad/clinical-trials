  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to offer a non-drug intervention for caregivers in nursing home to respond promptly
      to a behavioral crisis with an appropriate response to each patient, a chariot has been
      developed by the Institute of Ageing Well Korian (Institut du Bien Vieillir Korian) to bring
      together eleven mediation activities. These activities lasting about 15 minutes are based on
      emotion (reminiscent, games) and sensory interventions (music, massage, touch) to
      decentralize patient stimulus that disturbs and focus on a subject not disruptive. This
      emergency intervention should provide a reduction in Behavioral and Psychological Symptom of
      Dementia (BPSD) of nursing home patients. The main objective is to measure its immediate
      effect on productive symptoms (agitation, aberrant motor behavior and disinhibition). The
      secondary objectives are to measure its immediate impact on the well-being and psychotropic
      treatments, and measure its effect after two months and after four months on all BPSD with a
      focus on agitation, the administration of psychotropic drugs, the hospitalizations and the
      number of falls.

    <measure>Change in number of disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>until 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>the number of disorders are evaluated with Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) before and 30 minutes after each intervention.
The original version of the CMAI is initially planned to study the frequency of these disorders. However, the goal being to study the decrease in productive symptoms, after using the &quot;chariot-flash&quot;, only the number of this item will be considered (between 0 and 29). For example in this modified version, for the item &quot;pace, aimless wandering&quot; nursing team can answer &quot;present&quot; or &quot;absent&quot; instead of (never, less than once a week, once or twice per week, a few times over week, one to two times daily, several times a day, several times per hour)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score of well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>until 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>the score of well-being is assessed using the Instant Well-Being scale (Evaluation Instantané du Bien-Etre : EVIBE) before and 30 minutes after each intervention .
The EVIBE is a visual analogue scale for reporting the status of well-being of the patient at a specific time. On a graduated scale from 0 to 5, the caregiver should position a cursor position to the left corresponding to the feeling of well-being the lowest and the right position to the feeling of well-being the highest.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in psychotropic drugs prescribed</measure>

    <description>The caregiver or doctor will check on a board what are the treatments that have been added or modified (compared to the usual treatment) in response to behavioral disorder</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in score of BPSD</measure>
    <time_frame>before the beginning of the study, at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>the score of BPSD is assessed using the neuropsychiatric inventory nursing home version (NPI-NH).
Each of the 12 BPSD (delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, excitement, apathy, disinhibition, depression, motor aberrant behavior, sleep and appetite) is evaluated on 12 depending on its frequency and severity (global score =144).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change in level of agitation</measure>
    <time_frame>before the beginning of the study, at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>the level of agitation is assessed using the original version of CMAI. The CMAI lists 29 agitation and aggressive behaviors by frequency (0: not evaluable 1: never, 2: less than once a week 3 : once or twice per week, 4 : a few times over week, 5: one to two times daily, 6 : several times a day, 7 : several times per hour) to obtain a score ranging from 0-203.</description>

    <description>200 patient , in 15 nursing homes randomly will be exposed two months in the control condition (usual intervention) and 4 months in the experimental condition (chariot-flash intervention). The experimental condition is to propose the &quot;chariot-flash&quot; in emergency during the emergence or increase of productive symptoms.</description>

The &quot;chariot-flash&quot; condition is a chariot with eleven drawers. Each drawer contains an activity (lasting about 15 minutes):
