      This study compares the comparing the validity and usability of smartphone software for home
      monitoring of symptoms and signs in Parkinson's disease as compared to the current clinical
      gold standard - the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition, which when treated can result in
      fluctuating motor activity - sometimes too much movement, sometimes too little.

      A series of tests, run on a smartphone, will be used to evaluate the motor signs of
      Parkinson's and related to a clinical evaluation based on the Unified Parkinson's DIseae
      Rating Scale. 60 participants will be recruited - data from 30 participants will be used to
      'train' the smartphone, whilst data from the other 30 will be used to test how good the
      software is.

      A second phase of the study will ask patients to subjectively diary their symptoms, comparing
      a smartphone-based method with reminders, to a standard paper-based method.

          5. They must have been on the current Parkinson's Disease medication schedule for at
             least a week and have no plans to change this during the period of testing.

          6. They must have the capacity to consent to take part in the study.

          7. They must be able to tolerate overnight withdrawal of their medications.

          8. They must be able to understand English to the level of being able to operate the
             phone software, follow its instructions and be able to answer the study questions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute medical illness.

          2. Any other co-morbidity that in the opinion of the Investigator may preclude their
