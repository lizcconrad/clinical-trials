  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Present clinical study will be conducted in China to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single
      and repeat oral doses of trametinib, the safety profile and the clinical activity in Chinese
      subjects with solid tumor. Approximately 10 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the study,
      Subjects will receive trametinib 2 mg once daily (QD). Study treatment will continue until
      disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. The study will be completed after all
      subjects have discontinued from study treatment or last enrolled subject has had at least 16
      weeks of follow-up, whichever occurs first.
