  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major abdominal surgeries are associated with severe abdominal pain, which can affect
      respiratory and cardiac functions, if insufficiently managed. This increases the incidence of
      post-operative morbidity.

      The objective of this study was to detect the efficacy and safety of magnesium sulphate as an
      adjuvant to the analgesia offered by local anesthetic in ultrasound guided TAP block in
      patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy.
