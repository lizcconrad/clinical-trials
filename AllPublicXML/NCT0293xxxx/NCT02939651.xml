      The purpose of this research study is to test if pembrolizumab is safe and effective for
      treating patients with metastatic high-grade neuroendocrine tumors who have failed platinum
      based chemotherapy.The study drug, pembrolizumab has been FDA approved for treating a type of
      skin cancer called melanoma and for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, it is not
      approved for treatment of metastatic high-grade neuroendocrine tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic, high grade
             NET (Ki67 &gt;20%), excluding any high grade NETs of large or small cell type of
             lung/thymus origin and merkel cell carcinoma

          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension in accordance with RECIST criteria v.
             1.1 as described in detail in section 12.0

          3. Has received prior therapy with at least 1 platinum-containing regimen

          4. Age &gt; 18 years.

          5. ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function

          7. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy
             within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication). They should
             also be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain
             from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last
             dose of study medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual
             lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.

          8. Male participants must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
             contraception for the subject.

          9. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA
             consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.
             Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are
             stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to
             the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to
             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          2. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          3. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form
             of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

          4. Prior anti-cancer therapy with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to
             study Day 1 or not recovered from adverse events (improved to grade 1 or less) due to
             mAbs administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          5. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2
             weeks (12 weeks for measurable sites of CNS disease) prior to study Day 1 or not
             recovered from adverse events (improved to grade 1 or less) due to a previously
             administered agent. Note: Subjects with neuropathy or â‰¤ Grade 2 alopecia are an
             exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received
             major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or
             complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

          6. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment except
             superficial malignancies of the skin and in situ cervical cancer

             years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         11. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients

         14. Prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed cell death
             1 ligand (PDL-1), anti-PD-L2, or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory
             T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137)

             [qualitative]).

         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

         18. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
