  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study protocol is to conduct a confirmatory efficacy trial to test whether
      the Memory Support Intervention improves illness course and functional outcomes in major
      depressive disorder (MDD) and cognitive therapy (CT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric
      disorders and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Existing therapies fail to produce
      complete recovery. Progress toward improving outcome must include innovations that are safe,
      powerful, inexpensive and simple (for fast and effective dissemination). The proposed
      research seeks to test one such innovation. The investigators seek to improve outcome by
      improving memory for the content of cognitive therapy (CT) sessions. CT is one of the most
      promising approaches to the treatment of MDD, yet there is room for improvement.

      It is proposed that adding memory enhancing strategies to CT may improve MDD outcome because:
      (a) MDD is often characterized by memory impairment, (b) there is evidence that the memory
      impairment is modifiable, (c) CT typically entails the activation of emotion, (d) emotion can
      impair or bias memory and (e) there is evidence that memory for the content of therapy
      sessions is poor.

      Hence, the overall goal is to evaluate if integrating strategies designed to enhance memory
      for the content of CT sessions improves treatment outcome for MDD. Cognitive support involves
      a series of specific procedures that support the encoding and retrieval stages of an episodic
      memory. It is hypothesized that CT+Memory Support, relative to CT-as-usual, will be
      associated with improved illness course and functional outcome at the end of treatment as
      well as 6 and 12 months post-treatment.

    <description>There is evidence that CT for major depressive disorder (MDD) can be as effective as antidepressant medication for the initial treatment of moderate to severe MDD. Moreover, following the withdrawal of treatment, patients treated with CT are significantly less likely to relapse than patients treated with antidepressant medication and CT is at least as effective as antidepressant medication in preventing subsequent relapse. CT aims to alter the symptomatic expression of depression and reduce risk for subsequent episodes by correcting the negative beliefs and maladaptive information processing presumed to underlie the disorder and alter the systematic tendency to misperceive reality in a pessimistic fashion.</description>

    <description>The Memory Support Intervention will be delivered interwoven with CT. The Memory Support Intervention is designed to improve patient memory for treatment and involves a series of specific procedures that support the encoding and retrieval stages of episodic memory. It is comprised of eight memory promoting strategies: attention recruitment, categorization, evaluation, application, repetition, practice remembering, cued-based reminder and praise recall. These strategies are proactively, strategically and intensively integrated into treatment-as-usual to support encoding. Memory support is delivered alongside each 'treatment point', defined as a main idea, principle, or experience that the treatment provider wants the patient to remember or implement as part of the treatment.</description>

          -  Moderate or severe substance use in the past 6 months where 'moderate' is defined as
             4-5 symptoms and 'severe' is defined as 6+ listed in DSM-5 for each of the
             substance-related disorders

          -  Evidence of any medical disorder or condition that could cause depression, preclude
             participation in CT, or is associated with memory problems, that is not currently
             stabilized and/or managed under the care of a physician or the presence of an active
             and progressive physical illness or neurological degenerative disease,

          -  Current suicide risk sufficient to preclude treatment on an outpatient basis (assessed
             by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) or current homicide risk (assessed by
             our staff, a case manager or psychiatrist)
