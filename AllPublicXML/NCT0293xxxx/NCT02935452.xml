  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Generating Engagement in Network Involvement (GENIE) Tool is designed to support people
      to find and join social activities in their own neighbourhoods.

      Evidence has shown that people with more social support have increased ability to manage long
      term conditions and ill health.

      Patients with Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD) have difficulty breathing every day;
      this is both tiring and makes its difficult to socialise as they did prior to having their
      condition. COPD can be managed with medicines, and exercise, but will never be cured, so it
      is considered a 'long term condition.'

      This study plans to use a social mapping tool (GENIE) with COPD patients that are already
      part of the community service. The aim of the study is to increase opportunities to socialise
      and get day to day support outside of the health service.

      Patients will be offered either the tool, or usual care.

      If the study is successful then use of health care may reduce in the COPD patients already
      using the COPD service.

      The main aim here is to increase long term health care management options in Solent NHS (
      National Health Service) Trust by building social capacity to support self-management. The
      GENIE tool will be introduced into the COPD service to improve options for social groups and
      exercise when leaving a pulmonary rehabilitation group, or when clinically unable to
      participate in exercise. The implementation of the GENIE tool aims;

        -  to build social networking awareness and the importance of utilising existing social
           resources in the professional and voluntary members of the COPD service

        -  to use social network mapping techniques and preference elicitation to engage COPD
           patients in reflecting on their support preferences and needs, help them access further
           resources and knowledge

        -  Evaluate the success of the social mapping techniques (GENIE) in the COPD patient
           population

        -  Evaluate the cost benefit to the health service of the GENIE in the COPD patient
           population

    <description>GENIE is a way to help people think about the links they have with others to manage a health problem (local groups, friends, acquaintances, family members, professionals) and to reflect on their involvement in health and wellness activities and their ability to live an ordinary life with a long term condition. By using GENIE and thinking or talking through the GENIE mapping tool, individuals can visualize their network and can reflect on connections that provide value and resources for managing and where there are gaps in support- this might be social, practical or emotional as well as specifically related to a health condition.</description>
