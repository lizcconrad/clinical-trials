  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal models have demonstrated the role of aldosterone in left ventricular remodeling
      involving fibrosis, apoptosis and hypertrophy. Myocardial fibrosis is a risk factor for
      serious arrhythmia and sudden death in ischemic and idiopathic hypertrophic heart disease. It
      is accepted that patients with primary aldosteronism have a higher prevalence of LV
      hypertrophy , arterial involvement and increased cardiovascular risk. In humans, a link has
      been demonstrated between aldosterone and heart failure as well as the benefit of the
      administration of an anti -aldosterone drug to lower mortality in this population ,
      regardless of blood pressure level . The administration of spironolactone ( aldosterone ) in
      hypertensive rats has prevented the occurrence of aortic fibrosis . Plasma aldosteronism in
      humans has been associated with inflammation, fibrosis and aortic stiffness . However,
      primary aldosteronism is generally associated with so-called secondary hypertension . Chronic
      hypertension alone is a recognized etiological factor of myocardial hypertrophy ( myocardial
      fibrosis very advanced ) . The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of MRI
      hyperaldosteronism on the heart.

      Cross-sectional study with double analysis (A and B) with 2 x 2 sub-groups (ratio
      control/case 1/1)

        -  clinical situation: subjects are hypertensive. 20 subjects with primary aldosteronism
           will be compared to 20 patients with essential arterial hypertension

        -  clinical situation are normotensive subjects, 20 subjects with secondary aldosteronism
           loss in congenital salt (Bartter's syndrome / Gitelman) will be compared to 20 healthy
           volunteers. Controls (essential hypertension and healthy volunteers) are matched for
           age, sex and body size in two experimental groups (HAP and Gitelman). All subjects were
           recruited by the CIC of the European Georges Pompidou Hospital (Paris).
