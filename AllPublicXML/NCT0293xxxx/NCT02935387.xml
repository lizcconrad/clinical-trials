    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in remission with a combination of TNFinhibitors (TNFi)
      and methotrexate (MTX) often express their wish to stop MTX treatment because of side
      effects. Given the efficacy of TNFi it is conceivable that in early RA patients in remission
      with methotrexate (MTX)/TNFi stepwise discontinuation of MTX prior to TNFi is superior in
      maintaining sustained remission and reaching drug free remission as compared to
      discontinuation of TNFi prior to MTX.

      Objective: To investigate whether tapering MTX first, then the TNFi golimumab (GOL), is more
      efficacious than tapering GOL first, then MTX, in sustaining remission and reaching drug free
      remission.

      Study design: multicenter, open label clinical trial in very early RA patients. Remission
      will be induced by an open label treat-to-target (T2T) remission induction protocol in
      clinical care: (MTX, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), i.m. glucocorticoids (GC), and, if not in
      remission, the TNFi golimumab (GOL)) (phase I, 3/4th or 1 year). Patients in sustained
      remission on MTX/GOL (DAS28&lt;2.6 with max 4 swollen joints of the 44 swollen joint count (SJC)
      at 2 consecutive visits 3 months apart) will be randomized to taper either MTX first, then
      GOL or GOL first, then MTX with as primary endpoint sustained (drug free) remission (phase
      II, 1 year). During 1 year additional follow-up maintenance of drug-free sustained remission
      will be investigated (phase III).

      Study population: RA patients fulfilling 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EUropean
      League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for RA, with symptom duration &lt;12 months; naïve
      for anti-rheumatic drugs and glucocorticoids for RA; DAS28 ≥3.2.

      Intervention: Patients in sustained remission (defined as DAS28&lt;2.6 with max 4 swollen joints
      of the 44SJC at ≥ 2 consecutive visits 3 months apart) on MTX/GOL at the end of phase I
      (after 24 weeks of treatment with MTX/GOL) will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to taper
      medication as follows:

        -  Taper and stop GOL first during 24 weeks, then, if still in sustained remission, taper
           and stop MTX during 24 weeks

        -  Taper and stop MTX first during 24 weeks, then, if still in sustained remission, taper
           and stop GOL during 24 weeks The primary end point is the proportion of patients in
           sustained remission at week 24 after start of tapering of either MTX or GOL first. The
           main secondary end point is the proportion of patients in drug-free sustained remission,
           at week 48 after start of tapering.

           anti-rheumatic treatment, at week 48 after discontinuation of both MTX and GOL
