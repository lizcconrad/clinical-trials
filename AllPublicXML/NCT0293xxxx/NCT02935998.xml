      1. The title of this study is a multi-center,non randomized,open-labeled,intervention
           study:the efficacy and safety of intramuscular ziprasidone for three days in patients
           with acute psychotic agitation.

        2. The primary objectiveis to evaluate the efficacy of intramuscular ziprasidone in
           patients with acute psychotic agitation in daily clinical practice.

        3. The secondary objectives are:1.To evaluate the safety of intramuscular ziprasidone in
           patients with acute psychotic agitation in daily clinical practice.2.To compare the
           efficacy and tolerance of intramuscular ziprasidone in patients with agitation in the
           different psychotic disorder 3.To compare the efficacy and tolerance of intramuscular
           ziprasidone in patients with first episode andmulti-episode patients. 4.To explore the
           measured based administration according to severity of symptoms.5.To compare the
           efficacy and tolerance of ziprasidone im between the monotherapy and combination with
           other antipsychotic drug in clinical practice.

        4. The Rationale:In China, the studies of ziprasidone im treating agitation focus on
           schizophrenia. But in the foreign country, ziprasidone im also is approved to treat
           psychotic agitation, including bipolar and schizoaffective disorder. And in the clinical
           practice of China, ziprasidone im is also used to treat other patients, although the
           evidence is less. In this study, we assume ziprasidone im treat the psychotic agitation
           is effective and safe.

        5. Study populations:The study plan to enroll 1000 subjects in China. （6）The background and
           the hypothesis：The researches of ziprasidone mesylate injection in our country are more
           concentrated in schizophrenia at present, while in foreign countries ziprasidone is
           approved for psychotic agitation, including mania etc. It's also used for substance
           abuse and alcohol induced agitation.Therefore, this study assumes that ziprasidone
           mesylate injection is effective in the treatment of acute agitation, and it's well
           tolerated.

      1. Trial Design:This is a multi-center, open-labeled, intervention study.

        2. STUDY EVALUATION：1)Primary efficacy endpoint：The change of BARS total scores from
           baseline to the endpoint.2)Secondary efficacy endpoint：

             -  The change of CGI-S from baseline to the endpoint

             -  The change of BARS/CGI-S/CGI-I from baseline to every visit

             -  The percentage of response at the end of 2h(BARS decreased score&gt;=2)

             -  Subgroup analysis:(1)Comparison of the difference of the reduction in BARS/CGI-S in
                the different diseases subgroup.(2)Comparison of the difference of the reduction in
                BARS/CGI-S in the first episode and multi-episode patients.(3)Comparison of the
                difference of the reduction in BARS/CGI-S in the different previous antipsychotic
                treatment.(4)Comparison of the difference of disease categories, dosage, duration,
                and the reduction in BARS/CGI-S in the monotherapy and combination with other oral
                antipsychotic drugs Safety evaluation 3)Include adverse events, ECG(the change rate
                of ECG and the average change of QT),vital signs from the baseline to the endpoint.

                  1. The change of Simpson-Angus with from the baseline to endpoint.

                  2. The incidence of ADR、extrapyramidal symptoms、tachycardia during the studyThe
                     incidence of during the study.

        3. STUDY DRUGS:The injection mesylate ziprasidone used in this study have been marketed,
           manufactured by Pfizer and provided study drug for research purposes.Strength:Each vial
           contains Ziprasidone 30 mg, Sulfobutyl betadex sodium 441 mg. When reconstituted as
           directed the solution for injection contains the equivalent of 20 mg per mL of
           Ziprasidone.Ziprasidone intramuscular is intended for intramuscular use only and should
           not be administered intravenously.

        4. DATA ADMINISTRATION AND STATISTICAL METHODS:The case report form (CRF) used in this
           clinical study is in paper form.

           The data and statistical analysis collected in study will be recorded in the statistical
           analysis program (SAP).

        5. Basic principles of research design:Collecting the safety, effectiveness indexes in the
           process of drug treatment, analysis the changes before and after 3 days of the
           treatment, and record injection in the process of the study, in order to analyze the
           safety and efficacy of injection ziprasidone in the real clinical practice.

When reconstituted as directed the solution for injection contains the equivalent of 20 mg per mL of Ziprasidone.The initial dosage of ziprasidone injection：Most patients are suggested with 20mg i.m. Those with first-episode, lower age, emaciated body, or BARS score at 5 are suggest with 10mg i.m. Doses of 10 mg may be administered every two hours; doses of 20 mg may be administered every four hours up to a maximum of 40 mg/day.</description>

    <description>During the study, at least 1 injection is needed per day. Whether the second, third or fourth one is needed according to patients' symptoms. If the BARS score&gt;=5, clinicians are supposed to give 10mg or 20mg.If lower than 5, clinicians could choose to give 10mg or not according to patients' symptoms and doctor's experience. Doses of 10 mg may be administered every two hours; doses of 20 mg may be administered every four hours up to a maximum of 40 mg/day.It is not recommended to combine with other oral antipsychotic drugs. But if the patients' daily dose of injection has reached 40mg and agitation occurred 4 hours later after the last injection, with the BARS score higher than 5.The clinicians can determine whether or not to combine oral antipsychotic drug, and the dosage.</description>
