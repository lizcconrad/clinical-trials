    <textblock>
      After successful screening of patients based on inclusion criteria, we will measure the
      baseline Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient. At day 1 patients will undergo complete blood
      investigation including complete haemogram, kidney function test, liver function test,
      prothrombin time, AFP (Alfa Feto Protein) level, chest x ray, ultrasonography, fibroscan.
      Routine complete physical examination will be done.

    <description>Carvedilol will be administered orally at a start dose of 3.125 mg twice daily per day. After 1 week, this will increased to a dose of 6.25 mg twice daily per day. Target dose of 12.5 mg twice daily per day will be started after 2 weeks if systolic blood pressure does not fall below 90 mm Hg and HR 55-60/min.
Simvastatin will be administered orally at a start dose of 20 mg for 15 days followed by 40 mg OD for the next 3 months. Along with Simvastatin, Carvedilol will be administered orally at a start dose of 3.125 mg twice daily per day. After 1 week, this will increased to a dose of 6.25 mg twice daily per day. Target dose of 12.5 mg twice daily per day will be started after 2 weeks if systolic blood pressure does not fall below 90 mm Hg and HR 55-60/min.</description>
