  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No treatments exist for Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) when there is cell loss such
      as in late wet AMD or dry AMD. The differentiation of RPE cells from patient derived iPSC
      will offer valuable source of tissue for transplantation in these forms of AMD and may form
      basis for a future treatment option in terms of cell transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that adult human skin cells or human blood cells can be reprogrammed to
      become stem cells. This type of stem cell is called an induced Pluripotent Stem Cell
      (iPSC).It has been shown specifically that this type of stem cell can be produced from adult
      human skin cells or blood cells can in turn be converted into Retinal Pigment Epithelial
      (RPE) cells. These RPE cells are a very important cell type in the human retina that are
      abnormal and ultimately lost in Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Although it has been
      shown to be possible to make RPE cells from adult human skin, it has not been done to a level
      to fulfil regulatory requirements for human transplantation in AMD.

      This is a feasibility study involving 10 patients. The efficiency of creating an iPSC-Derived
      RPE cells from a patient's own skin or blood will be examined. A sample size of 10 patients
      will allow us to potentially consolidate the safety and efficacy of this method in order to
      create these cells within the context of a future transplantation trial.
