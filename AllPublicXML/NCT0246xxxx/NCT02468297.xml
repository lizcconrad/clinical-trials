  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized , double-blind, parallel-arm clinical trial was designed to study the
      efficacy and safety of the &quot;Electronic Acupuncture Shoes&quot; treatment on chronic low back pain
      patients.

      Chronic low back pain patients, aged 20-60, of both gender were recruited. As the primary
      outcome measure to assess the efficacy, &quot;0-10 numerical rating scale&quot; was used. Secondary
      outcome measure included the speed of pain-relief.

      The number of samples in the experimental group and the control group ratio of 1 : 1 , is
      expected to total effective sample number is 60 . Experimental group will receive a six-week
      &quot;Electronic Acupuncture Shoes&quot; treatment and a week back to the clinic three times , subject
      to a total of 18 treatments , each course of about one hour . Subjects will take NSAID
      placebo in the first week of the course of treatment . After the second week of NSAID placebo
      on disabled.

      Control subjects will also accept the six- week treatment , control subjects will be equally
      back to the clinic three times a week , each group will be given to the subject of one hour
      each shoe pseudo electrotherapy treatment group and control group run by entering from the
      test day in the first week of the course , each taking ibuprofen 400mg, taken three times a
      day , the second week after the NSAID drugs on disabled.
