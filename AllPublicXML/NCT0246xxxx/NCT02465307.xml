  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium, as a common complication of hospitalization, poses significant health problems in
      hospitalized patients. Though about a third of delirium cases can benefit from intervention,
      detecting and predicting delirium is still very limited in practice. A common
      characterization of delirium is changes in activity level, causing patients to become
      hyperactive or hypoactive which is manifested in facial expressions and total body movements.
      This pilot study is designed to test the feasibility of a delirium detection system using
      movement data obtained from 3-axis wearable accelerometers and commercially available camera
      and facial recognition video system, in conjunction with electronics medical record (EMR)
      data, to analyze the relation of whole-body movement as well as facial expressions with
      delirium.

      The aim of the study is to assess the potential of motion and facial expression data for
      detecting delirium in ICU patients by comparing motion and facial expression patterns in
      delirium and control group. In this study, the investigators will use ActiGraph accelerometer
      to record each subject's movement patterns. Also, a processed video using a commercially
      available camera interfaces with specialized program to identify patient facial expressions
      and movement patterns. A total of 40 participants will be enrolled with delirium and 20
      patients without delirium will be used as control group. Motion profiles will be compared in
      the motorically defined subgroups (hyperactive, hypoactive, normal) based on accelerometer
      and facial recognition data. Then differences in facial expression, number of changes in
      postures and percentage of time spent moving between motorically defined subgroups and in
      delirium and control group. EMR data will also be used to assess the feasibility of detecting
      delirium by additionally including information on related risk factors.

    <description>MDAS denotes motor profile and defines motor subtyping. It has 10 items which assesses several areas of cognitive functioning (memory, attention, orientation and disturbances in thinking) and psychomotor activity. The items are rated on a four point scale (0-3) based on the current interaction with the patient or by assessment of behavior. A score of 13 shows the diagnosis of delirium.</description>
