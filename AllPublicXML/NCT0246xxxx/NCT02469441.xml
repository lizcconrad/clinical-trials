      The aim of the study is to investigate if postoperative coffee intake decreases the time
      until first bowel movement in elective colorectal surgery with primary anastomosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus after colorectal surgery is a frequent problem which significantly
      prolongs hospital stay and increases perioperative costs. Postoperative therapeutic
      interventions vary significantly between different hospitals due to missing evidence-based
      guidelines. Coffee is a safe, cheap and simple agent without significant side effects which
      can positively influence the bowel function.

      The aim of the investigators is to evaluate in an own study if coffee consumption has an
      influence on the duration of postoperative ileus.

      The present trial is designed to evaluate if postoperative coffee intake decreases the time
      until first bowel movement in colorectal surgery with primary anastomosis. This study would
      be the second study which evaluates the described questions under randomized conditions.
