  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mammary reconstruction replaces total skin transplant, which may causing patient discomfort.
      It is a simple, painless and reproductible technology that avoids consequences and
      complications related to transplant. Tattoo helps patients to return faster to the normal
      life and close more easily the cancer episode.

      The study purpose is to measure the patient's esthetic satisfaction degree on 1year areola
      tattoo realized following standard care.

      Tattoo is realized as standard car as part of mammary reconstruction after surgery of patient
      suffering from breast cancer. We try to measured :

        -  Tattooed patient's satisfaction degree with qualitative questionnaire using four level
           satisfaction scale (very satisfied, satisfied, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied)

        -  Evaluate from patient and jury, the tall, form, color and areola position defects

        -  Evaluate professional jury's satisfaction degree regarding this areola tattoo
           technology, with the same patient criteria
