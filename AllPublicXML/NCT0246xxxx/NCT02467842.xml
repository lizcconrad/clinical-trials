    <textblock>
      All participants will receive a single dose of their assigned vaccine on Day 0. They will be
      followed up for immunogenicity and safety through Day 21 post-vaccination. The serious
      adverse events are collected for 6 months post-vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized controlled phase III trial undertaken in 10 university hospitals of South
      Korea, adults and elderly subjects are randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to NBP607-QIV
      versus cell culture-based trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, NBP607-Y and NBP607-V.
      Immunogenicity is assessed 3 weeks after vaccination by hemagglutination inhibition (HI)
      assay. Safety is assessed for 6 months post-vaccination: solicited adverse events for 7 days,
      unsolicited AEs for 21 days and SAE for 6 months.
