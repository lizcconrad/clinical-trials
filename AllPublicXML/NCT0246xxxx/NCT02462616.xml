    <textblock>
      A large-scale, community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted to explore the extent to
      which risk factors associated with cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in general
      Chinese population. A total of more than 2000 participants were recruited by using multiple
      stages sampling (first cluster sampling and then simply sampling). Data involved in
      demographic information, clinical biomarkers such as glucose and lipids profiles, medical and
      therapy history were collected. Every participants was complete DNA extracted and genotyped.
      Cardiovascular autonomic functions were measured by using short-term heart rate variability
      (HRV) to evaluate the outcome of CAN. Univariate and multiple variables analysis have been
      performed to examine potential environmental and genetic risk factors of CAN. In addition,
      clinical risk model, simply screening model and non-linear system model such as artificial
      neural network was created, respectively.

        We recruited participants from rural and urban communities in Shanghai. Survey participants
        with undiagnosed CAN, aged 30-90 years, were included in this study. Our study invited a
        total of 3,012 subjects to a screening visit between 2011 and 2012.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Survey Chinese participants with undiagnosed CAN

          -  Aged 30-90 years, were included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Some subjects were excluded from the study to eliminate potential confounding factors
             that may have influenced their CA function. Briefly, the exclusion criteria were as
             follows:

               1. history or findings of arrhythmia and hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism

               2. pregnancy or lactation

               3. serious hepatic or renal dysfunctions (GFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2).

          -  Of these subjects, complete baseline data were obtained for 2,092 (69.46%) of the
             participants.
