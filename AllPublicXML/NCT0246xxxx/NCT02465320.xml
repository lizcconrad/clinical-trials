  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if COL-1077 (10% lidocaine vaginal bioadhesive gel)
      will be effective as an acute-use anesthetic and can decrease the pain intensity associated
      with gynecologic procedures using endometrial biopsy as a representative procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COL-1077 is to be self-administered by patients prior to an outpatient transvaginal
      pipelle-directed endometrial biopsy with tenaculum placement in otherwise healthy women
      requiring biopsy.
