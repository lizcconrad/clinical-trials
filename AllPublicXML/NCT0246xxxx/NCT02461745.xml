      This is a Phase IV, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the real world sustained
      virological response rate, subject adherence, and subject reported outcomes during and after
      treatment of non-cirrhotic genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C subjects aged 18 years and older,
      with VIEKIRA PAK (ombitasvir, paritaprevir/r, dasubuvir), with or without ribavirin.

      This is a Phase IV, open-label, multi-center study to evaluate the real world sustained
      virological response rate, subject adherence, and subject reported outcomes during and after
      treatment of non-cirrhotic genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C subjects aged 18 years and older,
      with the AbbVie 3 direct-acting antiviral (3-DAA) regimen of VIEKIRA PAK (ombitasvir,
      paritaprevir/r, dasubuvir), with or without ribavirin.

      Subjects may be treatment-na√Øve or treatment experienced with pegylated-interferon based
      regimens excluding regimens with direct-acting antiviral agents. The study will be conducted
      at multiple Kaiser Permanente Southern California Medical Centers.

      The primary objective of this open label study is to evaluate the rate of sustained
      virological response rate 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12) with VIEKIRA PAK,
      with or without ribavirin in a large real world setting.

             than genotype 1

          -  Recent history of drug or alcohol abuse that could, in the opinion of the
             investigator, affect adherence to the study protocol
