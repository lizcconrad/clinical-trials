    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of remote ischemic preconditioning on preventing contrast
      medium-induced nephropathy in a population of high risk patients undergoing coronary
      angiography. Half of participants will receive a preconditioning procedure while the other
      half will receive a sham procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrast medium-induced nephropathy has a big impact on clinical outcomes in patients
      suffering from renal insufficiency who undergo percutaneous coronary interventions.

      Remote ischemic preconditioning is proved to protect myocardium in patients undergoing
      percutaneous coronary angiography.

      We will evaluate the effect of remote preconditioning on renal protection.
