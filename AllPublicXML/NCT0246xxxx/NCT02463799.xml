  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the effect of radium-223 when added to sipuleucel-T for treating
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to the bone. Sipuleucel-T is an autologous
      cellular immunotherapy designed to stimulate an immune response against prostate cancer. It
      has been suggested that the immune response may be strengthened by radiation therapy.
      Therefore this study is testing whether radium-223 added to sipuleucel-T increases the immune
      response and anti-tumor effect against prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study designed to assess the antigen-specific immune response of
      sipuleucel-T with or without radium-223. Eligible subjects will be registered and randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sipuleucel-T and radium-223 or sipuleucel-T alone.

      Subjects in both arms (sipuleucel-T and radium) will undergo a standard 1.5 to 2.0 blood
      volume leukapheresis, followed approximately 3 days later by an IV infusion of sipuleucel-T.
      This process will occur a total of 3 times at approximately 2-week intervals. Subjects in Arm
      1 will receive a total of 6 infusions of radium-223 at IV dose of 50 kBq/kg at 4-week
      interval.

      All participants are allowed to receive the best supportive care which includes secondary
      hormonal manipulation as required. No chemotherapy, external-beam radiation, or other
      radionuclides are allowed while on active treatment but are permitted after completion of
      active treatment. Glucocorticoid-containing treatments should be minimized to less than the
      equivalent dose of prednisone 10mg daily if feasible for the 3 months following sipuleucel-T
      therapy. All patients continue medical or surgical castration during treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent provided prior to initiation of study procedures

          2. Age ≥ 18 years

          3. Histologically documented adenocarcinoma prostate cancer confirmed by a pathology
             report from prostate biopsy or a radical prostatectomy specimen. If prostatic tumor is
             of mixed histology, &gt; 50% of the tumor must be adenocarcinoma

          4. Bone metastases as manifested by one or more lesions on a bone scan performed within 2
             months of screening

          5. Castrate-resistant prostate cancer, in the setting of castrate levels of testosterone
             (≤ 50 ng/dL), defined as current or historical evidence of disease progression
             concomitant with surgical castration or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), as
             demonstrated by two consecutive rises in PSA OR new lesions on bone scan:

               -  PSA progression will be defined as 2 rising PSA values compared to a reference
                  value, measured at least 7 days apart and the second value is ≥ 2 ng/mL [1]. It
                  must be documented within 2 months of screening.

               -  Appearance of one or more new areas of abnormal uptake on bone scan when compared
                  to imaging studies acquired during castration therapy or against the
                  precastration studies if there was no response. Increased uptake of pre-existing
                  lesions on bone scan does not constitute progression. It must be documented
                  within 4 months of screening

          6. Serum PSA ≥ 2.0 ng/mL

          7. Screening ECOG perf status ≤ 1

          8. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease (no narcotic analgesic; other analgesics
             use is allowed)

          9. Prior abiraterone and enzalutamide are permitted, but not required

         10. Concurrent osteoclast-inhibitory therapies (zoledronic acid, denosumab) are permitted
             if patients have been on a stable dose for at least 1 month

         13. Uncontrolled medical conditions including diabetes, heart failure, COPD, ulcerative
             colitis, or Crohn's disease

         14. Uncontrolled fecal incontinence

         15. Any medical intervention, any other condition, or any other circumstance which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, could compromise adherence with study requirements or
