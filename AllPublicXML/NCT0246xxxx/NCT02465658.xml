  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of co-existence of cervical elongation in women of uterine prolapse may decrease
      the patients' satisfaction of uterine-preservation surgery for uterine prolapse, and
      additional surgery, such as Manchester surgery, may be needed to solve the problem.Thus the
      aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors of co-existence of cervical elongation
      in uterine prolapse.

      Purpose:

      Thus the aim of this study is to investigate the risk factors of co-existence of cervical
      elongation in uterine prolapse.

      Patients and Methods:

      Between January 1994 and October 2014, all women underwent vaginal total hysterectomy in a
      medical center were enrolled in this study. Medical records were reviewed. Cervical
      elongation is defined as the presence of cervical length &gt;3.38 cm or cervix to corpus ratio
      &gt;0.79.

      Expected Results:

      The investigators will get the risk factors of co-existence of cervical elongation in uterine
      prolapse, and the result should be helpful for preoperative consultation, especially for
      uterine-preserving pelvic floor reconstruction surgery.
