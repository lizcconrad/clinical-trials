      This study aims to evaluate the effects of prior use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      Naproxen on risk and level of tooth sensitivity caused by in-office bleaching procedures.

    <description>The tooth sensitivity will be evaluated using a 5-point Verbal rating scale (VRS), where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = considerable and 4 = severe. Score different from 0 will determine presence of sensitivity. The risk of tooth sensitivity will be determined by relative risk assessed by ratio between absolute risk of experimental condition by those observed in control. The 95% confidence interval will be calculated.</description>
