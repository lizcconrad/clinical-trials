    <textblock>
      ICU acquired muscle weakness (IAMW) is a common disease that is associated with high
      morbidity and mortality. Patients with septic shock are particularly at risk.

      The diagnosis of IAMW is clinical and based on the rating of the Medical Research Council
      score (MRC score). A MRC score lower than 48 defines the IAMW. But this evaluation is only
      usable in sufficiently awaken patients.

      Several studies have highlighted the role of microRNAs in regulating physiological processes
      and diseases related to the skeletal muscles. To date, no study was interested in IAMW.

      The aim of this study is to compare the microRNA detection kinetics on the appearance of
      IAMW.

      In septic shock patients, the kinetics of nine microRNAs will be compared between two groups:
      those with IAMW (IAMW + group) and those without IAMW (IAMW - group).

      MicroRNAs (miR-1, miR-21, miR-133, miR-155, miR-206, miR-208a, miR-208b, miR-486, miR-499)
      will be measured at day 1, day 2, day 5 and day 7 after septic shock onset.
