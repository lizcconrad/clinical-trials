    <textblock>
      In this trial, patients with mantle cell lymphoma will be included, treatment with
      lenalidomide, rituximab and ibrutinib will be administered in an induction phase for up to 12
      cycles, cycle length 28 days. Patients with complete remission, partial response or stable
      disease will enter a maintenance phase with treatment with ibrutinib and rituximab until
      progression of disease.

      The primary objective is to evaluate overall response rate, based on PET and CT.
