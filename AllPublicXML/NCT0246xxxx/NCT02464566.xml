    <textblock>
      With low carbohydrate dietary approach for both arms, the investigators will examine the
      effectiveness of 12-weeks intensive lifestyle intervention program provided in individual
      sessions in primary health care obesity clinic in Jeddah with aim to achieve 5% reduction of
      baseline weight for experimental participants in comparison with active comparator group
      (only one health education session).

    <textblock>
      The study has two arms:

      Active Comparator Arm:

      Only health education. One session regarding diet restriction and physical activity with
      printed health education papers.

      Experimental Arm:

      Intensive lifestyle intervention Weekly individual session in obesity clinic (15 to 20 min.)
      for the first 4 weeks then one individual session in obesity clinic (10 to 20 min.) every two
      weeks (week 5 to week 12).

      Total sessions in 12 weeks: 8 (including the final data collection visit).The components of
      the program: 1) Low carbohydrate (aim to achieve spontaneous reduction in calorie intake) 2)
      increased physical activity; 3) behavioral strategies to facilitate adherence to diet and
      activity prescriptions.
