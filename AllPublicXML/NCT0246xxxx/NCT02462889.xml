    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-blind, randomized study to evaluate intravitreal aflibercept
      injection (IAI) versus sham as prophylaxis against conversion to neovascular age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD) in &quot;high-risk&quot; subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      128 subjects will be enrolled in the trial and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      IAI every three months for 24 months or sham injections. Enrollment will be stratified in
      order to ensure a balance between the two treatment groups for subjects who were diagnosed
      with exudative AMD within the past two years versus those diagnosed more than two years prior
      to Baseline.

      Study assessments will be conducted at required visits every three months and include
      manifest refraction and ETDRS visual acuity testing, slit lamp exam and dilated fundus exam,
      spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) using Avanti device, and OCT
      angiography using Avanti AngioVueTM, and fluorescein angiography. Fundus photography will
      also be performed at Baseline, Month 12 and Month 24 visits.

      In the event of conversion to neovascular AMD in the study eye at any point during the study,
      the Investigator will treat the subject with IAI at a frequency per his/her discretion.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study eye must have a diagnosis of non-exudative age-related degeneration
             characterized by the presence of many intermediate sized drusen, 1 or more large
             drusen, and/or hyperpigmentary changes. Fellow (non-study) eye must have CNV lesion
             (i.e., leakage on fluorescein angiography and/or subretinal, intraretinal, or sub-RPE
             fluid on OCT) secondary to age-related macular degeneration OR history of CNV lesion
             secondary to age-related macular degeneration, as confirmed by current or past
             treatment or current or past diagnostic imaging.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related
             procedures.

          -  Subject must provide signed informed consent.

          -  Subject must be able to understand and complete study-related questionnaires. In order
             to participate in the home monitoring sub-study, subjects must have an approved
             wireless device (i.e. iPhone, iPad, or iPod running iOS 6.0 or later) or be willing to
             use a loaned device and have access to a wireless Internet connection for the duration
             of the study.

          -  Evidence of neovascular AMD in the study eye at time of enrollment or anytime in the
