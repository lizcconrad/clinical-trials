      An open label single arm study to assess efficacy and safety of BL-8040 on top of standard
      immunotherapy regimen of hATG, cyclosporine and steroids in patients with Hypoplastic MDS and
      AA over the course of a six month (180 day) treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single arm, phase IIa study in subjects with AA or Hypoplastic
      MDS.

      Eligible subjects will receive subcutaneous (SC) injections of BL-8040 monotherapy over 10
      days. From Day 11 through Day 14, subjects will receive hATG, Methylprednisolone and
      Cyclosporine. From Day 15 until Day 30 (of the first month), subjects will continue treatment
      only with Methylprednisolone and Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine will continue daily through Month
      6/Day 30 (M6/D30) (end of study treatment). Beginning on M2/D1, BL-8040 will be administered
      daily as part of the maintenance period for the first 5 days of each month through M6. All
      BL-8040 injection courses will be given at the site, as either an inpatient or outpatient per
      the treating physician's decision.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of the treatment with BL-8040
      on top of the standard immunotherapy regimen of: hATG, cyclosporine, and steroids in patients
      with Hypoplastic MDS and AA. Safety and efficacy will be assessed at defined time-points
      throughout the study. Duration of response and overall survival will be assessed as a part of
      the long term FU. A maximum of 25 patients will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be
      equally distributed between the disease populations.

          6. Patients must have been off of cytotoxic, immunosuppressive (except steroids), or
             targeted therapy, including standard and investigational treatments for AA, for at
             least 1 week or 5 half-lives whichever comes later, prior to entering this study, and
             have recovered from the toxic effects of that therapy to Grade 1 or less.

          7. Adequate organ function as defined below:

             • Liver function:

             a. Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL (34 µmol/L) b. AST and/or ALT &lt;3 x ULN

               -  Kidney function: creatinine &lt; 2.5 x ULN.

          9. Women of childbearing potential and all men must agree to use an approved form of
             contraception (e.g. oral, transdermal patch, implanted contraceptives, intrauterine
             device, diaphragm, condom, abstinence or surgical sterility) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation through 30 days after the last dose of the
             last treatment drug. Pregnancy testing is not required for post-menopausal or
             surgically sterilized women.

         10. Subject is able and willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

             preclude safe and complete study participation, as determined by medical history,

                    -  Unstable psychiatric disorder that would render the patient unable to comply
                       with study requirements.

                    -  Any malignancies in the 3 years prior to Baseline, excluding basal cell
                       carcinoma, in situ malignancy, low-risk prostate cancer, cervical cancer
                       after curative therapy.

                    -  A co-morbid condition that, in the Investigator's opinion, renders the
