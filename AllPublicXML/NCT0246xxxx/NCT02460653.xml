      1. To determine the lowest nasal cannula flow rate in which upper airway deadspace is
           reduced. Hypothesis - The lowest flow rate of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) will reduce
           upper airway (extrathoracic) deadspace and improve respiratory efficiency by reducing
           transcutaneous CO2 and/or lower respiratory rate.

        2. To determine the lowest nasal cannula flow rate in which regional distribution (as
           defined by EIT) of ventilation changes. Hypothesis - Moderate to high flow rates will
           create positive pressure that leads to improved regional distribution of ventilation.

      Background and Significance Historically, oxygen nasal cannulae have been used in hypoxemic
      patients as a therapy to increase arterial oxygenation. In the neonatal community, oxygen
      flows &gt;2 L/min and &gt; 4 L/min in the pediatric patient have seldom been used due to the
      potential for excessive drying of the nasal mucosae and risk for developing hypothermia. It
      has been speculated that larger pediatric and adult patients are able to better tolerate flow
      rates in excess of 4 L/min because the large nasal mucosal surface area can support hydration
      of dry medical grade gases. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy is a form of respiratory
      support that provides flows that are believed to be in excess of a patient's spontaneous
      inspiratory and expiratory flow rates. In the last decade, a proliferation of
      heated-humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) devices has been introduced into the
      clinical setting. These devices are intended to provide optimal heating and humidification of
      medical gases and regardless of flow setting. In the case of neonates, which has been the
      predominant patient population receiving HFNC, there clearly is no consensus on which flows
      constitute &quot;high&quot; in this population. If &quot;high&quot; is intended to mean a flow rate that exceeds
      spontaneous inspiratory flow rate then there is no reasonable clinical measurement to
      ascertain this relationship. Thus, the true definition of HFNC remains an elusive term and
      our protocol hopes to shed some light on this subject.

      Our prospective randomized trial of the effects of 3 different oxygen nasal cannula flow
      rates (low, medium, and high) on respiratory rate, SPO2, transcutaneous CO2 and regional
      distribution of ventilation as measured by EIT will help clinicians define a range of HFNC
      flow rates in which deadspace washout occurs without positive distending pressure (low range)
      and in which deadspace washout occurs with positive pressure that creates regional
      distribution of ventilation changes.

      C. Preliminary Studies One neonatal source defines HFNC as flows &gt; 1 L/min and another
      defines flows &gt;3 L/min as HFNC.1 Classification is further complicated in larger pediatric
      and adult patients where flows during HFNC have been reported to be in excess of those
      traditionally used with a standard nasal cannula ~ 6 L/min) and as high as 30-40 L/min.2 With
      the technologic ability to provide better heat and humidity, clinicians have found that HFNC
      may be able to support a larger fraction of patients that would otherwise require continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), or invasive mechanical
      ventilation. There are several proposed mechanisms by which HFNC may provide greater
      respiratory assistance than standard oxygen delivery devices.

      Flows that exceed the expiratory flow rate may provide &quot;back-pressure&quot; at the nasal airway
      opening during exhalation that is similar to nasal CPAP. Additionally, gases may provide a
      physiologic purging of carbon dioxide from the anatomic dead space via anatomic leak
      (nasal/oral airway). These effects are likely to vary based on the flow, minute ventilation,
      patient size, leak, and nasal airway opening/prong size relationship. There are currently
      three FDA approved HFNC systems. Clinical acceptance is related to the fact that HFNC is less
      expensive, simpler to operate and requires a less complicated airway interface than a
      standard CPAP or NIV device. Another proposed benefit is that HFNC prongs are generally less
      occlusive and may cause less nasal airway injury than CPAP prongs or a BiPAP mask. The
      widespread acceptance and use of this approach has been implemented with very little
      experimental data to support HFNC flow settings as a safe and effective option in all
      patients with hypoxic respiratory failure.

      Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) Electrical impedance tomography capitalizes on changes
      in impendence in air-filled versus tissue-filled spaces to characterize and quantify regional
      distribution of lung volume at the bedside. This technology has been validated in animal3 and
      human4, 5 studies performed over the past decade at Boston Children's Hospital. The
      technology utilizes a series of 16 electrodes placed across the patient's chest (Figure 1).
      As small currents are passed between the electrodes, impedance is measured between and
      amongst the series. Through a complex interrogation and manipulation of these impedance
      values, a two-dimensional image is formed (Figure 2), and has been shown to correlate with
      clinical and radiographic changes in patients4. The ability to estimate lung volume and
      regional distribution of gas non-invasively and in real time may give us insight as to what
      mode of ventilation is more effective.

      Physiologic effects and safety of HFNC There are several proposed physiologic mechanisms by
      which HFNC is believed to be effective. These include: 1) flushing the upper airway deadspace
      of CO2, allowing for better alveolar gas exchange; 2) providing a flow adequate to support
      inspiration therefore reducing inspiratory work of breathing; 3) improving lung and airway
      mechanics by eliminating the effects of drying/cooling; 4) reducing or eliminating the
      metabolic cost of gas conditioning; and 5) providing positive expiratory distending pressure.
      While these variables have been measured in either animals or humans, short-term studies only
      enrolled small numbers of subjects and were not specifically designed to address safety of
      HFNC.

      Hasan et al observed the effects of pressure generated in a static neonatal lung model using
      two commercially available HFNC devices with flows between 0-12 L/min and at different leak
      settings.6 They demonstrated in a nares model where leak was minimized (mouth closed) that a
      systematic increase in simulated tracheal pressures was proportional to increased flows. The
      measured airway pressures were similar to those reported with nasal CPAP (~5-6 cmH2O at flows
      of ~6-8 L/min).

      Frizzola and colleagues measured tracheal pressures and gas exchange in 13 lung-injured
      neonatal piglets supported by N-CPAP and HFNC under high-leak and low-leak conditions.7 The
      major finding of this study was that HFNC tracheal pressures were comparable to CPAP
      pressures at the same flow range, and washout of nasopharyngeal dead space is associated with
      improved ventilation and oxygenation independent of tracheal pressure alone during HFNC.

      A number of short-term studies have evaluated the magnitude of distending pressure in the
      lung in a small group of infants. Sreenan et al found that similar end expiratory pleural
      pressures could be maintained between a standard oxygen delivery nasal cannula (1-2.5 L/min)
      and N-CPAP in a group of 40 premature infants with no differences in desaturations,
      bradycardia, and apnea.8 However, this pressure is likely to be highly variable due to leak
      and airway/cannula size relationship. Lampland observed similar end-expiratory pleural
      pressures between HFNC (2-6 L/min) and N-CPAP 6 cm H2O in premature neonates.9 A recent
      Cochrane meta-analysis evaluated prospective, randomized controlled trials that were limited
      to the premature infant population.1 The primary objective of this meta-analysis was to
      determine safety and efficacy of HFNC. When used as primary respiratory support after birth,
      one trial found similar rates of treatment failure in infants treated with HFNC (5-6 L/min)
      and nasal CPAP.10 Following extubation, one trial found that infants treated with HFNC (1.8
      L/min) had a significantly greater need for reintubation than those treated with nasal
      CPAP.11 Another trial found similar rates of reintubation for humidified and non-humidified
      HFNC (~ 2-3 L/min)12 and the fourth trial found no difference between two different models of
      equipment used to deliver humidified HFNC (6 L/min).13 There were few patients enrolled in
      these studies and in two studies (Woodhead, Miller) poor methodological approaches were used.
      In one study enrollment was stopped short due to infections related to the HFNC device being
      used.10 Based on these findings, there is insufficient evidence to establish the safety or
      effectiveness of HFNC within the range of commonly used flows, and as a form of respiratory
      support in preterm infants. Also, these data demonstrate that when used following extubation,
      HFNC may be associated with a higher rate of reintubation than nasal CPAP.14 There have been
      no studies evaluating safety and efficacy in larger infants and other pediatric patients.
      Despite the lack of supporting evidence, HFNC is still being implemented in many pediatric
      intensive care units (PICU) using flows ≥ 20 L/min and few adult studies have been conducted
      using these high flows during HFNC. Thus, it is difficult to extrapolate these findings to
      promote the use of similar flows in children. It is apparent that HFNC may provide some of
      the same clinical benefits as CPAP or even NIV with a less complicated nasal airway or
      naso-oral interface. While nasal CPAP serves as an intermediary form of support between
      oxygen therapy and invasive ventilation in neonates, it is more common for larger pediatrics
      and adults to be supported with bi-level NIV as an alternative to invasive ventilation. There
      is compelling data to also support the use of NIV in the neonatal population to augment the
      ventilation effects of nasal CPAP. HFNC not only provides a baseline pressure similar to CPAP
      but it also augments alveolar ventilation to a level that may be similar to NIV.

      D. Design and Methods

        1. Study Design

           a. In a prospective, randomized trial of three different flow rates of HFNC we will
           evaluate the outcome of EIT regional distribution, transcutaneous CO2, and respiratory
           rate.

        2. Patient Selection and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

           a. Inclusion Criteria i. All patients who are receiving HFNC for hypoxia ii. Age: 1 day
           (&gt; 38 weeks GA neonate or older) to 17 years. b. Exclusion Criteria i. Patients who have
           congenital heart defects. ii. Patient who the medical team feels may require urgent
           escalation of non-invasive therapy or imminent intubation.

           iii. Patients who are on FIO2 &gt; 0.6 at the highest level of flow offered within the
           study.

           iv. Patients who are immunocompromised and/or status post bone marrow transplant v.

           Patients with a known airway anomaly, e.g. Pierre-Robin, tracheomalacia. vii. Patients
           less than 38 weeks gestational age viii. Patients less than 3 kilograms ix. If the EIT
           band/electrodes are not able to be properly positioned on the chest due to size/weight
           limitations x. If the medical team feels that the patient is not appropriate to enroll
           in the study based on medical, social or emotional concerns

        3. Description of Study Treatments or Exposures/Predictors Following informed consent,
           patients who are ordered to receive HFNC therapy will be randomized to escalating flows
           (low to high) or deescalating (high to low) each hour and then returned to their
           previously order flow setting. According to age they will be placed on three different
           flow settings for 1 hour as shown in table 1 with a nasal cannula outside diameter no
           larger than 50% of the inside diameter of the naris. Table 1 was developed based on
           three known tidal volumes of 4, 6, and 8 mL/Kg with a 33% inspiratory time and highest
           normal respiratory rate. Measurements of SPO2, EIT, TCM CO2, and respiratory rate will
           be recorded every 15 minutes. FIO2 will be adjusted to maintain SPO2 90-95%.

           Transcutaneous CO2 (TCM) (Sentec) will be placed 30 minutes before randomization in
           order to allow for equilibration with the surface of the skin. We will place the TCM on
           left upper chest on patients less than 15 Kg and earlobe for those &gt; 15 Kg. The device
           is FDA approved and warms the skin to allow for diffusion of CO2 across the membrane of
           the skin and sensor. This device will allow us to develop a modified ventilation index.

           EIT measurements - EIT measurements will be taken prior to randomization and 1 hour
           after each of the three flow range changes. This involves the placement of a 16
           electrode band around the patients' chest, just below the nipple line.

           Pulse oximetry and co-oximetry - SpO2, S/F ratio (SpO2 to FIO2 ratio) SpHb (non-invasive
           HGB), and SpOC (oxygen content) will be monitored continuously for the 3 hour period.
           The average SpO2, S/F ratio, and SpOC will be calculated from the streamed data
           collected by the Masimo RAD-7 via a lap-top computer. Desaturations will be defined as a
           SpO2 &lt; 85% and reported. Excel will be utilized to perform these functions. An FDA
           approved disposable SPO2 probe will be applied to the patients' finger, thumb or toe.

        4. Definition of Primary and Secondary Outcomes/Endpoints a. Primary i. Oxygenation 1.
           Higher SPO2 on lower FIO2 (S/F ratio) 2. SpOC, and frequency of desaturations ii.
           Ventilation 1. Lower respiratory rate 2. Lower TCM CO2 b. Secondary i. Regional
           distribution difference measured by EIT 1. Area and upper to lower ratio will be the
           primary data analyzed 2. Regional filling of the lung will be compared.

        5. Data Collection Methods, Assessments, Interventions and Schedule (what assessments
           performed, how often) Data will be recorded continuously on each of the devices'
           (Draeger EIT, Sentec TCM, Masimo SPO2) computer. Data will be downloaded with either a
           USB drive or PCMC card and merged into one excel spreadsheet for analysis. Data will be
           manually recorded every 15 minutes for the entire 3 hours.

        6. Study Timeline a. See figure three.

      E. Adverse Event Criteria and Reporting Procedures Due to the fact that this is a pilot study
      the PI will review each major adverse event. The following complications will be monitored
      but only major complications will reported to the IRB. Minor events include: bradycardia (10%
      below baseline), increase in respiratory rate &gt; 20%, increase in TCpCO2 by 10 mmHg, increase
      in FIO2 of &gt; 0.3, hypoventilation (breath hold longer than 15 second) and desaturation
      (&lt;88%).

      Major events that will halt the study and be immediately reported to the IRB are:

        -  Desaturation &lt; 80% (continuously monitored by pulse oximetry) for longer than 1 minute.

        -  Bradycardia &lt; 60 BPM All major and minor events will be monitored and reported to the PI
           by the clinical research coordinator.

      F. Data Management Methods Upon entry, each patient will be assigned a number unique and
      unlinked from their medical record for the purpose of patient tracking. This number will be
      entered into a privately owned BCH, password protected research drive accessible only by BCH
      study personnel.

      A spreadsheet will be kept at the bedside during the data collection period (3 hours) for
      each data point to be entered manually.

      G. Quality Control Method Quality of the transfer of data will be ensured by a second
      investigator, who will confirm the manual and electronic data. SPSS software will be used to
      help analyze the data and ensuring data integrity by establishing alerts for non-filled
      fields as well as unexpected or possibly misentered results.

      H. Data Analysis Plan We will consider that &gt;10% differences in respiratory rate between flow
      setting to be considered significant. We will consider a &gt; 20% difference in TCM CO2 and SPO2
      to be considered significant.

      EIT data: The lung imaging system is the Dräger EIT Pulmovista 500 (Dräger Medical, Lübeck,
      Germany). Sixteen coplanar electrodes will be placed equidistantly around the thorax at the
      level of the parasternal sixth intercostal space. The reference electrode will be placed on
      the right side of the abdomen near the waistline. Electrodes #1 and #16 are symmetrically
      placed to the left and the right of the sternum, respectively, so that electrodes #8 and #9
      straddled the spinal column. This configuration leads to transverse images in the
      radiological convention, caudal to cranial, similar to a cat scan. Lung image reconstruction
      will be done according to the Graz consensus for electrical impedance tomography (GREIT) (15)
      using the Electrical Impedance and Diffuse Optical Reconstruction Software (16). In simple
      terms, the idea is to observe any shifts in the center of ventilation by assessing the ratio
      of the ventral to dorsal impedance changes ( ) during each part of the study. Impedance
      changes indicate how open or closed the lung is. This approach has been previously described
      in detail by our research group (17).

      I. Statistical Power and Sample Considerations Power analysis reveals based on repeated
      measures of three different flows per patient that 35 patients (7 per age category) are
      required for an effect size of 0.2, alpha of .05 and power of 0.8. Differences in mean values
      oxygenation (SPO2 and S/F ratio), ventilation (TCM CO2), and EIT (U/L ratio) between each
      treatment group will be compared every hour over the three hour testing period following
      randomization using ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test.

      J. Study Organization Single institution pilot study.
