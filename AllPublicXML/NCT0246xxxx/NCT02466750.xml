  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to collect safety and immunogenicity data for the WEE vaccine,
      TSI-GSD 210. Enrollment in this protocol is offered for personnel who enter areas where this
      virus is used in research or is endemic (an area where this disease process is found to occur
      frequently).

    <description>Immunogenicity data will be collected for all subjects and will be evaluated for all per-protocol subjects. The primary immunogenicity endpoint measurements will be the percentage of per-protocol subjects who develop titers of ≥ 1:40 as determined by PRNT80 after WEE vaccination at each scheduled time point for which blood samples are drawn and over the entire study period to study completion.</description>

    <description>Subjects receive 3 doses off WEE vaccine on Day 0, Day 7 ± 2 days, and Day 28-35 days. A booster will be administered on Day 180 ± 14 days and a sample collected for PRNT80 28-35 days later.</description>

    <description>Subjects who previously received the WEE vaccine under another protocol and have a PRNT80 &lt; 1:40. Boosters (and follow-up titers 28-35 days later) may continue while the subject has titers of &lt; 1:40 for a maximum of 4 booster doses in a year. If the titer remains &lt; 1:40 after 4 booster doses in 1 year, the subject will not be given WEE vaccine for 1 year. If the titer is &lt; 1:40 after that interval, one booster dose will be given and the titer will be assayed. If the immune response to the last booster dose is &lt; 1:40, the subject will be considered to have completed the study as a nonresponder.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be 18 to 65 years old at time of consent.

          2. Have WEE plaque reduction neutralization 80% titers (PRNT80) &lt; 1:10 for primary
             series.

          3. Have WEE PRNT80 &lt; 1:40 for booster series.

          4. If female of childbearing potential, must agree to have a urine pregnancy test on the
             same day before each vaccine. (Exception: documented hysterectomy or ≥ 3 years of
             menopause.) The results must be negative. Females must agree to not become pregnant
             for 3 months after receipt of the last study treatment (vaccination).

          5. Be considered at risk for exposure to WEE virus and who have submitted a Request for
             IND Vaccines for the WEE vaccine.

          6. Sign and date the approved informed consent document and HIPAA Authorization.

          7. Have in their charts

               1. medical history (including concomitant medications) within 60 days of planned
                  first administration of vaccine

               2. physical examination and laboratory tests within 1 year

               3. previous chest radiograph and electrocardiogram

          8. Be medically cleared for participation by an investigator. (Examinations and/or tests
             may be repeated at the discretion of the enrolling physician.)

          9. Be willing to return for all follow-up visits.

         10. Agree to report any adverse events (AEs) that may or may not be associated with
             administration of the vaccine for at least 28 days after administration and agree to
             report all serious adverse events (for example, resulting in hospitalization) for the
             duration of the subject's participation in the study.

         11. Agree to defer blood, bone marrow, and organ donation for 1 year after receipt of the
             vaccine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have completed previous WEE vaccine study as a nonresponder (PRNT80 &lt; 1:40).

          2. Have clinically significant abnormal laboratory results (including evidence of
             hepatitis C, hepatitis B carrier state) or elevated liver function tests (two times
             the normal range or at the discretion of the PI).

          3. Have a personal history of an immunodeficiency or received treatment with an
             immunosuppressive medication, such as systemically administered glucocorticoids (eg,
             prednisone) within 1 month before planned administration of the vaccine or with other
             immunosuppressive therapies within 6 months of planned administration of the vaccine.
             Other immunosuppressive therapies include all cancer chemotherapeutic agents, drugs to
             prevent transplant rejection, interferons, monoclonal antibodies, protein kinase
             inhibitors, methotrexate, TNF (tumor necrosis factor) inhibitors, and any other drug
             determined to be immunosuppressive by the PI. Current administration of topical,
             inhalational, or intranasal glucocorticoids is not excluded.

          4. Have a confirmed HIV infection (antibody positivity).

          5. Have a positive pregnancy test or be a breastfeeding female.

          6. Have any known allergies to components of the vaccine:

             formaldehyde eggs neomycin sulfate human serum albumin sodium bisulfite

          7. Have administration of another vaccine or investigational product within 28 days of
             WEE vaccination.

          8. Have any unresolved AE resulting from a previous immunization.

          9. A medical condition that, in the judgment of the PI, would impact subject safety.
