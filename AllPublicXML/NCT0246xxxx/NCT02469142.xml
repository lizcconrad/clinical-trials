    <textblock>
      Incarcerated inguinal hernia is one of the common acute abdomen abdominal surgery, often
      prone to intestinal necrosis and acute peritonitis.Using traditional tension hernia
      reparation, the recurrence rate were as high as 30%. In recent years, biological materials
      especially acellular matrix materials (Acellular Dermal Matrix, ADM) in resisting the
      infection, has become a research hotspot. In the project, the investigators try to address
      the role of ADM in incarcerated inguinal hernia patients.
