      Assess the Efficacy of HUEXC030 as Add-on Excipient to Eradicate Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs
      Induced Hepatic Injury ( ATDH ) in Subjects with Pulmonary Tuberculosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug is Isoniazid formulated with HUEXC030 as excipient for eradicating ATDH,
      whereas the reference control is Isoniazid formulated with inactive excipient. Subjects who
      fulfill all the entry criteria and have written informed consent will be enrolled to the
      study. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive study drug or reference
      control drug. Subjects will be genotyped according to a selected panel of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and categorized into high risk or low risk groups for occurring ATDH via
      a specific haplotype consists of CYP2E1 and NAT2 SNPs. Based on an extensive study result
      during 2007 to 2011,the estimated frequency for patients bearing high risk genotypes in
      Taiwanese population is around 25%. Approximately 352 subjects will be enrolled for genotype
      screening in order to recruit 88 high risk subjects for each of 44 subjects in the
      intervention and control arms.

      Subjects who are stratified as high risk groups will be administered the test drug or
      reference control drugs oral daily for 6 months or until treatment completion, i.e.
      bacteriologically confirmed negative of active M. tuberculosis. Subjects who are of low risk
      genotype will be removed from study after 8 weeks of study treatment, then return to
      conventional TB medication under the care of their investigator for at least one follow-up
      visit at 4 weeks after the End of Study.
