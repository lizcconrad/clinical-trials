    <textblock>
      The Decisional Capacity and Informed Consent in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) project is for the
      Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health &amp; Human Development,
      1R01HD071987-01A1, and will provide the first comprehensive description of decisional
      capacity of individuals with FXS; identify individual, family, and experiential factors
      associated with variability in decisional capacity; determine the validity of caregiver and
      expert ratings; and develop evidence-based guidelines for categorizing decisional capacity of
      individuals with FXS. RTI will develop a methodologically rigorous and conceptually grounded
      decision aid using digital technology to enhance participation of individuals with FXS in the
      consent process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FXS is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability (ID). The typical male has
      an IQ of 50 to 55, but involvement ranges from mild to severe. Females are generally less
      affected and have a broader range in function. Some have severe ID and adaptive impairments,
      but most have a normal or borderline intellectual ability. This wide range in cognitive
      skills leads to variable ability to make choices and live independently. Most research on
      individuals with FXS has been noninvasive, limited to parent surveys and psychological
      assessments. Studies such as these evoke few if any major ethical concerns, so the consent
      process typically involves a straightforward parental consent. Some studies have drawn blood,
      collected saliva, measured heart rate, or used neuroimaging, but until recently there has
      been a paucity of treatment research. This scenario has changed dramatically in the past
      several years. Advances in understanding the molecular basis of FXS have led to a new
      generation of treatments, and clinical trials are under way using a variety of compounds. The
      possibility of side effects and the potential for significant changes in behavior and ability
      elevate to a new level the importance of obtaining meaningful consent, not only from parents,
      but also from individuals with FXS. Researchers and Institutional Review Board (IRB) members
      need data to guide decisions about involving individuals with FXS in the consent process.
      Unfortunately, little is known about the extent to which individuals with FXS can be or are
      involved in decisions about research participation. This project will assess the range of
      decisional capacity in FXS, identify factors associated with individual differences in
      decisional capacity, validate a rating scale for categorizing decisional capacity, and
      develop a novel tablet-based decision aid technology to assist researchers and clinicians in
      maximizing decisional capacity and consent. This study will work toward achieving two
      overarching aims: 1) Characterize and explain individual differences in decisional capacity
      in FXS, 2) Design and evaluate the effect of a tablet-based decision aid on participation in
      the consent process for a hypothetical clinical trial. Ultimately, this study will provide
      important information about the nature of decisional capacity in FXS and validate a novel
      intervention to maximize successful participation in the consent process.

    <description>This will only include individuals who took part in the Aim 1 assessments. The sample size will be approximately 75 or more; however, eligibility and travel will play a role in how many we can feasibly conduct. Siblings will be eligible to participate so long as testing is done separately. The Aim 1 team members will provide an estimate of decisional capacity based on an individual's performance on the MacCAT flip chart and in consideration of the other assessments. Those in the first 3 categories will be eligible for the randomized control trial but those in the fourth category will not.</description>

    <description>Paper-based informed consent form will be sent to participant and family before data collection visit. They will be able to review as many times as they wish before visit. During visits, simplified overview of informed consent form will be provided in person just once. For MacCAT Questions, All questions will be asked after the disclosure information has been presented. Questions will have the same wording as experimental condition. Procedures will mimic MacCAT/flipchart (incorrect or partial credit will be given opportunity to answer question again after disclosure information is repeated). There will be multiple choice options rather than open-ended. Finally, data collection will be done through paper and pencil.</description>

    <description>Paper informed consent form will be sent to participant and family before data collection visit. They will be able to review as many times as they wish before visit. During visits, the participant can go through the tablet-based tool up to 3 times. All questions will be embedded within the vignettes/presentation of disclosure information. Question will use simplified wording, similar to flipchart. Procedures will mimic MacCAT/flipchart (incorrect or partial credit will be given opportunity to answer question again after disclosure information is repeated). Multiple choice options will be utilized rather than open-ended. Finally, response data stored within tool and exported to dataset for analysis.</description>
