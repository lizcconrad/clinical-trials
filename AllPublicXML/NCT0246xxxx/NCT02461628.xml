  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the public health impact of targeted
      antimalarials subsidies through scale-up by determining the community-wide effects of
      targeting an antimalarial subsidy through a partnership between Community Health Volunteers
      (CHVs) and the private retail sector. The primary hypothesis to be tested is that offering a
      fixed-price voucher that reduces the cost for ACT purchase in the retail sector conditional
      on a positive malaria test (targeted subsidy) can improve uptake of testing for malaria and
      will increase the proportion of fevers tested for malaria before treatment. The study will be
      carried out in two sub-counties in Kenya with similar malaria burden but different access to
      health services; the investigators will use a cluster-randomized design to assign community
      units (CUs) in each sub-county to either an intervention or control arm. CHVs will be trained
      to use malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to diagnose malaria in household members with
      documented or reported fever; households in intervention CUs will be informed of the
      intervention and encouraged to contact the CHV for any febrile illness in the home. There are
      minimal risks associated with receiving an RDT. Households with a positive RDT will be given
      a serialized voucher that will entitle the holder to purchase a quality assured ACT in the
      retail sector at a reduced, fixed price. The primary and secondary outcome measures will be
      compared at baseline and 12 months post-baseline through population-based surveying.
      Population-based surveying conducted at 6 months and 18 months post-baseline will provide
      additional information. The primary aim is to determine whether there is significant
      difference between the 2 study arms in the proportion of clients with fever who are tested
      prior to any treatment after adjusting for relevant covariates.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is to compare the percent of fevers that receive a malaria test from any source between the intervention and control arms. While the outcome will be measured in three population-based cross-sectional surveys (6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline), the primary endpoint will be evaluated at 12 months post-baseline. Additional information will be provided by the 6-month and 18-month timepoints.</description>

    <description>The main secondary outcome is the percent of all ACTs used that were taken by people with a malaria positive test. While the outcome will be measured in three population-based cross-sectional surveys (6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline), this endpoint will be evaluated at 12 months post-baseline. Additional information will be provided by the 6-month and 18-month timepoints.</description>

    <description>The percent of people for whom a fever was reported that report receiving correct treatment with regards to malaria (i.e., received an RDT test and took ACTs if the result was positive, or did not take ACTs if the test result was negative). While the outcome will be measured in three population-based cross-sectional surveys (6, 12, and 18 months post-baseline), this endpoint will be evaluated at 12 months post-baseline.
