      This study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of rhGM-CSF as adjuvant immunotherapy
      for patients with resectable stage III colon cancers. Patients were randomly assigned to
      rhGM-CSF group or placebo group and treated with rhGM-CSF or placebo perioperation and during
      the adjuvant chemotherapy. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the antitumor immune
      effect of rhGM-CSF before surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy through DFS of 5 years and to
      observe the safety during the treatment in order to provide evidence for improvement in
      treating resectable colon cancer patients.
