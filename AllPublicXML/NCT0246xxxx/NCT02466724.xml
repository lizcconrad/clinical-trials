  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and life threatening condition that will affect one in
      thirteen individuals. Colonoscopy is the most commonly used procedure to identify colorectal
      malignancies or precancerous lesions at an earlier stage, which affords an opportunity for
      cure. However, low level of bowel cleanliness hinders polyp detection and therefore can limit
      colonoscopy effectiveness. Historically, the majority of the studies have focused on
      pharmacological factors to optimize bowel preparation quality. Recently, non-pharmacological
      factors have been found to have significant increases in bowel preparation quality. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of web-based instructions vs. the
      historical phone/letter instructions given to patients planning to have a colonoscopy.

      This study is a prospective randomized trial. Four hundred and fifty consecutive eligible
      patients will be randomized to ideally have two hundred and twenty five patients in each arm.
      Those who will have traditional paper based instructions and those who will be using an
      online system. Both groups will receive their instructions by the research assistant prior to
      leaving the office after being consented. The paper based instructions will be given as a
      handout and those in the online group will receive their bowel preparation instructions via
      an email sent by a scheduling assistant
