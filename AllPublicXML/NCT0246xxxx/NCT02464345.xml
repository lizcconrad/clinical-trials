  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a new integrated therapy, namely a Healthy Approach to
      weIght management and Food in Eating Disorders (HAPIFED). HAPIFED is an enhanced behavioral
      weight loss therapy integrated with CBT for the management of EDs. HAPIFED uses CBT to treat
      ED behaviors and body image distress, whilst simultaneously emphasize a healthy lifestyle,
      the role of food and physical activity in mood regulation, and revised but clinically
      meaningful goals for weight loss. The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) that will compare HAPIFED to CBT-E in people with obesity and either BN or BED. The two
      main aims will be to reduce symptoms of ED and to improve weight management. The RCT will be
      conducted in Sydney and in São Paulo with a one year follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In sum, a new approach in management of the increasing numbers of obese people with BN and
      BED is needed. The investigators propose a RCT that will compare a novel therapy HAPIFED with
      the current 'gold-standard' trans diagnostic treatment, CBT-E. HAPIFED has been developed by
      the CIs and is based on recent developments in psychological approaches to obesity in general
      (as highlighted in Casazza et al.'s (2013) paper on &quot;Myths, presumptions and facts about
      obesity&quot;) and in people with co-morbid obesity and BN or BED. Unlike CBT-E, it allows reduced
      energy intake and education around specific food choices - a necessary element in weight
      loss.

    <description>HAPIFED is adapted from CBT to promote a positive relationship with food, eating and activity, appetite awareness, and weight loss to be achieved over a longer and more intensive period of therapy, thus recognizing the importance of longer-term therapy in weight loss (Casazza et al., 2013). Notably, HAPIFED is also multidisciplinary. Clinical practice and consensus views are to utilize the special expertise of dietitians and other allied health professionals (Robinson, 2009).</description>
