  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, Phase 1, single center study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells as a treatment for chronic Underactive Bladder.

      Subject that meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be consented and enrolled in this
      study. Initial screening includes blood and urine testing, questionnaires, physical
      examination, specialized bladder function testing and review of medical history. At the next
      visit a small sample of each subject's own thigh muscle is obtained by needle biopsy. This
      cell biopsy is sent to a specialized lab for growth and processing. Approximately ten weeks
      later the frozen cells will be sent back to the treatment site for thawing, diluting and
      injection under lighted instrumentation into the subject's bladder wall. The subject will be
      followed for 6 months and at that time may be eligible for a second injection of cells. The
      study doctor will determine if the second injection may be beneficial to the subject. All
      subjects will be followed for up to 24 months. The long term follow-up assessments at 12, 18
      and 24 months will include questionnaires, urine and blood testing, specialized bladder
      function testing and visualizing the inside of the bladder with a lighted instrument (at the
      12 month assessment only).
