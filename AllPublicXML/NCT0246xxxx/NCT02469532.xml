      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational registry to document the baseline, 24-hour
      and 30-day inflammatory response and procedural outcomes out to 12 month follow-up after
      femoropopliteal angioplasty or atherectomy-based revascularization procedures.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational registry to document the baseline, 24-hour
      and 30-day inflammatory response and procedural outcomes out to 12 month follow-up after
      femoropopliteal angioplasty or atherectomy-based revascularization procedures.

        1. To observe the femoropopliteal revascularization outcomes post-angioplasty and/or
           atherectomy and to observe potential correlation between patency outcomes and the levels
           of MCP-1, C-reactive protein and MMP-9 from baseline to 24 hours and 30 days
           post-procedure.

        2. To provide a comparator dataset to the investigational DANCE trial, which has the same
           enrollment criteria as this observational trial but includes the investigational use of
           a local drug therapy to limit inflammation caused by mechanical revascularization.
