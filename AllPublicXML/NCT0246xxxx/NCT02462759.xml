    <textblock>
      The primary objective of Part 1 of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      Nusinersen in participants with SMA who are not eligible to participate in the clinical
      studies ISIS 396443-CS3B (NCT02193074) or ISIS 396443-CS4 (NCT02292537). The secondary
      objective of Part 1 of this study is to examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Nusinersen in
      participants with SMA. The primary objective of Part 2 of this study is to assess the
      long-term safety and tolerability of Nusinersen in participants with SMA who participated in
      Part 1 and completed their End of Part 1 Evaluation assessments. The secondary objective of
      Part 2 of this study is to examine the PK of Nusinersen in participants with SMA who
      participated in Part 1 and completed their End of Part 1 Evaluation assessments.

        For Part 2 only:

        To be eligible to participate in Part 2 of this study, participants must meet the following

        Ability of parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to understand the purpose and risks of the study
        and to provide signed and dated informed consent on the Part 2 informed consent form (ICF)
        and authorization to use confidential health information in accordance with national and
        local participant privacy regulations.

        Able to complete all study procedures, measurements, and visits, and parent or legal
        guardian/participant has adequately supportive psychosocial circumstances, in the opinion
        of the Investigator.

        Participants will be excluded from the Part 2 if they meet the following exclusion
        criterion at the time of consent into Part 2 of the study:

        Any significant change in clinical status, including laboratory tests that, in the opinion
        of the Investigator, would make them unsuitable to participate in Part 2. The Investigator
        must reassess the subject's medical fitness for participation and consider any diseases
        that would preclude treatment.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
