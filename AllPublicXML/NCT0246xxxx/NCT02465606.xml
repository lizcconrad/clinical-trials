      The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the safety of lebrikizumab compared with
      Topical Corticosteroids (TCS) alone in patients with persistent moderate to severe Atopic
      Dermatitis (AD) that is inadequately controlled with TCS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 75 years, inclusive, at the start of the run-in period

          -  AD diagnosed by the Hanifin/Rajka criteria and that has been present for at least 1
             year at screening

          -  Moderate to severe AD as graded by the Rajka/Langeland criteria at screening

          -  History of inadequate response to a &gt;/= 1 month (within the 3 months prior to the
             screening visit) treatment regimen of at least daily TCS and regular emollient for
             treatment of AD

          -  EASI score &gt;/= 14 at screening

          -  IGA score &gt;/= 3

          -  AD involvement of &gt;/= 10% body surface area

          -  Pruritus Visual Analog Scale score &gt;/= 3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past and/or current use of any anti-IL-13 or anti-IL-4/IL-13 therapy, including
             lebrikizumab

          -  Use of an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to screening or within 5
             half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer

          -  Evidence of other skin conditions, including, but not limited to, T-cell lymphoma or
             allergic contact dermatitis

          -  History of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic reaction to a biologic agent or
             known hypersensitivity to any component of the lebrikizumab injection

          -  Use of any complementary, alternative, or homeopathic medicines including, but not
             limited to, phytotherapies, traditional or non-traditional herbal medications,
             essential fatty acids, or acupuncture within 7 days prior to the run-in period or need
             for such medications during the study

          -  Evidence of other skin conditions; including, but not limited to, T-cell lymphoma or
             allergic contact dermatitis

          -  Evidence of, or ongoing treatment (including topical antibiotics) for active skin

          -  Use of a topical calcineurin inhibitor (TCI) at the time of screening, unless the
             patient is willing to stop TCI use during the study (including the run-in period) and,
             in the investigator's opinion, it is safe to do so

          -  Clinically significant abnormality on screening ECG or laboratory tests

          -  Known current malignancy or current evaluation for a potential malignancy, including
             basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years prior to screening, except for appropriately
