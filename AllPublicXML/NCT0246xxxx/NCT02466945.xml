      The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the tolerance and efficacy of dental gel
      V063B-DP3003 in patients with dentinal hypersensitivity, under normal conditions of use,
      under dentist control.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the global oral and dental tolerance of
      the studied product after 28 days of use.

      Some efficacy objectives have been added to observe the efficacy of the dental gel. The
      dentinal hypersensitivity will be evaluated by the investigator with a thermal stimulus on
      two sensitive teeth selected by the investigator.

    <description>The medical device V063B-DP3003 has been developed to relieve and decrease dentinal hypersensitivity in patients by creating a film around the sensitive tooth in order to prevent pain. Application modalities: apply a pea size amount of product (around 0.5g) onto each of the sensitive teeth, 3 times a day, by gentle massage with clean finger after each brushing of teeth. Do not rinse</description>
