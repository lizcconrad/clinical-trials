      Evaluation of the best line of treatment of borderline CBD stones associated with gallbladder
      stones whether by conservative treatment or endoscopic stone extraction as regard complete
      clearance rate of the CBD stones followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The secondary
      outcomes are overall complications related to each approach, technical difficulties and
      conversion rate during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cost benefit relationship of each
      line of treatment.

      Enrolled patients in the study will be randomized to either conservative treatment or ERCP
      and stone extraction. The randomization process will be done using closed envelop method and
      will be withdrawn by a nurse in the outpatient clinic.

        1. Patients in conservative treatment group will receive medical treatment in the form of
           antibiotics, analgesics and antispasmodics for 3 days. These patients will be followed
           up for improvement on the ground of clinical symptoms and serum bilirubin level and
           abdominal US for CBD stones.

             1. Improvement: If the stone spontaneously passes to the duodenum and CBD is clear
                completely from the stones proved by US, the patient will undergo laparoscopic
                cholecystectomy (LC) within 3 days.

             2. No improvement: the patient will undergo ERCP and then LC.

        2. Patients in ERCP group will undergo ERCP and wide papillotomy and stone extraction
           directly then laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) within 3 days.
