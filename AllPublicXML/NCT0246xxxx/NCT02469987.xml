      Double-blind, single-dose, three-treatment, parallel group design PK comparability study of
      MYL-1402O solution manufactured for Mylan compared to US and EU marketed Avastin® solution
      (bevacizumab) in a total of 111 healthy, adult male volunteers (37 subjects per treatment
      arm). After randomization, subjects will receive one of the following treatments: A single 1
      mg/kg dose administered by i.v. infusion (25 mL over approximately 90 minutes) of MYL-1402O,
      an equivalent i.v. infusion of US marketed Avastin® (1 mg/kg), or an equivalent i.v. infusion
      of EU marketed Avastin® (1 mg/kg).
