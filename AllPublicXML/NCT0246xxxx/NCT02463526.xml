    <textblock>
      Participants will be initially assessed for their suitability for inclusion in the study and
      will undergo a physical screening of the affected shoulder and cervical spine by an
      experienced physiotherapist. After, participants will be attended 72 hours after data
      recording of the baseline measures (range of motion with a goniometer, pressure pain
      threshold with a algometer, and peak force with a dynamometer) for four sessions per week
      with 24 hours of interval between sessions. At each experimental week session, each
      participant will receive one of the two treatment conditions (MWM or sham) and then will
      repeats the assessment. In the following week, there will be a crossover condition of each
      individual and 24 hours after the last treatment session, the examiner will do the last
      assessment.

    <description>The treatment condition consists in the application of a posterolateral glide (MWM) in the affected shoulder. Subjects will be seated and the therapist will stay beside the participants on the opposite side to the affected shoulder. One hand will be placed over the scapula posteriorly while the thenar eminence of the other hand will be placed over the humerus head anterior aspect. A posterior glide will be applied to the humeral head. Three sets of 10 repetitions will be applied with a 30 seconds rest interval between each set. Sham condition will replicate treatment condition except for the hand positioning. The therapist will place one hand along the clavicle and the other on the humeral head posterior aspect of the affected shoulder. A simulated anterior glide will be performed.</description>
