    <textblock>
      Non-attendance to out-patient endoscopic procedures is high among underserved blacks. The
      overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of directly involving a social
      contact (chosen by the patient) on completion and quality of out-patient endoscopy
      recommended for the patient by his/her primary care physician, or after scheduling by the
      gastrointestinal endoscopist.

      Improved adherence and better quality of procedures are postulated with involvement of social
      contacts.

      The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine whether directly involving a social
      contact, chosen by the patient, will improve the completion and quality of scheduled
      out-patient endoscopy among blacks.

      These are three sub-projects:

      Project 1: Involves recruiting 400 patients referred for colonoscopy by their primary care
      physicians

      Project 2: Involves recruiting 400 patients scheduled for colonoscopy by their endoscopist

      Project 3: Involves recruiting 200 patients scheduled for upper endoscopy by their
      endoscopists
