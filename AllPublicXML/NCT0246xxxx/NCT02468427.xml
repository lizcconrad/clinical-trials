  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective, randomized Trial, the investigators compare Hands-on teaching and frontal
      teaching using a Training Video for learning how to perform an assisted delivery by vacuum
      extraction on a pelvic Training model. Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills
      (OSATS) scores are the primary outcome. The investigators hypothesize that Hands-on Training
      is superior to a video-teaching with regard to the OSATS scores achieved by the Trainees.

      The optimal mode of Training surgical novices how to perform an assisted delivery by means of
      vacuum extraction is unknown. We prospectively randomize probands to a 30 min hands-on (group
      1) and a 30 min demonstration (group 2) training session teaching a standardized vacuum
      Extraction (VE) algorithm scheme on a pelvic training model. Probands are tested with a 24
      item Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) scoring system after
      training and 48 hours, and 72 hours thereafter. OSATS scores are the primary outcome.
      Performance time (PT), self assessment (SA), confidence (CON), and global rating scale (GRS)
      are the secondary outcomes. Statistics will beperformed using Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square
      test, and multivariable logistic regression analysis.
