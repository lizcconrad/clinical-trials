      This study compares the effects of a one-month diet high in saturated fat (SF), glycemic
      index (GI), and salt (Na+) to a diet low in these nutritional parameters on memory and other
      cognitive functions, on MRI measures of brain structure, function, and perfusion, as well as
      on blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ), insulin, lipids (total
      cholesterol, HDL, LDL, oxidized LDL, and triglycerides), cytokines, apolipoprotein E (ApoE),
      apolipoprotein J, cortisol, soluble low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (sLRP),
      and glucose in middle-aged adults (45-65 years of age) with normal cognition or mild
      cognitive impairment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will be middle-aged (45 to 65 years of age) and will fall on the continuum
             from healthy (no pre-hypertension or insulin resistance) to pre-hypertensive and
             insulin resistant (pHAIR).

          2. Subjects will not be recruited based on memory status but will have normal memory or
             memory impairment with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Those subjects
             with MCI will have been assessed by physician and neuropsychologist experts and
             diagnosed with MCI according to Petersen criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetes not controlled by diet or exercise; current or previous use of diabetes
             medications

             pressure &lt;60, or current use of anti-hypertensive medications;

          3. Clinically significant elevations in liver function tests as follows: SGOT &gt; 1.5 X
             ULN, SGPT &gt; 1.5 X ULN, Alkaline Phosphate &gt; 1.5 ULN.

          4. Clinically significant elevations in lipid profile as follows: LDL&gt;190,
