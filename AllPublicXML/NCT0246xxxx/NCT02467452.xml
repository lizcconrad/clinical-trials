             (according to GOLD document updated 2014).

          3. Current smokers or ex-smokers who quit smoking at least 6 months prior to screening
             visit, with a smoking history of at least 10 pack years [pack-years = (number of

             production/purulence), from the stable state and beyond normal day-to-day variations,
             that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medication in a patient
             with underlying COPD that includes prescriptions of systemic corticosteroids and/or
             antibiotics or need for hospitalization&quot;. Also documented visits to an emergency
             department due to COPD exacerbation are considered acceptable to fulfil this

               1. A course of systemic steroids longer than 3 days for COPD exacerbation in the 4
                  weeks prior to screening

               2. A course of antibiotics for COPD exacerbation longer than 7 days in the 4 weeks
                  prior to screening

               3. phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors in the 4 weeks prior to screening

             antibiotics or hospitalization during the run-in period

          5. Patients treated with non-cardio selective β-blockers in the month preceding the
             screening visit or during the run-in period. Those patients may enter the study after
