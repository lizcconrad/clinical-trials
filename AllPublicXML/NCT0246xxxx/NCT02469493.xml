      The purpose of this study is to compare the preventive effect of electroacupuncture and sham
      acupuncture on acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and then investigate its
      potential mechanism by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).

    <description>The needles used were Huatuo brand (Suzhou, China) sterile disposable stainless steel filiform; needles sized 0.25*25 mm. After disinfection, needles were inserted 0.5 to 0.8 inches into the skin and were manipulated manually to obtain Deqi. An electric stimulator (Huatuo SDZ-V, Suzhou, China) was connected to the needles and delivered a constant-current, 0.2-ms, density-wave, stimulus of 2 to 10-Hz frequency, level of intensity was as much as tolerable, but not painful to the subjects. The needles were left for 30 minutes and then removed.</description>
