      To evaluate the long-term safety of SPD489 administered as a daily morning dose (5, 10, 15,
      20, and 30 mg/day) in preschool children diagnosed with Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD). Participants will be enrolled into this study from antecedent study

    <description>Sleep patterns will include sleep diary data and children's sleep habits questionnaire (CSHQ), which is a parent report questionnaire designed to screen for the most common sleep problems in children, and consists of 33 items for scoring and several extra items intended to provide administrators with other potentially useful information about respondents. The instrument evaluates the child's sleep based on behavior within 8 different sub scales: bedtime resistance, sleep-onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <description>C-SSRS is a semi-structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior occurred. The C-SSRS contains 2 required items pertaining to suicidal ideation, 4 required items pertaining to suicidal behavior, and 1 required item pertaining to non-suicidal but self-injurious behavior. In situations where there is a positive response to the screening questions, there are 8 additional suicidal ideation items and 4 additional suicidal behavior items which are completed. Thus, there is a maximum of 19 items to be completed.</description>

    <description>ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version was adapted from the ADHD Rating Scale-IV and provides examples appropriate for the developmental level of preschool children. The ADHD-RS-IV Preschool Version is an 18-item questionnaire that requires the respondent to rate the frequency of occurrence of ADHD symptoms as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (never or rarely) to 3 (very often) with total scores ranging from 0-54. The 18 items may be grouped into 2 subscales: hyperactivity/impulsivity (even numbered items 2-18) and inattentiveness (odd numbered items 1-17).</description>
