      The purpose of this study is to measure the treatment satisfaction after switching to
      mirabegron in patient with Overactive Bladder(OAB) who were unsatisfied with efficacy of
      antimuscarinic therapy or adverse event.

      Patient will take the mirabegron 50mg/day for 12 weeks, and the satisfation of the therapy
      will be measured with Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire(TSQ), Global Response
      Assessment(GRA), OAB-q short form, OAB Symptom Score and Willingness to continue Questions.
