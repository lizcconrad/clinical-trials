      To determine the safety of the approach of giving RUXOLITINIB before and after an autologous
      stem cell transplant, as measured by graft failure or death.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, single arm, single center study with no stratification to assess the safety
      (measured by graft failure or death) and feasibility (measured by adequacy of stem cell
      collection) of combining ruxolitinib with autologous Hematopoeitic Stem Cell Transplantation
      (HSCT) in patients with advanced myelofibrosis (MF). Patients will receive a short course of
      ruxolitinib prior to and during mobilization of HSCT with Filgrastim. Conditioning for the
      autologous HSCT will consist of Bulsulfan. Post-transplant patients will receive ruxolitinib
      maintenance.

    <description>Ruxolitinib, Jakafi ®, will be given orally at standard dose daily for 16 weeks pre ASCT and up to 3 months post-ASCT for 10 patients (allowing for 2 additional screen failures). Patients will restart ruxolitinib at 100 days after the ASCT as long as their platelet count is at least 50 x103. For patients whose platelet count is below 50 x103 at day 100, ruxolitinib should be restarted once platelet count reaches 50 x103. The dose of ruxolitinib can be titrated up as per clinical guidelines. PBSC mobilization will include G-CSF 10 mcg/kg/day. HDC for ASCT will consist of IV busulfan 2.0 mg/KBW once daily x 4 for days -5 to -2.</description>
