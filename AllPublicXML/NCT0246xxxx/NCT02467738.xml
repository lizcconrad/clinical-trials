  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies cesium Cs 131 brachytherapy in treating patients with head
      and neck cancer that has come back (recurrent) and can be removed by surgery. Brachytherapy,
      also known as internal radiation therapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or
      near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Radioactive drugs, such as cesium Cs 131, may carry
      radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Permanently implanting cesium Cs
      131 into the wound bed after surgery may help treat microscopic cancer cells that may be in
      the tissue after surgical removal of the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the impact of cesium 131 (cesium Cs 131) on recurrence rate, disease free survival
      and over all survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess complications associated with cesium 131 treatment in subjects with head and neck
      cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo brachytherapy using cesium Cs 131 during surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis: Subjects with a diagnosis of recurrent head and neck cancer

          2. Based on clinical and radiographic evidence the tumor needs to be deemed resectable
             preoperatively

          3. Age: Subjects must be ≥ 18 years of age and ≤ 90 years old

          4. Informed Consent: All subjects must be able to comprehend and sign a written informed
             consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are pregnant or may become pregnant

          2. Unresectable tumor

          3. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation, and in the judgment of the investigator
             would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study
