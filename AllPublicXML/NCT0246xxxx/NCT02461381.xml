  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to estimate sensitivities and specificities of diabetic cardiovascular
      autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) diagnostic tests using the Bayesian approach without a gold
      standard in another independence dataset.The reference the values for the short-term HRV were
      calculated in the investigators' previous study (including 371 healthy subjects). This study
      dataset contained 200 diabetic patients who completed both the short-term HRV test and
      Ewing's test. Simultaneous inferences about the population prevalence and the performance of
      each diagnostic test were possible using the Bayesian approach without a gold standard.

      The CAN prevalence is rapidly growing in all populations worldwide. No document has been
      reported diagnostic performance of short-term heart rate variability (HRV) for diabetic
      cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (DCAN) in the Chinese population. This study aimed to
      estimate sensitivities and specificities of DCAN diagnostic tests using the Bayesian
      approach, in the absence of a gold standard in another independence dataset.The reference the
      values for the short-term HRV were calculated in the investigators' previous study (including
      371 healthy subjects). This study dataset contained 200 subjects who completed both the
      short-term HRV test and Ewing's test. Simultaneous inferences about the population prevalence
      and the performance of each diagnostic test were possible using the Bayesian approach without
      a gold standard.

        Diabetic patients with inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited from healthy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Survey diabetic participants with undiagnosed CAN, aged 30-90 years, were included in
             this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Some subjects were excluded from the study to eliminate potential confounding factors
             that may have influenced their CA function. Briefly, the exclusion criteria were as
             follows:

               1. history or findings of arrhythmia, and hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism;

               2. pregnancy or lactation; and/or

               3. serious hepatic or renal dysfunctions.
