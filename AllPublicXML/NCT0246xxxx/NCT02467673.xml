  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to asses the effects of micronized (MIC) and nanoparticulate (NANO)
      transdermal hormone therapy (THT) on blood pressure, ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein
      (CRP), and cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open label study, 27 postmenopausal women, with no clinical evidence of
      cardiovascular disease, were randomly divided in two groups.

      During 12 weeks,

      15 patients received on the left forearm micronized (MIC) THT (micronized 17β-estradiol 2.5
      mg/day + progesterone 100 mg/day).

      and

      14 patients received a nanoparticulate (NANO) THT (nanoparticulate 17β-estradiol 2.5 mg/day +
      progesterone 100mg/day).

      After 12 weeks of treatment patients were evaluated.

      Baseline and Post-THT measures were determined: Insulin, body mass index, waist
      circumference, blood pressure, CRP-stratified levels, total testosterone, TSH and FSH levels.

    <description>The Blood samples are collected from the subjects early in the morning after an overnight fast. After serum testing, the identification hormone deficiencies, was determined and then, if necessary, additional transdermal nanostructured estradiol and progesterone is prescribed.
The patients are evaluated 3 months after THRT treatment protocol. All the patients were instructed about how to use the pump for transdermal application, the first application is performed in the presence of an experienced physician, in order to guarantee standardization and correct use of the THRT. Compliance was defined as completing seventy percent or more of the transdermal applications.</description>
