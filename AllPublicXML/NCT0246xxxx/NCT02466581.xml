  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international (Nordic) trial designed to compare the safety and efficacy of active
      conventional therapy (ACT) and three biologic treatments (Certolizumab-pegol, Abatacept or
      Tocilizumab) in subjects with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The global aim of this study
      is to assess and compare two alternative de-escalation strategies in patients who achieved
      low disease activity during first-line therapy in the NORD-STAR study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has been enrolled in the NORD-STAR study according to that study inclusion
             criteria (and did not meet any of the exclusion criteria in that study).

          2. Subject has low-disease-activity according to: 2.8 &lt; CDAI ≤ 10.0, from week 56 in the
             NORD-STAR study, i.e. during 24 weeks before randomization.

          3. Subject has not more than 3 tender out of the 28 joints.

          4. According to the investigators opinion the remaining findings are not due to
             significant active disease (RA).

          5. Female subject is either not of childbearing potential (postmenopausal, surgically
             sterile etc.), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of the following

               -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

               -  Contraceptives (oral, parenteral, patch) for three months prior to study drug
