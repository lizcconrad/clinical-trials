  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending (SAD), and multiple
      ascending dose (MAD) study conducted at a single clinical site within the UK. Healthy male
      and female subjects (on non-child bearing potential) will be enrolled to investigate single
      inhaled doses of molgramostim at 3 dose levels (Part 1) and multiple inhaled doses at 2 dose
      levels (Part 2). The 2 doses in the multiple ascending dose regimens will be administered
      once daily (QD) for 6 consecutive days. The clinical indication for inhaled molgramostim is
      the treatment of respiratory diseases such as aPAP, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis. The
      Clinical trial will involve 42 healthy participants. The trial is expected to last
      approximately 4 months.
