  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot single arm study with the primary endpoints of feasibility and preliminary
      estimates of safety and efficacy. This protocol builds on over 25 years of experience with
      high dose liver RT (Radiation Therapy), and in particular adaptive RT aimed at adjusting the
      global radiation dose based on a patient's measured sensitivity to treatment. This current
      protocol uses functional imaging and specialized radiation planning techniques to spare
      highly functional portions of the liver to preserve function. The investigators feel this
      will further improve the safety and efficacy of RT for all patients by customizing treatments
      to each. If this approach is promising, the investigators will proceed to a phase II
      randomized study of standard versus spatially and dosimetrically adapted RT.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is local control, measured as the time to progression of the treated lesion. Patients with no evidence of local progression at the time of data analysis will be censored at the last date on which they were evaluated for local progression. Local progression will be summarized with Kaplan-Meier curves and reported with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have hepatocellular carcinoma.

          -  Patients must not have extrahepatic cancer.

          -  Patients must not be eligible for a curative liver resection or have refused resection

          -  Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of prior liver-directed therapy
             and 4 weeks must have passed since the last procedure and protocol therapy.

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of less than or equal to 2 (Zubrod
             performance status is a measure that attempts to quantify a cancer patients' general
             well-being. Scores run from 0 to 5 where 0 denotes normal activity and 5 denotes
             death).

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function.

          -  Patients must understand and be willing to sign an IRB (Institutional Review Board)
             approved informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known allergies to intravenous iodinated contrast agents.

          -  Patients with a contraindication to contrast-enhanced MRI are excluded.
