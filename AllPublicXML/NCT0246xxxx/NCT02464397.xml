    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare vascular healing of the stented segment after
      deployment of titanium-nitride-oxide coated cobalt-chromium OPTIMAX™ bio-active stent (BAS)
      and SYNERGY™ everolimus-eluting stent (EES) in patients with acute coronary syndromes
      requiring percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Patients treated with BAS will be treated with DAPT for at least 4 weeks after the procedure
      followed by aspirin alone, while patients in the EES group will be treated with DAPT, at
      least for 6 months post procedure. In addition, this study will collect initial information
      about the safety and effectiveness of the BAS in comparison with EES group at 30 days, 6
      months, and 12 months.

    <textblock>
      OPTIMAX-OCT is a prospective, randomized (1:1), study that will be conducted at 2-3 sites
      (Finland, Belgium) to evaluate OPTIMAX-BAS vascular healing patterns and thrombus formation
      with OCT at one (Study A) and six (Study B) month after stent implantation in comparison with
      SYNERGY-EES. Patients receiving BAS will receive dual antiplatelet treatment (DAPT) for at
      least four weeks followed by aspirin, while patients implanted with EES, will receive DAPT
      for at least 6 months followed by aspirin.

      Patients will be randomized to study A and B as follow:

      Study A: OPTIMAX-BAS (n=25) versus SYNERGY-EES (n=25). First 50 patients will be randomized
      to study A. OCT at 1 month follow up.

      Study B: OPTIMAX-BAS (n=30) versus SYNERGY-EES (n=30) Following 60 patients will be
      randomized to study B. OCT at 6 months follow up.

      Randomization is used at the time of recruitment with sealed envelopes. Patients will be
      randomized in 1:1 fashion. First 50 patients are randomized in study A and following 60
      patients in study B. Patients in study A will have OCT follow up at 1 month after index
      procedure and patients in study B will have OCT at 6 months.

      OCT analyses will be performed blinded to patient's characteristics as well as the type of
      the stent used.

      Two (2-3) investigational sites:

        -  Cardiovascular Center Aalst, Aalst, Belgium

        -  Heart Center, Satakunta Central Hospital, Pori, Finland
