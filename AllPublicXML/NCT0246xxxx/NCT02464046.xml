  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of JNJ-42847922 (change versus
      placebo) on sleep efficiency (SE) measured by polysomnography (PSG) after single and multiple
      dose administration to participants with insomnia disorder without psychiatric comorbidity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      placebo-controlled, double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the identity of the
      assigned treatment), 2-way cross-over study of JNJ-42847922 participants with insomnia
      disorder without psychiatric comorbidity. The study consists of following phases: screening
      (28 days prior to Day 1), a double-blind treatment phase (consists of 5-day treatments,
      either JNJ-42847922 or placebo in subsequent 2-treatment periods, each separated with washout
      period of 5 to 9 days), and a follow-up examination (7 to 14 days after last dose
      administration). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

How long were you awake after initial sleep onset until you finally got out of bed (Wake After Sleep Onset); 4. How often did you awake during the night (how many times); 5. How did you rate the quality of the night sleep (1= extremely bad 10 =excellent).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Night 5</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
