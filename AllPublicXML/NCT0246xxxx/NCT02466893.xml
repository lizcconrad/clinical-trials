  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration has been shown to be safe
      and effective for treatment of AIS within 3 hours of symptom onset, and newer evidence has
      shown potential benefit out to 4.5 hours. Mechanical thrombectomy for AIS patients has been
      shown in clinical trials to be safe up to 8 hours after symptom onset. Recent trials
      utilizing advanced imaging to identify patients with large vessel occlusions amenable to
      intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) have shown superiority endovascular therapy over medical
      therapy to result in improved patient functional outcomes. Pilot data utilizing the ADAPT
      approach has shown superior technical results with similar functional outcomes while lowering
      procedure time and device costs versus traditional stent retriever as a first line therapy
      approaches

      This is a prospective, randomized trial comparing mechanical thrombectomy with the ADAPT
      approach to stent retrievers in patients presenting with AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset.
      Any cleared mechanical stent retriever (SR) or aspiration catheter device that is in common
      use in the operator's region of practice is approved for use. Prior to releasing any sites to
      enroll patients, we will collect the following information on the most recent 20 acute
      ischemic stroke cases, at least five of which must have used direct aspiration as a first
      approach, and at least five of which must have used stent retrievers as a first approach. It
      is permissible to go back in time farther than the most recent 20 cases to fulfill either or
      both of these requirements. There is no requirement for the remaining 10 cases. The
      datapoints to be collected include:

        -  Age

        -  Gender

        -  LVO location

        -  Side of LVO

        -  NIHSS at presentation

        -  Time of onset

        -  Time of hospital arrival

        -  Time imaging completed

        -  Time of groin puncture

        -  Time of revascularization, if applicable

        -  Time procedure terminated, if revascularization was not obtained

        -  tPA given pre-procedure

        -  Time of IV-tPA

        -  Imaging type

        -  Perfusion imaging

        -  Devices used

        -  Passes attempted

        -  Device success

        -  Standard and modified final TICI scores

        -  Outcome measurements: incidence of post-op ICH, discharge and 90 day NIHSS, discharge
           and 90 day mRS, any and all complications Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion
           criteria, consent to participate, and who are randomized will be considered enrolled.
           Treatment arm will be randomly assigned by a central web-based system in a 1:1 manner to
           treatment with either ADAPT or SR thrombectomy. Data on each patient will be collected
           at the time of enrollment and treatment, and at subsequent follow-up visits.

    <description>The primary objective is to show that AIS patients, with appropriate image selection, treated with ADAPT mechanical thrombectomy approach within 6 hours of symptom onset do not have inferior clinical outcomes to those treated with a first-line stent retriever approach with 90-day global disability assessed via the modified Rankin Scale score (mRS), analyzed using success criteria as mRS 0 to 2.</description>

    <description>If the patient is randomized to mechanical thrombectomy, the groin puncture to initiate the procedure should occur within 1 hour of the clinical imaging used to determine trial candidacy. An introducer sheath will be placed in the femoral artery. Diagnostic angiography is initially performed via the transfemoral approach with catheterization of the carotid artery appropriate to the patient's presenting symptoms. Once thrombus in the appropriate vessel is identified, the thrombectomy procedure will be initiated.</description>
