      This study evaluates the impact of active thermoregulation on free flap microcirculation
      following free flap transfer. Thermoregulation is performed by passive warming, active
      warming (water circulation based device) and active cooling. Changes in microcirculation are
      assessed using combined laser Doppler flowmetry and remission spectroscopy.

      Measurements are conducted at the day of the operation as well as the first three days
      following the operation. Tissue temperature is assessed by a temperature measurement probe
      that is placed 8 mm underneath the skin. The microcirculation parameters of free perforator
      flaps are assessed using combined laser Doppler flowmetry and remission spectroscopy (O2C®).
      This allows non-invasive measurement of blood flow, capillary venous oxygen saturation and
      relative postcapillary filling pressure using a fiber optic probe that is placed on the flap
      surface. Controlled Thermoregulation (between 10 and 38°C) is enabled using a water
      circulation based system (Hilotherm Clinic®).
