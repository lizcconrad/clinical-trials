    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a new physical
      activity technology (Jintronix) based on TV screen, virtual games and motion sensing cameras
      among pre-disabled older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 12 older adults will be recruited in the Oak Hammock residential community to
      participate in a physical activity program using a new technology called Jintronix. Jintronix
      is an easy-to-use virtual physical activity platform designed for physical and occupational
      therapy. It combines common exercise movements, virtual games and motion sensing cameras to
      offer a fun and effective tool for physical activity. The exercises will be performed by each
      participant autonomously in the living room of the residential community following a specific
      schedule. The duration of the exercise program will be of 30 minutes for two days a week for
      a total of four weeks. The participants will be trained prior the beginning of the program in
      order to enter autonomously in the Jintronix platform and perform the exercises.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Movements' Total Average Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of movements' score is a measure of feasibility. The quality of movement's score is automatically calculated by Jintronix for each participant at the end of the intervention program with Jintronix.
A quality of movement's score of 100% means that the participant performed the exercise perfectly.
To calculate the quality of movements' total average score for the Group (made of 12 participants), we summed the quality of movements' score for each participants and divided it for 12. We expected to find a total average quality movements' score&gt;80% in order to say that Jintronix was feasible.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Average Time in Performing Exercises With Jintronix.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant has to perform the exercise program with Jintronix for 30 minutes per session, for 2 times/week for a total of 4 weeks.
This means that each participant has to be able to perform a maximum of 240 minutes of exercises for 4 weeks.
Jintronix calculated automatically the time (minutes) in performing the exercises for each participant at the end of the 4 weeks of intervention.
As a measure of acceptability we calculated the total average time in performing the exercises for the 12 participants for 4 weeks by summing the minutes in performing the exercises for each participants for 4 week and dividing it for 12.
We expected to find an average total time in performing the exercises for 12 participants &gt; 192 minutes (3.2 hours) out of a total of 240 minutes (4 hours) in order to say that Jintronix was acceptable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Difficulty Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The global difficulty score was another measure of acceptability.
The global difficulty score will be derived from each participant's answer to the second question of a 9-item feasibility questionnaire. The second question of the questionnaire is :&quot;How difficult did you find the Jintronix?&quot;, participants' answer may be:
Very difficult (3 point)
Quite difficult (2 points)
Not at all (1 points)
No difficulty (0 points). This means that the global difficulty score for 12 participants may range from 0 (no difficult) to 36 (very difficult).
We expected to find a global difficulty score &lt; to 15 in order to say that Jintronix was acceptable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Appreciation Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The global appreciation score is a measure of feasibility.
This score will be derived from each participant's answer to the first question of a 9-item acceptability questionnaire. The second question of the questionnaire is :&quot;How much did you like Jintronix?&quot;, participants' answer may be:
I didn't like it (0 point)
A little (1 points)
Moderate (2 points)
A lot (3 points). The global appreciation score is the sum of the points obtained by each participants.
The global appreciation score for 12 participants may range from 0 (no appreciation) to 36 (a lot of appreciation).
In order to say that Jintronix is feasible we expected a global appreciation score for 12 participant after 4 weeks of intervention to be &gt; 24.</description>

          <title>Short Physical Performance Battery score (SPPB)</title>
          <description>The SPPB is a common measure of physical performance in older adults. The test is comprised of timed measures of standing balance in three positions (side by side position, semi tandem position, tandem position), walking speed over 4 meters, and time to stand up and sit down 5 times in a chair, as quickly as possible. Each of the 3 performance measures are assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest level of performance and 0 the inability to complete the test. A summary score was created by adding each performance score and ranges from 0-12.</description>

        <title>Quality of Movements' Total Average Score</title>
        <description>The quality of movements’ score is a measure of feasibility. The quality of movement's score is automatically calculated by Jintronix for each participant at the end of the intervention program with Jintronix.
A quality of movement's score of 100% means that the participant performed the exercise perfectly.
To calculate the quality of movements' total average score for the Group (made of 12 participants), we summed the quality of movements' score for each participants and divided it for 12. We expected to find a total average quality movements' score&gt;80% in order to say that Jintronix was feasible.</description>

        <description>Each participant has to perform the exercise program with Jintronix for 30 minutes per session, for 2 times/week for a total of 4 weeks.
This means that each participant has to be able to perform a maximum of 240 minutes of exercises for 4 weeks.
Jintronix calculated automatically the time (minutes) in performing the exercises for each participant at the end of the 4 weeks of intervention.
As a measure of acceptability we calculated the total average time in performing the exercises for the 12 participants for 4 weeks by summing the minutes in performing the exercises for each participants for 4 week and dividing it for 12.
We expected to find an average total time in performing the exercises for 12 participants &gt; 192 minutes (3.2 hours) out of a total of 240 minutes (4 hours) in order to say that Jintronix was acceptable.</description>

            <description>All the participants enrolled in the study will be part of the physical activity group in which they will perform a scheduled exercise program for 4 weeks using a new physical activity technology called Jintronix.
Jintronix: The participants will perform light exercises using the Jintronix software. Jintronix is an easy-to-use virtual physical activity platform designed for physical and occupational therapy. It combines common exercise movements, virtual games and motion sensing cameras to offer a fun and effective tool for physical activity.</description>
