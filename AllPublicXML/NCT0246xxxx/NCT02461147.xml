  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initial cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram, followed if required by ERCP, has
      been implemented at the investigators institution as the standard management strategy for
      patients at intermediate risk of common bile duct stone migration, following a randomized
      controlled trial previously published by the same investigators team. The aim of this study
      is to prospectively analyze the outcomes of this strategy.

    <textblock>
      A previous randomized controlled trial comparing initial cholecystectomy with intraoperative
      cholangiogram (IOC) versus common bile duct (CBD) assessment and subsequent cholecystectomy
      for patients admitted in the emergency room with an acute gallstone-related condition and
      with an intermediate risk of common bile duct stone was performed by the investigators. This
      study had been registered on Clinicaltrials.gov as well and had shown that a strategy with
      initial cholecystectomy significantly decreased the length of hospital stay and the number of
      CBD investigations procedures.

      Initial cholecystectomy with IOC is now the standard management strategy for these patients
      in the investigators hospital. The goal of this study is to perform a prospective validation
      of this strategy and to analyze if the results obtained in the previously mentioned
      randomized controlled trial are confirmed on a larger patients cohort. This study will be
      observational, since the intervention (initial cholecystectomy) is not assigned by the
      investigators, but is already a standard treatment strategy at our institution.
