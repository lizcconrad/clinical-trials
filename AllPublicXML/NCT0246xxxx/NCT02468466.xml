    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a community-based
      depression-screening program for suicide prevention among middle-aged adults, the
      investigators conducted a quasi-experimental intervention study, using a parallel cluster
      design with communities at municipal level as the unit of allocation and individuals as the
      unit of analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a major cause of premature death, particularly among middle-aged adults, in the
      majority of Western and Asian countries. A strong association of suicide and depression often
      indicates the necessity of a high-risk approach for suicide prevention. Improvements in
      identification and treatment can lead to better depression outcomes and suicide prevention.
      The investigators hypothesize that a 4-year community-based intervention, consisting of
      universal depression screening and subsequent care support in the target areas and health
      education programs, would result in reduced suicide rates among the middle-aged adult
      population in areas with a high suicide rate.

    <description>The intervention included both screening and educational components. The screening component invited residents aged 36-64 years to participate in a two-step screening program. In the initial screening, a self-report questionnaire were mailed to all of those residents in the priority districts with a past high suicide rate. The second stage was conducted for the participants who screened positive though a semi-structural interview. Based on the results, participants who were diagnosed with a major depressive episode were provided with a referral to a psychiatry and support for treatment adherence. Written feedback on the screening results was mailed to all respondents. The educational component was implemented through workshops open to the general public (3 times every year) and local public newsletters (twice every year) designed to improve access and adherence to treatment and to reduce stigma associated with suicide and depression.</description>
