        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients age 18 to 60 years at the time of enrollment.

          2. Women who have self-perceived thinning hair.

          3. Women who have presentation of female pattern hair loss/androgenic alopecia (Ludwig I
             and II).

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of allergic reactions or severe intolerance to minoxidil and Botanical Hair
             Solution product ingredients.

          2. Plan to use any other concomitant therapy to treat hair loss, regrowth or volume
             during the study.

        3 Subjects taking or planning to take topical or systemic prescription or OTC medications
        for treating hair loss and/or hair volume.

        4. Any significant history of concurrent medical disease, which in the judgment of the
        Investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry to this study including
        history of skin disease that may confound study results.

        5. Subjects who have recently (within the last 6 months) started the use of hormones for
        birth control or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Women currently using hormones for
        birth control or HRT must have been on a stable dose (6 months or longer) in order to be
        eligible for the study.

        6. Pregnant or breast-feeding females or women planning to become pregnant during the
