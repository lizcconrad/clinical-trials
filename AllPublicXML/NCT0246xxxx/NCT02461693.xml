  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine the effect of expectancy on mood and alertness
      after consumption of caffeine &quot;treatment&quot; or placebo &quot;control&quot; pill, given that participants
      know their probability for receiving the caffeine versus placebo pill. Participants will be
      randomly assigned a probability (ranging from 0-100%) of receiving caffeine vs. placebo, and
      this probability will be revealed to them before consumption of the assigned pill and
      subsequent cognitive testing. At the time of consumption, neither study staff administering
      the intervention nor participants will know for certain which pill is given to each
      participant. Pill assignment will depend on pre-determined randomization probabilities, which
      will be provided and assigned by the study statistician. By revealing participants'
      individual probability of receiving the caffeine pill, we will induce positive or negative
      expectancies regarding likelihood for receipt of the caffeine pill. These experimental
      manipulations will: 1) estimate the effect of expectancy on cognitive and affective outcomes,
      and 2) allow for a more direct estimate of the effect of the caffeine pill under real-world
      conditions than would a conventional randomized trial.

    <measure>Mood State Score on POMS-2 Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post pill consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Profile of Mood States (POMS-2)- &quot;Volunteers rated a series of 65 mood-related adjectives with regard to how they were feeling &quot;right now&quot; on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The adjectives factor into six mood sub-scales: Tension-Anxiety; Depression-Dejection; Anger-Hostility; Vigor-Activity; Fatigue-Inertia; Confusion-Bewilderment and a Total Mood Disturbance score which aggregates the six sub-scales into a single variable.&quot; - from our publication. The minimum and maximum possible raw scores were: 0 and 40 for Tension-Anxiety, 0 and 52 for Depression-Dejection, 0 and 44 for Anger-Hostility, 0 and 36 for Vigor-Aactivity, 0 and 24 for Fatigue-Inertia, 0 and 40 for Confusion-Bewilderment, -36 and 200 for Total Mood Disturbance, and 0 and 24 for Friendliness. For Friendliness and Vigor-Activity, the more positively a person feels, the higher the score. For all other sub-scales and Total Mood Disturbance, the more negatively a person feels, the higher the score.</description>

    <measure>Vigilance Score on Computer-based Test Using Random, Visual Stimulus: Proportion Correct (Out of 60)</measure>
    <time_frame>45 to 105 minutes post pill consumption</time_frame>
    <description>Scanning Visual Vigilance Test. &quot;This test assesses vigilance, ability to sustain attention during long, boring, continuous tasks that generate minimal cognitive load (Fine et al, 1994; Lieberman et al, 1998; 2002). The volunteer continuously scans a computer screen to detect an infrequent, difficult-to-detect stimulus that appears at random intervals and locations for 2 s. On average, a stimulus was presented once per minute. Upon detection of the stimulus, the volunteer pressed the space bar as rapidly as possible. Whether a stimulus was detected and time required for detection was recorded. Responses before or after stimulus occurrence were false alarms. The test lasted 60 minutes.&quot; - from our publication</description>

        <title>Mood State Score on POMS-2 Test</title>
        <description>Profile of Mood States (POMS-2)- &quot;Volunteers rated a series of 65 mood-related adjectives with regard to how they were feeling “right now” on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The adjectives factor into six mood sub-scales: Tension-Anxiety; Depression-Dejection; Anger-Hostility; Vigor-Activity; Fatigue-Inertia; Confusion-Bewilderment and a Total Mood Disturbance score which aggregates the six sub-scales into a single variable.&quot; - from our publication. The minimum and maximum possible raw scores were: 0 and 40 for Tension-Anxiety, 0 and 52 for Depression-Dejection, 0 and 44 for Anger-Hostility, 0 and 36 for Vigor-Aactivity, 0 and 24 for Fatigue-Inertia, 0 and 40 for Confusion-Bewilderment, -36 and 200 for Total Mood Disturbance, and 0 and 24 for Friendliness. For Friendliness and Vigor-Activity, the more positively a person feels, the higher the score. For all other sub-scales and Total Mood Disturbance, the more negatively a person feels, the higher the score.</description>

        <description>Scanning Visual Vigilance Test. &quot;This test assesses vigilance, ability to sustain attention during long, boring, continuous tasks that generate minimal cognitive load (Fine et al, 1994; Lieberman et al, 1998; 2002). The volunteer continuously scans a computer screen to detect an infrequent, difficult-to-detect stimulus that appears at random intervals and locations for 2 s. On average, a stimulus was presented once per minute. Upon detection of the stimulus, the volunteer pressed the space bar as rapidly as possible. Whether a stimulus was detected and time required for detection was recorded. Responses before or after stimulus occurrence were false alarms. The test lasted 60 minutes.&quot; - from our publication</description>

        <title>Vigilance Score on Computer-based Test Using Random, Visual Stimulus: Number Correct, Number of False Alarm Hits</title>
        <description>Scanning Visual Vigilance Test. &quot;This test assesses vigilance, ability to sustain attention during long, boring, continuous tasks that generate minimal cognitive load (Fine et al, 1994; Lieberman et al, 1998; 2002). The volunteer continuously scans a computer screen to detect an infrequent, difficult-to-detect stimulus that appears at random intervals and locations for 2 s. On average, a stimulus was presented once per minute. Upon detection of the stimulus, the volunteer pressed the space bar as rapidly as possible. Whether a stimulus was detected and time required for detection was recorded. Responses before or after stimulus occurrence were false alarms. The test lasted 60 minutes.&quot; - from our publication</description>
        <time_frame>45 to 105 minutes post pill consumption</time_frame>
        <population>One participant who received the caffeine pill had to use the restroom during the vigilance testing period and had to stop the test. Due to a technicality of the computer program, her data for the vigilance test was not available for analysis.</population>
