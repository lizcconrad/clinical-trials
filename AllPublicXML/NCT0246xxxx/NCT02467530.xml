  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an intervention study of the effects of food preparation on the gut bacteria in
      patients with end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. This is a dietary intervention
      consistent of consuming low amounts of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), the products
      of protein and sugar interaction during food processing and preparation using high direct
      heat.

      Gut microbes can influence numerous aspects of human biology. Alterations in the function and
      composition of gut microbial flora (gut microbiota) have been linked to different diseases
      such as obesity, diabetes and inflammation. Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) are formed
      via the Maillard reaction, which consists of a complex network of non-enzymatic reactions
      involving the carbonyl groups of reducing sugars which react with the amino groups of
      proteins. AGEs are produced in vivo and being consumed. They have been implicated in
      increased risk of different diseases including atherosclerosis, CAD and kidney diseases. In
      this study, the investigators are evaluating the effects of consuming a low AGE diet in
      participants on peritoneal dialysis on the gut bacteria and inflammation.
