  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neuromuscular disease that results in rapid decline
      in normal muscle function and tone leading to difficulties with mobility, eating, drinking,
      breathing, sleeping, and communicating. The disease is progressive and no cure currently
      exists. Most people diagnosed with ALS succumb within 3 to 5 years. The only approved
      treatment to slow the progression of ALS is called RilutekÂ® (riluzole) which has only a
      modest effect and has been shown to increase survival by a few months.

      Muscular dysfunction present in people with ALS is caused by nerve breakdown and a
      dysfunction in the communication between the muscles and the nerves. The area where these
      communications occur is called the neuromuscular junction. Some recent studies have focused
      on using different medications to enhance communication at the neuromuscular junction with
      the goal of improving muscle function as a result. This approach is unproven but may help to
      slow the progression of the disease.

      Pimozide is a medication that has been demonstrated to enhance communication at the
      neuromuscular junction in fish and mice. This study will look at whether Pimozide may help to
      slow the progression of ALS and how much medication needs to be taken to have an effect.

      This clinical trial has two components: an acute therapy component consisting of a Phase II
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized-controlled pilot study of pimozide for the
      treatment of ALS; and a second component featuring a longitudinal follow-up study on ALS
      progression and outcomes. This clinical trial is registry-based including subject recruitment
      facilitated by the Canadian Neuromuscular Disease Registry (CNDR; National Principal
      Investigator: L. Korngut), and longitudinal follow-up data collection will occur during the
      second component of this clinical trial through the CNDR.

      The acute therapy study duration for each subject is around 11 weeks. The follow up study
      duration through the CNDR is up to 5 years.

      Number of study participants:25

      Randomization: Subjects will be block randomized with a block size of five subjects. Within
      each block one subject will be randomly assigned to placebo with the remaining four subjects
      randomized to the treatment groups. Study physicians will be blinded to patient randomization
      status. Randomization will occur with a 4:1 ratio of study drug (20 subjects) to placebo (5
      subjects). After administration of maximum dose for 45-50 days, subjects will taper the
      allocated treatment or placebo. Randomization will occur via permuted block randomization and
      study personnel will be blinded to the randomization at all times allowing full concealment.
