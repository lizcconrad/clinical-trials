  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a behavioral weight loss group in
      conjunction with a prescribed breakfast can help children between 8 and 12 years of age
      change their behaviors to help them lose weight and become healthier.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this application is to evaluate the acceptability and initial efficacy of
      consumption of an egg breakfast, compared to a cereal breakfast, in the context of
      Family-based Behavioral Treatment (FBT) with overweight and obese children and their parents.
      Investigators will randomize 66 parents and their overweight and obese child (85-99.9%BMI) to
      FBT+egg or FBT+cereal groups. Families will eat their assigned breakfast (eggs or cereal) 5
      out of 7 days during the 4 month FBT treatment. However, all other aspects of FBT will be the
      same in the two groups. Children and parents will complete assessments at three time points;
      baseline, post-treatment and 4-months post-treatment.

    <description>The intervention for both groups will be a 4-month Family-Based Behavioral Treatment (FBT), which includes dietary changes, physical activity changes, and behavioral therapy. Treatment is provided in separate parent and child groups. Families will learn to reduce caloric consumption and increase caloric expenditure (physical activity). Behavior therapy includes stimulus control, self-monitoring, goal setting and contracting, parenting skills, skills for managing high-risk situations, and maintenance and relapse prevention. Families will self-monitor caloric intake, breakfast consumption, physical activity, and hunger and satiety throughout the day.</description>
