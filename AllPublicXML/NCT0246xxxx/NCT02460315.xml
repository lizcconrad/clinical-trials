  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10-15% of all patients with gallstones have coexisting common bile duct (CBD)
      stones. However CBD stones can also be formed in the absence of gallbladder stones. The
      current standard of treatment for calcular obstructive jaundice is endoscopic removal of the
      stones. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for
      patients with CBDS. Stone extraction is successful in up to 97% of patients The time interval
      between ERCP and laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is a matter of debate that may vary from
      days to months. Some retrospective and other prospective studies have investigated this issue
      without sharp clue or definite conclusion This study planned to compare early LC (within
      admission) versus late LC (after 1 month) after ERCP as regard technical difficulties and
      surgical outcomes.

      The aim is comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy after endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with gall bladder stones and calcular
      obstructive jaundice as regards operative difficulties, conversion rate, signs of
      inflammation, degree of adhesions, blood loss, postoperative morbidity, and hospital stay.
      Moreover, bacterial examination of bile and culture sensitivity test for assessment of
      bacterial colonization and relate the degree of colonization to timing of laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, to decide upon the
      optimal timing for the surgery.

      The study population will be divided into 2 groups; group (A) will be managed by early
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) within 3 days after ERCP and group (B) will be managed by
      late LC one month after ERCP.
