  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a critical role in the development of allergic rhinitis (AR) has been attributed to
      the nasal epithelium. The airway epithelium forms a physical barrier, protecting the nasal
      mucosa and underlying organs from damage from contact with exogenous particles. The nasal
      epithelial barrier is primarily determined by the integrity of the airway epithelium, in
      which epithelial cells are connected to each other by complex network structures like tight
      junctions (TJs), ultimately sealing off the paracellular space. TJs consist of different
      transmembrane proteins including occludin, tricellulin, the claudin family, and junctional
      adhesion molecules. TJ form intercellular homodimers/heterodimers between neighboring cells.
      Scaffold adaptor proteins like cingulin and the zonula occludens family connect the
      transmembrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton.

      Disturbed TJ function can facilitate the entrance of foreign pathogens and antigens into the
      submucosal layer, giving raise to allergic sensitization via increased access of allergens to
      the dendritic cells and/or inducing persistent inflammation via activation of mast cells and
      other inflammatory cells residing in the upper airways. Chronic disorders like allergic
      asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and atopic dermatitis have been linked to defective or
      altered TJ function. Recently, an impaired epithelial barrier function was found in patients
      with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), suggesting changes in TJ arrangement
      in the nasal cavity. CRSwNP presents a similar inflammation of the sinonasal cavities as
      found in AR patients, i.e. a Th2 cytokine driven inflammation with tissue eosinophilia.
      Nevertheless, the role of TJs and its regulation has not been investigated in AR.

    <time_frame>every 30 min over 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal biopsies will be mounted in modified 3 ml Ussing chambers. Experiments will be performed in open-circuit conditions. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) will be calculated from the voltage deflections induced by bipolar constant-current pulses of 16 mA every 60 s with duration of 200 ms and will be recorded every 30 min over 2 h. The average of all time points of the 2 biopsy samples/patient will be used and will be presented as Ωxcm².</description>

    <measure>change in mucosal permeability</measure>
    <time_frame>every 30 min over 2 h</time_frame>
    <description>The paracellular probe, fluorescently labelled dextran 4 kDa (FD4) (2 mg/ml) will be used to determine the mucosal permeability. FD4 will be added to the mucosal compartment and serosal samples will be collected every 30 min over 2 h. The fluorescence level will be measured using a fluorescence reader. The average of time points 60, 90 and 120 min of the 2 biopsy samples/patient will be used to express mucosal permeability.</description>
