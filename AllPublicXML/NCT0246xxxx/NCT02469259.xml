  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of oxytocin on alcohol-related behaviors, social
      abilities, and physiological startle responses in healthy individuals and patients with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) using a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, dose-tiered, between-subject study design. Specifically, the
      investigators will determine if intranasal administration of a single dose of the pro-social
      neuropeptide oxytocin decreases alcohol-related approach bias and cravings, enhances social
      abilities, and decreases physiological hyperactivity. The investigators will also determine
      the optimal dose to achieve these effects and will explore psychosocial predictors of
      responses to oxytocin. The proposed work has the potential to yield a novel pharmacological
      treatment for AUD and PTSD, both leading causes of disability in the US Military for which
      currently available treatments are inadequate.
