  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to investigate what effect altering handle height of posterior
      walkers has on forces through the walker, posture, efficiency, stability, speed, turning and
      comfort, and to obtain data which helps therapists understand the bio-mechanics involved
      during use and if this alters depending on age, posture or strength. All participants will
      have cerebral palsy. This will allow informed prescription of walkers and identify potential
      for redesign to improve efficiency, promote strengthening or improve posture to maximise
      children's potential to continue functional walking into adulthood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy (CP) find walking effortful due to weakness, lack of
      coordination between muscle groups, postural changes, poor balance and altered muscle tone.
      Walking aids improve efficiency, stability and posture.Posterior walkers were developed in
      the mid 1980's. There is evidence of their advantages over more traditional anterior walkers,
      however there is no evidence relating to setting handle height, and little information about
      bio-mechanics during use.

      This is a quantitative pilot study with a cross over design. A purposive sample of
      approximately 15 children will be recruited from Birmingham Community Healthcare National
      Health Service (NHS) Trust. Assessments will be carried out at 3 different handle heights,
      determined by measuring elbow flexion when the participant is standing holding the handles of
      their walker. Participants will attend two assessments. One at their school, and a second at
      the University of Birmingham. Forces going through the walker and the participant's feet,
      range of motion at the trunk, hip and knee, velocity, step and stride length, double support
      time, physiological cost index, pain, gross motor function, hip abductor strength and ease of
      turning will be measured.

      Analysis of variance with repeated measures will be used to analyse changes across handle
      heights and multiple linear regression to show associations between the dependent variables
      studied and identify potential confounding factors. p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically
      significant. Effect sizes needed for clinical significance will be considered.

    <measure>Three dimensional gait analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Half a day</time_frame>
    <description>Kinetic data will be captured using a 13 camera Vicon three dimensional motion analysis system. Reflective markers will be placed bilaterally on the acromion process, lateral epicondyle of the elbow, styloid process of the ulna, greater trochanter of the femur, anterior superior iliac spine, posterior superior iliac spine, lateral epicondyle of the femur, lateral malleolus, insertion of the achilles tendon and head of the fifth metatarsal. Markers will be placed on the corners of walker, at the top and bottom of it (8 in total). Trunk hip and knee angles on both sides of the body will be recorded throughout the gait cycle, as children with CP often have asymmetrical gait. Velocity, step and stride length and double support time will also be calculated using this system.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Force through the legs of the walker and the participants feet.</measure>
    <time_frame>Half a day</time_frame>
    <description>A sensor will be placed in each of the four walker legs to measure the force going through each one. The force the participants's feet exert on the floor will be measured as they cross the force plate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physiological cost index</measure>
    <time_frame>Half a day</time_frame>
    <description>This measures efficiency of gait in beats per metre.It is calculated using the following formula:
Walking heart rate-resting heart rate/walking speed. Heart rate is measured in beats/minute and speed in metres/minute. Heart rate will be continuously monitored electronically. It will be calculated over a distance of 50m.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Faces Pain Scale -Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Half a day</time_frame>
    <description>The participant chooses from one of 5 faces to indicate how much pain they are in. This will be repeated at each handle height.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross Motor function measure - 88</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Used to assess change in gross motor function over time in children with CP. Participants are asked to do a series of simple tasks across 5 domains of lying and rolling, sitting, crawling and kneeling, standing, walking running and jumping.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip abductor strength</measure>
    <time_frame>10 mins</time_frame>
    <description>Hip abductor strength will be measured in supine lying using a Kin Com dynamometer, as previously described by Engsberg at al (Engsberg et al., 2002).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posterior walker 180 degree turn test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>This test has been designed for the purposes of this study. A line is taped on the floor perpendicular to the direction in which the participant is walking. They approach the line from a minimum of 3m away and turn when they reach the line. Direction of the turn (clockwise/anticlockwise), time and number of steps taken to turn 180 degrees is recorded.</description>
