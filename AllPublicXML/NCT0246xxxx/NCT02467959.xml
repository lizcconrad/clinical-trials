      The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic yield and accuracy of bedside emergency
      physician performed ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency physician (EP) performed bedside ultrasound is cost effective, repeatable and
      especially useful in the diagnosis of life treating conditions such as aortic dissection,
      traumatic bleedings. While abdominal pain is a common complaint in the emergency department
      and accurate diagnosis of its etiology may affect the patient's outcome, the accuracy and the
      diagnostic yield of bedside EP performed ultrasound is not well established. The diagnosis of
      a patient presented to emergency department with right lower abdominal pain is generally
      problematic and physician has to exclude acute surgical reasons such as acute appendicitis.

      In this study, patients who are suspicious to have acute appendicitis base on their clinical
      findings will be included. EP will record his diagnosis and then patient will undergo
      emergency physician performed ultrasound. After ultrasound EP will fill the study form
      according to US findings and record his diagnosis once again.

      At the end of the study the investigators evaluate and compare the radiology performed US
      reports and if there is operational biopsy results with the EP's pre- and post ultrasound
      diagnosis to estimate the diagnostic yield and accuracy of bedside emergency physician
      performed ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
