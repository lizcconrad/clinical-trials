  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary strictures present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to clinicians due to
      unsatisfied accuracy of sampling modality. The major problem is very difficult to discern
      malignant from non-malignant strictures, such as patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis
      (PSC). With the poor prognosis and high mortality rate of advanced stage of
      hepatopancreaticobiliary malignancies, early and accurate diagnosis impacts patients' outcome
      and possible surgical candidacy. Therefore, a pre-operative determination of malignancy to
      help plan appropriate treatment is highly desirable.

      Before 2000s, several diagnostic modalities, including laboratory tests, ultrasonography
      (US), computed tomography (CT) scan, cholangiography by percutaneous transhepatic
      cholangiography endoscopic (PTC) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),
      and brushing cytology disclosed 13% to 24% false positive rate for suspicious malignant hilar
      strictures. Compared to recent studies, ERCP brushings still suffer from low sensitivity
      (41.6% ± 3.2% (99% CI)) and negative predictive value (58.0% ± 3.2% (99% CI)). In order to
      increase diagnostic accuracy, at least two sampling methods, including brushing cytology,
      biopsy, and fine-needle aspiration is therefore recommended. One article showed multimodal
      tissue-sampling (Brushing + Biopsy + Fine-needle aspiration) increased the sensitivity for
      diagnosis of malignant biliary stricture to 62%. However, no any literature demonstrate the
      best sequence of combined sampling modalities to yield the highest diagnostic accuracy.
      Besides, the role of stricture dilation before or after different tissue sampling modality is
      still uncertain.

      In this study, the investigators want to compare stricture dilation before or after
      multimodal tissue-sampling, including brush cytology, intraductal suction and forceps biopsy
      for the diagnosis of malignant biliary stricture and also assess which kind of the sequence
      of combined tissue-sampling modalities could offer the highest diagnostic accuracy.
