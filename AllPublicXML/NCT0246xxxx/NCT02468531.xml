  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) is the vital complication of Stanford type A aortic dissection. It is
      confirmed that Xenon has the significant protective effect on important organs and has no
      suppression on the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, our earlier trial has already
      clarified that static inflation with 50% Xenon during cardiopulmonary bypass could attenuate
      ALI for Standford A acute aortic dissection. However the protection effect was restricted for
      the limited time. Aimed to enhance the protection effect of Xenon, we designed this
      randomized trial that anesthesia with 50% xenon one hour before and after CPB and pulmonary
      static Inflation with 50%,75% and 100% Xenon during CPB respectively.
