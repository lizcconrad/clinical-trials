             (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times and the
             average of the three BP values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

             times and the average of the three QTcF values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility.

             days prior to dosing.

             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

         22. Subjects with history of infection within 1 week prior to study entry.

         23. Male subjects with partners currently pregnant and male subjects able to father
