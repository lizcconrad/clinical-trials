    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study of combining BV in a licensed indication with imatinib in
      patients with ALCL. It is intended as a &quot;window of opportunity&quot; trial in which the study
      drugs will be given as an initial substitute for conventional chemotherapy with the intention
      to achieve a remission enabling the patients to proceed to autologous or allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation, if eligible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be included in this trial if they have relapsed or refractory ALK+ ALCL after
      at least one line of conventional chemotherapy or if they are ineligible for conventional
      chemotherapy.

      Imatinib will be given continuously starting from day 1 of the first cycle at an oral dose of
      100mg daily. The dose will be increased to 200mg daily starting from day 1 of the second
      cycle if no DLT occurs during the first cycle. BV will be given 3 weekly starting on day 1 at
      a dose of 1.8 mg/kg body weight. In the absence of a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) i.e.
      haematological toxicity ≥ grade 2, non- haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3, after 3 weeks of
      therapy, and in the presence of a clinical response (CR or PR) after cycle 1, the BV dose
      will continue every 3 weeks for 48 weeks. Dose modifications and stopping rules will be
      introduced as described in chapter 6. In case of progression at any time during the study the
      patient will go off trial and receive salvage treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients ≥ 18 years of age

          -  ALK+ ALCL

          -  Histologically confirmed relapse after having achieved a PR or CR with conventional
             therapy

          -  Refractoriness to conventional chemotherapy (SD or PD after conventional chemotherapy)

          -  Not able to receive conventional chemotherapy (e.g. due to comorbidities)

          -  Adequate organ function, defined as the following:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/μL unless there is known hematologic/solid
                  tumor marrow involvement

               -  Platelet count ≥ 75,000/ μL unless there is known marrow involvement of the

                  elevated up to 5 times the ULN if their elevation can be reasonably ascribed to
