      To assess the effect of PEX168 doses on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy
      subjects.To provide a scientific basis for clinical drug combination of PEX168.

      To evaluated the impact of pharmacodynamics coadministrated hypodermic PEX168 and warfarin in
      healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, sequential, single-center study that evaluated the pharmacokinetics
      of warfarin when coadministered with PEX168 in healthy adult subjects. The total duration of
      each subject's participation in the study was approximately 13 weeks, which included up to a
      14-day Screening Period, a 51-day Treatment Period, and an approximately 4-week Follow-up
      Period.

      Center: This study was conducted at a single site in the first affiliate hospital of Zhejiang
      University.All subjects receives a single 5mg oral dose of warfarin on Day 1 followed by 5
      weekly 200μg doses of PEX168 injected subcutaneously beginning on Day 8 and a second single
      5mg oral dose of warfarin on Day 44.
