      Monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (GM1) protect breast cancer patient from taxanes-related
      neurotoxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taxanes is a key agent in the treatment of breast cancer. However, peripheral neuropathy
      markedly limits the use of taxanes. There are no way to relieve or eliminate taxanes-related
      neurotoxicity. Monosialotetrahexosyl ganglioside (GM1) present a role of neuroprotective
      properties. This multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed to assess
      the efficacy of GM1 for preventing taxanes induced neurotoxicity in operable breast cancer
      patients who received taxanes-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
