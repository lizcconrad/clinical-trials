  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study the effect of dietary supplementation with a natural
      health product (NHP) with a focus on its effects on its levels in breast milk.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of oral cysteine on its levels in breast milk and plasma will be measured in
      breast feeding mothers.

      The investigators will not be studying tryptophan and tyrosine in this study. The title is an
      overview title left over from other past studies (but the investigators are only assessing
      cysteine at this time).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Breast milk cysteine levels</measure>
    <time_frame>The main protocol occurs of 10 hours of time when the pharmacokinetics of the amino acid are measured.</time_frame>
    <description>measurement of amino acid before and after acute administration over a 10 hour period
The first visit would be the screening visit, which the subjects will be evaluated for general health status through a standardized health questionnaire. A urine test will be done in order to screen for any drug use.
On the second visit, each subject would be tested for plasma levels of the amino acid during the day. In addition breast milk will be tested in order to examine the effect of these supplements on the amino acid contents of the breast milk at few time points on both days.</description>
