    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to look at how much a new trial drug get into body, such as when
      the drug concentration in your body reaches peak and how high the peak value is.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a histologically confirmed (Gleason graded) adenocarcinoma of the prostate (all
             stages), for which endocrine therapy (except for neoadjuvant hormonal therapy) is
             indicated

          -  Has a Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) level ≥2.0 ng/mL at Screening

          -  Has a screening serum testosterone level &gt;150 ng/dL

          -  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of ≤2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has had previous or is currently under hormonal management of prostate cancer.
             However, hormonal therapy for a maximum duration of 6 months is accepted. This
             treatment should have been terminated at least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit

          -  Is currently treated with a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor

          -  Is in need of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy

          -  Has a history of bilateral orchiectomy, adrenalectomy, or hypophysectomy
