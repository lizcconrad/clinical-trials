  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal
      tract which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). A recent
      epidemiological investigation estimates that nearly 4 million people worldwide are affected
      and approximately 1.4 million of these cases occur in the United States. IBD can lead to
      debilitating symptoms, hospitalizations, decreased quality of life, frequent procedures
      and/or surgery. Treatment options consist of immunosuppressive therapy, such as systemic
      corticosteroids, immunomodulators (thiopurines and methotrexate) and/or biologics, such as
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) agents or an integrin inhibitor, vedolizumab. They can
      achieve clinical remission and decrease the risk of complications, but also increase the risk
      for opportunistic infections, including influenza.

      Multiple studies have shown lower influenza vaccine responses in patients with IBD compared
      to healthy individuals; IBD patients treated with TNF agents or combination therapy (TNF
      inhibitors and immunomodulators) are very likely to mount a poor immune response. Influenza
      serum antibody concentration correlates with protection from infection following vaccination.
      Therefore, increasing influenza antibody responses in patients with IBD would appear to be
      critical to improving protection from influenza. A high dose (HD) influenza vaccine
      containing four times more hemagglutinin was licensed based on its ability to induce higher
      antibody concentrations compared to standard dose (SD) in adults 65 years or older.
