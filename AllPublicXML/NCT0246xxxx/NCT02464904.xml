  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Can neoadjuvant intrapleural cryotherapy be safely performed in patients with malignant
      pleural mesothelioma and will it trigger substantial systemic and local pro-inflammatory
      changes, resulting in the induction of anti-tumor immunity?

      Patients that have been diagnosed, or are suspected of having malignant pleural mesothelioma,
      a cancer of the pleura, surgery may be considered as an attempt to treat the cancer. As part
      of the testing needed before surgery, a pleuroscopy or video camera examination of the pleura
      is necessary to establish the diagnosis and/or to evaluate the extent of the cancer. This
      study evaluates the effects of cryotherapy (freezing spray) on the ability of a patient's
      immune system to attack the cancer, as has been reported in other types of cancers. The
      purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of
      cryotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. If successful, this study could
      provide support for future studies evaluating this new treatment for mesothelioma.

    <description>Subjects will have their blood drawn prior to undergoing a staging pleuroscopy. During the pleuroscopy pleural fluid will be collected as well as pleural biopsies (4 to 8 research biopsies). The procedure will involve 2 to 3 applications of cryospray on the location of the disease. After establishing cryofrost over a minimum of a 2 x 2 cm area, cryospray will continue for 15 to 20 seconds, allow a thaw period of 60 seconds followed by one to two repeats in the same location before proceeding onto the next location. We will treat a minimum of 6 x 6 cm area in aggregate. The freezing procedure will be video-recorded and freezing locations and time will be recorded. Approximately, 14 days following the staging pleuroscopy patients will undergo surgical treatment as per standard of care, with repeat blood, pleural fluid and tissue collection.</description>
