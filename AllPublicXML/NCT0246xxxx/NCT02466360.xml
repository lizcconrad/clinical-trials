  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-specific chronic lower back pain is a common pathology which is a real public health
      problem. Around 84% of the population could have non-specific chronic lower back pain at
      least once in their lives and 8% of that non-specific lower back pain could become chronical
      (pain that would last at least 3 months). This proportion of patients represents 85% of the
      costs related to this pathology.

      Physical activity practice is involved in medical care for plenty of chronical diseases and
      particularly for chronic lower back pain. In 2003, World Health Organization pointed out the
      poor adhesion of patients with chronical diseases to medical prescriptions and the
      after-effects it could have on illness evolution. Therefore, adhesion to physical activity
      practice for patients with chronic lower back pain is one of the most challenging matters for
      medical teams.

      The aim of this study was to identify the brakes and levers of physical activity practice for
      these patients. Sixteen individual interviews and four focus groups have been carried out on
      patients with chronic lower back pain who were taken care of either by a rachis functional
      restoration program or by primary care.
