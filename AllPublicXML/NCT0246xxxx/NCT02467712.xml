    <textblock>
      It is generally accepted that the fungal infection on a joint prosthesis is to be treated in
      two surgical time: implant removal and prosthetic reconstruction. The service took the option
      for over 10 years to treat bacterial infections in joint replacement by a change in time. In
      four recent cases the diagnosis initially suspected of bacterial infection has been restated
      on intraoperative bacteriological examinations fungal infection. It is therefore a
      potentially harmful side effect of the chosen treatment option, but 4 patients in question
      were all cured of their fungal infection after a postoperative antifungal therapy. The
      objective of this study is to report these cases for discussion on the therapeutic choices in
      fungal infections on joint replacement.
