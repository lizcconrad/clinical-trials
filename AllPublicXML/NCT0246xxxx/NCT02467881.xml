    <textblock>
      Diabetes Prevention Program translational efforts, such as the Group Lifestyle Balance
      Program (GLB), have been shown to be effective in reducing weight and modifying diabetes and
      CVD risk factors in a variety of diverse community settings. Although one of the two primary
      goals of these DPP translation programs focuses on increasing physical activity levels, few
      published DPP translation studies reported results on change in physical activity with only
      one study reporting activity levels from an objective measurement instrument. In order to
      completely understand the role that physical activity plays in making healthy lifestyle
      change, it is critical that we validate the impact of activity using a valid and reliable
      objective measure. In addition, current studies suggest that decreasing time spent sitting
      may have a positive health impact separate from the effects of participating in planned bouts
      of moderate intensity activity. Therefore, we propose to examine the impact of a modified
      version of the GLB program, which will focus on decreasing sedentary/sitting behaviors. The
      results of this project will provide information regarding best options for physical activity
      within lifestyle intervention programs, focusing both on verifying the current role of
      physical activity in lifestyle intervention using an objective measure and on examining an
      alternative intervention option for translation efforts.

    <textblock>
      Translation efforts based upon the successful Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have shown
      that this behavioral lifestyle intervention model is effective in a variety of diverse
      community settings. Despite the fact that physical activity is a key part of the DPP
      lifestyle intervention as one of the two intervention goals, activity change in the DPP,
      and/or the resulting translation studies modeled after it, has not been adequately verified
      with an accurate objective measure. In addition, previous research has shown that, in many
      subgroups of the general population, moderate and vigorous physical activity is non-existent.
      Individuals with activity only at the low end of the intensity spectrum may have a difficult
      time increasing their levels of moderate+ intensity physical activity for various reasons
      such as limited function or lack of motivation. For these individuals, interventions with a
      movement goal of increasing planned bouts of moderate intensity activity may not be as
      effective and therefore not as beneficial as interventions with a movement goal of decreasing
      time spent sitting.

      The purpose of this proposal is to understand the impact of movement, specifically physical
      activity and sitting time, in a DPP-adapted community lifestyle intervention, Group Lifestyle
      Balance (GLB).

      Aim 1: To determine if the GLB lifestyle intervention, shown to be effective in translation
      efforts in decreasing weight and increasing self-reported activity, has significant changes
      in physical activity levels determined by a validated objective measure, the accelerometer.
      It is hypothesized that participants randomized to the conventional lifestyle intervention
      arm (GLB-MOD) will have significant improvements in our primary endpoints of weight and
      physical activity (measured objectively) compared to a delayed-intervention control at 6
      months and will have reductions in several secondary outcome measures (fasting glucose,
      insulin, blood pressure, waist, lipids, physical function, and quality of life).

      Aim 2: To determine if a lifestyle intervention program similar to the one described above,
      with the only change being that the activity focus is now replaced with an inactivity focus
      (GLB-SED), is also effective. It is hypothesized that participants randomized to GLB-SED will
      have a significant improvement in the primary endpoints of weight and decreased inactivity
      (measured objectively) compared to a delayed-intervention control at 6 months and will have
      significant reductions in several of the secondary endpoints (fasting glucose, insulin, blood
      pressure, waist circumference, lipids, physical function, quality of life).

      Secondary Aims: To examine the pre-post change in participants for weight, physical activity
      (objective and subjective), and sedentary time from baseline to 6 and 12 months of
      intervention for each randomized arm and to understand the inter-relationships of these
      behavioral factors over time. It is hypothesized that those GLB-MOD participants who achieve
      significant weight loss will also have significant increases in their moderate+ intensity
      activity levels. Similarly, we hypothesize those GLB-SED participants who achieve significant
      weight loss will also have significant decreases in the amount of time they spent
      sedentary/sitting. An estimate of the difference in participant cost between the two versions
      of the lifestyle intervention programs will also be determined.

      Aim #1 addresses an important remaining gap in the prevention literature; does objectively
      measured activity improve as a result of the existing intervention that is being used in
      DPP-based translation efforts and does this change in activity have an impact on weight
      change? Aim #2 examines the impact of replacing the conventional physical activity goal of
      increasing planned and relatively brief bouts of moderate physical activity with one focusing
      on decreasing sedentary time within the framework of a successful translation lifestyle
      intervention adapted from the DPP, the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program.

      The study design is a prospective, six month delayed-control intervention in which 321
      subjects (age 50 and older with a BMI of â‰¥24 kg/m2 and with prediabetes and/or metabolic
      syndrome) will be recruited from community centers and randomly assigned to one of three
      groups: the standard GLB program which includes the conventional moderate activity goal
      (GLB-MOD), the GLB program with a focus on decreasing sedentary behavior (GLB-SED), or
      delayed intervention. Subjects assigned to GLB-MOD and GLB-SED will each, separately be
      compared at 6 months to the delayed-control group after which time, the delayed group will be
      randomly assigned to either GLB-MOD or GLB-SED. Participants will complete baseline, 6, and
      12 month assessment visits. Change in weight, objectively measured activity, and time spent
      sedentary are the primary outcomes with secondary outcomes including change in self-reported
      physical activity, HbA1c, fasting glucose, lipids, blood pressure, waist circumference,
      quality of life and physical function.

      It is hypothesized that physical activity assessed by accelerometry in GLB-MOD will
      significantly increase (mostly moderate intense activity) and that there will be a
      significant decrease in weight, which will partly be related to change in activity levels.
      The 2nd hypothesis is that the GLB-SED intervention will significantly decrease time spent
      sitting as measured by accelerometry and that this change will also be related to a
      significant decrease in weight. The information that will be gained from this entire effort
      is important, innovative, and will allow us to obtain a complete and accurate understanding
      of both ends of the physical activity/inactivity spectrum and their impact in community
      prevention intervention programs. If shown to be effective, the innovative, modified
      sedentary-focused translation intervention program would provide a valuable future
      translation option.

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will follow the traditional GLB program with an activity goal of 150 minutes per week of moderately intense physical activity similar to a brisk walk. Progression of the activity goal each week is slow and safe with increases of no more than 30 minutes per week. Participants are requested to try and achieve 20-30 minutes per day of moderate activity but, to allow for flexibility, that amount can be split into 10 minute increments. Self-reported monitoring for this group includes keeping track of weight, daily food intake as well the number of minutes each day spent being active as part of their planned activity goal. This is all recorded in the self-monitoring keeping track book.</description>

    <description>The GLB curriculum will be adapted to direct participants to decrease the time they spend sitting in a day rather than to increase moderate+ physical activity as is the case in the current GLB program. In order for the participant to become aware of how much time they spend sitting and where most of their sitting time occurs, they will fill out a &quot;7 Day Sedentary Diary&quot; that consists of daily entry of time spent sitting over the course of one week. Participants will be asked to eliminate a 45 minute sitting bout in a day with non-sitting activity. They will initially be asked to eliminate 45 minutes of sitting for two days in that week. This will increase one day a week until 7 days in a week are met.</description>

    <description>The Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) program was adapted from the original DPP lifestyle intervention. As in the original DPP lifestyle program, the GLB goals are to achieve and maintain a 7% weight loss, and to safely and progressively increase physical activity to 150 minutes/week of moderately intense physical activity similar to a brisk walk.
The curriculum will be administered in intervention groups with an average of 10-15 individuals per group; sessions will be conducted by trained coaches, with participants attending 22 sessions over one year.
The two intervention arms will only differ in the aerobic activity portion of the intervention, which is covered in sessions #4, #10 and 19 as well as participant record keeping and goal setting in regards to activity/inactivity progression.</description>
