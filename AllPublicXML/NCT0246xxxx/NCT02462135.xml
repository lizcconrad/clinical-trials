    <textblock>
      This study sought to investigate the changes in objective memory performance (including
      immediate recall and delayed recall), subjective memory complaints and degree of depression
      in older adults with mild cognitive impairment after Virtual interactive memory training
      (VIMT).

      This double-blind randomized controlled study has a 2-arm parallel group design. All subjects
      will be randomized by the block randomization, into intervention group (Virtual interactive
      memory training, VIMT), or active control group (Passive information activities, PIA).
      Training sessions of the VIMT group are 45 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 12 weeks (36
      sessions each). The training of PIA group is the same as VIMT group. We constructed a
      rigorous VIMT program adhering to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
      reporting guidelines. The investigators expect to determine the improvement in memory
      function and degree of depression of older adults with mild cognitive impairment after using
      the VIMT.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must endorse at least two items from a list of frequent subjective memory
             complaints by patient and/or an informant

          2. Objective memory impairment on neuropsychological tests of memory 1.5 SD or more below
             age/education norms

          3. Clinical neurologic examination by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of
             24 or higher, and cut-off score of 23/24 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)

          4. No impairment in personal activities of daily living (P-ADL) as determined by clinical
             interview with participant and family

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The clinical diagnosis of dementia was based on the DSM-IV-TR

          2. Active in another cognitive or memory-related training in the past year

          3. Comorbid medical conditions that would predispose them to imminent functional decline
             or cognitive impairment

          4. A diagnosis of major neurological or psychiatric illness history and/or behavioral
             problems that would sufficiently impair performance to make participation impossible

          5. Severe losses in vision, hearing, or communicative ability
