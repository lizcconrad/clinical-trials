  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that monetary incentives and messaging, such as making
      nutritious foods relatively less expensive than less nutritious foods and framing the price
      difference in a positive or negative way, will influence purchasing behavior of households.

      In this study, 239 loyalty card shoppers were recruited at Hannaford grocery stores to
      participate in a study in which a 10% price difference between nutritious and less nutritious
      foods was introduced. and then framed as a subsidy, tax, or a combination of a tax and
      subsidy. To determine whether or not the framing of the price difference influenced
      purchasing behavior, the difference was framed as a subsidy on nutritious foods, a tax on
      less nutritious foods, and a combination of a tax and subsidy on less nutritious and
      nutritious foods, respectively. The purpose of this study was to examine the general impact
      of this price difference on purchases of nutritious and less nutritious foods, and whether or
      not the framing of the price difference had a differential effect on behavior.

    <description>Item level transaction data were collected for each participant between mid-July 2010 and mid-March 2011. These data included expenditures on all items purchased in the store, as well as the specific product type. With this information, product groupings can be created, such as for dairy, candy, and fresh produce. Average weekly expenditures for these groupings were generated and reported in July 2012.</description>
