      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of laparoscopy-assisted D2
      radical surgery for distal advanced gastric cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In both arms,subtotal gastrectomy (dissect more than 2/3 of stomach and total omentectomy)
      and D2 lymph node dissection (around common hepatic artery, celiac artery, proximal part of
      splenic artery (4d, 4sb), hepatoduodenal ligament, superior mesenteric vein) wiil be
      performed basically. As a general rule, Billroth I or BillrothII methods will be used for
      gastric reconstruction for all cases. For anastomosis, absorbable suture is used. Anastomotic
      diameter is 5~6 cm length. Drainage tube is inserted through the right flank area and
      additional drainage tubes can be inserted as needed.

    <description>Patients in this arm undergo radical resection of gastric cancer in laparoscopic surgery.10 mm trocar under umbilicus, 12 mm and 5 mm trocar at the right flank area are inserted into abdominal wall. Another two 5 mm trocar are inserted into the both midline of subcostal line. The devices for operation are inserted through the trocars. Subtotal gastrectomy (dissect more than 2/3 of stomach and total omentectomy) and D2 lymph node dissection (around common hepatic artery, celiac artery, proximal part of splenic artery, hepatoduodenal ligament, superior mesenteric vein) will be performed basically. Dissected stomach and lymph node are collected through additional 5-10 cm incision at the preexisting epigastric incision.</description>
