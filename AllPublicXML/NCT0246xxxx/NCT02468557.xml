    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of
      single agent idelalisib and in combination with chemotherapy in adults with metastatic
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This study will also define the the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of idelalisib in combination with chemotherapy.
