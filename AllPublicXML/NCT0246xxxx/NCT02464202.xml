    <textblock>
      The aim of this study lies in comparing the outcome of the proposed technique in a large
      sample size group to the outcome of the conventional tooth autotransplantation method and to
      provide sufficient evidence for improving the long-term success rate of the tooth
      autotransplantation procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subjects will be divided in two groups according to different surgical protocols.

          1. Pediatric subjects (age between 9-18 years) treated with the CBCT-based replica
             procedure (prospective approach).

             Pediatric subjects (N=50) that missed their teeth due to agenesis or lost their
             permanent teeth due to trauma, caries, and endodontic failure and referred to
             dentistry department for replacement of the missing tooth by means of tooth
             autotransplantation.

          2. Pediatric subjects (age between 9-18 years) treated with the conventional method
             (prospective and retrospective).

        Pediatric subjects (N=50) that missed their teeth due to agenesis or lost their permanent
        teeth due to trauma, caries, and endodontic failure and referred to dentistry department
        for replacement of the missing tooth by means of tooth autotransplantation.

        A matched control patient will be selected with the focus on a very similar surgical
        challenge, based on age, gender and a matching donor tooth with the same stage of root
        development and host bed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential participants (case and control) will be excluded if follow-up data are
             missing for the one-year follow-up.
