  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a rapid scan of the pancreas and ovaries that could be
      used in the future to screen patients at risk for pancreatic or ovarian cancers. Currently,
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations of the pancreas and ovaries can last 30-45
      minutes each. The investigators hope to create a rapid pancreatic and ovarian MRI evaluation
      that can be used as a screening tool that is completed in approximately 15 minutes. They will
      compare different tools available on modern MRI scanners to see which one reliably offers
      high quality images of the pancreas and ovaries.

    <description>The images will be evaluated qualitatively for image quality from 1 to 5 with 5 = not adequate and 1 = adequate image quality by two radiologists in consensus. If both radiologists give a score of 1, the sequence will be considered to be adequate in image quality. Quantitative measurements of SNR will be performed on the pancreatic head, body and tail, and ovarian tissue by region of interest (ROI) analysis. Final acquisition times and spatial resolution for each sequence will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this study is to optimize rapid pancreatic and ovarian MR screening protocols using T1, T2 and DW imaging sequences in BRCA mutation carriers. Each screening MR protocol is considered optimized if we reach 5 consecutive patients with technically adequate image quality. We will enroll up to 60 patients to perform the MR screening protocol, if the initial MR sequence parameters do not yield technically adequate MR images in a single patient, we will stop and modify our imaging protocol. We will continue to modify the technique until we reach 5 consecutive patients with technically adequate MR images for both on all imaging sequences. Thus, it is possible we will optimize different imaging sequences at different time points in our study. We plan to enroll at least 5 patients, and up to 60 patients with BRCA mutation who undergo breast MRI for this study. Participants will receive a copy of the questionnaire on the day of their Breast MRI.</description>
