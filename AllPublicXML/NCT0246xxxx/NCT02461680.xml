  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flexors tendon injuries are frequent and serious with a potential of definitive functional
      aftereffects. In the case of partial injury, the treatment is debated. There are 2 techniques
      of possible repair, the direct suture and the tangential resection. The investigators have
      already demonstrated that this last technique was favorable for injuries going to 50 %. In
      the case of partial section between 50 and 75 %, the investigators think that the technique
      of tangential resection compared with the direct suture would not increase the risks of
      secondary breaks, would authorize even an immediate mobilization and would decrease the
      secondary complications.

      The main objective is to highlight that the tangential resection is not lower than the
      classic technique on the clinical plan The secondary objectives are to highlight the
      non-inferiority of the tangential technique in clinical terms (pains, dexterity,
      complications), radiologics (MRI, ultrasound) and functional (function, go back to leisures
      and professional activities)
