  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-trial pilot study in which adult methadone maintenance treatment patients who
      are living with HIV but are not engaged in HIV primary care (i.e., missed appointments,
      non-adherence to medication) will be recruited to participate in a HIV primary care
      engagement study. The purpose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility and
      acceptability of a mobile phone-based health (mHealth) text messaging intervention to improve
      engagement in HIV primary care among substance abusing populations with HIV.

    <description>All participants will receive individualized text messages based on a schedule determined during the development and refinement of the mHealth text messaging intervention (i.e., once or twice a week). All participants will receive text messages for: 1) medication reminders, 2) appointment reminders, and 3) text messages addressing barriers (educational information to improve HIV knowledge) or promoting facilitators (e.g., routinizing taking of HIV antiretroviral medication) of care engagement. Each participant will complete baseline assessments, and will select their preferences for personalized messages on the day of baseline assessments. Text messages will be deployed for the duration of the 30-day trial. Participants will be followed-up at the completion of the 30-day intervention. Each participant will be asked to complete a follow-up survey, including questions on the acceptability of the mHealth intervention.</description>
