      The purpose of this study is to obtain outcomes data on the Anatomical Shoulder™
      Inverse/Reverse System by analysis of standard scoring systems and radiographs.

      Outcome data will be collected using the following standard scoring systems of which summary
      statistics will be provided:

        -  Constant and Murley Score to evaluate clinical parameters such as range of motion,
           power, level of pain and functional ability.

        -  SF-12 Physical and Mental Health Summary Measures (SF12 Questionnaire) comprising of
           twelve questions to assess the subject's physical and mental health status which must be
           answered by the patient.

      This is a multi-centre, non-comparative, prospective post-market surveillance study involving
      orthopaedic surgeons skilled in shoulder replacement surgery. Each case enrolled will receive
      an Anatomical Shoulder™ Inverse/Reverse implant. All system components are CE-marked and
      commercially available. Patients will be selected according to the subject selection
      criteria.

      All patients will undergo pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative physical
      examination, radiographic evaluation according to the hospital's routine procedure and
      collection of quality of life metrics. Follow-up evaluations are to be conducted at either 6
      weeks or 6 months (according to the hospital's standard care plan) and thereafter at 1, 2, 5
      and 10 years post hospital discharge.

      There are 5 study centres taking part in this project enrolling in total a maximum of 160
      patients.
