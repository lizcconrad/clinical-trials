    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the metabolic and clinical results of two well recognized and accepted
      surgical techniques in the management of severe hyperparathyroidism in patients under regular
      dialysis treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective randomized trial in the surgical management of severe hyperparathyroidism of
      chronic kidney disease stage V under dialysis. Patients will be randomized and they will be
      submitted to subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy with immediate heterotopic
      autograft of 45 or 90 fragments of parathyroid tissue.
