  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order for flexible sigmoidoscopy to be a successful screening procedure, the bowel must be
      free of solid matter so the endoscopist has a clear view, increasing the chance of detection
      of abnormalities. This is achieved through the use of bowel cleansing preparations, which are
      administered prior to the procedure. Enemas are the preferred method as they clear the lower
      bowel more quickly than oral formulations and do not require dietary restrictions.

      The medical device being tested in this clinical investigation is NER1008, an enema which
      contains PEG3350 (polyethylene glycol 3350). PEG3350 is an osmotic agent, which holds the
      water content in the rectum and sigmoid colon, consequently increasing stool volume,
      resulting in rectal distension and subsequent distal colon emptying. The increased colonic
      luminal content stimulates the motility, propulsive transportation and rectal evacuation of
      the distal colon content.

      This study is designed to assess the performance of NER1008 in bowel cleansing and compare
      this with the performance of Fleet® enema, which is widely used for this purpose.

          1. Healthy male or female subjects [as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory test values, vital signs and 12-lead electrocardiograms
             (ECG's) at screening] aged 18 to 45 years.
