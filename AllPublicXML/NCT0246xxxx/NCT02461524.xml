               -  Subject has vascular dimensions, e.g., aortic and iliac diameters, lengths from
                  renal arteries to iliac bifurcation and hypogastric arteries, in the range of
                  sizes available for the Endurant Evo AAA stent graft system (measured intima to
                  intima) and within the sizing recommendations (refer to Endurant Evo AAA stent
                  graft system Instructions for Use (IFU))

               -  Subject has a proximal aortic neck diameter ≥18 mm and ≤32 mm

               -  The distal fixation center of the iliac arteries must have a diameter ≥7 mm and ≤
                  25 mm bilaterally for the bifur and unilaterally for the Aorto-Uni-Iliac (AUI)

               -  Subject has documented imaging evidence of at least one patent iliac and one
                  femoral artery, or can tolerate a vascular conduit that allows introduction of
                  the Endurant Evo AAA stent graft system

               -  Subject has distal non-aneurysmal iliac (cylindrical) fixation length ≥ 20 mm

         14. Subject has significant aortic thrombus and/or calcification at either the proximal or
             distal attachment centers that would compromise fixation and seal of the device at the
             discretion of the investigator

         15. Subject has ectatic iliac arteries requiring bilateral exclusion of hypogastric blood
             flow

         16. Subject whose arterial access site is not anticipated to accommodate the diameter of
             the Endurant Evo AAA delivery system (13F-17F) due to vessel size, calcification, or
             tortuosity

         17. Subject is morbidly obese or has other documented clinical conditions that severely
             inhibit radiographic visualization of the aorta at the discretion of the investigator

         18. Subject has active infection at the time of the index procedure documented by e.g.
             pain, fever, drainage, positive culture and/or leukocytosis considered to be
             clinically significant per investigator discretion

         19. Subject has congenital degenerative collagen disease, e.g., Marfan's Syndrome

         20. Subject has a creatinine level &gt;2.00 mg/dl (or &gt;176.8 µmol/L)

         21. Subject is on dialysis
