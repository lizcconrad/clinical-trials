      This randomized clinical trial studies how well gentle yoga and dietary counseling lifestyle
      change effects physical function and quality of life of endometrial cancer survivors. Gentle
      yoga and dietary counseling may help improve physical function and quality of life for stage
      I-II endometrial cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and efficacy of a combined lifestyle intervention (yoga +
      diet) to positively impact physical function and quality of life for endometrial cancer
      survivors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants undergo onsite gentle yoga once weekly over 45-60 minutes for 8 weeks and
      home-based gentle yoga for 6 weeks. Participants also undergo dietary counseling over 8
      weeks.

      ARM II: Participants undergo enhanced usual care designed to educate on best practices for
      exercise, diet and lifestyle change once weekly for 14 weeks.
