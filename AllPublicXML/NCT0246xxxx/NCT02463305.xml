    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the effects that creatine monohydrate has on disease
      activity in ulcerative colitis. Creatine is a substance that is naturally produced by the
      body and is found in foods, such as meat and fish. Creatine helps to provide energy to some
      body tissues, such as the colon. In the colon, this energy allows cells to form a tight
      barrier between molecules in digested food and bacteria and the body's infection-fighting
      cells within the colon underneath this barrier. If the barrier becomes &quot;leaky&quot; molecules may
      pass through and lead to inflammation. This &quot;leakiness&quot; may contribute to the colon
      inflammation seen in ulcerative colitis.
