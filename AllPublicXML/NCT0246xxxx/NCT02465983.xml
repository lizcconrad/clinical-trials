      This is a study in which pancreatic cancer patients receive a combination therapy with
      CART-meso cells and CART19 cells administered at 3 days after one dose of cyclophosphamide.
      CART-meso cells are patients' own T cells that were modified in the laboratory to express a
      receptor specific to the mesothelin protein. CART19 cells are patients' own T cells that were
      modified in the laboratory to express a receptor specific to a protein called CD19. The CD19
      protein is expressed on white blood B cells. CART19 cells are expected to attack the B cells
      and impede the antibody response against CART-meso cells. The investigators hypothesize that
      this combination therapy may prolong the duration of CART-meso cells in the body.
      Additionally, one dose of cyclophosphamide may enhance engraftment and persistence of CART
      cells.

      Immunotherapy is a novel and promising approach for the treatment of solid tumors;
      immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (CART cells) in particular has the
      potential advantage of targeted therapies that can invoke a rapid tumor response, and the
      advantage of long-lived responses that are the hallmark of engagement of the adaptive immune
      system such as memory T cells.

      This is a single arm, open-label, phase I study to determine the safety and feasibility of
      combination CART-meso cells (autologous T cells lentivirally transduced to express
      anti-mesothelin scFv fused to TCRζ and 4-1BB costimulatory domains) and CART19 cells
      (autologous T cells lentivirally transduced to express a humanized anti-CD19 scFv fused to
      TCRζ and 4-1BB costimulatory domains) in patients with pancreatic cancer following
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide.

    <description>A single dose of CART-meso-19 T cells (combination therapy with CART-meso and CART19 cells) will be administered intravenously as two separate infusions. The dose is 1-3x107/m2 (Cohort 1) or 1-3x108/m2 (Cohort 2) CART positive cells. The infusion will be scheduled to occur 3 (±1) days after a single dose of 1.5 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide, which will be administered according to standard procedures in the outpatient setting.</description>
