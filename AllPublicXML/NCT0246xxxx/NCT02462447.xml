  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Men with and without prostate cancer will have a PET/CT scan that measures the level of the
      amino acid sarcosine. PET is a scanning method that uses short lived radioactivity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissue levels of the amino acid sarcosine are elevated in prostate cancer compared to normal
      prostate tissues and further increased in metastases from prostate cancer. This research
      project is designed to test whether 11C-sarcosine (a chemical that is linked to short lived
      radioactivity) would be useful to detect prostate cancer in men using PET/CT imaging. The
      uptake and distribution of 11C-sarcosine in men with known or suspected prostate cancer will
      be determined and compared with results from 11C-choline PET/CT.

    <description>Standardized uptake (SUV) values from tumor tissues relative to background, also called tumor-to-background ratios (TBR), will be determined from both, 11C-sarcosine and 11C-choline. Then TBR measurements from 11C-choline and 11C-sarcosine will be compared to identify whether 11C-sarcosine improves tumor to background image contrast relative to 11C-choline in prostate cancer.</description>
