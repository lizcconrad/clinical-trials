  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin Carotenoid Scores (SCS) are a biomarker of overall antioxidant status. This study
      extends an earlier study in which an increase in skin carotenoid scores (SCS) was observed in
      subjects who increased their intake of fruits and vegetables. The scores were determined
      using the Raman Spectroscopy. In that study subjects were assigned to one of four groups
      based on their baseline SCS. For unknown reasons, the groups with the highest and lowest
      baseline SCS failed to show an increase whereas the two intermediate groups did. One possible
      explanation might be that intakes varied more than expected and was not obvious due to
      self-reporting of intake of fruits and vegetables with different contents.

      This current project will be an interventional, non-invasive study examining changes in skin
      carotenoid levels over time in individuals who increase their carotenoid intake by taking a
      dietary supplement containing a known amount of carotenoids. After a two-week control period
      eating their normal diet, forty medical students meeting study inclusion criteria will be
      asked to take a dietary supplement over an eight week period of time. Students will be given
      twin-sachet packets of LifePak Nano supplements containing five capsules (dry ingredients)
      and two CR-6 Liponutrient softgel capsules (liquid ingredients, including omega-3 fatty acids
      and nanosized carotenoids). These will be taken twice a day with eight ounces of liquid at
      the morning and evening meal. SCS will be measured every 2 weeks. At the end of this period,
      the students will be asked to discontinue dietary supplement intake and follow their usual
      diet for 2 weeks then their SCS measured again.

    <description>Skin Carotenoid Scores (SCS) are a biomarker of overall antioxidant status. The purpose of this study is to measure changes in SCS in medical students taking dietary supplements over a 12-week period of time. SCS will measured using a Bio-photonic Scanner. This scanner non-invasively measures carotenoid levels in the skin using optical signals. By placing the palm of the hand in front of a low-energy blue light for less than two minutes, the scanner can determine the SCS.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical students must be willing to maintain the increased consumption of dietary
             supplements, two twin-sachet packets of seven (7) supplements twice per day, for the

             the times that measurements will be made. Individuals taking non-Pharmanex dietary
             supplements e.g. vitamins, minerals, herbals, and/or antioxidants will be asked to
             discontinue use at the time of the consenting to the study. Study supplements will
             replace all previous dietary supplements.

          2. BMI between 20 and 29.9

          3. Non-smoker, non-pregnant, non-lactating

          2. Individuals suffering from any chronic illness requiring ongoing medication, such as
             diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, GI disorders or other metabolic disorders

          3. Individuals allergic or intolerant to shellfish,

          4. pregnant or lactating women,

          5. smokers
