      This is a single-center, prospective, non-randomized, observational study to evaluate
      specific proteogenomic biomarker panels for acute rejection (AR) and chronic allograft
      nephropathy/interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (CAN/IFTA) in blood, urine and kidney
      tissue (biopsy) in kidney transplant recipients. Proteogenomic profiles will be routinely
      monitored over one year after enrollment.

      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this phase of the study is to allow the clinical site to gain
      familiarity with patient recruitment, sample and data collection, and interpretation of the
      proteogenomic biomarker report provided, through retrospective analysis. This phase of the
      study will provide a platform for the transplant physicians to gain confidence with the
      format, logistics, and potential use of the biomarker tests on blood and tissue.

B. STUDY DESIGN: Enroll 20 subjects who are post-transplant and are undergoing kidney transplant biopsies at the UC Davis transplant center. Ten subjects will be enrolled who are receiving surveillance &quot;protocol biopsies&quot; and 10 subjects.</description>

      Laboratory evaluations: The UC Davis laboratory will be used for clinical chemistry, and
      hematology, as well as other outside laboratories that the participants may go to

        1. Hematology: Routine hematological parameters will be analyzed as indicated by standard
           clinical care

        2. Clinical chemistry: Routine clinical chemistry parameters will be analyzed including
           basic and comprehensive metabolic profiles as indicated by standard clinical care
           Immunologic Profiles: As per standard routine monitoring with both indicated and
           surveillance biopsies, donor specific antibodies will be monitored

        post-transplant and are undergoing kidney transplant biopsies at the UC Davis transplant
        center. Ten subjects will be enrolled who are receiving surveillance &quot;protocol biopsies&quot;
        and 10 subjects who will be receiving &quot;for cause&quot; biopsies in the setting of an elevated
        serum creatinine or proteinuria. Samples of blood, and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
        biopsy tissue will be sent to Transplant Genomics INC. (TGI) for study purposes. In
        addition, clinical data will be collected on each subject.. Blood and tissue will be
        analyzed by TGI using Affymetrix microarrays, and reports will be sent to UC Davis
        retrospectively. Samples may be batch-shipped and results will not be reported in real
        time. These results will be compared to both the histological diagnosis, and to the
        clinical course.
