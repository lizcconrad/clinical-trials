  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized and controlled study to find out if a rotational
      thromboelastometry(ROTEM) guided treatment protocol reduces the need for blood transfusions
      in major obstetric haemorrhage compared to standard care of clinical decision making,
      conventional coagulation tests and massive transfusion protocol. Secondary aim is to find out
      if ROTEM can predict the incidence of thromboembolic events in this patient group.

    <textblock>
      A comparison of two different treatment protocols is made in patients suffering major
      obstetric haemorrhage: those who after a normal delivery are bleeding more than 1000 ml and
      are in need of surgical intervention to control the bleeding and those in cesarean section
      with ongoing bleeding of more than 1000 ml. Patients are randomized in to two groups: the
      control group(n=30) will be treated according to a protocol based on clinical decision
      making, standard coagulation tests and massive transfusion packages of blood products(1:1:1),
      if needed. This is referred as 'Standard care' in this hospital. The intervention group(n=30)
      will be treated according to a rotational thromboelastometry guided protocol, and massive
      transfusion packages, if needed. The study is powered to detect a reduction of one unit in
      red blood cell transfusion. Blood product, fibrinogen concentrate, prothrombin complex
      concentrate usage and total amount of blood loss will be compared, and the number of
      transfusion related side effects and thromboembolic events 30 days after the bleeding will be
      recorded.

    <description>Rotational thromboelastometry results are used to guide the treatment of major obstetric hemorrhage, eg. administration of prothrombin complex concentrate, fresh-frozen plasma, fibrinogen concentrate or platelets. In case of massive hemorrhage, &quot;shock packs&quot; of blood products in 1:1:1 ratio are administered.</description>
