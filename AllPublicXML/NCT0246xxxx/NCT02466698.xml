  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium Difficile infections (CDIs) are treated initially with antibiotic therapy and
      supportive care, with surgical intervention reserved for patients with significant systemic
      toxicity or perforation. Severe CDI may be refractory to medical management and require
      surgical intervention, carrying a mortality of approximately 40%.

      Mortality associated with CDI increases significantly as the severity of the infection
      increases. In patients failing medical management, earlier operation is associated with
      decreased mortality. However, the lack of validated tools to predict the necessity for
      surgical intervention, combined with the significant morbidity associated with total
      colectomy significantly reduces the likelihood of patients receiving early surgical
      intervention. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess the addition of intestinal PEG
      lavage via nasojejunal tube to usual care in the treatment of adult patients with severe CDI
      who have no immediate indication for surgical intervention.

    <textblock>
      Despite a lack of definitive evidence, total abdominal colectomy (TAC) is currently
      recommended as the surgical intervention of choice in the setting of severe-complicated CDI.
      This recommendation was based on meta-analysis of studies comparing TAC to partial colectomy
      or other surgery (such as exploratory laparotomy without colectomy, or ostomy formation) or
      no surgery, which did not find any statistical mortality difference. This recommendation is
      based on the results of sensitivity analysis and an expert panel consensus that considered
      the potential for confounding factors such as TAC occurring later in the course of the
      disease and on sicker patients, and on anticipated patient values that would pace value on a
      definitive procedure being the initial surgical intervention.

      Given the high mortality of fulminant CDI, early surgical intervention is recommended.
      However, data regarding the optimal timing for surgical intervention is lacking.
      Meta-analyses and guidelines strongly recommend early surgical management, defined as being
      before the development of shock or the requirement for vasopressors, based on very low
      quality evidence, but with the potential for significant mortality reduction.

      On the basis of CDI being a toxin mediated inflammatory process of the colonic mucosa, Neal
      et al hypothesized that surgical diversion of the fecal stream with a loop ileostomy and
      intraoperative antegrade colonic lavage may effectively treat severe CDI. Widely referred to
      as the 'Pittsburgh Protocol,' the regimen included colonic lavage with 8 litres of
      polyethylene glycol (PEG 3350) intra-operatively after formation of a loop ileostomy,
      followed by antegrade Vancomycin flushes (500mg in 500cc Ringer's Lactate TID) and IV
      Metronidazole (500mg TID) for 10 days. The study utilized a before-and-after methodology
      comparing the experimental protocol to historical controls. Forty-two patients were submitted
      to the regimen over 18 months. Three patients required reoperation for TAC. 30-day mortality
      was 19% in the intervention cohort, compared to 50% in the control. 79% of survivors went on
      to ileostomy reversal within 6 months of surgery. One of the potential benefits of this
      regimen is that given the reduced morbidity compared to TAC, practitioners may have been
      offering surgical intervention earlier in the management of CDI and not exclusively as a
      therapy of last resort. Despite the limited sample size and methodological shortcoming of
      this study, this treatment regime has been adopted in some centres for select cases. A
      randomized controlled trial to compare this less invasive surgical approach with total
      abdominal colectomy was closed prematurely given lack of meaningful patient enrolment
      (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01441271).

      Given the positive results of fecal diversion and antegrade lavage and vancomycin flushed
      proposed by Neal et al, combined with the limited data regarding the benefit of intracolonic
      vancomycin, a novel treatment was instituted at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) to
      accomplish lavage of the colon and vancomycin flushes in an antegrade fashion using a
      nasojejunal feeding tube to facilitate delivery in select patients. The protocol allows for
      lavage and intracolonic antibiotic delivery similar to that provided by the 'Pittsburgh
      protocol' without surgical fecal diversion.

      A small preliminary cohort of patients completing this protocol at LHSC is being assessed
      retrospectively, comparing outcomes to a group undergoing the Pittsburgh protocol and initial
      total colectomy. The study was approved by the Western University Research Ethics Board (REB
      File # 104944). Interim analysis of the past 24 months includes 13 patients undergoing the
      study protocol, 9 undergoing the Pittsburgh protocol and 17 undergoing initial colectomy.
      Despite significant limitations of the study methodology, the results are encouraging and
      further study is warranted, especially given the significant mortality associated with
      fulminant CDI.

    <description>A nasojejunal tube and fecal management system will be inserted. Intestinal lavage with PEG is initiated and increased to a goal rate of 400cc/hour to a total of 8L of PEG. In the absence of an ileus, lavage should be initiated at 200cc/hr. Tolerance is confirmed if the rectal effluent volume is ≥50% of the lavage volume over the first 6 hours and no emesis has developed. If the consulting surgical service suspects a significant ileus, the lavage is initiated at 100cc/hr. If tolerance is confirmed the lavage rate is increased in a stepwise fashion. Antibiotic regimen will consist of Vancomycin 500mg via nasojejunal every 6 hours and Metronidazole 500 mg IV three times daily for 14 days. PEG will be held for 2 hours after administration of Vancomycin.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive usual care for severe CDI. This includes an antibiotic regimen of Vancomycin 500mg orally every 6 hours and Metronidazole 500mg IV three times daily for 14 days. The usual care group will receive the same antibiotic doses as the experimental arm of the study. For both arms, indications to escalate treatment to surgical intervention will ultimately be based on the clinical assessment by the surgical service. An absolute indication for surgery is perforation. Other indications such as toxic megacolon, worsening peritonitis or biochemical profile lavage are relative indications that vary according to clinician and individual patient characteristics.</description>
