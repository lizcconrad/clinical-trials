  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HPV infections are prominent among college-aged women. Although HPV vaccines decrease women's
      risk for cervical cancer, vaccination rates remain inadequate. This study explored the
      utility of an Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills intervention in promoting HPV
      vaccination knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills among college aged women.

      HPV infections are prominent among college-aged women. Although HPV vaccines decrease women's
      risk for cervical cancer, vaccination rates remain inadequate. This study explored the
      utility of an Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills intervention in promoting HPV
      vaccination knowledge, motivation, and behavioral skills among college aged women.

      Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to a single-session intervention or
      attention-control arm and were assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at
      1-month follow-up.

    <measure>Vaccination Motivation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>Consistent with studies based on the IMB model, motivation to get vaccinated was assessed through five questionnaires to measure different aspects of motivation: perceived motivation, attitudes related to getting vaccinated, perceived social norms to getting vaccinated, behavioral intentions, and perceived risk for HPV/cervical cancer.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral Skills Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>One Month</time_frame>
    <description>Consistent with studies based on the IMB model, participants' belief and confidence in their ability to get vaccinated were assessed with questions adapted from these studies.</description>

    <description>The IMB group received an HPV Vaccination Information Statement (VIS) often given to individuals prior to vaccination. In addition, they received the following:
Additional educational content related to HPV, Cervical Cancer, and HPV vaccination,
Motivational content to help identify and problem-solve benefits and barriers to vaccination,
Skills-building content, including brief communication skills training and ways to access the vaccine.</description>

    <description>The attention control group also received an HPV Vaccination Information Statement (VIS) often given to individuals prior to vaccination. In addition, to maintain consistency with the treatment's presentation format, participants watched a set of short video clips encompassing aspects of women's general and sexual health.</description>
