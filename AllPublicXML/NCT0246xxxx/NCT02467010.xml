  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib and cyclophosphamide in combination with dexamethasone has already demonstrated
      high response rates in refractory multiple myeloma. Low dose continuous cyclophosphamide,
      also called metronomic scheduling, minimize toxic side effects and eliminate the obligatory
      rest periods. Combining cyclophosphamide with bortezomib might target distinct aspects of a
      myeloma functionality.

      The objectives of the present study are whether patients with refractory or relapsed multiple
      myeloma after reinduction with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone will benefit
      from maintenance therapy with bortezomib and cyclophosphamide with acceptable side-effects.
      Recently two studies have shown with thalidomide that maintenance therapy might improve EFS
      and one study also the OS.
