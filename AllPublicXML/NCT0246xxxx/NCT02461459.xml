  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the developmental phenotype of ASD and ID and
      identify biomarkers using advanced MRI methodology predictive of ASD and ID presence and
      severity in pediatric patients with TSC. In addition, this study will be establishing
      infrastructure for the collection and storage of human bio-specimens, including genetic
      material, from TSC patients and their family members with ASD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-system disease that usually exhibits a high
      variability in clinical findings both among and within families. About 50% of individuals
      with TSC develop intellectual disability (ID) and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The
      purpose of this research study is to learn more information about ASD/ID in individuals with
      TSC through neurobehavioral assessments and magnetic resonance imaging so that ultimately
      effective treatments and interventions for ASD/ID can be realized.

      Individuals with TSC will be asked to participate in this study if they are between the ages
      of 3 and 21 years old and have been diagnosed with suspected or confirmed autism spectrum
      disorder and/or intellectual disability. Both males and females will be asked to participate.
      Additionally, to be eligible for study participation, individuals' primary communicative
      language must be English. Also, the participant and at least one biological parent will be
      asked to provide biological specimens including DNA and RNA for inclusion in the TSC RDCRN
      Biorepository.

      The study involves 5 visits (3 on site visits) over the course of two years. Study visits
      will vary in length from about 4 hours to 6 hours. Study visits involve a physical exam,
      medical history questions and neuropsychological assessments. Blood will be drawn during the
      baseline visit for DNA and RNA studies. Individuals with TSC have annual MRI scans as
      clinically indicated. The clinical scan will be extended for 15 minutes as part of this
      study.
