  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to comprehensively characterize PMS using standardized medical,
      cognitive, and behavioral measures and to track the natural history of the syndrome using
      repeated longitudinal assessments. In addition, this study will be aiming to identify
      biomarkers using neuroimaging, including diffusion tensor imaging and identify genetic
      factors which contribute to diverse phenotypes in patients with PMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) or 22q13 Deletion syndrome, caused by a loss of one copy of
      the SHANK3 gene, is characterized by global developmental delay/intellectual disability,
      motor skills deficits, delayed or absent speech, and autism spectrum disorder. The goal of
      this study is to understand more about the PMS phenotype and the biological pathways
      associated with ID and ASD in the disorder, and to establish the foundation for future
      clinical trials in PMS and in other ID/ASD-associated disorders that share signaling pathways
      with PMS.

      Individuals with PMS will be asked to participate in this study if they are between the ages
      of 3 to 21 years of age with pathogenic deletions or mutations of the SHANK3 gene at time of
      enrollment. Both males and females will be asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible
      for study participation, individuals' primary communicative language must be English. Parents
      and unaffected siblings may also be asked to consent to have blood drawn for analysis.

      The study involves 5 visits (3 on site visits ) over 2 years. Study visits involve a physical
      exam, medical history questions, blood work and neuropsychological assessments. Individuals
      who have certain clinically indicated procedures (i.e. MRI, EEG, etc.) due will have them
      done as part of the research study.
