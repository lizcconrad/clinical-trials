  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a 1-year prospective and randomized study to evaluate the
      initial efficacy of positive affect vs. an educational control to motivate physical activity
      in older adults with high burdens of chronic disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with multiple chronic diseases are at high risk for both disability and adverse
      clinical events, outcomes that can be improved with physical activity, but there have been no
      trials to establish physical activity recommendations or clinical guidelines for this
      vulnerable population. A recent randomized controlled trial conducted by Dr. Peterson
      established the efficacy of inducing positive affect—a feeling of happiness and well-being—in
      motivating physical activity in older adults with cardiovascular disease. This new randomized
      controlled trial will pilot test the a new PAIRE (Positive Affect Induction for Regular
      Exercise) intervention that is specific to older adults with multiple high-risk chronic
      illnesses versus an educational control group. This work is innovative because it will
      translate the benefits of a proven intervention focused on positive affect to increase
      physical activity in older adults with multiple high-risk chronic illnesses, one that is
      tailored to the clinical and psychosocial challenges of this particularly vulnerable
      population. This work is significant because an effective intervention promoting physical
      activity will improve outcomes for older adults with multiple high-risk chronic diseases, and
      currently one does not exist.
