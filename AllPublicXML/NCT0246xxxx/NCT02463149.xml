    <textblock>
      This project examined the effectiveness of Youth Chef Academy (YCA), a classroom-based
      experiential culinary and nutrition literacy curriculum for middle-school students. The
      primary study hypothesis was that students assigned to YCA would demonstrate greater
      improvement in F/V and whole grain consumption compared to students in the control group.
      Eight classrooms in eight public K-8 schools participated in the project. Classrooms were
      assigned to intervention or control condition in a non-randomized manner. YCA was delivered
      by project staff to all of the students in the four intervention classrooms. Students
      completed a survey to assess primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, six-week curriculum
      completion, and at twelve-week curriculum completion (YCA extended twelve-week curriculum
      cohort).
