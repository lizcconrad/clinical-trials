  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research goals include evaluating the relative impact of maternal nutritional status versus
      recent dietary intake on breast milk micronutrient composition, and evaluating the impact of
      a maternal lipid based nutrient supplement (LNS) on breast milk micronutrient composition.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes a cross sectional and an interventional component. Maternal dietary intake
      and nutritional status will be compared to breast milk micronutrient composition in a cross
      sectional manner.

      The short term effect of maternal dietary intake on breast milk micronutrient composition
      will be examined using an intervention with a controlled diet and LNS. Infants will be
      test-weighed during the LNS intervention in order to calculate the infant micronutrient
      intake from the control and LNS intervention days.

      Mother-infant dyads will be recruited into the study and the order in which they will receive
      the 3 treatments will be randomized. All mothers will receive all treatments.

      The mothers will be invited to the clinic on 4 separate occasions. During the first study
      visit, maternal blood will be collected, anthropometric indices will be assessed, and food
      frequency and demographic characteristic surveys will be administered. During the 2-4 visits,
      the LNS intervention will take place. Mothers will arrive at the clinic fasted, and a fasted
      milk collection will occur. Subsequently, mothers will be provided 3 meals based on local
      foods with low-nutrient density. Milk will be collected for 8 hours at each infant feed (ad
      libitum). A 24 hour dietary recall will be conducted. Mothers will receive 1) no LNS, 2) A
      single dose of LNS with breakfast, or 3) A single dose of LNS split into 3 parts with their
      meals throughout the day. Infants will be test weighed before and after each feed to
      calculate their nutrient intake from breast milk and the impact of the different
      supplementation schemes on their nutrient intake.
