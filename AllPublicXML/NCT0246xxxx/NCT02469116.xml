  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will be using an AUC of 6 based on creatinine clearance using
      the Carboplatin dosing formula used for Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols.

      Given that myelosuppression was significant using the docetaxel dose of 75 mg/m*2 in the
      SCOTROC trial, the prophylactic use of pegylated G-CSF in this Phase II trial is warranted.
      The expectation would be that patients will be able to receive their cycles in a more timely
      fashion, with less delays, thereby allowing for improved outcomes and decreased
      hospitalizations due to myelosuppression.

    <measure>Efficacy of Regimen as Measured by CA-125 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of treatment (approximately 18 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Progression is defined as one of the following:
Patients with elevated CA-125 pretreatment and normalization of CA-125 must show evidence of CA-125 ≥ twice the upper limit of normal on two occasions at least one week apart
Patients with elevated CA-125 pretreatment which never normalizes must show evidence of CA-125 ≥ 2 times the nadir value OR &gt; 50% increase from the nadir on two occasions at least one week apart,
Patients with CA-125 in the normal range pretreatment must show evidence of CA-125 ≥ two times the upper limit of normal on two occasions at least one week apart.
Complete response is defined as a CA-125 value &lt;13 confirmed on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart.
Partial Response is defined as a reduction of at least 50% from the original elevated CA-125 value (original value must have been &gt; 50), confirmed on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart.
Stable Disease is defined as not meeting one of the above criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD or the appearance of new lesions within 8 weeks of study entry. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, other than pleural effusions without cytological proof of neoplastic origin, in the opinion of the treating physician within 8 weeks of study entry is also considered increasing disease (in this circumstance an explanation must be provided). In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% increase in the LD is required.</description>

        <title>Efficacy of Regimen as Measured by CA-125 Response</title>
        <description>Progression is defined as one of the following:
Patients with elevated CA-125 pretreatment and normalization of CA-125 must show evidence of CA-125 ≥ twice the upper limit of normal on two occasions at least one week apart
Patients with elevated CA-125 pretreatment which never normalizes must show evidence of CA-125 ≥ 2 times the nadir value OR &gt; 50% increase from the nadir on two occasions at least one week apart,
Patients with CA-125 in the normal range pretreatment must show evidence of CA-125 ≥ two times the upper limit of normal on two occasions at least one week apart.
Complete response is defined as a CA-125 value &lt;13 confirmed on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart.
Partial Response is defined as a reduction of at least 50% from the original elevated CA-125 value (original value must have been &gt; 50), confirmed on two occasions at least 2 weeks apart.
Stable Disease is defined as not meeting one of the above criteria.</description>

        <description>Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD or the appearance of new lesions within 8 weeks of study entry. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, other than pleural effusions without cytological proof of neoplastic origin, in the opinion of the treating physician within 8 weeks of study entry is also considered increasing disease (in this circumstance an explanation must be provided). In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% increase in the LD is required.</description>
