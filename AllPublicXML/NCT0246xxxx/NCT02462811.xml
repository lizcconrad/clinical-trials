    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to compare the occurrence and severity of opioid-induced
      nausea and vomiting (OINV) associated with CL-108 to Norco®, and to demonstrate the efficacy
      of CL-108 when compared to placebo for the relief of moderate to severe pain In patients with
      moderate to severe pain following bunionectomy (osteotomy with fixation of the head of the
      first metatarsal bone).

             performed.

          -  Gender: Male or non-pregnant and non-lactating female. A female of child-bearing
             potential is eligible to participate in this study if she has a negative urine
             pregnancy test and is using an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., oral,

          -  Pain Confirm: Rating ≥ 50 mm on the baseline visual analog pain intensity scale
             (PI-VAS)

             hepatic, respiratory, or thyroid function)

             anti-emetic or anti-psychotic medication

             aides, benzodiazepines, performance/attention enhancers, marijuana, anti-depressants)
             or any drug contraindicated with hydrocodone, acetaminophen, or promethazine (except

          -  Investigation Drug Use: Use of an investigational drug within the past 30 days

          -  Participated in Study:Previous participation in this study

          -  Pregnancy, Lactation: Women who are pregnant or lactating
