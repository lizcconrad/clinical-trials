  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether a brief course of radiation therapy given to
      one area affected by the cancer will improve the chances of responding to immuno-therapy in
      the form of a medicine called MPDL3280A, an antibody against PD-L1. PD-L1 is expressed on
      lung cancers and is known to block the effects of the body's immune system in attacking the
      cancer. Blocking this PD-L1 has been shown to improve the body's immune cells to attack and
      kill the cancer cells in non-small cell lung cancer. The goal of this study is to see if
      prior treatment with radiation will allow improved recognition of the cancer by the body's
      immune cells in the presence of MPDL3280A.
