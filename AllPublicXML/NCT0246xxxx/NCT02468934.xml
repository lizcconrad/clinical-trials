    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of
      electricity) can safely and effectively reduce pain following total knee replacement. This
      study involves a device called the SPRINT System. The SPRINT System delivers mild electrical
      stimulation to nerves in the leg that received the knee replacement. The SPRINT System
      includes a small wire (called a &quot;lead&quot;) that is placed through the skin in the upper leg. It
      also includes a device worn on the body that delivers stimulation (called the SPRINT
      Stimulator).
