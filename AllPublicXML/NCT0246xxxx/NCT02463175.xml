  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery for scoliosis correction, the abnormal curvature of the spine, is a major procedure
      often undertaken in adolescents. In adult anesthesia, there is a large volume of literature
      debating how to optimize fluids administered during surgery, as both too much fluid and too
      little fluid are associated with worse outcomes. The investigators will compare fluid
      administration based on the measured amount of blood pumped by the heart during each heart
      beat (goal-directed therapy), against standard anesthetic management. The main outcomes are
      a) post-surgical kidney dysfunction, b) prevalence of intraoperative hypotension, c) volumes
      of administered fluids, and d) length of hospitalization.

      1. Written informed consent from parent/guardian and assent from the patient will be
           obtained.

        2. Each patient will be randomized into either the control arm or Cardio Q directed fluid
           therapy arm.

        3. The following standard monitors will be placed before induction of anesthesia:
           electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure and pulse oximetry. The patient is
           anesthetized in the supine position using a standardized anesthetic technique. All
           attempts will be made to maintain normothermia

        4. Following induction of anesthesia, the following will be placed: invasive arterial
           cannula, large bore intravenous cannula, Bispectral index monitor, temperature probe and
           central venous cannula (if needed).

        5. Cardiac output monitor: Following induction of anesthesia and after placement of
           appropriate lines and monitors, a transoesophageal doppler (TED) probe will be inserted
           through the mouth into the esophagus and positioned correctly. A normal saline infusion
           will be started once the patient is anesthetized at 0.5 ml/kg/hour in the line where the
           drugs will be infused.

             1. Control Group: In this group, fluid administration, using boluses of 5ml/kg of
                plasmalyte at the anesthesiologist's discretion will be used. Anesthesiologists
                will be blinded to the cardio-Q numerics on the monitor. The flow waveform and
                sound will be available to optimize probe position.

             2. Intervention groups: Boluses of 5ml/kg plasmalyte will be given when: either MAP
                drops 20% from baseline or stroke volume drops 15% from baseline. If the patient is
                fluid responsive, a further 5ml/kg of fluid will be given.

             3. Vasopressor use: MAP (and stroke volume) becomes unresponsive to a fluid bolus then
                a bolus of phenylephrine or ephedrine may be given at the anesthesiologist's
                discretion.
