      RATIONALE: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype shown to have a high
      risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) and distant metastasis (DM). The equivalent impact of
      breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy on disease-free survival in patients with
      early breast cancer has been established by a number of large randomized controlled trials
      and meta-analysis. However, ongoing dispute exists on whether TNBC is a good candidate for
      BCT.

      PURPOSE: This prospective, randomized, open, single-center Phase III clinical study is
      conducted to compare efficacy and safety of breast-conserving therapy and mastectomy in
      treating Chinese patients with early TNBC.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Operable patients with T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary To assess the impact of breast-conserving therapy on disease-free survival compared
      with mastectomy in patients with T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer.

      Secondary To assess the impact of breast-conserving therapy on locoregional recurrence-free
      survival (LRRFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) compared with mastectomy in
      patients with T1-2N0-1M0 triple-negative breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a prospective, randomized, open, single-center Phase III clinical study.

      Patients undergo either lumpectomy or mastectomy with surgical axillary staging with all
      lesions resected to negative margins based on the results of randomization generated by
      computer.

      Patients with stage I and II receive adjuvant chemotherapy using TC and TAC regimen
      respectively.

      Since all tumors are smaller than 5cm and metastatic lymph nodes are less than 4, patients
      undergoing mastectomy do not receive radiation therapy. On the hand, within 4-8 weeks after
      completion of chemotherapy, patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery receive radiation
      therapy as follows: (1) N0: Radiation therapy to whole breast (+boost to tumor bed) or
      consideration of partial breast irradiation in selected patients; (2) N1: Radiation therapy
      to whole breast (+boost to tumor bed), infraclavicular region, and supraclavicular area with
      or without radiation therapy to internal mammary nodes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then 6 months for years 3-5.

    <description>Patients undergo lumpectomy with surgical axillary staging with all lesions resected to negative margins.
Within 4-8 weeks after surgery, patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy as follows:

TAC for stage II: Docetaxel 75 mg/m + Doxorubicin 50 mg/m + Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m, cycled every 21 days for 6 cycles.
Within 4-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo radiation therapy as follows:
