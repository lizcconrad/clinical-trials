  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a well-documented syndrome that affects 42% of
      non-acclimatized individuals traveling to altitudes above 10,000 feet. Decreased barometric
      pressure, which leads to low blood oxygen levels, is the primary casual factor of AMS.
      Symptoms of AMS are characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue and
      difficultly sleeping. Moreover, when people travel to high altitude, cognitive performance
      and endurance exercise capacity are impaired. Therefore, the goal of this research is to
      identify effective pharmacological agents that will help reduce the symptoms of AMS and
      improve physical and cognitive performance at high altitude.

      The investigators will study the efficacy of the dietary supplement, quercetin, the drugs
      nifedipine (extended release) and methazolamide taken together, the drug metformin, and the
      drug nitrite in reducing symptoms of AMS and improving cognitive and exercise performance at
      high altitudes.
