    <textblock>
      ZetrOZ's Ultrasonic Diathermy device (sam(R) Professional System) is intended for use as a
      portable and wearable medical device which, when applied to various areas of the body applies
      Low Intensity Therapeutic Ultrasound (LITUS) to deep tissues. This device is FDA-cleared for
      pain reduction, treatment of muscle spasm and joint contracture, and increasing local
      circulation. This study will look at the use of therapeutic ultrasound to relieve pain and
      enhance tendon extensibility for individuals with tendinopathy over a 6 week time period.

          -  Diagnosis of tendinitis in the elbow (lateral or medial epicondyle), Achilles tendon,
             or patellar tendon based on examination of medical history and confirmed by physical
             examination including either manual movements of the injured limb, e.g., a positive
             Mill's Test for elbow tendinitis, or local tenderness upon palpation of the tendon;

          -  Body mass index (BMI) less than or equal to 30.0

          -  Not taking NSAIDs or prescription pain medications for their tendinitis, and agree to
             document all pain medication use during the study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or current diagnosis of tendon tear in treated tendon

          -  Known neuropathy

          -  Type I or Type II diabetes mellitus

          -  Had surgery in target treatment area within 6 months

          -  Refuse to agree to not increase current use or initiate new use of pain medication
             during the trial unless medically necessary to ensure patient safety

          -  Refuse to agree to not use any cream, gel, or topical solution during the
             administration of treatment other than the approved ultrasound gel provided

          -  Refuse to discontinue all other interventional treatment modalities (e.g.,
             transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, other ultrasound therapy, etc.)

          -  Have had a local corticosteroid or platelet-rich plasma injection within the past 3
             months

          -  Have participated in a clinical trial for an investigational drug and/or agent within
             30 days prior to screening
