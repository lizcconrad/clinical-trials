      Background: Aloe vera is considered to be the most promising and high-ranking agent as an
      all-purpose herbal plant amongst herbal agents used in dentistry. This study was designed to
      evaluate the clinical and microbiological effectiveness of locally delivered aloe vera gel as
      an adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

      Background: Aloe vera is considered to be the most promising and high-ranking agent as an
      all-purpose herbal plant amongst herbal agents used in dentistry. This study was designed to
      evaluate the clinical and microbiological effectiveness of locally delivered aloe vera gel as
      an adjunct to scaling and root planing in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

      Methods: Twelve subjects diagnosed with chronic generalized periodontitis were selected and
      randomly divided into two groups: Test group which received scaling and root planning (SRP)
      followed by application of aloe vera gel as a local drug delivery agent in the deepest
      periodontal pocket and control group which received SRP alone. Clinical evaluation was
      undertaken using Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Probing pocket depth (PPD), Relative
      attachment level (RAL) and Gingival marginal level (GML) and microbiologic counts (total
      colony count/ml) were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 3 months.
