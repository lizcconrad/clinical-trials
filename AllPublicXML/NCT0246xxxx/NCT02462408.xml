  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lateral parasagittal in-plane is the current conventional approach in ultrasound-guided
      infraclavicular brachial plexus block. However this technique is less popular because
      brachial plexus at the infraclavicular level runs deeper compared to its course proximally,
      often give rise to impaired needle visualisation due to its steep angle of needle trajectory
      to the ultrasound beam. A new posterior parasagittal in-plane approach was introduced to
      improve needle visibility. This approach proved feasible from our case series hence the
      investigators would like to compare it with the conventional method in this study

      This study compared the conventional lateral and posterior approach parasagittal in-plane
      ultrasound guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block for upper limb surgery. A cadaveric
      study was also performed to complement the findings.

      After obtaining approval from the Medical Ethics Committee, University Malaya Medical Centre
      (IRB reference no. 949.14 dated 17 October 2012), 46 patients undergoing upper limb surgery
      were prospectively recruited and randomized. A cadaveric dissection was also performed.

      DESIGN: Prospective randomized study

      SETTING: Single centre, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; November
      2012 to October 2013

      INTERVENTION: Ultrasound guided, lateral or posterior parasagittal in-plane infraclavicular
      brachial plexus blocks were performed on patients, depending on randomization. All blocks
      were performed using 21G x 4 inch Stimuplex A (B Braun Medical) without nerve stimulation
      plus SonoSite M-Turbo with HFL38x/ 13-6 MHz linear transducer probe. A 25-ml local
      anaesthetic admixture [Lignocaine 2% (100mg) plus Ropivacaine 0.75% (150mg)] were injected to
      all patients. A total volume of normal saline 0.9% 25ml mixed with methylene blue (0.2ml) was
      used for cadaveric study.

    <description>Success rate - was equivalent to surgical anesthesia, defined as the ability to proceed with surgery without the need for intravenous narcotics, general anaesthesia, rescue blocks or local infiltration by the surgeon.
The adequacy of block was determined during assessment of motor and sensory blockade at predetermined intervals, every 5 minutes until 30 minutes; Please refer to the study detailed description.</description>

    <time_frame>participants will be followed up throughout the procedure (performing the blocks), average time for block perfomances 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a composite outcome measure. The anaesthesia assistant would record the time required to perform the procedure as follow below description:
(i)Imaging time (defined as the time interval between contact of the ultrasound probe with the patient and the acquisition of a satisfactory sonoanatomy - a complete round short-axis view of the axillary artery), (ii) Needling time (defined as the time interval between the start of the needle insertion and the end of local anaesthetic injection through the needle), (iii) Performance time (defined as the sum of imaging and needling times). This timing definition had been published in other journals (please refer our references - 3)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety aspects and potential complications; we measured by any incidence of paraesthesia, vascular puncture, Horner's syndrome, dyspnoea and symptoms suggestive of LA toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants would be followed up throughout procedure (average duration 30 minutes), during operation (average duration 2 to 4 hours) and 1 week after the operation (via phone call)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a composite outcome measure. We measured safety aspects and potential complications by recording any incidence of paraesthesia and vascular puncture during block performances, any Horner's syndrome, dyspnoea and symptoms suggestive of local anaesthetic toxicity were routinely checked after the procedure and during surgery. To further enhance patient's safety, we would still follow up patient by phone call 1 week after the surgery</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>adequacy of block for tourniquet application</measure>
    <time_frame>participants would be followed up throughout the operation duration whether they complained of pain at torniquet site during the operation duration; average duration of operation 2 - 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of tourniquet pain; this would describe whether the block technique covers for tourniquet pain</description>
