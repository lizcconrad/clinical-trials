      single-modality phase I dose escalation toxicity study for first-line curative treatment of
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HYDRA will consist of 5 fraction SBRT treatment targeting only grossly evident disease
      localized by examination and standard diagnostic CT, MR, and PET-CT imaging. Prophylactic
      coverage of uninvolved at-risk mucosal and nodal drainage basins will be strictly disallowed.
      The initial dose cohort will be treated to a total of 42.5 Gy in five equal fractions
      delivered every other day over a two week period (biologically equivalent to 66 Gy delivered
      in 2 Gy daily fractions), drawn from our successful institutional experience with similar
      dosing and fractionation for early-stage larynx SBRT. Escalation of total dose will proceed
      in 2.5 Gy increments, up to a final target dose of 50 Gy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients older than 18 years of age with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma
             of the larynx.

          -  Stage T1-2N1-2c/T3-4N0-2c disease, as defined by American Joint Committee on Cancer
             (AJCC) criteria.

          -  ECOG (Zubrod) performance status 0-2.

          -  Must be functionally and technically fit for partial laryngectomy.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have undergone resection of primary disease.

          -  Patients who have received induction chemotherapy for their cancer diagnosis.

          -  Patients who have undergone a diverting tracheostomy which is either a) traversing
             directly through tumor, b) has been placed for true airway insufficiency. Patients
             with a tracheostomy placed preemptively for impending airway compromise remain
             eligible for enrollment.

          -  Prior cancer diagnosis, except appropriately treated localized epithelial skin cancer
             or cervical cancer.

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the head and neck region.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (a woman of child-bearing potential is a
             reproductively mature woman who has not undergone a hysterectomy or who has not been
             naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., who has had menses
             at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months]) and male participants must
             practice effective contraception (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal
             contraceptive; tubal ligation; intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with
             spermicide; or vasectomized partner) throughout the study.

          -  Patients unable or unwilling to give written, informed consent.

                  the last 6 months.

               2. Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months.

               3. Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time
                  of registration.

               4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy within 30 days before

               5. Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects;
                  note, however, that laboratory tests for liver function and coagulation
                  parameters are not required for entry into this protocol.

               6. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) based upon current CDC definition;
                  note, however, that HIV testing is not required for entry into this protocol.
                  Protocol-specific requirements may also exclude immuno-compromised patients.

               7. History of treatment with potent immunosuppressive drugs for such conditions as
                  post organ transplant, severe rheumatoid arthritis, etc. within the past 6
                  months.

          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants
