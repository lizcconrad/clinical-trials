    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) who are
      treated with fidaxomicin have less contamination of their skin and surrounding environment
      with spores of C. difficile than patients treated with other drugs (metronidazole or
      vancomycin)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fidaxomicin is a newly licensed drug for the treatment of CDI. Patients treated with
      fidaxomicin have a significantly lower C. difficile spore count in their faeces than patients
      who receive alternative drugs (metronidazole or vancomycin). In vitro evidence has shown that
      the drug persists in the gut for several weeks after treatment has finished and also prevents
      the outgrowth of spores. These findings suggest that fidaxomicin therapy could be associated
      with less contamination of CDI patient's skin and their surrounding environment than
      metronidazole or vancomycin therapy.

      This prospective, case control study aims to investigate this hypothesis by measuring C.
      difficile spore counts in patient's stool samples, on their skin and in the surrounding
      environment. Results for patients receiving fidaxomicin will be compared with those on either
      metronidazole or vancomycin.

      If fidaxomicin therapy does reduce contamination levels, it might be a useful adjunct to
      existing measures used to control CDI in healthcare settings, particularly in outbreak
      situations.
