  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Vitality HealthyFood benefit is a three-tiered incentive program designed to encourage
      healthier food choices amongst members of Discovery Health's Vitality program. Once enrolled
      in the benefit, participating members can receive 10%, 15%, or 25% cash-back on the healthy
      foods they purchase at selected grocers. And, while overall enrollment in the program is
      high, there is particular interest in increasing enrollment in the benefit amongst Vitality
      members with diabetes. One presumed barrier to enrollment in the benefit amongst members with
      diabetes is a misperception of the particular relevance of the benefit and healthier food
      choices for their personal health. Improved messaging regarding the HealthyFood benefit and
      its particular salience for individuals with diabetes may be an effective means of increasing
      activation of the benefit in this population. The proposed study will be a collaboration
      between Discovery Health/Vitality and researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the
      University of Pennsylvania. In the proposed RCT, Vitality members with diabetes will be
      randomised to different types of messages regarding the HealthyFood benefit. The
      investigators will then compare the effectiveness of these different messaging strategies at
      increasing activation of the HealthyFood benefit amongst Vitality members with diabetes.

    <description>This arm will represent current practice. This group will receive no contact from the research team.

    <description>This group will receive a message which simply cites the two specific benefits of the eating more healthy foods for individuals with diabetes. This message contains a link to start the enrolment process.</description>

    <description>This group will receive a message that includes a quote from the perspective of a Vitality member with diabetes who uses the HealthyFood benefit. Given the need to standardise message content across study arms, the quote was written by the study team and not an actual member. The quote emphasizes the positive impact the benefit has had for the memberâ€”both the financial benefit, as well as the two specific diabetes health benefits.</description>

    <description>This group will receive a message that includes a quote from a South African physician who specializes in diabetes. The quote emphasises the financial benefit and the two specific diabetes health benefits of the HealthyFood program included in the other messages. It concludes with the doctor's recommendation of the benefit for all individuals with diabetes.</description>

    <description>This group will receive a message whose first portion is identical to those in the diabetes-specific message group. The second portion of the message differs in that instead of just asking recipients to click on the provided link if interested, the message asks people to choose and click on one of following possible responses:
Yes! I want to active the HealthyFood benefit and get up to 25% cash back on the healthy food I buy at Pick n Pay or Woolworths
No, I'd prefer not to activate and continue paying full price for my healthy food purchases</description>
