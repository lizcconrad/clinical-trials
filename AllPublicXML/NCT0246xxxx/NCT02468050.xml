  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The breast cancer screening and diagnostic period is associated with heightened symptoms of
      anxiety and depression. Physical exercise has been found to effectively decrease these
      symptoms in healthy and diseased populations. This study aims to determine if a pre treatment
      exercise intervention can minimize symptoms of anxiety and depression in women undergoing
      screening for breast cancer.

      The breast cancer diagnostic process is associated with anxiety and depression. Physical
      exercise has emerged as an attractive non-pharmacologic approach to mitigating the
      psychological and physical sequelae of breast cancer and its treatments, however pre
      treatment interventions are not integrated into current practice. This study aims to
      determine the effectiveness and feasibility of a pre treatment exercise intervention in
      attenuating levels of anxiety and depression following breast biopsy and throughout the
      diagnostic period.

    <description>In addition to the weekly supervised exercise session, participants in this arm will view an instructional video. The video will deliver theory driven training of cognitive behavioural strategies for self management of exercise. It is expected that this will improve adherence to the exercise program.</description>
