      1. Objectives -The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of ERT on LV diastolic
           function and flow in patients with Fabry's cardiomyopathy using diastolic stress
           echocardiography, LV vortex flow and CMR.

        2. Primary / Secondary Endpoint 1) Primary endpoint

             -  Changes of peak exercise E/E' by diastolic stress echocardiography (RECAP-F STRESS
                trial) and LV vortex flow parameters (RECAP-F FLOW trial) at 1 year follow up.

                2) Secondary endpoint

             -  Changes of extracellular volume by CMR(T1 mapping) at 1 year follow up (RECAP-F
                trial) ② Evaluation of the degree of the resting LV diastolic function ③ Other
                echo-parameters; LV mass index at baseline, 1 year follow up, reduction of peak
                exercise E/E prime at 1 year follow up

                  -  Changes of quality of life using questionnaire ⑤ Change of peak VO2, exercise
                     time, AT by diastolic stress echocardiography at 1 year follow up ⑥ Change in
                     T1 baseline(myo, ms) &amp; T1 baseline(blood, ms) T1 postcontrast(myo, ms) &amp; T1
                     baseline(blood, ms) by CMR

        3. Study Methods 1) Study Design : 28 patients with newly diagnosed genetically confirmed
           Anderson-Fabry's disease will undergo diastolic stress echocardiography, LV vortex flow
           analysis, and cardiac MRI before enzyme replacement therapy(ERT) (baseline study) and
           after 1 year of treatment with agalsidese beta at the dose of 1mg/kg (follow-up study).

      2) Study procedures : Examinations as described below will be done before ERT and 1 year
      later
