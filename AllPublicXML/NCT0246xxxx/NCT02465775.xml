      Prospective, blinded, one arm, baseline-controlled clinical study for the evaluation the
      performance of the UltraShape treatment for non-invasive fat reduction by compare control and
      treated flanks.

      Study subjects will undergo UltraShape treatments on one randomized flank using the
      U-Sculpt/VDF Transducer. The second flank will not be treated (control). Both flanks (treated
      and control) will be compared to baseline, as well as, one to each other

      This study is a prospective, baseline and blinded controlled, comparison, clinical study
      showing the performance and safety of the UltraShape treatment for non-invasive fat reduction
      at the flanks area comparing improvement observed in treated versus control flanks.

      Up to 60 Healthy subjects in up to 4 investigational sites will be enrolled in this study.
      All subjects will undergo an assessment of their general health. During the treatment period,
      subject's fat thickness will be measured on both flanks. Three successive bi-weekly (two
      weeks interval) UltraShape treatments will be performed on one randomized flank, while the
      second flank will not be treated and served as a control.

      The study subjects will undergo UltraShape treatments on one flank using the U-Sculpt /VDF
      Transducer, the treated flank will remain steady along the study and will be comparing to the
      baseline and to the controlled flank Three follow-up visits will be conducted as follows: 4
      weeks (4wk FU), 8 weeks (8wk FU) and 16 weeks (16wk FU) post last treatment (Tx.3).

      Subject's fat thickness will be measured on both flanks in the measurements points using
      caliper at each visit (at treatment visits, prior to treatment). Ultrasound measurements will
      be taken at each visit, except for the second treatment visit, on each flank. Investigator
      satisfaction will be assessed at all FU visits. In addition, subject questionnaires will be
      completed at each follow-up visit. Photographs of the front, right, left and back view of
      each flank will be performed under visible light conditions at each study visit.
