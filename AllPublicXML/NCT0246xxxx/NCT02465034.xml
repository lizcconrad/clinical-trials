  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how different areas in the brain interact with each
      other and how using brain imaging and brain stimulation approaches can influence these
      interactions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subcortical strokes affect small vessels deep in the brain, and typically present with motor
      hemiparesis. The investigator will assess the effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (TMS) on motor function and examine how different areas in the human brain interact with each
      other using brain imaging and brain stimulation. The investigator will also evaluate the
      capacity for noninvasive stimulation to transiently modify brain activity supporting arm
      movement.

    <measure>Change in long-term potentiation-like plasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-Paired Associative Stimulation (1min post)</time_frame>
    <description>Long-term potentiation-like plasticity will be measured using paired associative stimulation (PAS). PAS consists of repeated peripheral electric stimulation paired with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) applied to the motor cortex at varying interstimulus intervals. Subjects will receive 180 paired stimuli at 0.25Hz for 12 minutes. Impaired long-term potentiation-like plasticity points towards reduced excitatory synaptic connectivity and deficits in sensorimotor integration. Decrease or no change in the amplitudes of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) indicates impaired long-term potentiation-like plasticity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in electroencephalography recordings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-Paired Associative Stimulation (5min post)</time_frame>
    <description>Electroencephalography data will be recorded using a 64-channel TMS-compatible electrode cap (Easy Cap). Signals will be collected at 2000Hz during pre- and post-transcranial magnetic stimulation epochs (-100ms to 200ms). Fifty suprathreshold (120% AMT) transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses will be applied to motor cortex while the subject is seated quietly with eyes open. This procedure will be conducted bilaterally. Single-channel evoked potentials will be defined as the area under the curve obtained between 10 and 150ms poststimulus. Lower amplitudes indicate decreased cortical activity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Nine Hole Peg Test completion times</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-Paired Associative Stimulation (10min post)</time_frame>
    <description>The Nine Hole Peg Test is administered by asking the subject to take pegs from a container, one by one, and place them into the holes on the board, as quickly as possible. Subjects are asked to then remove the pegs from the holes, one by one, and replace them back into the container. Only the hand being evaluated will perform the test. The total time taken to complete the task is recorded. Scores are based on the time taken to complete the test activity, and is recorded in seconds. The results are expressed as the number of pegs placed per second. Increased number of pegs placed per second is indicative of greater manual dexterity and increased change scores indicate the contribution of paired associative stimulation to hand dexterity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The arm function in subjects in the subcortical stroke group will be evaluated by the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). The test consists of timed and functional tasks and has 17 items. It is composed of 3 parts: Time, functional ability and strength and includes 15 function-based tasks and 2 strength based tasks. Items 1-6 involve timed functional tasks, items 7-14 are measures of strength, and the remaining 9 items consist of analyzing movement quality when completing various tasks. The examiner will test the less affected upper extremity followed by the most affected side. Scores are based on time taken to complete each task. The median time to complete all tasks will be be used to evaluate motor function. Larger values indicate greater upper extremity motor dysfunction</description>

    <measure>Change in hand-held dynamometry pressure readings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-Paired Associative Stimulation (10min post)</time_frame>
    <description>The uses a hand-held dynamometer to assess grip strength in the arm. Scores are based on force production in kilograms or pounds; kilograms (0-90), pounds (0-200). The arm being tested is not supported by examiner or armrest and the dynamometer is presented vertically and in line with the forearm. The subject is asked to apply as much grip pressure as possible to the dynamometer. The maximum reading on the dynamometer is recorded. Higher pressure scores indicate better muscle strength in the arm following paired associative stimulation.</description>
