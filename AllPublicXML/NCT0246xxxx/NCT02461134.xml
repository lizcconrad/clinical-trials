  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic graft versus host diseasre (GVHD) is a serious reaction that might occur in a person
      (the host) who has received cells or organs (graft) from another person because the graft
      attacks the host's cells. Currently there are no approved therapies for chronic GVHD in the
      USA, and patients with chroninc GVHD are treated with immunosuppressant drugs. T-lymphocytes
      (a type of white blood cells) are likely to play a role in the development of chronic GVHD.
      Due to the capacity of ponesimod to block the traffic of T-lymphocytes, ponesimod may be a
      new therapeutic approach to treat chroninc GVHD.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of several doses
      of ponesimod in subjects with chronic GVHD who did not respond to standard available
      treatments.

    <description>This outcome measure reports the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) during the treatment period and the follow-up period, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug. A treatment-emergent AE is any AE temporally associated with the use of study treatment whether or not considered by the investigator as related to study treatment.</description>

    <description>The exploratory efficacy endpoint is based on the 2014 NIH Consensus Development Project response criteria. A complete overall response is defined as a resolution of all reversible manifestations due to chronic GVHD in each organ as defined per NIH Consensus Development Project response criteria. A partial overall response is defined as improvement in a measure for at least one organ without progression in measures for any other organ.</description>
