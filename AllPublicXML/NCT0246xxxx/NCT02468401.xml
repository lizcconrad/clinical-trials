    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need to find effective strategies for the prevention of contrast induced
      nephropathy in patients with advanced renal dysfunction. The current study was designed to
      assess the efficacy of a new protocol for preventing contrast induced nephropathy in patients
      with advanced renal dysfunction undergoing coronary interventions
