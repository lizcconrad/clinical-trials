  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain condition affecting several millions of Canadians.
      Although the etiology and pathophysiology are poorly understood, there is a well-recognized
      association between muscular pain in fibromyalgia and muscular hypoperfusion, hypoxia,
      abnormal muscle metabolism and oxidative stress. Currently there is no cure for FM.
      Pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies are directed to control symptoms such as
      pain, fatigue, non-restorative sleep and depression.

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is an intermittent inhalation of 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric
      chamber at a pressure higher than 1 absolute atmosphere. Physiological effect of HBOT is
      based on a dramatic increase in the amount of dissolved oxygen carried by the blood which
      enables oxygenation of ischemic areas with compromised circulation. It also activates
      oxidant-antioxidant system, stimulates angio- and neurogenesis, modulates inflammatory
      response, induces brain neuroplasticity and possesses analgesic effect.

      While some interventions offer benefit for some patients, additional treatment alternatives
      are needed for patients with FM in whom currently available options are either ineffective or
      poorly tolerated. Given its physiological effect, HBOT could be considered as a potential
      therapy for treatment of underlying muscular hypoxia, optimizing oxidant- antioxidant system
      and controlling FM symptoms. The results from this study could therefore provide new
      information supporting the basic science underling the pathophysiology of this disease and
      stimulate novel therapies for patients suffering with FM.

    <description>If a participant is randomized to the group receiving the intervention, the participant will be receiving a baseline assessment functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and subsequently receiving hyperbaric oxygen treatment for 90 minutes, once daily, five times a week for 8 consecutive weeks (40 treatments with 100% oxygen at 2.0 ATA). A follow-up fMRI will be performed after the last day of treatment.</description>

    <description>If the participant is assigned to the cross group, the participant will also receive a baseline assessment functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, it will be followed-up in a controlled manner for 3 months. After 3 months, the participant will be receiving hyperbaric oxygen treatment identical to Group A and a follow-up fMRI will be performed after the last treatment.</description>
