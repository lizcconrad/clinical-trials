      This study is a prospective, baseline and blinded controlled, one arm clinical study showing
      the performance and safety of the UltraShape treatment for non-invasive fat and circumference
      reduction at the flanks area.

      Up to 60 Healthy subjects in up to 4 investigational sites will be enrolled in this study.
      All subjects will undergo an assessment of their general health. During the treatment period,
      subject's circumference and fat thickness will be measured and three successive bi-weekly
      (two weeks interval) UltraShape treatments will be performed.

      The study subjects will undergo UltraShape treatments on the flanks area using the U-Sculpt
      /VDF Transducer.

      During the follow-up period visit will be conducted as follow: 4 weeks (4wk FU), 8 weeks (8wk
      FU) and 16 weeks (16wk FU) post last treatment (Tx.3). Subject's circumference will be
      measured in the measurements points according to the flanks treated area, circumference
      reduction will be assessed at each visit. Additionally, a subject questionnaire will be
      completed in each follow-up visit. Finally, photography will be performed under visible light
      conditions of the front, right, left and back view. Most of the assessments will occur at
      each of the visits to the clinic.
