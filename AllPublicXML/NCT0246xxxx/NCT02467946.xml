  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment outcome with ABVD in elderly patients remains inferior to adults. Moreover,
      Bleomycin-induced lung toxicity in the elderly has been reported as high as 46%. For these
      reasons, questions arise whether ABVD could be still considered the standard treatment in HL
      patients aged &gt; than 60. Regimens containing other alkylators such as CHOP proved even
      superior to ABVD, with a 3-y PFS of 67%. Frontline treatment of advanced-stage HL with
      Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) in association with AVD (Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine)
      proved very active in a pioneer study, reporting the preliminary results of a phase 1
      multicentre trial, in which the percentage of patients achieving CR was as high as 92%. For
      all these reason the investigators decided to test the association of an alkylator with an
      innovative mechanism of action and a very safe toxicity profile in the elderly such as
      Bendamustine (Be) with BV in untreated elderly HL patients.

      The combination of BV and Be, investigated in this study, might represent an innovative
      treatment alternative for HL patients older than 60 years of age, especially for those of
      them in whom ABVD chemotherapy, the current standard front-line treatment, is not suitable.
      However, even when ABVD is given as upfront treatment for elderly HL patients, it is
      associated with substantial dose reduction, treatment delay, toxicity, and treatment-related
      mortality, with treatment outcomes remaining much inferior to those obtained in younger
      patients. This drug association is expected to be safe, well-tolerated and to demonstrate
      higher efficiency compared with ABVD. In this setting, it is expected that this therapy could
      be offered to the large majority of elderly patients with a full treatment completion reached
      in up to 80% of these patients.

      Thus, the aim of this study will be to assess safety and efficacy of the above association.
