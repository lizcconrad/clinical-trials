        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects of any race or ethnicity with an age adjusted for any
             prematurity of ≥1 month and ≤24 months.

          -  Diagnosis of RSV infection by virological.

          -  Subject must weigh &gt;3 kg at screening.

          -  Must have provided written informed consent for the subject to participate.

          -  For patients aged &lt;12 months, and occipitofrontal head circumference (OFHC) within the
             normal range for age and gender.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has taken, is currently taking or requires any restricted medications.

          -  Subject is known to be HIV-positive (or the mother, if the potential subject is a
             child aged &lt;6 months).

          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to the
             date of screening.

          -  Requires vasopressors or inotropic support at the time of enrollment.

          -  Concurrent gastrointestinal conditions that could, in the opinion of the investigator,
             prejudice absorption of the Investigational Medicinal Product (e.g. protracted
             vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, a history of necrotising enterocolitis with
             consequent short gut syndrome).

          -  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic lung disease requiring assisted ventilation at
             the time of enrollment.

          -  Diminished ventilatory reserve at risk for hypercapnia (e.g. pulmonary hypoplasia,
             sequestration syndromes, cystadenomatoid malformation, a history of surgery for
             diaphragmatic hernia).

          -  Left to right shunt meriting corrective therapy.
