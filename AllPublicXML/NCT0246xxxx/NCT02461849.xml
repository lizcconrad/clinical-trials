  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to stem-cell factor (SCF), activating a series
      of downstream effector pathways. KIT is an established therapeutic target in cancer with
      activating mutations of KIT, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and significant
      benefit is achieved with various small molecule inhibitors of KIT such as imatinib mesylate.
      Moreover, there is increasing evidence implicating KIT mutations as tractable therapeutic
      targets in melanoma. Additional information is required to characterize the functional role
      of low-frequency mutations in KIT and to determine whether amplification of wild type KIT is
      a real driver that can be targeted therapeutically. Except GIST and melanoma, other solid
      cancers were reported to have KIT mutation even in low frequency. A molecular profiling of
      the tumors of patients referred to the phase I clinic at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
      showed KIT mutation in 7 patients in total of 431 patients (2%).

      Hence, the investigators planned this study to apply the molecularly targeted agent, imatinib
      to various types of cancers harboring KIT mutation or amplification.
