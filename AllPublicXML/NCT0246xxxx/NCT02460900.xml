  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The single greatest health behavior change that could improve cardiovascular morbidity and
      associated mortality is to assist people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke to quit. The
      investigators will use a factorial design to evaluate the most promising behavioral and
      pharmacologic treatments aimed at achieving maximal efficacy for smoking cessation among
      people living with HIV/AIDS who smoke. Results of this study will provide crucial, real world
      evidence of the best way for healthcare providers to help smokers living with HIV/AIDS quit
      smoking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a factorial design strategy to evaluate the effects, individually and in
      combination, of the most promising pharmaco- and behavioral cessation therapies available for
      PLWH according to our review of the extant literature for HIV-infected and general population
      smokers. The sizable cohort and prospective design will also permit us to evaluate the
      effects of tobacco use, treatment, and cessation on a panel of soluble biomarkers of
      inflammation that are likely contributors to cardiac morbidity and mortality in people living
      with HIV/AIDS. The specific aims of our proposal are:

      Primary Aim 1: Compare varenicline to placebo on rates of 7-day point prevalence abstinence
      (PPA) at 24 weeks in smokers with HIV/AIDS. We hypothesize that rates of smoking abstinence
      at week 24 will be higher in those treated with varenicline compared to placebo.

      Primary Aim 2: Compare Positively Smoke Free to low intensity, brief counseling on rates of
      7-day PPA at 24 weeks in smokers with HIV/AIDS. We hypothesize that rates of smoking
      abstinence at week 24 will be higher in those treated with Positively Smoke Free compared to
      brief counseling.

      Secondary Aim: Compare Positively Smoke Free + varenicline to the other two study conditions
      outlined above on rates of 7-day PPA in smokers with HIV/AIDS at 24 weeks. We hypothesize the
      effect of PSF with varenicline is greater than the effect of PSF or varenicline alone.

      Exporatory Aim: Explore the effect of successful cessation/smoking abstinence on levels of
      cardiac specific biomarkers, nicotine biomarkers, generalized markers of inflammation,
      lipids, coagulation and monocyte/macrophage activation. We hypothesize that smoking cessation
      will be associated with significant reductions in levels of these biomarkers and
      monocyte/macrophage activation.
