  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of fidaxomicin in Solid Organ
      Transplant (SOT) recipients (heart, lung, kidney, liver, kidney-pancreas, and pancreas) with
      a first-episode of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with fidaxomicin 200 mg PO twice daily for 10 days. The rate of
      sustained clinical response (SCR; cure without recurrence at 30 days) will be assessed and
      compared to a historical cohort of SOT recipients who received standard of care therapy for
      CDI at our institution. The data for the historical control group will be collected under a
      separate IRB-approved protocol. Standard of care therapy will be considered oral or
      intravenous metronidazole and / or oral vancomycin. The study will be powered to show
      non-inferiority of fidaxomicin compared to standard of care treatment in SOT recipients.
