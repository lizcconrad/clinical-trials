  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left Ventricular Assist Devices are commonly used to assist failing hearts as a bridge to
      transplantation or for long-term support. The purpose of the MESenchymal stem cell therapy
      and Left Ventricular Assist Device program is to improve heart function with stem cell
      therapy and attempt to wean patients from HeartMate Left Ventricular Assist Device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently Left Ventricular Assist Device-only patients are being implanted and followed.
      Feasibility of autologous mesenchymal stem cell grafting in patients receiving heart mate
      will be assessed in a 4 patient pilot trial. Mesenchymal stem cell are delivered during Left
      Ventricular Assist Device surgery by intramyocardial infusions. Recovery of contractile
      function of the heart is assessed during attempts to wean patients from Left Ventricular
      Assist Device
