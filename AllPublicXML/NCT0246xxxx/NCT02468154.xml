      Assess whether by placing a &quot;custom made&quot; splint with heel in the immediate postoperative
      period until removal of the cast, the rate of pain, the number of healthcare interventions to
      maintain the off-loaded heel position and number of pressure sores in children wearing lower
      limb plaster casts is reduced.
