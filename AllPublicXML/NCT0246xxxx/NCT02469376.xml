    <textblock>
      Arterial and venous thrombi play an important role in various vascular diseases such as
      myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and pulmonary embolism. These
      thromboembolic disorders are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A
      non-invasive method for the quantitative and effective detection of thrombi in the whole body
      has not yet been established. In spite of the available techniques, 30% to 40% of ischemic
      strokes &quot;cryptogenic&quot; (undetermined cause, the source of thromboembolism is never
      identified). Possible causes of cryptogenic stroke atherosclerosis include in the aortic arch
      or intracranial arteries. A plaque in the arch or other large vessels could be an important
      source of cryptogenic strokes, however, are those difficult to detect by routine methods. The
      approach of thrombus targeted molecular imaging could identify potentially troublesome
      plaques early on before they become a dangerous rupture. The hypothesis is that the
      radiotracer 18F-arterial GP1 and venous thrombi using positron emission tomography (PET) can
      be made visible. The primary goal is the potential applicability of the substance as a PET
      tracer for diagnosing thrombi.
