      This is a phase 1, multi-center, open-label study of the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of young (&lt;30 years of age) healthy male donor
      plasma transfusions in patients with PSP. Up to 10 subjects will receive once monthly 4-unit
      transfusions of young healthy male donor plasma for 6 months.

      plasma transfusions in patients with PSP. Up to 10 subjects will receive once monthly 4-unit
      transfusions of young healthy male donor plasma for 6 months.

      If ≥3 subjects experience drug limiting toxicity (DLT), as defined in Section 7.19, the study
      will be terminated. Any subject that experiences a DLT will be discontinued from further
      treatment with the study drug.

      An interim futility analysis will be performed after five subjects have completed 6 months of
      study drug treatment. If the criteria listed in Section 9.3 of this protocol are met, an
      additional 5 subjects will be enrolled in the trial. If not, the trial will be terminated.
