    <textblock>
      Nodding Syndrome is an enigmatic neuropsychiatric syndrome affecting children and adolescents
      mostly in Eastern Africa. The symptoms of Nodding Syndrome and catatonia seem to overlap. The
      researchers' objectives in this study were to investigate the presence and types of catatonic
      symptoms in children with Nodding Syndrome and observe their response to one or two doses of
      lorazepam, the first-line treatment for catatonia.

      In this pilot study, the investigators examined a convenient sample of children and
      adolescents with Nodding Syndrome (NS) for catatonic symptoms using standardized criteria.
      The investigators also tested whether oral lorazepam (LZP) administered to those who
      qualified to have pediatric catatonia would alleviate symptoms. This was a cross-sectional
      descriptive study of catatonia in NS patients in Northern Uganda and an exploratory study of
      using one or two doses of lorazepam as a catatonia test.

      All the children with confirmed NS that had 2 or more of symptoms of catatonia were recruited
      to undergo the catatonia test using oral Lorazepam EG® (n.v. Eurogenerics s.a. Brussels,
      Belgium) using the 1 mg formulation tablets. It was proposed to perform a catatonia test
      using Lorazepam (LZP) as first choice medication, as this is the medication that has been
      used most commonly in pediatric catatonia.

      The amount of drug given was based on the weight of the child. The lower dose (0.5 mg) was
      used as starting dose for patients with &lt;30 kg body weight, while the higher dose (1 mg) as
      the starting dose for patients with &gt;30 kg body weight.

      A positive response to a catatonia test consisted of a reduction in catatonic symptoms, 30 or
      60 minutes later, by at least 50% .Positive responses were documented by video footage before
      and after administration of LZP.

      If no response to the initial dose of LZP, was observed after one hour, a second
      administration of the same medication at double the dose was given. Catatonia was again
      assessed at 30 and 60 minutes thereafter. If no response was observed, the test was
      considered negative.

    <description>Children with confirmed Nodding syndrome that had 2 or more of the symptoms on the 10-item Kampala Catatonia Panel (KCP) scale were recruited to undergo the catatonia test using oral Lorazepam EG® (n.v. Eurogenerics s.a. Brussels, Belgium) using the 1 mg formulation tablets. The amount of Lorazepam (LZP) drug given orally was based on the weight of the child. The lower dose (0.5 mg) was used as starting dose for patients with &lt;30 kg body weight, while the higher dose (1 mg) as the starting dose for patients with &gt;30 kg body weight.
A positive response to a catatonia test consisted of a reduction in catatonic symptoms, 60 minutes later, by at least 50% assessed by the KCP (using all 10 items). If no response to the initial dose of LZP, was observed after one hour, a second administration of the same medication at double the dose was given. Catatonia was again assessed at 60 minutes thereafter. If no response was observed, the test was considered negative.</description>
