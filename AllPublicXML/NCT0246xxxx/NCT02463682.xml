      This is a feasibility study of an artificial pancreas (AP) system with our previously
      validated Zone-MPC and Health Monitoring System (HMS) algorithms (ClinicalTraisl.gov:
      NCT01929798) integrated into the Diabetes Assistant (DiAs) system. The system will be
      evaluated on 2-3 subjects per site (n=6-9 subjects) for 2 weeks at 3 different sites (William
      Sansum Diabetes Center, University of Virginia, and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Basal rates
      will be adjusted in a run-to-run manner by study physicians prior to the closed-loop phase
      for a maximum of 3 weeks. Subjects will then complete 2 weeks at home use of the Zone-MPC/HMS
      system using the DIAs platform for a closed-loop feasibility trial. The purpose of this pilot
      study is to establish that safe day-and-night use of the Zone-MPC/HMS system integrated into
      the DiAs is achievable in the home environment, to analyze and learn to improve upon the
      run-to- run optimization process, and to collect efficacy data to inform a future larger
      study.

    <description>The artificial pancreas system will be allowed to employ its Model Predictive Control algorithm to make decisions about insulin delivery based on measured glucose levels. The Health Monitoring System algorithm uses the same CGM data as the MPC control algorithm but utilizes a separate algorithm for trending and predictions of future glucose values. Using a redundant and independent algorithm is an important safety feature of the overall AP device.</description>
