  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether full-mouth disinfection is effective in the
      initial periodontal treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis on clinical parameters
      and gingival crevicular fluid interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) levels
      compared with conventional initial periodontal treatment and full-mouth initial periodontal
      treatment.

      The investigators' hypothesis is to test whether full-mouth disinfection in the initial
      periodontal treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis enhance the clinical and
      biochemical parameters in comparison to conventional initial periodontal treatment and
      full-mouth initial periodontal treatment.

      The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of conventional initial periodontal treatment
      (C-IPT), full-mouth disinfection IPT (FMD-IPT) and full-mouth IPT (FM-IPT) and the levels of
      gingival crevicular fluid interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) in patients with
      generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) over 6-months period. Forty-two GAgP patients
      were randomly assigned into 3 groups. IPT was performed in a quadrant-wise manner at 1-week
      intervals in C-IPT, in 2 sessions within 24 hours in FM-IPT, and in 2 sessions with
      application of chlorhexidine to the intra-oral niches within 24 hours in FMD-IPT. FMD-IPT
      group also used daily 0,2% chlorhexidine for 3 weeks. At baseline, 3 and 6 months clinical
      parameters consisting of plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and
      clinical attachment level were recorded and gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected.
      Gingival crevicular fluid levels of IL-1β and IL-17 were analyzed using ELISA.
