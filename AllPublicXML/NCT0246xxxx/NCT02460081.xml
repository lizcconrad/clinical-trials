    <textblock>
      Study PDA-002-DFU-003 is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled, dose range finding study in subjects who have diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)
      with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The study will enroll approximately 24 subjects. This
      study will investigate the hemodynamic effects, clinical efficacy, and safety of 3 monthly
      intramuscular (IM) injections of PDA-002 in subjects who have DFU with PAD.
