      This prospective cohort study will provide information about:

      Characteristics of Rivaroxaban use in patients who are prescribed Rivaroxaban for the first
      time compared to patients who are prescribed standard of care for the first time.

      The occurrence of intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal and urogenital bleeding, and the
      occurrence of non-infective liver disease.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Descriptive analysis of demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who are prescribed oral rivaroxaban for the first time in comparison with those who are prescribed standard of care for the first time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The following data will be collected and assessed at 2 and 4 years after rivaroxaban market authorization: • age and sex distribution at index date • dose of rivaroxaban at index date • diagnosis associated with the prescribing of the index drug • use of specific prescribed medications confirming ACS indication • use of other prescribed medications • comorbidity based on diagnoses • renal impairment • healthcare utilization (e.g. outpatient visits and hospital admissions)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and effectiveness: occurrence of hospitalization for a) intracranial haemorrhage, (b) gastrointestinal bleeding, (c) urogenital bleeding among users of rivaroxaban in comparison with individuals receiving current standard of care</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The two cohorts will be followed up from the index date until 12 months after the end of the enrolment period for potential outcomes For descriptive purposes, annualized crude incidence rates of the major bleeding events will be calculated, accompanied by 95% confidence intervals.
For evaluation of safety and effectiveness outcome events, Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used. Propensity score matching will be done to account for confounding by indication.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of hospitalization for bleeding events not specified as primary safety outcomes (&quot;other bleeding&quot;, secondary safety outcome) in individuals receiving rivaroxaban, in comparison with those receiving current standard of care.</measure>
    <time_frame>at 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome will be analyzed after end of data collection. Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used. Propensity score matching will be done to account for confounding by indication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of non-infective liver disease (secondary safety outcome) in individuals receiving rivaroxaban in comparison with those receiving current standard of care.</measure>

    <description>Outcome will be analyzed after end of data collection. Cox proportional hazards regression model will be used. Propensity score matching will be done to account for confounding by indication.</description>

    <description>Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE (15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily [bid] for 3 weeks, then 15 mg or 20 mg once daily [od], tablets).
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [SPAF]) with one or more risk factors, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (20 mg rivaroxaban [od], tablets).
Prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery (recommended dose: 10 mg rivaroxaban [od] tablets for 35 days following hip replacement surgery and 14 days following knee replacement surgery).
Co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or ticlopidine, for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (recommended dose 2.5 mg rivaroxaban tablets [bid]).</description>
