    <textblock>
      The aim is to test whether rtfMRI-based neurofeedback training on anterior insula impacts
      pain empathy.

    <textblock>
      In the present study, investigators plan to use the real-time fMRI neurofeedback to train
      healthy subjects to learn volitional control over their own anterior insula (AI) activity.
      Then the effect of AI regulation will assessed by examining subjects' empathic responses and
      functional connectivity changes. Subjects were separated into two groups randomly. While the
      experimental group received specific neurofeedback from their own AI, the control group
      received sham NF from an unspecific region.

    <time_frame>three days.</time_frame>
    <description>Neural activity was analyzed using standard fMRI analysis procedure that examine neural activity during training of anterior insula regulation. The measures include BOLD signal analysis (reflecting neural activity strengths) as well as functional connectivity analysis (that examine the interaction between different brain regions).</description>

    <measure>Pain Empathy Rating Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>three days.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were required to rate their empathic feeling towards painful pictures on a Likert Scale ranging from 1-9 (1 = not at all and 9 = very painful). The effects of training on the empathy for pain were analyzed comparing the feedback group with the controls group. For each subject differences were calculated between pictures that were preceded by a training compared to a no-training block. Within the context of the present design we expected that training-induced increases in anterior insula activity should lead to higher pain empathy ratings in the training group as compared to the control group.</description>
