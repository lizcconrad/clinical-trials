  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if splenomegaly on point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS)
      is an accurate and user-friendly surrogate to the heterophile antibody test and Epstein-Barr
      Virus (EBV) serologies to diagnose acute mononucleosis infection in patients presenting with
      sore throat to the Emergency Department (ED).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to determine whether the presence of splenomegaly on POCUS can
      accurately diagnose acute infectious mononucleosis in symptomatic ED patients, and determine
      the feasibility of performing point-of-care ultrasound for splenomegaly by emergency
      physicians in the emergency department setting.

    <description>Splenomegaly is defined as a splenic length of &gt; 11.5 centimetres (cm) for 10-12 year-old patients, &gt; 12 cm for 12-15 year-old patients, &gt; 12 cm for 15-35 year-old female patients, and &gt; 13 cm for 15-35 year-old male patients.</description>

    <description>Enrolled patients will undergo POCUS of the spleen by the treating emergency physician (resident, fellow or attending). Canadian Emergency Ultrasound Society (CEUS) certified residents, fellows and attending physicians will conduct the bedside ultrasonography after receiving specific training for the purposes of this study. The spleen will be assessed using a curved 2-6 Megahertz (MHz) transducer with the participant in the supine position. The cranio-caudal splenic length will be measured and its maximum dimension will be recorded on the standardized study data sheet.</description>
