  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct a prospective observational study on consecutive patients being
      admitted to a tertiary care-centre with infective endocarditis. The investigators' primary
      aim is to identify baseline clincal, laboratory and microbiological predictors of in-hospital
      events, mortality and 6-month mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mortality and major complications among infective endocarditis remain high. In addition
      developing nations are crippled with a high incidence of culture-negative endocarditis and
      lack of wide availability of transesophageal echocardiography. We intended to identify
      predictors among admission clinical features, laboratory paramters and culture reports that
      can help risk stratify patients early in the course of treatment.
