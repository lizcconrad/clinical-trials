      The main purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10 and its metabolite(s) administered as multiple ascending oral
      doses over 14 days to healthy obese male volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Complexa has developed an oral formulation of CXA-10. The main purpose of this trial is to
      demonstrate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10 and its
      metabolite(s) administered as multiple ascending oral doses over 14 days to healthy obese
      male volunteers. The pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of CXA-10 on serum biomarkers, some of
      which are elevated in the obese population, will also be investigated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt;27 and ≤40 kg/m2

          -  In good general health as determined by a thorough medical history and physical
             examination, ECG, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluation

          -  Results of clinical laboratory tests must be without clinically significant
             abnormalities for this population and may exceed the limits of the reference ranges,
             including hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis except as noted below

          -  Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) &lt;7%

          -  Average blood pressure &lt;160/100 mmHg at screening

          -  QTcF interval (Fredericia's correction factor) must be ≤430 msec at screening and
             pre-dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality for this population identified on the screening
             history, physical or laboratory examinations, or any other medical condition or
             circumstance making the volunteer unsuitable for participation in the study

          -  Any clinical history of cardiovascular events, arrhythmias, fainting, palpitations,
             personal or family history of congenital prolonged QT syndromes or sudden unexpected
             death due to a cardiac reason

          -  History of any primary malignancy, including a history of melanoma or suspicious
             undiagnosed skin lesions, with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas
             of the skin or cervical carcinoma in situ or other malignancies curatively treated and
             with no evidence of disease for at least 5 years

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 21 units/week (one unit = 125 mL of
             wine or 284 mL of beer or a single 25 mL measure of spirits) within 6 months of
             screening

          -  Treatment with any prescription or non-prescription drugs (including vitamins, herbal
             and dietary supplements) within 7 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to
             dosing and until collection of the final PK sample. Use of any drug including aspirin
             or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be avoided within 7 days prior
             to the first dose and during this study as it may interfere with the pharmacology of
             CXA-10. Use of high energy supplements or drinks (especially, those containing
             caffeine, protein supplements, and weight loss drugs)

          -  History of smoking, including e-cigarettes, or use of nicotine-containing products
             within 1 month of screening

          -  Resting heart rate ≥100 BPM after 5 minutes rest (as above) at the screening visit

          -  Subjects with any other clinically relevant ECG parameter abnormality (e.g., PR
             interval, QRS deviation) or any clinically significant ECG abnormality will be
             excluded from the study

          -  Any clinically significant murmurs evident on auscultation of the heart (including
             evidence of mitral valve prolapse)
