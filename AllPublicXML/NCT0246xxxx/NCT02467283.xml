  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current concepts of the causes of periodontitis implicate a bacterial infection as the
      primary cause of the disease. Several bacterial species residing in a biofilm on tooth
      surfaces are closely associated with periodontitis. Chronic periodontitis (CP) is initiated
      and sustained by bacterial plaque, but host defense mechanisms play an integral role in its
      pathogenesis.

      Gene expression profiling is a powerful means of generating comprehensive genome-level data
      sets on diseases such as cancer, asthma, rheumatoid disorders and periodontitis, and provides
      significant insight information for these diseases. Gene expression profiling may provide an
      evidence for involving genes in the pathogenesis of CP and generate further information other
      than clinical signs and symptoms of CP.

      The aim of this study was to identify gene-expression patterns of patients with chronic
      periodontitis by whole-transcriptome gene-expression analyses.
