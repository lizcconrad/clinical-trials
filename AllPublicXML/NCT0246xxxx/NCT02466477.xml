  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence exists supporting the ability of genetic variations to influence patient drug
      response and side effects. Previous studies utilizing an open-label design have shown
      significant improvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) patient outcomes following use of
      the GeneSight Psychotropic (GEN) test. The first objective of this trial is to utilize a
      double-blinded, randomized clinical trial design to replicate previous findings of
      improvement in clinical outcomes in MDD subjects whose medication therapy was guided by GEN
      testing. Another objective is to determine the added benefit of Enhanced-GeneSight (E-GEN)
      compared to GEN for the pharmacogenomic guidance of treatment selections. Furthermore, this
      trial intends to develop an evidence-based case for the value of GEN and E-GEN to Canadian
      healthcare payers.

      The primary objectives of this study are 1) to compare the efficacy of GEN to treatment as
      usual (TAU) in improving response to psychotropic treatment in outpatients suffering from a
      MDD and having had - within the current episode - an inadequate response to at least one
      psychotropic medication included in GEN; and 2) to validate the utility of the new CAMH
      markers and demonstrate the superior predictive capabilities and greater clinical utility of
      E-GEN as compared to GEN.

      This study is designed as a three-arm multi-centre, double-blind (participants and raters),
      randomized controlled trial to compare the clinical and economic outcomes of GEN, E-GEN and
      TAU for patients suffering from a MDD and having had - within the current episode - an
      inadequate response to at least one psychotropic medication included in GEN. Participants
      will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of the three treatment arms. Recruitment will be
      24 months. Follow-up will be 12 months.

      Subjects will complete short diagnostic interviews specific to their clinical diagnosis,
      basic metabolic measures (eg. blood pressure, weight), and provide buccal swab samples for
      genetic analysis (the unanalyzed buccal swabs and associated DNA will be biobanked). During
      the first visit, blood and urine samples will be required for laboratory panel screening and
      blood biobanking. Subjects will be monitored over a one year period and clinical measures and
      healthcare resource utilization will be obtained. Treating clinicians in the GEN and E-GEN
      arms will receive an easy to implement report providing pharmacogenomic guidance for
      prescribing psychotropic medications to their patients.

      The study will recruit subjects from 10 sites, stratified into 2 clusters. Nine study sites
      altogether will form one of the two stratified clusters. CAMH will constitute the tenth study
      site and the second stratified cluster.The sample size required for this study was calculated
      using effect size estimates drawn from a previous study conducted by Hall-Flavin et al
      [Pharmacogenetics Genomics 2013; 23(10)]. Assuming an effect size of 0.30 in HAM-D17 score
      favoring the treatment group, intra class coefficient between clusters of 20%, statistical
      power of 90%, an alpha level of 0.05, and an expected 16.7% rate of premature discontinuation
      by Week 8 (primary endpoint), a total of 570 subjects (i.e., 190 per treatment arm) are
      required to detect the same effect in this study.

    <description>The GeneSight Psychotropic (GEN) product is a pharmacogenomic decision support tool that helps clinicians to make informed, evidence-based decisions about proper drug selection. More specifically, patients are tested for clinically important genetic variants of multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genes that affect a patient's ability to metabolize, tolerate or respond to medications.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Enhanced-GeneSight Psychotropic (E-GEN)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The current GEN test lacks predictive genes for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), a major complication of antipsychotic drug use. Therefore, the Enhanced-GeneSight Psychotropic (E-GEN), which is an enhanced version of the GEN test, was developed by incorporating 6 new genes (represented by 7 SNPs) that are predictive for AIWG, to those used in the GEN algorithm. An increasing risk level associated with AIWG is estimated by an increasing number of risk genotypes that a given patient possesses among the 7 SNPs.</description>

    <description>The comparator chosen for this study provides a &quot;real world&quot; comparison of standard of care for patients who receive no pharmacogenomics guidance.
Patients randomized to the TAU arm will also have their DNA collected and a pharmacogenomic-based interpretive report will be generated using GEN testing. However, this report will not be shared with the treating clinicians until completion at 12 months of the study. Therefore, patients in this arm will receive clinical treatment as usual, without the use or knowledge of genotyping results by their treating clinicians.</description>
