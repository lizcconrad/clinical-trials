  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy (as measured by progression-free survival [PFS] rate at 8 weeks) of
      regorafenib in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) whose disease is refractory
      to standard therapies and who were never exposed to antiangiogenic therapy.

             or within 4 months following the last administration of standard therapies.

             medical history of proteinuria, previous urinalysis results should be considered
             and/or performed so at least 2 results separated by at least 2 weeks are available;

          -  History of interstitial lung disease with ongoing signs and symptoms at the time of
             informed consent;

          -  Non-healing wound, non-healing ulcer, or non-healing bone fracture;

          -  Subjects with evidence or history of any bleeding diathesis, irrespective of severity;

          -  Any hemorrhage or bleeding event ≥ Grade 3 NCI-CTCAE v 4.03 within 4 weeks prior to
