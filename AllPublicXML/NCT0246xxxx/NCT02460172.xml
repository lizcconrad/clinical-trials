      Study designed to compare the Zip Surgical Skin Closure device vs. conventional staples for
      wound closure following bi lateral knee replacement surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, within patient control study comparing the use of Zip Surgical Skin
      Closure device versus conventional staple placement when utilized for surgical wound closure
      after bi lateral unicompartmental or bi lateral total knee replacement. A total of up to 25
      patients will be enrolled and followed for up to 8 weeks post surgery to evaluate wound
      healing and overall satisfaction of closure method.
