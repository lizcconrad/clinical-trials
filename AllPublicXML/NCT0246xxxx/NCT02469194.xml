  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, the toxicity of radiation therapy and chemotherapy exhibits a strong
      dose-response relationship. However, patients receiving similar doses still exhibit a range
      of toxicity responses due to a variety of factors, including comorbid conditions, disease
      (cancer) specific factors, and inter-individual genetic variation. A very small percentage of
      patients experience side effects that are either extremely severe or extremely mild compared
      to the majority of patients for the dose of radiation or chemotherapy given. Currently, the
      reasons for this are not entirely clear, but likely relate to patient specific factors such
      as immune response, cell/tissue repair capacity and other factors that fundamentally rely on
      rare genetic variations at loci involved in these responses. For example, patients with
      homozygous deletions in DNA damage response genes such as ATM are uniquely sensitive to DNA
      damaging agents. Many patients with severe, homozygous mutations in such genes have other
      sequela that lead to medical recognition of the syndrome prior to therapy. The investigators
      hypothesize that patients with unusually severe toxicity from therapy that do not exhibit
      classical signs of homozygous mutation syndromes are heterozygous for nonfunctional or
      hypofunctional alleles at these loci, such that the defect is only uncovered under the
      relatively acute, severe stress on that pathway by radiation or chemotherapy. Conversely,
      patients with very mild reactions could exhibit rare variants/combinations of variants that
      make them uniquely resistant to chemotherapy or radiotherapy toxicity.

      The purpose of the study is to better understand these mechanisms with the eventual goal of
      developing predictive markers that will allow us to help individually tailor cancer therapy
      is in future patients. Will accomplish these goals by studying a variety of factors from a
      single vial of blood. These will include circulating proteins and hormones, circulating cells
      and the levels and sequences of white blood cell DNA or RNA using a variety of techniques
      including but not limited to determination of cytokine/hormone levels, proteomic analysis,
      immunocytochemical assays, whole exome sequencing and qPCR.

        Subjects will be recruited from the inpatient and outpatient clinical practices in the
        University of Pennsylvania Health System. There will be no attempt to advertise enrollment
        on this protocol to physicians outside of the treating departments (i.e. Radiation
        Oncology, Surgery, Medical Oncology).
