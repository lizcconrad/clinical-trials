  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have
      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced
      patient survival. In some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid damage to normal
      tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function. The investigators
      hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the
      edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in
      real-time as they operate. This is a safety study to assess the safety of BLZ-100 in
      pediatric patients with central nervous system tumors.

      Subjects who provide voluntary written informed consent, or have it provided by their legally
      acceptable representative, will be screened for eligibility. Subjects meeting all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate.

      Subjects will be required to arrive at the hospital for dosing at least 1 hour before the
      planned surgical excision. Following dosing, subjects will be monitored for safety and
      surgical excision will occur at least 1 hour after study product administration.
