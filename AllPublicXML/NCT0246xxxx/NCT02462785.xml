  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helping individuals with diabetes to control their blood sugars through self-management is an
      important goal, and counting carbohydrates (CHO) remains a key part of diabetes education and
      management. There is very little research examining CHO counting education with adolescents
      who have type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate a newly
      developed internet-based teaching module of CHO counting for adolescents, ages 12-17 years,
      with T1DM and who do not regularly CHO count and require instruction. A secondary aim is to
      assess feasibility for a future, larger-scale clinical trail. An effective web-based CHO
      counting tutorial could be used to strengthen current diabetes education programs and may
      serve as a basis for developing other teaching modules. Advantages of web-based teaching
      include convenience, increased accessibility, and the ability to review and reinforce
      teaching concepts through repetition. It may also encourage adolescents to take the
      initiative for their own diabetes care, beginning with a self-directed, active learning
      experience.

    <description>Test trays will comprise foods commonly consumed by adolescents (e.g., hamburger, grilled cheese sandwich). CHO counting accuracy using food trays will be checked against a computerized food analysis. Several tray combinations will be used with randomization to tray order within each group for both pre- and post- assessments.</description>

    <description>An in-person carbohydrate counting class led by a registered dietician. The in class session covers topics including the role of CHO in nutrition and diabetes, sources of CHO, different CHO and non-CHO foods, resources for CHO counting, label reading, and meal planning. This is the standard procedure for CHO counting education at SickKids.</description>

    <intervention_name>Online Carbohydrate Counting Tutorial</intervention_name>
    <description>A web-based CHO counting tutorial that covers the same concepts reviewed during the standard in-person instructional session held at SickKids. A teen delivers the educational messages in short segments using techniques designed to maintain the viewer's attention (e.g., visuals of food portions and short segment highlights to emphasize important points). The online module includes brief interactive question/answer components for reinforcement. The secure online tutorial will be accessible for one week through a link provided by REDCap. Users will be able to repeat sessions, log on and off during sessions, and choose specific modules for repetition/review. The investigators will be able to capture the number of times patients log on and detail frequency and specifics of usage.</description>
