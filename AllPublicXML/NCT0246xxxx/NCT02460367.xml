  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 trial using indoximod, an inhibitor of the immune &quot;checkpoint&quot; pathway
      indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), in combination with Tergenpumatucel-L immunotherapy and
      Docetaxel to treat subjects with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). From a
      practical standpoint, a successful tumor immunotherapy will likely require a combination
      treatment with additional therapeutic interventions that both activate an immune response and
      remove redundant mechanisms of tolerance maintenance. This clinical trial utilizes the
      combination of the chemotherapeutic agent, docetaxel, plus two investigational methods of
      cancer immunotherapy: the first, tergenpumatucel-L, is intended to educate the human immune
      system to recognize the abnormal components found in lung cancer cells, resulting in an
      immune response intended to destroy or block the growth of the cancer; and the second, the
      IDO inhibitor Indoximod, will overcome tumor-induced immune suppression.

      The goal of this study is to assess the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS) rates in this patient population. This study will provide a foundation for future trials
      testing indoximod combined with tergenpumatucel-L.

             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the unknown
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with indoximod, or docetaxel. In addition,

             suppressive therapy.

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic therapy. Patients with a history of
             autoimmune disease must be counselled regarding the unknown potential of exacerbating
