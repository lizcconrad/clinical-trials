      The current study was designed to investigate the change of plasma thrombospondin-1 levels
      and assess the prognostic predictive effect of plasma thrombospondin-1 levels in the patients
      with acute intracerebral hemorrhage.

      Thrombospondin-1 acts as an anti-angiogenic factor and its expression in rat brain is
      upregulated after intracerebral hemorrhage. The current study was designed to investigate the
      change of plasma thrombospondin-1 levels and assess the prognostic predictive effect of
      plasma thrombospondin-1 levels in the patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. About 110
      patients will be recruited. All blood samples from the patients at admission were collected.
      Thrombospondin-1 levels in plasma were measured using sandwich immunoassays. The patients
      will be followed up till 6 months after intracerebral hemorrhage. The relationships between
      plasma thrombospondin-1 levels and 1-week mortality, 6-month mortality, 6-month overall
      survival, 6-month unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score &gt;2) and disease severity
      reflected by hematoma volume and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score were
      assessed using multivariate analysis. It is proposed that elevated plasma thrombospondin-1
      levels are independently associated with disease severity and clinical outcomes. It will be
      suggested thrombospondin has potential to be a good prognostic biomarker of intracerebral
      hemorrhage.
