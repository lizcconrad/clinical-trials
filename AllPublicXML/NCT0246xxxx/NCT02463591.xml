    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) is
      effective in reversing the anticoagulant effect of Dabigatran, as assessed by two modified
      skin-bleeding tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no treatment widely available for immediate reversal of Dabigatran
      anticoagulant effects, e.g. in case of major bleeding or when emergency surgery or invasive
      procedures are indicated.

      Treatment with prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) seems effective in reducing blood loss
      in animal models, but previous studies in humans have failed to show an effect on blood
      coagulation parameters. Recently, two novel methods of skin blood loss, one called &quot;shed
      blood&quot; and another &quot;washed blood&quot; were able to measure effects of anticoagulation, either as
      the inhibition of fibrin formation at the wound site by measuring Fibrinopeptide A (FPA) or
      as elevated blood loss, respectively, after oral administration of Dabigatran in healthy
      volunteers.

      The investigators hypothesise that the shed/washed blood methods are able to measure
      Dabigatran reversal following administration of PCC (Beriplex).

      The study will be performed as a randomised double blind cross-over study and 12 healthy
      human male subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will take Dabigatran 300 mg b.i.d. on day -2,
      -1 and 0. After the fifth dose (on day 0), subjects will be randomised to receive Beriplex
      (50 IU/kg) or a similar volume of saline as a single bolus dose i.v. over 20 minutes. After a
      10 day minimum wash-out period this procedure will be repeated, and the alternative treatment
      (Saline or Beriplex) is administered.

      The Shed / Washed Blood measurements will be performed at different time points before and
      after starting oral anticoagulants and before and after administration of Beriplex/Saline.

      In addition to the Shed / Washed blood tests, several ex vivo standard coagulation tests will
      be performed. These include: activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time
      (PT), diluted thrombin time (DTT/Hemoclot), Dabigatran plasma levels (using liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)), endogenous thrombin generation (ETG) and
      pre and post factor II, VII, IX and X.

    <description>The Shed blood test allows assessment of thrombin activity and subsequent fibrinogen conversion to fibrin in vivo by measuring fibrinopeptide A (FPA) generation. A standardized wound, using a disposable device (Surgicutt® Adult) is made on the volar surface of the forearm, from which blood is collected during 4 minutes. The total amount of shed blood is measured in addition to Fibrinopeptide A levels. FPA levels are compared to FPA levels in systemic venous samples collected at corresponding timepoints.
The washed blood test measures both the time until bleeding stops and sensitively measures small volumes of blood loss as area under the curve (AUC).</description>
