      The purpose of this study is to study the validity, reliability and practicality of the
      different weight estimation methods (parent estimation method, Mercy method, Broselow tape,
      original and update APLS) in Thai children.

      A reliable paediatric weight estimation method is crucial for the physician attempting to
      resuscitate an injured child. When a patient is in a critical, life threatening condition or
      in mass casualty settings, actual body weight cannot be obtained by weight measurement
      instrument. Several resuscitation modalities, such as resuscitation medications, fluid
      replacement, and amount of electrical shock in defibrillation, are calculated according to
      patient body weight

      Besides from weight derived from children's parent which cannot achieve in some situations
      and vary in accuracy, Broselow tape is the gold standard currently for appraise children's
      weight from their length. However, this tape tends to underestimate weight and it is limited
      to use in children are less than 146 centimeters in length. Age- based weight estimation
      methods are the mathematical formulas to estimate weight from the children's age. The various
      methods described in the Advanced Paediatric Life support (APLS) both original and updated
      still have doubts about the accuracy and reliability. Both length- based and aged- based
      methods fail to resolve the overweight or obese and underweight children who have the same
      height or the same age. Mercy method is the new weight estimation method that incorporates
      the humeral length and mid-upper arm circumference to estimate the child weight. This method
      has been demonstrated both accuracy and reliability over other existing methods. This study
      will evaluate the validity, reliability and practicality of the previously mentioned
      pediatric weight estimation methods.

    <description>The performance of the Mercy method, Broselow tape, parental estimation and aged-base methods (original APLS,updated APLS formula) were compared against the actual weight and against each other. Agreement between estimated weight and actual weight of each weight estimation method was determined by Bland-Altman plots with 95% limits of agreement and correlation test. Bias and variability tested by calculate error : predicted weight -actual weight, calculated percentage error : [(predicted - actual weight) x 100%] / actual weight, calculated root mean square error = square root of the average squared error. Categorical error analysis was done by the percentage error of each of the estimation techniques within 10% and 20% of actual weight.</description>
