    <textblock>
      Autologous human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) stored at Cord Blood Registry will be given to
      children who have suffered from a Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke. The aim is to determine
      if hUCB infusion is safe, if late functional outcome is improved, if hUCB treatment improves
      physiologic response in the child's SSEP &amp; EEG, and the effect of hUCB infusion in altering
      anatomic findings on MRI.

      Autologous human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) stored at Cord Blood Registry will be given to
      children who have suffered from a Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke.

      Subjects will come to Orlando for pretesting to include an MRI, SSEP, Urodynamics, blood
      work: CBC, CMP, Hepatic Function Panel, PT/PTT/INR, Chest Xray, EEG, Gross Motor Function
      Classification, Manual Ability Classification System, and a Speech and Language Evaluation.

      After pretesting, the subjects will receive their autologous cord blood infusion
      intravenously. The subjects will then be monitored for 24 hours post infusion. After 24
      hours, the subject will undergo repeat blood work and a chest x ray. Subjects will then be
      discharged home.

      Subjects will follow up in Orlando at 6 months and 1 year post infusion. Follow up testing
      will repeat the exams performed at pretesting.

    <measure>Composite Outcome: Hemodynamic Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Three primary and two secondary hemodynamic indices will be monitored as indices of hemodynamic stability throughout the infusion and post-infusion periods. Heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation will be recorded every 5 minutes during the infusion, every 30 minutes for 2 hours after infusion and then hourly for 6 hours. A consistent, non-isolated 20% decrease in any of these indices will be prompt additional maneuvers to restore MAP.
Two secondary hemodynamic indices will be monitored as indices of hemodynamic stability: capillary refill and heart rate. Prolongation of capillary refill by 2 seconds from baseline and/or &gt;20% change in heart rate during the procedure will prompt an evaluation as to the etiology of the change in hemodynamic status. An adverse event will be defined as a sustained (&gt; 10 minutes) &gt;20% decrease in MAP. Transient decreases in MAP that respond to fluid infusion or inotropes will not be considered adverse events.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Outcome: Pulmonary Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A concern exists regarding the systemic infusion of leukocytes in a concentrated manner. Theoretically, activated monocytes could function to enhance PMN migration into the lung, as the lung is the primary &quot;first pass&quot; filter for intravenous infusion of any cellular product. PMN mediated organ injury typically occurs over a 6-24 hour time frame. Based on this, Chest radiographs will be performed and evaluated at Baseline and on Post-Infusion Day 1. Chest radiographs will be evaluated for systemic infusion of leukocytes in a concentrated manner. Additionally, blood-oxygen saturation will be monitored by finger oximeter. Moderate respiratory dysfunction within the first 48 hours post infusion will be considered an adverse event but will not warrant stopping the trial unless recommended by the DSMB. In the event of pulmonary dysfunction, standard supportive therapy will be given. Pulmonary symptoms/events corresponding to the CTCAE v3.0 Grade 3 will trigger the stopping rules.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Outcome: Renal Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To minimize the effect of DSMO, our hUCB product will be washed according to Standard Operating Procedures prior to infusion. Though unlikely, it is possible that some quantity of DMSO will remain which could cause toxicity. Renal function/events corresponding to the CTCAE v3.0 Grade 3 will trigger the stopping rules</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite Outcome: Neurological Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's acute neurologic status will be monitored until discharged. Data recorded every 4 hours includes GCS, pupillary size/reactivity, motor/sensory evaluation of extremities, and seizure activity from infusion to discharge. Grade 3-5 CNS event as defined in the NCI CTCAE v3.0 occurring within 12 hours of cellular product infusion will trigger the stopping rules. Other changes temporally related to hUCB infusion (those events occurring within 12 hours of infusion) will be considered associated with the protocol and recorded as an adverse event.</description>

    <measure>Language</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Language will be evaluated before treatment and at follow-up visits 6 months and 1 year. Full evaluations will include measures of language expression, reception, and oral-motor functioning. Formal tests include: The Preschool Language Scale, Fifth Edition (PLS-5), Expressive Vocabulary Test, Second Edition (EVT-2), and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition (PPVT-4). Informal measures include: phonetic inventory, oral motor evaluation and The Rossetti Infant-Toddler Language Scale.</description>

    <description>Speech will be evaluated before treatment and at follow-up visits 6 months and 1 year. Full evaluations will include measures of speech production. Formal tests include: The Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (CASL) and The Arizona Articulation Proficiency Scale- Third Edition.</description>
