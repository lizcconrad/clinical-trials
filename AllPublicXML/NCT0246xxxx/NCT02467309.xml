      The purpose of this study is to determine whether deficiency of Vitamin D has association
      with outcomes of children with bacterial meningitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency has been proved in serious diseases patients, including patients in
      shock, however, few study have been done about association between deficiency of Vitamin D
      and outcomes of children with bacterial meningitis.

      in our study, we will observe incidence of complication and severity of complication between
      patients who have different Vitamin D status.
