  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fish oil is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentanoic acid and
      docosahexaenoic acid, and it is not used widely in parenteral nutrition because fish oil
      emulsions have not been commercially available until very recently. The Objective of this
      study is to to evaluate the effect on blood lipid profiles of omega-3 enriched total
      parenteral nutrition in healthy Korean male subjects. This study is designed as a randomized,
      open-label, 2-treatment, 2-way crossover trial. Blood samples will be collected every 1 hour
      from 0 to 12 hours after starting an intravenous infusion for triglyceride, glucose, and
      insulin.

      Fish oil is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentanoic acid and
      docosahexaenoic acid, and it is not used widely in parenteral nutrition because fish oil
      emulsions have not been commercially available until very recently. The Objective of this
      study is to to evaluate the effect on blood lipid profiles of omega-3 enriched total
      parenteral nutrition in healthy Korean male subjects.

      This study is designed as a randomized, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-way crossover trial. The
      16 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 sequences of the two treatments: Combiflex®
      lipid peri or Winuf® peri will be infused via peripheral venous catheter for 6 hours at 3
      ml/kg/h. Blood samples will be collected every 1 hour from 0 to 12 hours after starting an
      intravenous infusion for triglyceride, glucose, and insulin. Cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol, AST, ALT, and total bilirubin as liver function biomarkers, and hsCRP as
      inflammatory biomarker will be analysed at 0, 6 and 12 hour after starting an intravenous
      infusion.
