  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HeartMate PHP System is a temporary (&lt;6 hours) ventricular assist device indicated for
      use during high risk percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) performed in elective or
      urgent, hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed
      left ventricular ejection fraction.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, multi-center, open-label trial of the HeartMate PHP at up to 100
      sites in the US. Control device will be any Abiomed Impella device approved for use in
      high-risk PCI.

      Nonrandomized roll-in phase: Each site must first enroll and treat up to 6 patients (up to 3
      PHP and 3 Impella per site)

      Randomized phase: Up to 425 patients undergoing PCI per the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria.
