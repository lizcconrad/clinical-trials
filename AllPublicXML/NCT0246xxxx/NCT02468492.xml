      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the affect that platelet rich plasma has on the
      molecular an cellular functioning of the knee joint.

    <textblock>
      In this study 18 subjects with mild to moderate symptomatic knee osteoarthritis will be
      recruited per an IRB approved protocol with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Subjects who are enrolled and meet all criteria will be blinded and randomized (2:1) to
      receive Platelet Rich Plasma or normal saline &quot;control&quot;. Prior to the intervention, a
      synovial fluid aspiration will occur. At follow up number one (approximately 10 days from
      baseline) a repeat aspiration will occur and a differential analysis of the molecular and
      biochemical effects will be undertaken; this data will serve as the primary outcome measures.
      This data will be correlated to clinical and imaging outcome measures which will be secondary
      outcome measures completed at baseline and intermittently throughout the study. The duration
      of the study is one year.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Early/Mild to Moderate Stage knee osteoarthritis (KOA), as determined by
             Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 2 to 3 on PA standing radiograph within the past three months;

               -  A prospective subject who has a diagnosis of non-end stage KOA (i.e., a potential
                  study candidate) and expresses interest in participating but has no XRAY within
                  the specified time-period will be sent for a fresh XRAY. This XRAY will be read
                  by a radiologist &amp; be paid for by the study.

          2. &gt;=40 years of age;

          3. Average 100-point VAS score of &gt;50, on average, within the past 3 months*, with KOA
             felt to be the primary contributor to pain.

               -  Alternate 10-point scales with pain scores averaging &gt;5 may be considered if the
                  prospective subject also completes a VAS with score &gt;50 at screening.

          4. Exam consistent with KOA being primary etiology of pain;

             examination;
