  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will evaluate a potential mechanism of increased risk of lung function
      impairment, cathelicidin levels, as well as determine if vitamin D replacement can alter this
      pathway. This study will improve the understanding of factors which can lead to chronic lung
      disease. If effective, this application would also provide the justification to study vitamin
      D as a therapy to improve lung health.

    <textblock>
      Understanding mechanisms leading to decrements in lung function, the physiologic hallmark of
      obstructive lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are
      necessary to inform interventions to improve lung health. The antimicrobial peptide
      cathelicidin, and its primary regulator vitamin D, has been implicated in development and
      progression of chronic lung disease. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the
      effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on lung cathelicidin levels in humans. Cathelicidin
      has bactericidal and inflammatory activities in the lung and is regulated by vitamin D
      levels. The investigators hypothesize that oral vitamin D supplementation will raise
      cathelicidin levels in the pulmonary compartment, thereby restoring lung cathelicidin
      deficiency. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will recruit from two ongoing cohort
      studies: 1) At Johns Hopkins, the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD
      Study study and 2)at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill pulmonary and general
      medicine clinic. The investigators will measure blood and lung lavage cathelicidin levels in
      40 vitamin D insufficient individuals (20 from each cohort) before and after eight weeks of
      oral vitamin D supplementation to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on
      cathelicidin levels.
