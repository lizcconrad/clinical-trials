  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-group randomized clinical trial testing whether group-based care will help improve
      blood pressure control in adult and adolescent patients with chronic kidney disease and
      hypertension.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This two-group RCT will enroll 300 subjects, adolescents over or equal to 12 years of age,
      and men and women over age of 21, with stage 3-4 and 5 CKD from various causes including
      diabetes and hypertension. Patients will be recruited from the Montefiore Medical Center
      Nephrology.

      Informed consent will be obtained on all subjects. All subjects with meet with one of the
      investigators who will verbally explain to them the purpose of the study and the
      alternatives.

      Blood and 24 hr urine test will be collected to assess for sodium, phosphorus, and serum
      creatinine. These tests will be used for experimental purposes only and will be collected at
      enrollment and 6 months visit.

      There will be two arms, an arm randomized to Group-based care attending monthly outpatient
      clinic visits as part of a group and the other to usual care who will see their provider once
      a month for 6 months.
