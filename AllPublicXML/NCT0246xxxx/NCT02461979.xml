  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous data have suggested that vitamin D levels may influence cancer development. In
      particular, several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been described in the Vitamin D
      receptor( VDR gene), and some polymorphisms are associated with tumor occurrence. For
      instance, VDR polymorphisms have been related to cancers of the breast, prostate, skin,
      colon-rectum, bladder and kidney, although with conflicting observations . VDR polymorphisms
      have also been investigated in the context of some chronic liver diseases, such as chronic
      hepatitis B, primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune hepatitis . In a recent published
      study, VDR polymorphism may be used as a molecular marker to predict the risk and to evaluate
      the disease severity of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

      A significant association of VDR (ApaI) polymorphism with the development of HCC in chronic
      HCV infection may help to identify those who are at high risk of developing HCC.

      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the major public health problems worldwide .
      Chronic HCV infection is characterized by a high rate of progression to fibrosis, chronic
      hepatitis, leading to cirrhosis and ultimately to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Early
      detection is critically important because the most effective treatment for HCC is surgical
      resection or ablation therapy when the tumour is small. On the other hand, genetic factors
      can also contribute, particularly gene polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokines and growth
      factor ligands and receptors . Vitamin D is involved in the metabolism of skeleton as a
      systemic hormone but also has important roles in the regulation of host immune responses,
      fibrogenesis and development of cancer through vitamin D receptor (VDR). Previous data have
      suggested that vitamin D levels may influence cancer development. In particular, several
      single nucleotide polymorphisms have been described in the VDR gene, and some polymorphisms
      are associated with tumor occurrence. For instance, VDR polymorphisms have been related to
      cancers of the breast, prostate, skin, colon-rectum, bladder and kidney, although with
      conflicting observations. VDR polymorphisms have also been investigated in the context of
      some chronic liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis B, primary biliary cirrhosis and
      autoimmune hepatitis . In a recent published study, VDR polymorphism may be used as a
      molecular marker to predict the risk and to evaluate the disease severity of HCC in patients
      with chronic hepatitis B.

      A significant association of VDR ApaI polymorphism with the development of HCC in chronic HCV
      infection may help to identify those who are at high risk of developing HCC.
