  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food provision and consumption were assessed for all hospitalized patients over a 24h-period
      survey. This study is a part of a control quality programme and is performed every 4 years
      since 1999.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During one day, a team of dieticians assessed food provided, consumed and reasons for
      non-consumption in all hospitalized patients receiving 3 meals/day. Oral nutritional
      supplements, supplemental enteral and parenteral nutrition were taken into account.
      Nutritional needs were calculated according to the ESPEN recommendations.

      Amount of energy and proteins provided and consumed were calculated using the nutrient
      analysis software Winrest (FSI, Noisy-le-grand, France).

      In 2012, the presence of healthcare-associated infections was recorded during this study.
