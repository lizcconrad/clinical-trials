             situ of the cervix

         19. Active myocarditis or early postpartum cardiomyopathy (within six months).

         20. Systemic corticosteroids, cytostatics, immunosuppressive drug therapy
             (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, etc.), and DNA depleting
             or cytotoxic drugs taken within four weeks prior to study treatment

         21. Porphyria

         22. Allergy to sodium citrate or any &quot;caine&quot; type of local anesthetic

         25. Clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history, physical examination,
             ECG, or laboratory tests at the screening assessment that would interfere with the
             objectives of the study or would preclude safe completion of the study. Abnormal
             findings could include: known HIV infection or other immunodeficiency state, chronic
             active viral infection (such as hepatitis B or C), acute systemic infections (defined
             as patients undergoing treatment with antibiotics), gastrointestinal tract bleeding,
             or any severe or acute concomitant illness or injury

         26. Any other medical, social, or geographical factor that would make it unlikely that the
             patient could comply with study procedures (e.g., alcohol abuse, lack of permanent
