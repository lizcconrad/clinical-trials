  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnoea affects more than 20% of people over 65 years and is largely underdiagnosed. It
      does multiply tenfold the occurrence of vascular events, particularly stroke. While
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is currently the Gold standard treatment to
      prevent cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events, with a major clinical benefit, long term
      adherence to CPAP is a significant problem and search for alternative treatment is essential.

      The investigators hypothesize that long-term exercise training would allow to reduce
      significantly sleep apnoea syndrome severity. Thus, in this study, the investigators will
      compare evolution of Apnoea Hypopnea Index (AHI) in an exercise trained group performed
      through in a national based non-profit organization (Fédération Française d'éducation
      Physique et de Gymnastique Volontaire (FFEPGV)) using a medical established program
      (NeuroGyV) during nine months against a control group receiving only standard dietetic and
      physical activity counseling.
