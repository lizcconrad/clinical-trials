      Despite the fact that migraine is a common disorder, the pathogenesis is still not fully
      elucidated. Studying transcriptomic and biochemical changes during induced and spontaneous
      migraine-attacks will enhance our understanding and may point to new targets for drug
      development.

      Migraine is a common neurological disorder affecting approx. 16 % of the European population.
      Despite the fact that migraine is a common disorder, the pathogenesis is still not
      sufficiently known.

      Studying transcriptomic and biochemical changes during spontaneous migraine-attacks will
      greatly enhance our understanding of migraine mechanisms and may point to new targets for
      drug development.

      Two blood samples (one for RNA analysis and one for biochemical analysis) are taken on
      minimum 15 patient with migraine with aura and 15 patients with migraine without aura when
      they experience a spontaneous migraine attack. A second sample is taken 2 hours after
      treatment with subcutaneous sumatriptan. Another two blood samples are taken when the patient
      has been migraine free for at least 5 days and had no other headache for at least 24 hours. A
      fourth set of blood samples are collected after a cold pressor test.
