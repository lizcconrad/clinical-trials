    <textblock>
      The objective of this post marketing study is to further explore a variety of treatment
      parameters in order to optimize the optical (laser) and electrical (RF) treatments over the
      various skin types, when using a combination 755 nm alexandrite laser together with a bipolar
      RF energy system, for the purpose of hair reduction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study device (Helos) combines 755nm alexandrite laser energy with bipolar RF energy. The
      laser can deliver 0.25 to 100 ms laser pulses at a maximum of 20 J/cm2. Bipolar RF energy
      will be delivered across the laser beam via two appropriately sized electrodes and spacing
      between the electrodes. Bipolar RF energy may be delivered at a maximum of 35 J operating at
      1 MHz. Typical RF pulses will be of duration of between 100 and 300ms. Epidermal cooling is
      accomplished via contact with a cooled window.

    <measure>Average percentage of hair reduction by hair counts at baseline compared to 3 months after last treatment</measure>

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is to measure the average percentage of hair reduction at 3 months post last treatment computed over all subjects and all treatment sites. Hair reduction will be evaluated by counting the number of terminal hairs present in the 3 cm by 3 cm defined region by at least two independent blinded trained reviewers of photos taken at baseline and at the follow-up visits.</description>
