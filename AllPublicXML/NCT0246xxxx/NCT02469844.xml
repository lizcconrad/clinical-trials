    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is disabling and costly to patients and the health service. Nearly 400,000 people in
      England suffer from epilepsy. About 40% of these patients are known to have seizures
      predominantly in sleep. All seizures pose risk to the individual both physical and
      psychological. Nocturnal seizures pose extra risk as the diagnosis may be missed or delayed.
      Patients with nocturnal seizures are also thought to be at particular risk of sudden
      unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), especially if their seizures are unobserved. In
      patients with poor seizure control, the risk of SUDEP has been found to be as high as 9 per
      1,000 patient years. Previous studies show that many seizures are associated with changes in
      the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) tone. The ANS tone can be assessed using heart rate
      variability parameters (HRV). A few studies suggest that ANS tone changes tend to precede the
      onset of epileptic seizure related surface electroencephalographic (EEG) changes, suggesting
      that ANS tone changes could be used in seizure alarm or intervention systems. This
      prospective study intends to focus on seizures from sleep and study HRV parameters in the
      immediate preictal state of the seizure and compare these with resting HRV parameters in the
      same patient with the aim of finding HRV metrics which could help to identify the presence of
      seizures in longterm electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, or help predict seizure
      occurrence, or provide information about the current risk of seizures. This study will also
      investigate whether there are differences in the alterations of HRV parameters between
      different forms of epilepsy and whether seizure lateralisation has an impact on HRV
      parameters.

    <description>1. Alterations in heart rate variability (HRV) parameters at baseline (interictal sleep), immediately before (pre-ictal) and during nocturnal epileptic seizures. The composite measure consists of the following: Time Domain HRV metrics: SDNN to describe overall variability; RMSSD to describe Parasympathetic component of HRV FrequencyDomain HRV: HF for Parasympathetic, LF for Sympathetic and LF/HF for sympatho vagal balance.
Non-linear HRV metrics: CVI for Parasympathetic and CSI for Sympathetic component.</description>
