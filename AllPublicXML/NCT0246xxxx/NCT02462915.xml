  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our study, we compared the ventilation performance of i-gel to the endotracheal tube
      during laparoscopic surgery.

      The lungs were ventilated at tidal volumes (8mL/kg) using volume controlled. After that, we
      wanted to observe the respiratory parameters, such as leak fraction, leak volume, tidal
      volume, peak airway pressure and mean airway pressure.

      In our hypothesis, the i-gel may be used reasonable alternative to tracheal tube during
      volume controlled ventilation in laparoscopic surgeries.

      In our study, we compared the ventilation performance of i-gel to the endotracheal tube
      during laparoscopic surgery.

      Our patient receive i-gel or endotracheal tube by draw. These patients were Included by the
      criteria:1.ASA I-II2.Age from 20-80 years old, who were underwent elective GYN laparoscopic
      surgery and had ability to give inform consent.

      The excluding criteria was: 1.presence of any significant lung, heart, brain disease 2.
      pathology of the neck or upper respiratory tract 3.Potential difficult intubation 4.an
      increased risk of aspiration, ex:gastroesophageal reflux, full stomach,Obese (BMI&gt;30), and
      pregnant woman, who were confirmed by patient history and medical chart.

      Preoxygenation was maintained for three minutes to avoid bag and mask ventilation. Anesthesia
      was induced with the routine medication, such as lidocaine„ÄÅ propofol, fentanyl and
      cisatracurium. The i-gel or endotracheal tubes were inserted. The lungs were ventilated at
      the tidal volume (8mL/kg) using volume controlled. After that, we wanted to observe the
      respiratory parameters, such as leak fraction, leak volume, tidal volume, peak airway
      pressure and mean airway pressure.

      In our hypothesis, the i-gel may be used reasonable alternative to tracheal tube during
      volume controlled ventilation in laparoscopic surgeries.
