  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A descent of the anterior vaginal wall is the most common form of female pelvic organ
      prolapse (POP). Although anterior colporrhaphy (AC) is accepted worldwide as a &quot;standard
      procedure&quot;, its exact steps are not well standardized.

      We developed a small stitch anterior colporrhaphy (SSTAC) in an effort to increase the
      strength and durability of AC

      Objectives

      The aim of this pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility and complication rate of the
      SSTAC and to assess the anatomical and functional outcomes after this method of cystocele
      repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective case series evaluation of SSTAC following the recommendations of
      IDEAL-Collaboration (www.ideal-collaboration.net) will be performed. The newly developed
      procedure will be tested in a group of 10 patients, who equals stage 2a in the development
      and innovation of surgical innovations. In this stage safety and technical success is the
      main outcome. As technical modifications may be common during stage 2a and their nature and
      timing should be meticulously recorded, the videotaping during all surgical procedures will
      be performed.
