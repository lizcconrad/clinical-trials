  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves sampling bone marrow transplant patients, hospital workers and the
      patient room for microbes using swabs and other techniques. We send these samples to the
      laboratory, where they will use state-of-the art technology to identify and relate the
      microbes to each other. This study also involves putting copper, nickel, or titanium into
      some hospital rooms, and seeing whether these metals influences the growth of microbes. Some
      equipment in the hospital room, such as faucets and soap dispensers will be replaced by
      sensor-based (e.g. touchless) controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bacteria and other microbes are everywhere, the majority of which are harmless. They live on
      our bodies, on everyday objects, in food, and in our environment. They are passed around
      through the many interactions with other people and our surroundings. Some are even
      beneficial, helping us digest our food or protecting us from infections caused by harmful
      microbes.

      In rare instances, some of the harmful microbes can cause infections. When a microbe causes
      an infection while we are in healthcare facilities, they are called &quot;Healthcare-associated
      infections&quot;, or &quot;HAIs&quot;. Examples that you may have heard of include Clostridium difficile,
      and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Vancouver General Hospital already
      has some of the lowest HAI rates in the country. We have dedicated hospital workers that do a
      great job at preventing HAIs, but we are always looking for ways to be even better.
