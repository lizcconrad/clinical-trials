  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if electrical stimulation of the leg muscles
      will improve strength in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit
      (ICU). ICU care frequently results in chronically critically ill (CCI) patients. Some CCI
      patients develop persistent inflammation/immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS),
      and they have morbid long-term outcomes. CCI patients with PICS often develop severe limb
      muscle atrophy, weakness and accelerated protein catabolism. Limb muscle dysfunction in PICS
      is due to many factors including sepsis/inflammation, proteolysis, apoptosis, and inactivity.
      Despite the seriousness of limb muscle weakness in CCI patients receiving mechanical
      ventilation, little is known about exercise strategies to treat this problem. There is
      limited knowledge about how strength training impacts inflammation and catabolism in CCI
      patients. In addition, an assessment of the effect of exercise on markers of inflammation and
      protein catabolism on muscle samples obtained with biopsy techniques and venous blood samples
      will be performed. This project will further understanding of how treating CCI-related muscle
      weakness with strength training cannot only improve muscle function, but also potentially
      blunt the inflammation and catabolism of PICS.

      As a participant in the study, the following will take place: Assignment to study groups: a
      random assignment will be done to one of two groups by a list generated by a computer
      program, much like flipping a coin. One group of subjects will be assigned to an effective
      muscle stimulation group and the second group will be assigned to a group that will receive
      ineffective stimulation (Control or Sham). Muscle stimulation will be performed with a Niveus
      medical stimulator on both quadriceps muscle groups for 30 minutes, five days per week. The
      stimulator will be individually adjusted in terms of intensity of stimulation to elicit a
      visible or palpable quadriceps muscle contraction. Four contractions per minute will be
      performed for a total of approximately 120 contractions per 30 minute treatment. Isometric
      Muscle strength testing: All subjects will undergo isometric muscle strength testing. Maximal
      isometric twitch strength will be measured by placing the subjects' dominant leg in a frame
      that will hold the knee at 60°. A cuff will be placed around the patient's ankle and will be
      connected to an electronic dynamometer with the cable. A magnetic nerve stimulator will be
      used over the body of the quadriceps muscle to stimulate the muscle.

    <description>Quadriceps strength will be measured on the initial day of study approximately every seven days thereafter and on the final day of study participation. For this measurement, patients will remain supine in their bed and the dominant leg will be placed on a frame that will hold the knee at a 60° angle. A cuff will be placed around the ankle and connected to an electronic dynamometer that will record the force generated during the stimulation. The muscle will be stimulated to contract with magnetic stimulators placed over the body of the quadriceps muscle and stimulated at 100% of power output.</description>

    <intervention_name>Muscle Biopsy</intervention_name>
    <description>This procedure will be done at the end of participation in the study.The biopsy will be performed with a sterile needle, which will be inserted through the skin. A skin incision (approximately 1/4&quot; long) will be made in order to insert the needle. The biopsy procedure yields two small pieces of muscle tissue (200 mg total), each about half the size of the eraser on a pencil. After the biopsy is taken, the incision will be closed using a steri-strip bandage (no stitches are required), and a sterile dressing will be placed over the site to reduce the risk of bleeding.</description>

    <intervention_name>Muscle Biopsy Medication: Lidocaine</intervention_name>
    <description>Biopsy samples will be obtained under local anesthesia (up to 20 milliliters of 1% Lidocaine administered subcutaneously). Lidocaine, a drug to numb your pain will be injected into the skin and muscle tissue. The injection of the numbing medication will be slightly painful and is similar to receiving a shot into your arm for a vaccination. This medication numbs the skin and muscle so that you do not feel pain when the biopsy is obtained.</description>

    <description>Blood and urine samples will be obtained and examined for markers inflammation and muscle catabolism. Sampling will occur at time of entry into study, and then once every 2-4 days and on the final day of participation or the last day of study (day 28). Peripheral blood will be collected from an existing venous line, or by venipuncture, if required. Urine will be collected from an existing catheter or if the patient is able to void on their own then we will provide a specimen cup. There will be no more than 14 ml of blood drawn at any given time point and a collection of 15 ml of urine at each time point.</description>

    <description>An investigator will perform range of motion on both legs, five days per week. The range of motion activity will include the investigator helping you bend and straighten each knee approximately 12 times. Rotation of the leg at the hip will also be performed by bending your knee and gently rotating your upper leg in a clockwise and counterclockwise motion. The range of motion will be performed on each leg and repeated five days per week.</description>
