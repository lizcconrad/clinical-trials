  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the immediate effects of retrograde rhinopharyngeal
      clearance with nasopharyngeal aspiration in children admitted with acute viral bronchiolitis.
      The investigators selected children, up to 12 months old, admitted for acute viral
      bronchiolitis. Patients were divided in aspiration group (AG), submitted to nasopharyngeal
      aspiration, and clearance group (CG), submitted to retrograde rhinopharyngeal clearance with
      physiological solution (0.9%) instillation (RRC) technique. In both groups children were
      evaluated three times in the same day in order to verify cardiorespiratory parameters,
      clinical score of respiratory dysfunction and adverse effects.

      Children up to 12 months old, admitted for acute viral acute viral bronchiolitis were
      selected. All children participating in the study should be in the first 48 hours of
      hospitalization. Patients were divided in aspiration group (AG), submitted to nasopharyngeal
      aspiration, and clearance group (CG), submitted to retrograde rhinopharyngeal clearance (RRC)
      technique with physiological solution (0.9%) instillation. In both groups children were
      evaluated three times in the same day (data collection 1 (C1) - performed early in the
      morning; data collecting 2 (C2) - performed in the early afternoon; and data collecting 3
      (C3) - performed in the evening). In each data collection, cardiorespiratory parameters and
      clinical score of respiratory dysfunction were evaluated before procedures (T0), 10 minutes
      after (T1) and 30 minutes after (T2). Adverse effects were evaluated during the whole day of
      the study.

    <description>The retrograde rhinopharyngeal clearance (RRC) is based on the inspiratory reflex that follows a slow and prolonged expiration (passive exhalation technique performed using a slow thoracic-abdominal compression that begins at the end of a spontaneous exhalation and continues until the expiratory reserve volume). At the end of the expiratory time, the child's mouth was closed by the hand of the researcher (raising the lower jaw), leading the child to perform a nasal aspiration maneuver. The instillation of saline (0.9%) preceded this step, resulting in the inhalation of the substance during the forced inspiration, contributing to the nasopharyngeal clearance.</description>

    <description>Nasopharyngeal aspiration consisted in the introduction of a catheter that, by using negative pressure (vacuum), promotes the suction of secretion from the airways. In order to do that, a sterile aspiration catheter was connected to an extension and carefully introduced into the nasal cavity of the patient. The saline instillation of 0.9% was used for humidification before the procedure.</description>
