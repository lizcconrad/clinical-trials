  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the HepaFat-Scan (a special sequence of images done in
      a MRI) can accurately detect the amount of fat in the liver.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The leading cause of liver disease for both adults and children in the US is nonalcoholic
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD), an obesity-related liver disease closely associated with the
      metabolic syndrome. NAFLD increases the risk of liver disease but also increases risk of type
      II diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the metabolic syndrome. Invasive liver biopsy
      has been considered the best diagnostic tool for confirming NAFLD. This study will establish
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) / magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) as a quantitative
      noninvasive &quot;virtual biopsy&quot; and benefit the health of children with liver diseases by
      decreasing risk and improving diagnosis. Specifically, in NAFLD, this fat quantification
      protocol will be broadly useful in future research studies, including therapies for NAFLD as
      well as for patient diagnosis and follow-up.
