  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young adults who have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) without co-occurring intellectual
      impairment face a fairly unique set of challenges as they transition out of secondary school.
      These students are often quite capable of succeeding in higher education and many of them
      have interest in pursuing advanced degrees, but the nature of their disability and associated
      deficits (e.g., poor time management and poor self-regulation) may impede success.
      Individualized, appropriately timed, and developmentally sensitive transition and support
      services may promote optimal outcomes for these young people. The goal of this project is to
      develop a comprehensive program to promote successful transition of students with ASD from
      high school to post-secondary education.

      The investigators propose to refine and then evaluate a novel transition support and
      intervention program for adolescents and young adults with ASD: STEPS [Stepped Transition in
      Education Program for Students with ASD]. By targeting improved self-regulation (SR) and
      self-determination (SD) in young people with ASD, the investigators assert that this program
      may have positive outcomes with respective to college adjustment and functional behavior.
      Although the program will be finalized during the first phase of the proposed project, at
      present STEPS is comprised of two levels (or steps), which match the student's particular
      needs in relation to transition planning. In Step 1, students facing transition (i.e., have
      identified the college they will attend (either 2-year or 4-year institution) but are still
      in high school) and their caregivers will receive information to assist in transition
      planning, undergo readiness self-assessments (to identify degree of preparedness for
      post-secondary school), and participate in interactive sessions online and in person to
      promote self-knowledge and determination. The goal of Step 1 is to assist families and
      students with transition planning, specifically ensuring that families and students have the
      tools needed to make informed choices and take necessary steps (e.g., remediating identified
      skill deficits) to increase the likelihood of a successful transition out of high school. In
      Step 2, college students with ASD will receive fairly intensive supports and interventions,
      including individual counseling, structured support services, social integration activities,
      and coaching to promote academic and social success. The following specific aims are
      proposed.
