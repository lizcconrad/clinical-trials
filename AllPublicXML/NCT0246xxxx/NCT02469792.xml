  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) will be extracted using Celution 800/CRS
      System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) from a portion of the fat harvested from the patient's front
      abdominal wall. Patients will undergo knee arthroscopic surgery followed by one-time
      intraarticular ADRC administration (directly into anterior cruciate ligament). This is a
      single arm study with no control. All patients receive cell therapy.

      Patients with verified diagnosis partial rupture of anterior cruciate ligament will undergo
      liposuction from front abdominal wall under local anesthesia. After that autologous ADRC will
      be extracted using Celution 800/CRS System (Cytori Therapeutics Inc) from harvested adipose
      tissue. Same day patients will undergo knee arthroscopic surgery followed by one-time
      intraarticular freshly isolated ADRC administration (directly into anterior cruciate ligament
      close to the rupture).
