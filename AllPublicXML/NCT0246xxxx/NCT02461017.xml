  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endotracheal tube (ETT) leak test (LT), or audible leak test is a widely performed
      assessment to verify appropriate tube size in neonates, infants and children. However, many
      factors are known to influence the audible leak test. Even though the test is widely
      performed, the accuracy has not been evaluated.

    <textblock>
      The endotracheal tube (ETT) leak test (LT), or audible leak when the peak airway pressures
      reach 15-30 cmH2O, is a commonly performed assessment to confirm that an endotracheal tube
      size is appropriate for a child in order to minimize the risk of airway injury and adverse
      events after removal of ETT. Many factors are known to affect the results of the leak test
      and variation in results among experienced anesthesiologists may be as great as 38%, but the
      accuracy of the audible leak test by directly observing the presence of a leak around the ETT
      has not been evaluated. This study will attempt to use direct visualization of the air leak
      to correlate to and assess the accuracy of the audible air leak test.

    <description>In supine position, the head will be positioned in neutral position. With fresh gas flow at 2-5L/min, and pop off valve in the anesthesia machine closed and pressure in the inspiratory circuit is slowly increased until an audible leak is heard at the mouth. That pressure will be recorded.</description>

    <description>In the same patient position, a flexible nasal laryngoscope will be inserted and positioned superior to the laryngeal inlet by the surgeon. With fresh gas flow at 2-5L/min, and pop off valve in the anesthesia machine closed, the pressure in the inspiratory circuit will be increased slowly until a leak around the TT will be visualized by inspecting the supraglottic area for bubbles or air movement around the TT. The peak pressure at which leak is observed physically will be recorded. This is the end of the study.</description>
