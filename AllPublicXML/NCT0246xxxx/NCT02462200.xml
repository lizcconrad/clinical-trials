  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled superiority trial of standard
      breast-conserving surgery (BCS) versus BCS with cavity shave margins (CSM). The main
      objectives of this trial will be to evaluate prospectively the impact of routine standardized
      CSM on margin status following primary surgery for early stage breast cancer (Stage 0 - II),
      on post-operative patient satisfaction and cosmetic outcomes, and on general intraoperative
      time and operative costs. A parallel group format will be implemented to compare this
      modified surgical therapy - BCS with CSM - with BCS alone, which is the current standard of
      care.

    <description>The BREAST-Q questionnaire consists of 13 sections.
The sections ask the patient questions about how they feel about how their breast area looks, how they feel emotionally, any physical side effects, and sexual side effects.
Some of the sections ask the patients to answer a question on a scale of None of the Time (equals=1) to All of the Time (equals=5)
Some of the sections ask the patients to answer a question on a scale of Very Dissatisfied (equals=1) to Very Satisfied (equals=4)</description>

    <description>The investigators plan to assess plasma and serum levels of several candidate biomarkers, including a phosphorylated form of the annexin A2 protein (&quot;P-annexin A2&quot;), in study patients by immunoblotting/ELISA. This biomarker evaluation in the context of disease status will provide new information in the clinical detection and diagnosis of malignancy. Successful validation of these biomarkers may lead to development of novel blood-based cancer diagnostic tests.</description>

The ICG will be prepared per manufacturer instructions and diluted to allow for intravenous dosing up to 0.5 mg/kg (except for those patients with iodine or seafood allergies or in cases where the goggles are unavailable for use).
Following the BCS procedures, the surgeon or a study team member will don the goggles and state the NIR fluorescence margin information of the excised primary tumor specimen and of and CSM that are taken.</description>

    <description>Partial mastectomy, lumpectomy, or local excisional biopsy with or without needle/wire localization with the addition of additional tissue specimens from all 6 margins (anterior, posterior, superior, inferior, medial, lateral) of the wound cavity if possible. In cases where an additional margin would involve the skin at the anterior margin and/or the pectoral muscle at the posterior margin, only the 4 (or 5) remaining margins should be obtained
A margin thickness of 1 cm will be the defined goal to establish uniformity among different surgeons and allow for appropriate pathological evaluation
The ICG will be prepared per manufacturer instructions and diluted to allow for intravenous dosing up to 0.5 mg/kg (no iodine or seafood allergies).
Following the BCS procedures, the surgeon or a study team member will don the goggles and state the NIR fluorescence margin information of the excised primary tumor specimen and of any CSM that are taken.</description>
