      This Phase 3, open-label, triple arm study aims to evaluate the overall survival (OS) of
      fotemustine versus the combination of ipilimumab and fotemustine or the combination of
      Ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with metastatic melanoma with brain metastasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive tumor associated with very poor prognosis. Brain
      metastases develop in nearly half of MM pts and in 30 to 40% of these subjects, the brain is
      the first site of relapse. The limited activity of available agents, along with relative
      resistance to radiotherapy and poor CNS penetration of most chemotherapeutic agents, make
      this one of the most daunting problems in oncology. There is no optimal systemic or local
      therapy for melanoma metastatic to the brain. Though MM pts with brain metastases have been
      excluded from most phase II-III trials with ipilimumab, initial evidences suggest that the
      anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab might be active as single-agent also in this
      clinical setting. Preliminary results from the NIBIT-M1 phase II trial suggest for the safety
      and efficacy of the combination of fotemustine plus ipilimumab in MM pts with or w/o brain
      metastases.Recent data from a phase I study in MM pts w/o brain metastases have shown that
      concurrent administration of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) plus the anti-PD1 mAb nivolumab (1 mg/kg)
      induced objective responses in 53% of pts, with a tumor reduction of â‰¥80% in 41% of pts, with
      an 82% 1-year OS, and with an acceptable safety profile.Based on the long-term follow-up of
      the NIBIT-M1 study, and on the activity of the concurrent administration of ipilimumab and
      nivolumabthe NIBIT-M2 study will explore the efficacy of the combination of ipilimumab and
      fotemustine or ipilimumab and nivolumab versus fotemustine alone in pts with melanoma
      metastatic to the brain.

For those subjects who have not died, OS will be censored at the recorded last date of subject contact, and for subjects with a missing recorded last date of contact, OS will be censored at the last date the subject was known to be alive.</description>

Note that if an assessment of irPR occurs before confirmation of irCR, the duration of immune-related response endpoint will not begin at the time that the irBOR of irCR is shown but rather at the earlier time-point showing irPR.
