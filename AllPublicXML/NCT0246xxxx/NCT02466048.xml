      material, in patients with spinal fusion.

    <textblock>
      This study is an open-trial study. The study will be explained to the subjects and they
      voluntarily agreed to participate in it. Their eligibility to participate in the study will
      be checked, either the right or left side of one patient will be selected for the study
      group, and the other, for the control group, through randomization. In the area for the study
      group, autogenous bones and SurgiFillTM will be grafted; and in the area for the control
      group, only the autogenous bones will be grafted. They will be asked to follow the guidelines
      of the investigators during the study and to visit the hospital seven times, including for
      screening. At each visit, the subjects undergo an examination with doctors, a CT scan, a
      X-ray, and a SPECT/CT procedure to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SurgiFill™. (*If the
      subject gets surgery on the screening date, the total number of his or her visits will be
      six).

    <description>A CT scan shall be conducted one week, and six and 12 months, post-operatively to calculate and record the bone integration volume. The changes in the bone integration volume shown in the CT images shall be compared and analyzed. In other words, the mean values of the experiment group's bone integration volume shown in CT images 1week, six and 12 months post-operatively shall be compared and analyzed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS Score change of Back pain questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>screening, 6month and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The level of the pain (i.e., the lumbar pain and the pain radiating to the upper and lower extremities) shall be recorded using the VAS before the spondylodesis, and at six and 12 months post-operatively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ODI Score change of Back pain questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>screening, 6month and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>Using the ODI score from the ODQ, the disturbances in the daily activities associated with the lumbar pain shall be compared before the spondylodesis, and at six and 12 months post-operatively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of abnormal blood test result of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12month</time_frame>
    <description>Regardless of the clinical trial, if there are blood tests' results of participants with adverse events such as hematologic examination (WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin(Hb), Hematocrit(Hct), Platelet(PLT), ESR) and general chemistry (BUN, Creatinine(Cr), AST, ALT, CRP) closed to the day of regular visit, they shall be recorded on the CRF at screening or after spinal fusion. If there is any abnormality of the results, the number of abnormal blood test result will be recorded, and then additionally the result shall be analyzed according to the investigator's judgment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Spinal Fusion</intervention_name>
    <description>Spinal fusion, also known as spondylodesis or spondylosyndesis, is a surgical technique used to join two or more vertebrae. Supplementary bone tissue, from the patient (autograft), is used in conjunction with the body's natural bone growth (osteoblastic) processes to fuse the vertebrae. Either the right or left side of one patient will be selected for the study group, and the other, for the control group, through randomization. In the study group site, SurgiFill™ and the autogenous bone mixture shall be transplanted, whereas in the control group site, only the autogenous bone shall be transplanted. The autogenous bones are from iliac part.</description>
