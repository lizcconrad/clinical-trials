      The aim of this study is to develop a reliable and valid instrument to measure symptom
      management (experience and / or management strategies) during exacerbation episodes in CF
      patients. For the development a sequential exploratory two phase mixed-method study will be
      applied. In a first step, up to 25 CF patients will be interviewed: approximately 15 CF
      patients who experienced at least one episode of exacerbation in the past year and
      approximately CF 10 patients who are currently experiencing an exacerbation. The latter group
      will be interviewed up to 3 times during and after the antibiotic treatment. The instruments
      initial item list will be developed on basis of the interviews. Up to five health
      professionals will rate the items' relevance. In a further step, items' clarity and relevance
      will be assessed by cognitive debriefing interviews with no more than 10 patients. In the
      last step (part III), the instrument's preliminary construct and concurrent validity and
      reliability will be tested in a larger sample up to 150 patients experiencing exacerbation.
      Patients will be asked to complete the newly developed questionnaires and a set of other
      questionnaires at one time point. For part III, ethic approval will be asked at a later date
      (2015).
