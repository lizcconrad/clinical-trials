  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence that early treatment leads to better outcomes for patients
      with inflammatory arthritis (IA). Triage, which is the process of identifying the urgency of
      a patient's disease state efficiently and correctly, may facilitate early referral to a
      rheumatologist. Several studies have suggested that placing allied health professionals
      (occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, etc.) in a triage roll may reduce wait
      time for patients with suspected IA. The goal of this investigation will be to demonstrate
      the system-level impact of an Arthritis Society extended role occupational therapist (OT) or
      physical therapist (PT) working in a triage role in improving access to rheumatologists for
      people with IA. In this study two groups will be observed: intervention and &quot;usual care&quot; as
      determined by historical chart review. Wait times will be compared between both groups.
