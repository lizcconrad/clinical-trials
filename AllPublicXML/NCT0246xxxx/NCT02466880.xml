  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a culturally appropriate, low cost and sustainable management
      plan for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Various randomized controlled trials
      confirmed that T2DM can be delayed with lifestyle intervention and programmes which promote
      improvements in diet, increased physical activity and weight loss. Translation of lifestyle
      intervention to real-life settings however remains a major challenge.

      The investigators therefore propose a diabetes management trial for T2DM patients using
      telemedicine. This project's innovations include the use of information technology to deliver
      messages to the physicians while similarly involving family members of diabetics to manage
      the patient's condition collectively. This creates a sense of well-being, empowering the
      individual as well as the community to be responsible for their own health and well-being
