    <textblock>
      Inadequate pain management is a common problem encountered in ED settings. Pain relief
      medications use is often limited by their side effects. Evidence suggests that non
      pharmacologic pain relief techniques such as acupuncture can play a central role to treat
      pain in acute conditions, but their application is still scarce.

    <textblock>
      Pain is a common cause of emergency department visits and its control remains a challenge and
      health priority worldwide. Many techniques were developed to control pain and to ensure
      patients comfort but their application is still difficult especially in emergency department
      (ED) settings, due to the variety of treated conditions, the non-availability of qualified
      practitioners and the patient's specificity. Pharmacologic methods in particular IV opioids
      are the most used and with regard to their rapid action with high efficacy. But the use of
      these drugs can be limited by their side effects. Non-pharmacologic pain relief techniques
      such as acupuncture have been proposed. During the second half of the twentieth century,
      acupuncture was established in Europe and in the last two decades, it has spread around the
      world. In Tunisia, acupuncture was introduced into the health system in the 90s, particularly
      to treat pain.

      The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized acupuncture as safe and sound therapy. A
      preliminary list of acupuncture indications has been reported including 43 diseases. However,
      the introduction of acupuncture in the treatment of pain in ED is more recent or even
      anecdotal. In the treatment of chronic pain, it was shown that acupuncture is comparable to
      morphine and that its better safety profile makes it the method of choice in some clinical
      conditions.

      In a recent systematic review, it has been concluded that there is insufficient evidence for
      the use of acupuncture in the ED settings due to the paucity of randomized controlled trials
      and the suboptimal methodological qualities of related studies.

      The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture compared with
      morphine for the management of acute pain in ED.

    <description>Change of pain score was assessed at 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 minutes time points from the starting of the protocol.
Pain severity was measured using the visual analogic scale (VAS) going from 10 (maximum imaginable pain) to 0 (no pain). if the VAS was not applicable to certain patients, a verbal numeric rating scale (NRS) was used instead.
Success of treatment was defined by a drop in the pain intensity under 30.</description>

recurrent vomiting non controlled by the standard measures
Altered mental status
Uncontrolled bleeding from the site of needle insertion
Respiratory distress with capillary saturation under 95% or signs of pneumothorax</description>
