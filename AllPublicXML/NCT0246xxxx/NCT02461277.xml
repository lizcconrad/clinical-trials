      The aim of this study was to compare the functional capacity of exercise by six-minute walk
      test before and after thoracic surgical procedure in subjects who have undergone the
      Fast-track protocol with those who were under conventional care. Researchers want to find out
      if Fast-track is a strategy to enhance functional capacity after thoracic surgery.

      Fast track programs represents a new approach to the management of patients undergoing
      surgery. It is perioperative care pathway designed to achieve early recovery and helps to
      minimize postoperative morbidity and mortality.

      These multimodal approaches focuses on enhancing recovery and reducing of surgical stress by
      minimal invasive surgery, optimized pain relief, early nutrition and ambulation.

      In postoperative, the bed rest leads to the increase in muscle loss and weakness, impairs
      pulmonary function, predisposes to venous stasis and thromboembolism, increases infection
      complications and reduces functional capacity.

      However, information on the results of Fast-track protocols in functional capacity of
      exercise during hospital stay is sparse.

      The six-minute walk test is use to measure of functional capacity of exercise in different
      populations and to detect changes after interventions. The distances traveled in two
      six-minute walk test (preoperative and postoperative) will be compared between the two groups
      (Fast-track and Conventional).

      In this trial the investigators will consider Fast-track protocol to be feasible to enhance
      functional capacity of exercise after thoracic surgery.

    <description>Before surgery, patients are informed about the surgical procedure, anesthesia and rehabilitation protocol. The surgery occurs in accordance with the principles of the Fast-track: minimal invasive surgery, epidural anesthetic management, avoiding the need opioid in postoperatory analgesia and use of an standardized postoperatory management protocol to an early oral intake and early mobilization.</description>

    <description>Preoperatory management, epidural anesthetic management, avoiding the need opioid in postoperatory analgesia and use of an standardized postoperatory management protocol to an early oral intake and early mobilization. At the postoperative recovery room, after extubation and fully awake, patients started physiotherapy exercises, as physical exercises of moving up upper and lower extremities accompanied by deep breathing exercises. After than, the patients standed up beside the bed and if there was no complications, patients performed ambulation. The physiotherapist aided the patients during all period.</description>
