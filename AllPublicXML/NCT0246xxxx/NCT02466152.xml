  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the systemic exposure and pharmacokinetic parameters of GSK2894512
      following twice daily topical administration of 1% and 2% cream in adult subjects with AD,
      and will provide information about the systemic safety as well as local safety and
      tolerability following twice daily application to up to 35% body surface area (BSA) of
      affected skin of subjects with AD. It will be an open-label, sequential study consisting of 2
      cohorts. A cohort of 6 subjects (Cohort 1) will apply GSK2894512 (cream, 2%) to affected skin
      on an area ranging from 15 to 35% of the total BSA for 20 days plus a final dose on Day 21.
      Cohort 2 will consist of 6 subjects that will apply 1% cream. Cohort 2 will follow the same
      procedures as Cohort 1.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent

          -  Confirmed clinical diagnosis of AD according to established criteria by Hanifin at the
             screening visit.

          -  History of AD of at least 6 months.

          -  Atopic dermatitis on 15-35%, of the BSA, (scalp and area around the eyes not included
             as treatment area) at baseline. Note: 1% BSA is approximately equal to the surface of
             one hand with fingers together (a handprint)

          -  An IGA of AD score of &gt;=3 at baseline.

          -  Male: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with
             the following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study
             medication until at least five half-lives of study medication after the last dose of
             study medication:

               1. Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia.

               2. Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options: Contraceptive
                  sub-dermal implant that meets the standard operating procedure (SOP)
                  effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the
                  product label; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the SOP
                  effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the
                  product label; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone,
                  Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive
                  patches.

        These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly
        and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that
        subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  A woman is eligible to participate if she is of non-reproductive potential, defined
             as:

               1. Postmenopausal (including all women over 60 years of age).

               2. Females with one of the following procedures documented and no plans to utilize
                  assisted reproductive techniques (e.g., in vitro fertilization or donor embryo
                  transfer): Bilateral tubal ligation or salpingectomy; Hysteroscopic tubal
                  occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion;
                  Hysterectomy; Bilateral oophorectomy (surgical menopause) Note: A practical
                  definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, &gt;45 years, in the absence of hormone
                  replacement therapy [HRT] or medical suppression of the menstrual cycle). In
                  questionable cases for women &lt;60 years of age, a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone and estradiol falling into the central laboratory's
                  postmenopausal reference range is confirmatory. Women &lt;60 years of age who are on
                  HRT, wish to continue, and whose menopausal status is in doubt are required to
                  use a highly-effective method to avoid pregnancy. Otherwise, they must
                  discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study
                  enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between
                  cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and
                  dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of postmenopausal status, HRT may be
                  resumed during the study without use of a highly-effective method to avoid
                  pregnancy

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Protocol which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin &gt;1.5x Upper limit of normal (ULN)
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%) at screening.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities

          -  QTc &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

        NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula
        (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or manually
        over-read. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and
        discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the
        study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for
        an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the
        subject from the trial. For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT correction
        formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will be used as specified in the
        Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP).

          -  Concurrent conditions and history of other diseases: Immunocompromized (e.g.,
             lymphoma, Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome) or have a
             history of malignant disease within 5 years before the baseline visit; Presence at
             screening or baseline of an active acute bacterial, fungal or viral skin infection
             (e.g., herpes simplex, herpes zoster, chicken pox); Any other concomitant skin
             disorder (e.g., generalized erythroderma such as Netherton's Syndrome, or psoriasis),
             significant hyperpigmentation, or extensive scarring that in the opinion of the
             investigator may interfere with the evaluation of AD lesions or compromise subject
             safety; Clinical signs of infection (viral, fungal or bacterial) on the treatment
             areas; Other types of eczema.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  A positive drug/alcohol screen at screening.

          -  A positive test for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody at screening.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
