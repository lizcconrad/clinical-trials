  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue, and failure to surgically remove a
      cancer-affected lymph node or residual cancer at the surgical margin reduces a patient's
      chance of survival. Moreover, damage to adjacent normal tissue during surgery can result in
      significant morbidity. The investigators hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical
      outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize the edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer
      cells that have spread to other sites in real-time as they operate. This is a safety study to
      assess the safety of BLZ-100 in patients with soft tissue sarcoma undergoing surgery.

      Subjects who provide voluntary written informed consent will be screened for eligibility.
      Subjects meeting all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to
      participate.

      This is a two part study:

      Part 1 - Dose Finding: Subjects will be required to arrive at the phase 1 unit for dosing 2-3
      days prior to the planned surgical excision. Two dose levels of BLZ-100 (3 mg and 12 mg) will
      be evaluated in a total of 6 subjects with a 2-3 day post-dose imaging interval (also defined
      as the Intermediate Imaging interval).

      Part 2 - Imaging Interval Assessment: The BLZ-100 dose to be evaluated in Part 2 will be
      determined by the Protocol Steering Committee following completion of Part 1. In Part 2, up
      to 15 additional subjects will be randomized into one of three imaging interval groups (up to
      6 subjects per group): Early Imaging (within 1 day post BLZ-100 dose), Intermediate Imaging
      (2-3 days post BLZ-100 dose), and Late Imaging (4-7 days post BLZ-100 dose). Subjects will be
      required to arrive at the phase 1 unit for dosing between 1 and 7 days prior to planned
      surgical excision, depending on which imaging interval they are randomized to.

      Following dosing, all subjects will be monitored for safety.

    <description>All participants in the study will receive the investigational drug product BLZ-100.
In part 1 of the study, two dose levels of BLZ-100 will be evaluated (3 mg and 12 mg) in 6 subjects, with a 2-3 post-dose imaging window.
In part 2 of the study up to 15 additional subjects will be randomized to one of three imaging interval groups (up to 6 subjects/interval): Early Imaging (within 1 day post-BLZ-100 dose), Intermediate Imaging (2 - 3 days post- BLZ-100 dose), and Late Imaging (4 - 7 days post- BLZ-100 dose).</description>

    <description>All subjects enrolled in the study will receive doses of BLZ-100, an investigational drug for imaging tumors.
Three different imaging windows will be investigated during the study:
Early Imaging (imaging occurs within 1 day post-BLZ-100 dose); Intermediate Imaging (imaging occurs within 2-3 days post-BLZ-100 dose); Late Imaging (imaging occurs 4-7 post-BLZ-100 dose)
All subjects in Part 1 of the study will be imaged in the Intermediate Imaging group. Subjects in Part 2 of the study will be randomized into one of the three imaging groups.</description>
