      To compare and analysis pharmacokinetics of PEX 168 in patients with renal insufficiency or
      normal renal function who were administrated subcutaneously single dose PEX168.To evaluate
      dose adjustment of PEX168 administered in patients with renal insufficiency and provide a
      scientific basis in patients with renal insufficiency of rational drug use.

      This is an open, non-randomized, parallel-group, single-dose study that evaluated the
      pharmacokinetics of PEX168 when single dose administered with PEX168 in patients with renal
      insufficiency and normal renal function subjects. The total duration of each subject's
      participation in the study was approximately 45 days, which included up to a 14-day Screening
      Period, a 31-day PK sample collecting Period.

      Center: This study was conducted at two sites in the Third Xiangya hospital of Center South
      University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital.All subjects receives a single 200μg doses of
      PEX168 injected subcutaneously on Day 1.
