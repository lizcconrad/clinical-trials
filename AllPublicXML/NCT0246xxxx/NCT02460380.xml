  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects 5 to 10% of women of reproductive age. It is
      characterized by a cluster of hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinemia, menstrual dysfunction,
      hirsutism and infertility. Although the pathogenesis of PCOS is unknown, accumulating
      evidence suggests that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) dysregulation may be implicated.
      TGF-β is the prototype member of the TGF-β superfamily of proteins. TGF-βs exert a diverse
      range of biological functions regulating cell proliferation, angiogenesis, fibroblast
      activation and tissue fibrosis. PCOS ovaries show all the hallmarks of TGF-β upregulation,
      including increased collagen deposition in ovarian stroma and theca, supported by increased
      vascularity. Consistent with this, The investigators recently showed that TGF-β1 is increased
      in serum of PCOS women while its circulating receptor soluble endoglin (sENG) is decreased,
      resulting in greater TGF-β1 bioavailability. PCOS patients also have decreased vitamin D
      levels, and vitamin D treatment has been previously shown to improve various clinical
      parameters in PCOS women, including glucose intolerance, hypertension and androgen levels.
      Interestingly, vitamin D has been shown to decrease TGF-β1 levels in several diseases where
      TGF-β1 is elevated, including myelofibrosis. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that
      vitamin D treatment of PCOS women will result in a decrease of serum TGF-β1 levels
      concomitant with improvement in clinical disease parameters. In addition, the investigators
      hypothesize that improvement in clinical disease parameters will correlate with changes in
      TGF-β1 bioavailability. Our aim in the present study is to investigate the effects of vitamin
      D treatment on serum TGF-β1/sENG levels in PCOS women, and assess whether changes in
      TGF-β1/sENG levels following vitamin D treatment correlate with clinical disease in these
      women. For this end, PCOS patients who are vitamin D-deficient will be treated with vitamin D
      and their serum levels of TGF-β1 and its sENG receptor will be measured before and after
      treatment. In addition, clinical disease parameters will be recorded before and 4 months
      after treatment, including serum glucose and insulin levels, serum androgen levels, and blood
      pressure.

      The proposed study aims to identify a putative link between vitamin D and TGF-β1 in the
      context of PCOS, and provide a novel molecular explanation for the beneficial clinical
      effects of vitamin D on PCOS patients.

      This study is a randomized, single blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      vitamin D on vitamin D-deficient women with PCOS. 93 reproductive-aged women diagnosed with
      PCOS presenting to Maimonides Medical Center for annual check-up between October 2013 and
      March 2015 were screened for vitamin D deficiency (defined as 25 hydroxy-vitaminD [25OH-D]
      levels &lt;20 ng/mL). All participants signed the informed consent and the study was approved by
      the international review board (IRB) of Maimonides Medical Center. PCOS was diagnosed
      according to the Rotterdam Consensus (ESHRE/ASRM criteria), i.e. the presence of two of three
      criteria: oligo- or anovulation, signs of clinical hyperandrogenism, and/or biochemical signs
      of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography after exclusion of specific
      identifiable disorders (thyroid disorder, hyperprolactinemia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
      androgen-secreting tumors, and Cushing's syndrome). The investigators included women aged
      between 18 and 38 years who were not: 1) pregnant, postpartum, breastfeeding, 2) taking any
      vitamin D supplements, metformin or any hormonal therapy, 3) diagnosed with poor ovarian
      reserve (AMH&lt;1ng/mL).

      Interventions and blood collection 68 women diagnosed with PCOS and vitamin D deficiency were
      enrolled. Participants were allocated to each group according to a computer-generated list
      using ratio 2/1 (Vitamin D/placebo). Women allocated to vitamin D group received one capsule
      50.000 IU of vitamin D3 once weekly for eight weeks. The vitamin D supplementation regimen
      was extracted from the Endocrine Society guidelines. Women in the placebo group received once
      capsule of placebo once weekly for eight weeks. The placebo was prepared at Maimonides
      Medical Center's pharmacy. To ensure compliance, The investigators called each participant
      once weekly and reminded her to take her pill. Fasting blood samples were collected by
      venipuncture before starting and within two weeks after completing the treatment (vitamin D
      or placebo). Blood samples were allowed to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature before
      centrifugation at 1,200 rpm for 10 minutes. Serum was stored at -80°C in aliquots until
      assayed.

      The assays of all measured hormones, 25OH-D, TGF-β1, sENG, and AMH:

      Serum 25OH-D levels were measured before and after completing the treatment. The levels were
      determined by the ADVIA Centaur vitamin D assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics).
      Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG),
      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing
      hormone (LH) were measured using IMMULITE 2000 XPi immunoassay system (Siemens Healthcare
      USA). Insulin and prolactin concentrations were quantified by DXL 800 immunoassay analyzer
      according to manufacturer's protocols (Beckman Coulter). Insulin resistance was calculated
      according to the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) (29) by using the following formula:
      Insulin resistance (HOMA IR) = [fasting insulin (µU/mL) x fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/22.5.
      17OH-progesterone level was determined by ELISA assay (Eagle BioSciences). AMH concentration
      was measured using the ultrasensitive AMH/MIS CLIA kit (AnshLabs). TGF-β1 concentration was
      measured using Human TGF-beta1 Quantikine ELISA kit according to manufacturer's protocols
      (R&amp;D Systems). sENG levels were quantified by Human Endoglin/CD105 Quantikine ELISA kit (R&amp;D
      Systems). The inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation for all assays were less
      than 10%.

      Clinical parameters:

      All the clinical parameters were evaluated before and four months after the completion of
      treatment. These parameters included blood pressure (BP), Ferriman-Gallwey score (FGS)
      (hirsutism score), acne status, and interval between periods.

      Statistical analysis:

      Data were tested for normality. All values were expressed as mean ± standard error of the
      mean (SEM). A paired student's t-test was used to compare pre- and post-treatment serum
      levels and clinical parameters. Correlation between changes in serum TGF-β1/sENG and changes
      in clinical disease parameters was analyzed using Pearson's test and linear regression.
      X2-test was used to evaluate the changes in acne after treatment. SigmaStat (SPSS Science,
      Chicago, IL) was used for statistical analysis. P&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically
      significant.
