  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the second largest infectious disease that causes death in the last 4
      centuries in all the world. Observational studies found an association between vitaminD and
      TB, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of vitaminD supplementation in patients with
      active tuberculosis. The hypothesis is that the administration of vitaminD is associated with
      changes in the levels of cytokines in patients with tuberculosis treated with first-line
      drugs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of vitaminD supplementation on the
      clinical course, the time of negative smears and cultures, and the effect on the immune
      response in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TBP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are going to include of 60 patients diagnosed with confirmed TBP with and without diabetes
      mellitus, by positive smear and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to
      first-line drugs (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol), which will be grouped
      as follows: 1) patients who receive vitamin D (VD) (n = 30) and 2) patients who not receive
      vitamin D (NVD) (n = 30) in addition to drug treatment of tuberculosis drug frontline. Blood
      samples must be taken each month until the end of treatment.The VD group of participants will
      receive treatment with a daily dose of Vitamin D 200 International Units (IU) during the
      first two months of treatment. All Patients who participate must give their written consent.

      First, we are going to separate the peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Ficoll reagent.
      Then, for the determination of intracellular cytokines in basal conditions and after the
      antigenic stimulation with M.tuberculosis, the flow cytometric technique is going to be used
      and the results will be analyzing in a flow cytometer. We are going to infected cells with M.
      tuberculosis strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and 10, in order to determinate
      phagocytosis and bactericidal activity of peripheral whole blood of patients, using Colony
      Forming Units (CFU) and staining. Extraction of RNA will be performed according to the kit
      supplier. The amplification reaction is going to perform with Applied Biosystems and Sybr
      Green Master Mix. We are going to use the unpaired Student t test, for the normal
      distribution parameters.

    <description>First, we are going to separate the peripheral blood mononuclear cells with Ficoll reagent. Cells were adjusted and placed in 1 mL tubes, with an antibody will be incubated for 15 min. at room temperature. Anti-antibody corresponding isotypes are going to incubate for 20 min at room temperature. The cells are going to be fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde before acquiring and analyzing in the flow cytometer. The concentration of Interleucin 17 (IL-17), Interferon-g and Tumor Necrosis Factor-a in culture supernatants of infected cells in vitro with M.tuberculosis are going to be measure. We are going to determinate them by ELISA.</description>
