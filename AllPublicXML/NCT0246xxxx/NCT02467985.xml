  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery suffer in 30-85% of cases of referred pain in the
      shoulder in the first days following their intervention. Pain can be disabling and may even
      delay the discharge of patients. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce this
      problem. Promising strategies include the reduction of CO2 insufflation flow, lung
      recruitment maneuvers and active aspiration of intraperitoneal air at the end of surgical
      procedure to force gas discharge. The investigators wish to perform a randomized controlled
      trial with 160 women, who will assess the effect of a combined approach, combining for the
      first time lung recruitment maneuvers and aspiration of pneumoperitoneum in the Trendelenburg
      position at the end of surgery and flow of insufflation reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) forming
      the pneumoperitoneum during surgery, on the intensity of shoulder pain postoperatively. In
      the control group the evacuation of the pneumoperitoneum will be done by opening the trocars
      and external abdominal pressure at the end of surgery. No study to our knowledge has tested
      the active aspiration maneuvers gas after laparoscopic surgery in gynecology. The study will
      be preceded by a pilot study in 15 participants, who will be assigned to the control group to
      determine the basic rate of referred pain in the shoulder in our people and improve test
      management.

After the intervention, the CO2 insufflation is discontinued, accessories trocars are removed under direct vision and the incisions the sites of these trocars will be closed. Patients will be placed in the Trendelenburg position 30 degrees, head tilted down. The umbilical trocar is opened. Suction is inserted into the trocar, taking care to stay inside the jacket of the trocar. Active suction gas will during lung recruitment. This maneuver will be performed by the anesthesiologist who applies 5 subsequent forced breaths, up to 40 cm H2O pressure, taking care to maintain the insufflation last 5 sec. Once completed, the suction will be removed, the laparoscope is inserted into the trocar to verify the absence of trauma to underlying structures.</description>
