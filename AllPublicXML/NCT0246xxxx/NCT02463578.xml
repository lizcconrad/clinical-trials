    <textblock>
      Exploratory study of anti-pneumococcal immune response in patients with Anti-neutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) immunized according to new vaccine
      recommendations (i.e. with a combined vaccine schedule (13-valent conjugate pneumococcal
      vaccine -PCV13- followed by a 23-valent non-conjugate pneumococcal vaccine -PPV23- 8 weeks
      later).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether this vaccination schedule induces
      sufficient protective immunity (serotype-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
      and opsonophagocytosis (OPA) response rates) in AAV-patients receiving immunosuppressive
      therapy.
