    <textblock>
      This research study will test whether a series of video clips with breast cancer information
      improves knowledge of breast cancer, breast cancer treatment and living with breast cancer.
      Questionnaires will be completed to learn if the videos are helpful and pleasant to watch.

    <textblock>
      Though Black women have a lower breast cancer rate than White women, Black women have the
      poorest outcomes of all races and ethnicities. Low cancer knowledge and mistrust of the
      healthcare system have been shown to lead to poorer outcomes following breast cancer
      diagnosis. Participants are asked to be in this research study if they are a woman age 21
      years or older who identifies as Black/ African American and has been diagnosed with breast
      cancer within the past 6 months.

      First, participants will come to a pre-intervention study appointment and will be asked to
      complete several questionnaires. The questionnaires will ask about breast cancer knowledge,
      quality of life, and their relationship with their doctor. Participants will then opt-in to
      the study by sending a text message to the study.

      For the next ten ten weeks, participants will receive a text message with a link to one video
      clip per week. Each video is 15-20 minutes long and contains information about breast cancer.
      Participants will also receive one supportive text message per week for ten weeks.

      At the end of the ten weeks, participants will be scheduled for a follow-up appointment.
      Participants will again be asked questions about breast cancer knowledge, quality of life,
      and their relationship with their doctor. Participants will also be asked what was helpful
      and not helpful about the videos.

    <measure>Breast Cancer Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment (Week 1) to post-intervention assessment (Week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>Breast cancer knowledge will be assessed using the Knowledge subscales of the Breast Cancer Surgery Decision Quality Instrument, short version 2 (BCS-DQI, SV2) developed by Massachusetts General Hospital. The knowledge subscale has twelve multiple choice or fill in the blank items about breast cancer, treatment options, recurrence, survival and side effects.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Involvement in Care Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment (Week 1) to post-intervention assessment (Week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Involvement in Care Scale (PICS) is a 13 item self-report scale that assesses patient's perception of doctor and patient behaviors that occur during a medical visit. It assesses the patients' perception of the doctors' facilitation of patient involvement, amount of information exchanged between the patient and doctor, and patient involvement in decision making.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment (Week 1) to post-intervention assessment (Week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a 10-item, self-report questionnaire of globally perceived stress. Each item is rated for the past month on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = never to 5 = very often). A higher total score indicates greater stress.</description>

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment (Week 1) to post-intervention assessment (Week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire is a global measure of quality of life. The FACT-B assesses well-being across five broad domains (i.e., physical, spiritual, social/family, emotional, and functional) and one specific domain of breast cancer symptoms. The instructions ask participants to indicate to what degree each statement has been &quot;true&quot; during the past seven days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment (Week 1) to post-intervention assessment (Week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire queries the participant's ratings of the acceptability of the program. Item content includes: program was a good use of my time, program was helpful, program will be useful in my daily life, program has helped me deal with my breast cancer, likeability of of the interventionist, acceptability of mobile health (mhealth) format, perceived skill of interventionist, ease of participation in intervention, interactions with program staff, ease of trouble shooting difficulties and overall rating</description>
