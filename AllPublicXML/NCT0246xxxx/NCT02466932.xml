  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of birth weight (BW) on ocular anterior segment parameters
      in preschool children using the Galilei Dual-Sheimpflug Analyzer (GD-SA). Children were
      measured by GD-SA and relationships between all anterior segment parameters obtained by this
      device and birth weight were analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preschoolers, who were born heavier, had thicker cornea and lens, longer axial length, and
      flatter corneal curve. The thicknesses and axial curves of central cornea within 7mm may be
      particularly associated with BW.
