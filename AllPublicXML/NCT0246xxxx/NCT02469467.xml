      The purpose is to evaluate the tolerability, safety and efficacy of VS-505 when given with
      meal for 8 weeks to hemodialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia

    <textblock>
      This study consists of 4 period; 1) screening period: up to 30 days, 2) first washout period:
      2 weeks (remove existing phosphate binder effect), 3) treatment period: 8 weeks, and 4)
      second washout period: 2 weeks (remove VS-505 effect). VS-505 is orally administered with
      meal for 8 weeks. The starting dose of VS-505 is 1.50 g/day and the dose will be elevated
      step wise from 1.50 g to 2.25 g, 4.50 g and 6.75 g per day based on the safety assessment and
      plasma Pi level every 2 weeks during the treatment period.
