  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of childhood obesity has increased at an alarming rate over the last decades,
      both globally and in Denmark. There are a number of serious sequelae related to obesity, such
      as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, fatty liver and prediabetes. Obesity is found to be a
      risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA in childhood is known to be associated
      with cardiovascular complications, neurocognitive problems and reduced quality of life. The
      correlation between obesity and OSA is still poorly understood. Early detection and
      intervention is of great importance as the health consequences related to OSA as well as
      obesity are severe. Adenotonsillectomy is recommended as first-line therapy in children with
      OSA. However, only around 25% of obese children benefit from this treatment compared to
      around 75% of normal-weight children suggesting that there might be other structural factors
      predisposing to OSA in obese children.

      In this study the investigators aim to clarify the impact of obesity in the development of
      OSA. The prevalence of OSA in obese children will be investigated. Furthermore the purpose is
      to assess the effect of weight loss on OSA.
