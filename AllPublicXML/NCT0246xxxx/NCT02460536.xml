  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention biases in threat processing have been assigned a prominent role in the etiology and
      maintenance of anxiety disorders. Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) utilizes
      computer-based protocols to implicitly modify biased attentional patterns in anxious
      patients. This is a double-blind randomized controlled trial of ABMT for clinically anxious
      10-18 year-olds. Participants will be assessed using clinical interviews and parent- and
      self-rated questionnaires before, in the middle and after twelve sessions of ABMT or control
      groups, and again at ten-week follow-up. Outcome measures will be anxiety symptoms and
      depression as measured by gold standard questionnaires as well as structured clinical
      interviews with youth and their parents. Attentional threat bias, Attentional control and
      interpretation of ambiguous information will also be measured to explore potential mediators
      of ABMT's effect on anxiety. The investigators expect the findings to inform pathways to
      treatments for anxious children and to provide initial information on mechanisms of ABMT
      efficacy.
