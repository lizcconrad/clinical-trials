  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and the ability of MK-1075 to
      suppress viral load (VL) in HCV-infected participants during 7 days of once daily dose
      administration. The primary hypothesis is at a once-daily dose that is sufficiently safe and
      well tolerated in HCV-infected participants, the mean maximum HCV RNA (log10 IU/mL) reduction
      is at least 3 log10 IU/mL as compared to baseline following multiple dose oral administration
      of MK-1075 in HCV genotype 1 (GT1) and genotype 3 (GT3) infected participants.
