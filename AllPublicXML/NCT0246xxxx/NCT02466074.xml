  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how improved cerebral blood flow affects the way in which newly
      formed MS lesions evolve and whether tissue repair is improved. Patients with multiple
      sclerosis (MS) will be treated with acetazolamide in daily divided doses and obtain MRI to
      determine how much and in which regions of the brain cerebral perfusion improves as well as
      the extent to which tissue integrity is improved in these areas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral perfusion is altered in many disease states, including MS. Altered perfusion has
      been seen in patients with all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes and is well established as
      occurring early in relapsing-remitting disease.

      Previous research in our laboratory has shown that reduced cerebral perfusion in MS patients
      is a precursor to the formation of chronic lesions. In addition, studies have suggested that
      &quot;virtual hypoxia&quot;, resultant from the combination of diminished cerebral perfusion and
      increased energy demand, contributes to tissue damage that strongly correlates with clinical
      disability in persons with MS. Our preliminary studies have already shown short-term
      increases in global and regional cerebral perfusion in MS patients after therapy with
      acetazolamide (ACZ).

      The central hypothesis is that if cerebral perfusion is important in tissue injury, then MS
      lesions within hypoperfused areas are more likely to develop permanent tissue damage, and
      medications that improve cerebral perfusion might beneficially alter the evolution of MS
      plaques, enhance remyelination and repair and diminish clinical disability progression.

      Forty MS patients will be enrolled in this single-center exploratory RCT. Half of the
      patients will be randomly assigned to get ACZ treatment in phase 1 consisting of 24 weeks on
      ACZ, followed by another 24 weeks on ACZ during phase 2. The other half of the patients will
      be assigned to placebo for 24 weeks in phase 1 and then switched to ACZ and followed for 24
      weeks in phase 2. This study will utilize various imaging techniques to determine the degree
      to which cerebral blood flow is improved in MS subjects after administration of ACZ.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis using revised McDonald criteria

          2. Stable on either subcutaneous glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), interferon beta-1b
             (Betaseron, Extavia), or interferon beta-1a (Rebif) or intramuscular interferon
             beta-1a (avonex). The term &quot;stable&quot; implies that the subject has not had change in
             therapy for any reason for the 12 months prior to study entry.

          3. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 0-6.0 inclusive

          4. Understood and signed written informed consent, obtained prior to the study subject
