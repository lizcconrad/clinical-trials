  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with previously-treated locally-advanced unresectable or
      metastatic mismatched repair (MMR) deficient or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)
      colorectal carcinoma (CRC) will be treated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®)
      monotherapy. There will be two cohorts in this study: Cohort A and Cohort B. For Cohort A,
      participants are required to have been previously treated with standard therapies, which must
      include fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Enrollment into Cohort A has been
      completed. For Cohort B, participants are required to have been previously treated with at
      least one line of systemic standard of care therapy: fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin or
      fluoropyrimidine + irinotecan +/ - anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/ epidermal
      growth factor regulator (EGFR) monoclonal antibody.
