      Cross-sectional cohort study to evaluating pain and vital signs variations (blood pressure
      and radial pulse) during the placement of the intrauterine device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intrauterine device (IUD), which is one of the most effective and safe contraceptives is
      still little used by women. It is considered a long action reversible contraception (LARC).
      Among the many reasons for this resistance stands the fear of pain, the complications that
      can occur during the insertion.

      Objective: To evaluate the intensity of pain on outpatient insertion of IUD. In addition to
      evaluating changes in vital signs and detect which are the factors associated with pain on
      outpatient insertion of IUD. Methods: Cross Sectional Retrospective study of 285 procedures
      of outpatient insertion of IUD.

      Inclusion criteria were age older than 18 years, cervical cytology without abnormalities,
      classification for Category 1 or 2 of the WHO eligibility criteria for IUD. The criteria for
      non inclusion were patients with cardiac arrhythmias and gynecological disorders. The
      insertions of IUD were conducted on an outpatient basis without the use of painkillers.

      Evaluation of vital signs ( blood pressure and radial pulse) was performed pre and five
      minutes after the procedure. The pain assessment was performed using the scale visual analog
      (VAS), five minutes after the procedure.Correlations of the pain's score with clinical
      factors as age, parity, BMI, hysterometry, previous vaginal delivery were also performed.

    <description>Women who came to the medical service, to insert an intra uterine Device (IUD) of Cu or a Levonorgestrel Intra Uterine System( Lng- IUS) after have been attended in the Family Planning Service of Federal University of São Paulo . All patient have had the pain evaluated by Application of the Visual Analog Scale of Pain (VAS), and also their vital signs ( Evaluation of blood pressure,Evaluation of radial pulse) evaluated pre and five minutes after the IUD/ IUS insertion.</description>
