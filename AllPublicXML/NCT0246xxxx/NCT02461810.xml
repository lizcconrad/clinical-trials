      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the SpineJack® with
      the Kyphx Xpander® Inflatable Bone Tamp and support a non-inferiority finding for the use of
      SpineJack® VCF treatment system versus Balloon Kyphoplasty.

    <description>The primary composite endpoint defines a successful subject if the following components are satisfied (safety and effectiveness):
Reduction in VCF fracture-related pain at 12 months from baseline as measured by a 100 mm VAS scale (reduction of pain at 12 months by &gt; 20 mm) AND,
Maintenance or improvement in function at 12 months from baseline as measured by the 100 point Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) AND,
Absence of device-related serious adverse events, defined as device-related adverse events (device migration, recollapse, protrusion) or symptomatic cement extravasation requiring surgical re-intervention or retreatment at the index level, including revision, removal, reoperation, and/or supplemental fixation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female with at least 50 years of age

          2. 1 painful VCF which at least meet all following criteria:

               -  Fracture due to diagnosed or presumed underlying osteoporosis

               -  VCF between T7 and L3

               -  Fracture age &lt;3 months

               -  VCF shows loss of height in the anterior, mid or posterior third of the VB from
                  estimated pre-fracture configuration of at least 15% but not more than 40% based
                  on X-Ray at baseline

               -  The Index fracture is acute or persistent (not healed), as demonstrated by T2
                  weighted STIR MRI (or bone scan if patient is contraindicated for MRI)

          3. Patient has failed conservative medical therapy, defined as either having a VAS back
             pain score of ≥50 mm at 6 weeks after initiation of fracture care or a VAS back pain
             score of ≥70mm at 2 weeks after initiation of fracture care

          4. Investigator believes target VB is suitable for SpineJack procedure and Balloon
             kyphoplasty (e.g., appropriate pedicle diameter) assessed on CT scan pre op

          5. Patient has an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of ≥ 30/100

          6. Patient is mentally capable and willing to sign a study specific informed consent as
             documentation of the informed consent process prior to any study procedures

          7. The patient is willing and able to comply with all study requirements including
             follow-up visits and radiographic assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Target VCF due to underlying or suspected tumor

          2. Target VCF due to high-energy trauma

          3. Target VCF is diagnosed as an osteonecrotic fracture

          4. Segmental kyphosis of target VB of &gt;30°

          5. Any prior surgical treatment for a vertebral body compression fracture or other
