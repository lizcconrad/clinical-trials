  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has compared quadrant scaling and root planing (Q-SRP) versus intensive treatment
      performed within 24 hours (FM-SRP) in terms of acute phase responses following treatment of
      periodontal disease. The primary aim was to compare the differences in CRP acute increase
      following FM-SRP versus Q-SRP therapy (24 hours after therapy). Secondary outcomes included
      changes in a broad array of inflammatory and endothelial injury markers between groups.
      Patients were randomly assigned to either FM-SRP and Q-SRP. Data indicated that non-surgical
      periodontal therapy performed within 24 hours induced greater perturbations of systemic
      inflammation compared to conventional treatment.

      Aim. A moderate acute-phase response occurs 24 hours following full-mouth non-surgical
      treatment (FM-SRP). Aim of this study will be to compare quadrant scaling (Q-SRP) versus
      FM-SRP in terms of systemic acute (24 hours) and medium-term (3 months) inflammation.

      Material &amp; Methods. 38 periodontitis-affected subjects will be randomly allocated to FM-SRP
      or Q-SRP after a baseline visit. Periodontal and anthropometric parameters, such as systolic
      and diastolic bood pressure, BMI and temperature, will be collected at baseline and 3 months.
      Serum samples will be drawn at baseline, 1, 7 and 90 days after treatment. High sensitivity
      assays for a broad array of inflammatory (PCR, IL-6, TNF-alpha) and endothelial assays will
      be performed.

Treatment was provided using both hand and ultrasonic instrumentation with fine tips. Local anaesthesia was used when needed and no time constraints were enforced. FM-SRP patients received treatment within 24 hrs in two separate sessions, one side of the mouth for each session: two quadrants were instrumented in an afternoon session, whereas the other two were instrumented the following morning</description>
