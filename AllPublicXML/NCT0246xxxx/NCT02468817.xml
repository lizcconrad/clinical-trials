  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise that causes a decline in serum Calcium (Ca) as a result of dermal Ca loss stimulates
      bone resorption via an increase in Parathyroid Hormone (PTH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Determine whether the magnitude of dermal Ca loss (i.e., sweating) during exercise is a
      determinant of the decline in iCa and increases in PTH and carboxy-terminal collagen
      crosslinks (CTX; marker of bone resorption). The proposed experiment will address this by
      manipulating the rate of dermal Ca loss (moderate vs high sweating rate) to determine whether
      this is the trigger for the cascade described in Figure 1. This will be achieved by having
      participants perform two identical exercise bouts under different thermal conditions (warm vs
      cool).

    <measure>Change in Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)</measure>

    <description>PTH will be measured during baseline, throughout exercise, and during recovery at regular intervals. We are looking to see how PTH changes over the course of the exercise and recovery period in both the warm and cool conditions. We anticipate that PTH will be higher in the warm condition versus the cool. We expect that men and women will respond similarly.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults aged 60-80 y

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of medications in the past 6 months known to affect bone metabolism (e.g.,
             bisphosphonates, thiazide diuretics, oral glucocorticoids)

          -  BMD t score &lt; -2.5 at the total hip or lumbar spine

          -  Known disease or condition associated with intestinal malabsorption

          -  Moderate or severe renal impairment defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate
             of &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2 based on the MDRD equation

          -  Chronic hepatobiliary disease, defined as liver function tests (AST, ALT) &gt;1.5 times
             the upper limit of normal; if such values are obtained on initial screening and

             vitamin D supplementation

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as resting systolic BP &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic BP&gt;90

             follow-up evaluation must include diagnostic testing (e.g., stress echocardiogram or
