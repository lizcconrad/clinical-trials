  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study, which allows analysis of multiple immune parameters derived
      from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with relapsing remitting
      multiple sclerosis before and during immune-modulatory treatment with dimethyl fumarate in
      comparison to PBMCs from healthy subjects.

      The purpose of the trial is to shed more light on the mechanisms of action of dimethyl
      fumarate in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. More specifically the
      influence of dimethyl fumarate on peripheral immune cells will be addressed to evaluate
      changes in cytokine production by the distinct T cell subsets and the differentiation
      capacity of naïve T cells. Furthermore, the impact of dimethyl fumarate treatment on the
      migratory capacity of T cells as well as the evaluation of changes in the suppressive
      capacity of regulatory T cells will be evaluated. To put the obtained results into context,
      response data of dimethyl fumarate-treated patients will be compared with data from healthy
      subjects.

At week 1, the dose is increased to 120 mg Tecfidera® p.o. twice daily, split into a morning and an evening dose. At week 2, the daily dose is further increased to 240 mg Tecfidera® p.o. in the morning and 120 mg Tecfidera® p.o. in the evening. Finally at week 3, the dose will be increased to the final daily dose of 240 mg Tecfidera® p.o. in the morning and 240 mg Tecfidera® p.o. in the evening and maintained throughout the study.</description>
