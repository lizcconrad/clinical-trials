  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is unclear whether peer coaching is effective in minority populations living with diabetes
      in hard-to-reach, under resourced areas such as the rural South. We examined the effect of an
      innovative peer coaching intervention plus brief education vs. brief education alone on
      diabetes outcomes.

      The purpose of this project was to provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of a peer
      support intervention in improving diabetes outcomes by conducting a group-randomized,
      controlled implementation trial of a volunteer peer support intervention.

      The study had three specific aims:

      Aim 1. In Phase I (months 0-8), to perform a qualitative needs assessment with peer advisors
      and health care providers to inform peer advisor roles and responsibilities (i.e., the
      intervention) and peer advisor recruitment strategies, curriculum and training; and patient
      recruitment plans.

      Aim 2. Also in Phase I, to pilot our collaboratively developed intervention and, based on
      pilot test results, to recruit and train peer advisors for the intervention, and begin
      patient recruitment.

      Aim 3. In Phase II (months 9-32), conduct the group randomized implementation trial and
      evaluate it using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM)
      framework.
