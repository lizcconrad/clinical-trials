    <textblock>
      Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral illness that leads to chronic joint pain in
      approximately one half of patients. The mechanisms leading to long term arthritis in humans
      has not been well established. There is some evidence from animal studies that activated
      macrophages with persistent viral infection may play a role in chronic arthritis however
      these mechanisms have not yet been identified in humans. It is hypothesized that activated
      macrophages harboring persistent active chikungunya virus are responsible for chronic
      arthritis and joint pain in patients. The focus of this proposal is to evaluate synovial
      fluid and blood for direct viral persistence and activated macrophages that may clarify the
      mechanism of inflammatory injury. The results of this study will be directly applicable to
      tailoring trials of therapeutics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chikungunya is rapidly spreading throughout the Americas and causes debilitating chronic
      arthritis in approximately one fourth of patients. There is currently no standard treatment
      for chikungunya arthritis, and the mechanisms leading to this chronic arthritis are unclear.
      Further characterization of the disease pathophysiology is needed in order to guide
      evaluation of potential therapeutics. It is hypothesized that chronic chikungunya arthritis
      is due to persistence of active virus in the synovial fluid where macrophages serve as a
      viral reservoir. The predominance of activated macrophages in persistently infected tissue
      and the presence of viral genome within these macrophages in non-human primates makes our
      hypothesis plausible. To test this hypothesis, this study has three Specific Aims. Aim 1,
      describe host characteristics affect susceptibility to severe or persistent arthritis. Aim 2,
      determine if chikungunya virus persists in synovial fluid and synovial fluid macrophages in
      humans as shown in non-human primates. Aim 3, investigate how these macrophages may be
      activated and modulated by cytokines. To date, these pathophysiologic factors have not been
      well characterized in humans. Information gained from this study can directly lead to
      recommendations for the further evaluation of antiviral versus immune modulating medications.

               -  Cohort 2 Acute chikungunya: Ten participants with acute chikungunya defined as
                  clinical symptoms of chikungunya with acute fever &gt;38Â°C and joint pain within 10
                  days the onset of symptoms without other more likely diagnosis or laboratory
                  confirmed chikungunya.

               -  Cohort 3 Healthy controls: Five healthy participants will participate that will
                  provide baseline measurements of the cytokine profile and mononuclear cell sample
                  recovery.

        All subjects will be adults â¥18 years old. Cohort 1 participants will only be enrolled in
        the study if they have a knee effusion at baseline presentation. Laboratory confirmation of
        chikungunya includes positive viral PCR or positive IgM antibody. All patients will be able
        to understand and give informed consent in Spanish.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded if they have a known bleeding disorders or if they are
             on warfarin, clopidogrel, and ticagrelor therapy they will be excluded for increased
             bleeding risk.

          -  The study will also exclude children, adults unable to give consent, prisoners, and
             pregnant women.
