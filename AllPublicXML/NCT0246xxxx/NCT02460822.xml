    <textblock>
      This research project addresses critical gaps in cancer symptom management through the
      creation of a mobile chemotherapy symptom management application. This application will
      assess for the presence and severity of common chemotherapy side-effects and provide
      personally tailored symptom-related video and narratives to enhance self-management of cancer
      and treatment-related symptoms. This study will examine patient acceptance and use of this
      mHealth application (called MyChemoCare) in a prospective trial of cancer patients (n=60) who
      are receiving chemotherapy for colorectal cancer at the University of Michigan Comprehensive
      Cancer Center.

    <measure>Patient Retention and Engagement With the MyChemoCare Application</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient retention is defined as the number of patients who completed the 8-week study through the final evaluation. Engagement with the MyChemoCare application was measured as number of patients who checked in at least once per week of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction and Usability of the MyChemoCare Application</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use a 9-item survey developed by Dr. An to assess patients' experiences using the MyChemoCare app.
This result is the mean of the the survey items (with opposite items reversed). The scale was scored from 0 = Strongly disagree to 6 = Strongly agree.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Use of the Study Feedback Mechanism</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess for how many of the enrolled patients the physicians use the feedback from the app to assist in clinical care of the patients. This includes following up about distressing symptoms and using information provided by the patient during regular clinical visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increased Mastery of Cancer and Chemotherapy Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Cancer Care Mastery Scale to assess patients' feelings of control over their cancer care. This scale is based on the Mastery Scale developed by Pearlin and Schooler, designed to capture the sense of control a patient feels over their cancer care. This is a 7-item scale where users are asked to respond to statements by choosing and answer from the following: Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither agree or disagree, Agree, Strongly agree. Mastery scores were computed by taking the numeric mean of the items (1-5), with negatively worded items reversed.
The number presented here is the number of patients whose mastery score improved between baseline and the end of the 8-week program. Because this is a small pilot study, we measure ANY improvement with no threshold specified.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Burden Reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) to describe patient experiences in 8 core symptom areas (pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, lack of appetite, weakness, and diarrhea). For each area, patients are asked to rank their symptoms on a scale from 0 (Not present) to 10 (As bad as you can imagine). The overall score is the mean across all 8 items.
The number reported here is the count of patients with a reduction in symptom burden between baseline and 8-week follow up. Because this is a small pilot study, we measure ANY reduction with no threshold specified.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improved Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the FACT-G survey to assess four dimensions of patients health (physical, functional, social and emotional). For each of the dimensions, patients are given a series of statements about specific elements of well being and asked to rank them on the following scale: Not at all, a little bit, Somewhat, Quite a bit, or Very much. These items are given numeric values of 0-4, with negatively worded statements reverse coded. Within each of the four dimensions of health, average scores are calculated, and then an overall sum is derived. Total well-being ranges from 0 (Complete lack of well being) to 16 (Completely well).
The number presented is the count of participants for whom the overall FACT-G score increased between baseline and 8-week followup. Because this is a small pilot study, we measure ANY increase with no threshold specified.</description>

While using the application, high symptom severity scores will be reported to the participant's medical team, who may intervene to help relieve the symptom. Participants will also be contacted if they have not checked in for 48 hours to make sure they are coping well with their chemotherapy regimen.</description>

Participants will also be contacted if they have not checked in for 48 hours to make sure they are coping well with their chemotherapy regimen.

        <title>Increased Mastery of Cancer and Chemotherapy Symptoms</title>
        <description>The investigators will use the Cancer Care Mastery Scale to assess patients' feelings of control over their cancer care. This scale is based on the Mastery Scale developed by Pearlin and Schooler, designed to capture the sense of control a patient feels over their cancer care. This is a 7-item scale where users are asked to respond to statements by choosing and answer from the following: Strongly disagree, Disagree, Neither agree or disagree, Agree, Strongly agree. Mastery scores were computed by taking the numeric mean of the items (1-5), with negatively worded items reversed.
The number presented here is the number of patients whose mastery score improved between baseline and the end of the 8-week program. Because this is a small pilot study, we measure ANY improvement with no threshold specified.</description>

        <title>Symptom Burden Reduction</title>
        <description>The investigators will use the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) to describe patient experiences in 8 core symptom areas (pain, fatigue, nausea, disturbed sleep, distress, lack of appetite, weakness, and diarrhea). For each area, patients are asked to rank their symptoms on a scale from 0 (Not present) to 10 (As bad as you can imagine). The overall score is the mean across all 8 items.
The number reported here is the count of patients with a reduction in symptom burden between baseline and 8-week follow up. Because this is a small pilot study, we measure ANY reduction with no threshold specified.</description>

        <title>Improved Quality of Life</title>
        <description>The investigators will use the FACT-G survey to assess four dimensions of patients health (physical, functional, social and emotional). For each of the dimensions, patients are given a series of statements about specific elements of well being and asked to rank them on the following scale: Not at all, a little bit, Somewhat, Quite a bit, or Very much. These items are given numeric values of 0-4, with negatively worded statements reverse coded. Within each of the four dimensions of health, average scores are calculated, and then an overall sum is derived. Total well-being ranges from 0 (Complete lack of well being) to 16 (Completely well).
The number presented is the count of participants for whom the overall FACT-G score increased between baseline and 8-week followup. Because this is a small pilot study, we measure ANY increase with no threshold specified.</description>
