  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial will examine the effects of intranasal insulin aspart on cognition,
      daily function, blood and cerebral spinal fluid markers of Alzheimer's disease, and amyloid
      deposition in the brain. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive insulin aspart or
      placebo during a 12-week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests that insulin plays a role in normal memory processes and
      that insulin abnormalities may contribute to cognitive and brain changes associated with
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly, insulin administered to the nasal cavity is
      transported within a few minutes into the brain, but does not affect blood sugar or insulin
      levels.

      This trial will consist of a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial
      in which 30 participants with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) receive twice daily
      intranasal administrations of insulin aspart (20 IU) or placebo (saline), two times per day
      for 12 weeks. All participants will appoint a &quot;support person&quot; to answer a collateral
      questionnaire and supervise the administration of the study drug. All participants and study
      partners will undergo the intensive, structured training program in the self-management of
      intranasal insulin administration. Cognitive testing and blood collection will occur at
      baseline, after 6 weeks of treatment, and at the end of the 12 week treatment period.
      Participants will also receive a lumbar puncture to measure AD biomarkers in the subject's
      cerebral spinal fluid.
