  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics，safety and tolerability of
      Hemay020 and to determine the recommended dose for future Phase II study as well as to obtain
      preliminary information on the efficacy of Hemay020 in subjects with solid tumors. The study
      will be conducted in two parts. Part one, testing will be done on up to 16-31 subjects to
      determine the safety and tolerability of Hemay 020 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      Part two, another 16-24 subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, will be added to the
      trial to better define the tolerability and preliminary efficacy of Hemay020.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phaseⅠsequential-group study of ascending single and multiple oral doses
      administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors. Each subject will receive a single dose
      of Hemay020, followed by a 2-week observation period, and then will receive Hemay020
      administered once daily by mouth for 28 days. Each cycle consist of 28 days. Subjects will be
      enrolled in groups of 3 to 6. Depending on the safety and activity profile observed during
      the dose escalation phase, the dose selected for Part 2 may be adjusted. Part 2 is an
      extension part of two dose groups administered to subjects with NSCLC.
