      Patients with PFPS demonstrate quadriceps and hip musculature weakness, altered lower
      extremity (LE) kinematics, and decreased LE flexibility. Psychosocial factors have also been
      identified as an important factor in patients with PFPS. The authors hypothesize that an
      ordered approach addressing each of these impairments sequentially will result in greater
      improvement in PFPS symptoms. The results of the investigators pilot study assessing the
      feasibility of using a sequential approach showed a full randomized controlled trial is
      warranted, the authors now plan to proceed with a full trial. The objective of this study is
      to assess the efficacy of a sequential approach in the treatment of Patellofemoral Pain
      Syndrome.

      Methods: Patients will be randomized to a sequential treatment approach using a PFPS
      treatment algorithm (PFPS Algorithm) designed by the authors or typical physical therapy
      care. Due to the constant evaluation necessary no blinding will be performed. Patients will
      attend therapy two times per week for six weeks. Pain, Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS), and
      Global Rating of Change (GROC) will be measured at evaluation and discharge, 3 month
      follow-up and 6 month follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) accounts for 25 to 40% of knee pain in young and active
      individuals. PFPS is described as anterior knee pain around the patella which is aggravated
      by activity, particularly activities that increase patellofemoral forces such as squatting,
      ascending or descending stairs, running, and jumping. It is common in adolescents and
      physically active adults. Females are more likely to experience PFPS than males. PFPS is a
      multi-factorial condition with no clear etiology and is considered a syndrome and not a
      diagnosis. Dye has described PFPS as one of the most difficult orthopedic conditions to
      manage.

      Multiple theories exist regarding a cause for PFPS pain. A primary theory for the cause of
      PFPS is abnormal patellar tracking which results in excessive patellofemoral joint
      compressive forces. Many factors contributing to abnormal patellar tracking have been
      suggested including; hip and quadriceps weakness, delayed or diminished activation of vastus
      medialis obliquus, increased Q-angle, altered lower extremity mechanics and decreased lower
      extremity flexibility. Due to the number of suggested contributory factors to PFPS pain, a
      vast amount of interventions exist and are frequently used by clinicians. Although, physical
      therapy interventions have been shown to be effective over sham interventions, many
      individuals will have recurrent or chronic pain. Ninety-six percent of patients report having
      problems four years following their diagnosis of PFPS. A possible reason for the continued
      pain is that PFPS is a multi-factorial condition and the treatments may not address all of
      the contributing factors in each individual.

      If all of the contributing factors for the patient's PFPS are identified, addressing all of
      these factors at once may not be the best approach. Performing hip strengthening prior to
      quadriceps strengthening results in decreased levels of pain with exercise. Individuals with
      reduced flexibility are more likely to have impaired lower extremity mechanics. Performing
      traditional lower extremity strengthening exercises when there is impaired lower extremity
      mechanics results in increased patellofemoral joint contact forces.

      In an attempt to better treat individuals with PFPS, classification systems to subgroup
      patients with PFPS have been proposed, but their effectiveness has not been evaluated. An
      important clinical question with classification systems is what to do when a patient does not
      nicely fit into one subgroup. If a patient does not meet or meets the criteria for multiple
      subgroups, how is the patient treated? No evidence exists on the relative frequency with
      which patients with PFPS fall into each of these proposed subgroups and whether these
      subgroups are mutually exclusive.

      The clinical classification systems reported in literature only address physical impairments.
      Psychosocial factors have also been identified as important when treating patients with PFPS.
      In a study by Piva et al. fear avoidance beliefs were the strongest predictor of outcomes for
      function and pain. Mental health status on the Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 is correlated
      with severity of patellofemoral symptoms in athletes. The results of these studies highlight
      the necessity of addressing psychosocial factors when treating PFPS.

      Therefore, the authors have designed a new classification system (PFPS algorithm) for
      subgrouping patients based on the patient's clinical presentation. There are four subgroups
      in the new PFPS algorithm: Fear-Avoidance, Flexibility, Functional Malalignment, and
      Strengthening with function progression. The criteria and intervention of each subgroup is
      addressed sequentially over the episode of care. This classification system aims to address
      problems encountered if individuals meet the criteria for multiple subgroups. There is also a
      psychosocial component to address the needs of individuals with activity avoidance. The PFPS
      algorithm is goal-based, where meeting the criteria to pass through each subgroup is the
      focus of the treatment. Clinicians can provide whichever physical therapy intervention that
      allows an individual patient to meet the criteria of each subgroup. Interventions used in the
      PFPS algorithm are based on best available evidence, clinician's experience, and the
      patient's individual response to the intervention.

      A pilot study assessing the feasibility of a full study assessing this algorithm and it
      effectiveness was performed previously by the study investigators (IRB13-00749). The primary
      aims of this pilot study were met. The therapists and clinic personnel successfully worked
      together to carry out all treatments required to conduct a future full scale randomized
      controlled trial. The ordered treatment approach used in the PFPS algorithm, addressing soft
      tissue tightness, altered lower extremity kinematics, neuromuscular deficits and psychosocial
      factors in a sequential manor, resulting in clinically significant improvements in Anterior
      Knee Pain Scale and Global Rating of Change scores. With minor changes to the protocol and
      outcome measures used, a full randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of the
      PFPS algorithm was deemed feasible.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of using a sequential treatment
      approach to treat patellofemoral pain syndrome.

      Patient will be randomized into one of two treatment groups; either the PFPS algorithm or the
      control group which is an impairment based approach.

      Impairment Based Approach:

      The control group will be an impairment based approach with treatment focusing on impairments
      found during evaluation in the lower quarter. The evaluation of the lower quarter will assess
      motion, flexibility, strength and body mechanics. The joints of the lower quarter include the
      lumbar spine, hip, knee, ankle and foot. Specific attention will be paid to quadriceps and
      hip strength, hip and knee flexibility, and squatting, jumping, walking and running
      mechanics. Treatment will consist of 2 visits per week for 6 weeks. Treatments will last for
      45-60 minutes. Exercises will be given for the patient to perform at home at the therapist
      discretion. Interventions will be individualized to the patient and will be at the
      therapist's discretion. Therapists can use treatments including but not limited to: exercise,
      manual therapy, taping and bracing, orthotics, modalities, and education. Home exercises will
      be given the therapist discretion consistent with standard care.

      PFPS treatment algorithm:

      The PFPS treatment algorithm is a objective goal driven treatment program. Treatment is at
      the therapist discretion with the objective to meet the requirements for each subgroup.
      Evidence from literature guides treatment to best meet these goals.

      The first group within the classification system is Fear Avoidance, as research has shown
      that a change in fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity is one of the best predictors
      for improved functional outcome.

      The second group is Flexibility. This is the second group in the system because research
      shows that patients with decreased flexibility are unable to properly perform functional
      malalignment test. Also quadriceps length and gastrocnemius/soleus lengths are strongly
      associated with PFPS.

      The third group is Functional Malalignment. This group assesses the patient's form with
      functional tasks. If the patient demonstrates impaired mechanics, time is spent with
      strengthening and motor control so that the patient will be able to strengthen and return to
      full function with proper technique.

      The final group is Strengthening/Return to Function. This group will work strengthening of
      the lower quarter muscles with particular attention to the quadriceps, hip abductor and
      external rotators. This is also the time to progress the patient back to sport or functional
      activity.

    <description>Assessment of change of the Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS). The AKPS is a self-reported 13 item questionnaire with discrete categories related to various levels of current knee function. Categories within each item are weighted, and responses are summed to provide an overall score of 0-100, with 100 representing no disability. The Anterior Knee Pain Scale is found to be valid and reliable in patients from 12-50 years of age presenting with anterior knee pain with a test-retest reliability of .95 (Watson, 2005). A change of 10 points represent the minimal clinical difference (Crossley, 2004).</description>

    <description>The Numeric Pain rating scale asks the patient their highest pain in the last 24 hours. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale is a 0-10 scale subjectively assessing a patients perceived level of pain. With 0 on the scale = to no pain, and 10 = to the worst pain imaginable. The use of the Numerical Pain Rating Scale for assessing pain has been validated for use in PFPS patients and has been found to have a minimal detectable change of 1 points (Piva, 2009). The highest pain value is being used because of a floor effect was noted using average pain during the pilot study.</description>

    <description>The Global Rating of Change scale is a 15-point Likert type scale (-7 to +7). A score of 0 represents no change from initial injury, +7 represents a great deal better, and -7 represents a great deal worse. A score of +/- 3 represents a minimal clinical difference (Wang, 2011).</description>

    <description>The Patellofemoral Syndrome algorithm is designed to determine what deficits a patient may have and addressing these sequentially. This subgrouping first assesses a patient fear avoidance beliefs, flexibility, body mechanics, and then strength and functional ability. The reason for sequential treatment is that there is evidence that without adequate flexibility a patient will be unable to perform exercises with proper body mechanics, and without proper mechanics strengthening and functional activity can cause increased stress on the patellofemoral joint. Progression through each specific subgroup is based on objective goals. Once the patient has met these goals they are progressed to the next treatment subgroup until discharge.</description>
