        1. Cirrhosis: based on previous liver biopsy if available or based on clinical, imaging.

          2. Severe acute hepatitis [14]: fulfilling any 2 of the 3 criteria:

               -  Hepatic encephalopathy,

               -  Serum bilirubin equal to or more than 10 mg/dl

               -  International normalized ratio (INR) more than or equal to 1.6

          3. Acute on chronic liver failure [3]: Acute hepatic insult manifesting as jaundice
             (serum bilirubin ≥ 5mg/dL) and coagulopathy (INR ≥ 1.5), complicated within 4 weeks by
             ascites and/or encephalopathy in patients with previously diagnosed or undiagnosed
             chronic liver disease/cirrhosis, and is associated with a high 28-day mortality.

          4. Acute deterioration of decompensated cirrhosis [4]: Acute decompensation of cirrhosis
             in the form of one or more major complications of liver disease, including ascites,
             hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding.
