        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18.

          2. Subject scheduled to undergo a ureteral stent placement for ureteral obstruction or
             post- ureteroscopy procedure.

          3. Otherwise healthy subjects who are able and willing to participate in the study.

          4. None of the planned interventions are documented in the labeled contraindications,

             persistent urinary symptoms and AUASS more than 7.

             (ii) Taken an oral alpha agonist, anticholinergic or cholinergic medication within 5
             days of the first screening visit with the following exception(s): a singular dose
             given in ER or on the hospital floor prior to procedure, topical anticholinergic eye
             drops used for glaucoma or inhaled anti-cholinergic used for COPD.

          7. Subject has significant stress incontinence or mixed stress/urgency incontinence where
             stress is the predominant factor as determined by the investigator (for female

             previous or current malignant disease of the pelvic organs, or bladder stones (which
             can be located in different anatomical location and can cause LUTS similar to bladder
             infection and pain related to their location in the bladder which could mask the
             treatment effect).

         11. Subject who is currently under active treatment with botulinum toxin (and all other
             bladder paralytics) intravesically.

         18. Subject has been treated with an experimental device within 30 days or received an
