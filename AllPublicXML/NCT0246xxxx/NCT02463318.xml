      The purpose of this study is to investigate the gene expression and activity of SIRT1, and
      forkhead box O3 pathway by means of investigating target genes MnSOD and catalase in multiple
      sclerosis and healthy subjects. Also, we investigate the effect of melatonin on interaction
      between SIRT1 activity and target genes MnSOD and catalase in multiple sclerosis and healthy
      subject .Additionally, we evaluate effect the probable effect of melatonin treatment on gene
      expression and activity of above-mentioned genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of
      healthy subjects-treated with H2O2.

        Status Scale (EDSS) score â‰¤ 6 and had never received immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive
        drugs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) treated with antioxidant supplements,
             anti-inflammatory drugs, and vitamins in the previous 6 months; 2) had a history of
             acute or chronic infection, malignancy, diabetes (type I and II), and any clinically
             significant systemic disease; 3) was currently pregnant or lactating; 4) was currently
