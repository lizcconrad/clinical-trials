      This is an observational study of isolated thoracic perfusion with subsequent hemofiltration
      to lower the concentration of the cytotoxic drugs as a locoregional therapeutic strategy in
      malignant pleural mesothelioma.

    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with progressive malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) after multimodal
      therapy is a therapeutic challenge. Survival of the patients is low and the treatment options
      are sparse. This is an observational study of isolated thoracic perfusion with subsequent
      hemofiltration as a locoregional therapeutic strategy in this situation.

      23 pts. with epithelioid MPM were included in this phase II study after informed consent. All
      patients had progressive disease after multiple therapies and were recommended BSC of a MDT.
      Following insertion of a venous and arterial 21 ch. stop flow catheter via a femoral access,
      the inferior vena cava was blocked beneath the right atrium, the arterial catheter was
      blocked in the aorta at the diaphragm. The upper arms were blocked by pneumatic cuffs.
      Chemotherapy was given via the arterial catheter. Chemotherapy consisted of 60mg/m2
      cisplatinum and 15mg/m2 mitoxantrone q for 3 weeks until progress. After administration of
      chemotherapy, thoracic perfusion with blocked stop-flow catheters was maintained for 15
      minutes. After de-blocking of the catheters, hemofiltration was performed for 45 min. with 5l
      filtrate. The endpoint of the study was overall survival.Secondary endpoint was toxicity.
