    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects after 6 months of supervised weekly
      Tai-Chi-Chi versus Health Education and Wellness classes on reduction of depressive symptoms
      and improvement in resilience, health functioning, quality of life, cognition, sleep, fMRI
      neural correlates of working memory, and brain structure.

      The proposed randomized trial aims to investigate neural mechanisms of brain connectivity
      when comparing response to TCC to health and wellness education classes using fMRI biomarkers
      of emotional regulation and cognition. Control group will include health wellness education
      programs (HEW) that will help to control for the non-specific social support factors. Primary
      outcomes include measures of depressive symptom severity. Secondary outcomes include
      cognition, resilience, health functioning, quality of life. Maintenance of response and
      relapse of major depression will be determined during 6 month follow-up. Functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) correlates of emotional processing and connectivity in related
      functional networks. Neural correlates of working memory, and brain structure will be
      examined in Â½ of the sample. The researchers will investigate whether variations in emotional
      regulation will moderate or predict emotional and functional improvement linked to TCC.

      The investigators will recruit 220 older adults with depressive symptoms who have been stable
      on antidepressant treatment for at least 4 months, who will be randomly assigned to 12 weeks
      of: 1.Ta-Chi-Chih (TCC) class; or 2. Health/Wellness Education Program (HEW); all for 120
      minutes per week. All subjects will receive comprehensive evaluations of mood, mental and
      physical health, and cognition at baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 months. Changes over time in
      measures of depressive symptoms, resilience, quality of life, and cognition will be assessed
      in random regression models. The investigators anticipate that greater clinical improvement
      in mood and cognition will in the TCC group compared to the HEW. The investigators also
      expect clinical improvement to correlate with the change in the activation in the right
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and amygdala in an affect labeling task, and working
      memory-related activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and change in functional
      connectivity in brain network activity. This is the first randomized trial of response to TCC
      that integrates the use of fMRI biomarkers of response to guide the development of treatment
      and preventive approaches in geriatric depression.
