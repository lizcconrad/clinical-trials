    <textblock>
      Unhealthy alcohol use is present in up to 38% of the 4 million patients admitted to an
      American intensive care unit (ICU) each year in the US. Despite the high prevalence of
      unhealthy alcohol use in ICU survivors, routine interventions targeted at reducing alcohol
      consumption, alcohol-related consequences, and illness related to alcohol are not currently
      part of the multidisciplinary approach to critical care. Although screening, brief
      intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) has been described in several healthcare
      settings, it fails to address common characteristics of medical ICU survivors including high
      rates of alcohol use disorders, cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric comorbidities, and
      intimate involvement of friends and family. This study uses a qualitative approach to further
      understand the needs of medical ICU survivors with unhealthy alcohol use. The investigators
      hypothesize that there are common, modifiable barriers to improving alcohol-related outcomes
