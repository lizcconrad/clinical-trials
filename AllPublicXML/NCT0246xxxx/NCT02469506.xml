  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Situations such as fractures of the lower extremity can necessitate a prolonged
      period of immobilization in otherwise healthy individuals. Long-term immobilization of the
      lower extremity has shown to cause significant reductions in skeletal muscle mass, already
      occurring during the early stages of disuse. Accordingly, feasible strategies for attenuating
      this loss of muscle during disuse need to be pursued. Local neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation (NMES) offers such a potential strategy but, as yet, remains untested during
      prolonged muscle disuse in a clinical setting.

      Objective: To investigate whether twice daily local (gastrocnemius/soleus) NMES attenuates
      muscle loss during 2 weeks of unilateral ankle immobilization.

      Study design: Randomized, parallel (two groups) study design.

      Study population: 30 adults (18-65 y) with any form of closed ankle fractures needing
      surgical treatment.

      Intervention: Twice daily neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) or no intervention.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary: Calf muscle (gastrocnemius) cross sectional area
      (CSA) as determined by CT scan. Secondary: type I and II muscle fiber CSA and SC content,
      intramuscular triglyceride content and mRNA and protein expression of anabolic signaling
      proteins.
