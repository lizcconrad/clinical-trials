    <textblock>
      The purpose of CLCT-006, a multi-center open-label study, is to evaluate the safety of CL-108
      (hydrocodone 7.5 mg/APAP 325 mg, promethazine 12.5 mg) for the treatment of moderate to
      severe acute pain (&quot;flare&quot;) associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip under actual
      conditions of use.

      The purpose of CLCT-006, a multi-center open-label study, is to evaluate the safety of CL-108
      (hydrocodone 7.5 mg/APAP 325 mg, promethazine 12.5 mg) for the treatment of moderate to
      severe acute pain (&quot;flare&quot;) associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip under actual
      conditions of use.

      The study will also endeavor to determine

        -  the physicians' global evaluation of CL-108 as a treatment for moderate to severe acute
           pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip

        -  the patients' global impression of change in pain after treatment of moderate to severe
           acute pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip

        -  any change in the patient's quality of life after treatment of moderate to severe acute
           pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip

        -  the percentage change in pain intensity after treatment of moderate to severe acute pain
           associated with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip

             eligible to participate in this study if she has a negative urine pregnancy test and
             is post-menopausal or using an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., hormonal,
             transdermal, or implanted contraceptives, intra-uterine device, diaphragm, condom,
             abstinence, or surgical sterilization)

          -  At least 18 years of age

        Diagnosis of OA

          -  Clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee (signal joints) based on
             history and physical findings

        Confirmation of OA

          -  Radiographic evidence of OA of the knee or hip (e.g., joint space narrowing, K-L
             grades 1-4). [Any X-ray finding or report of an X-ray finding at any time that is
             indicative of OA of the knee or hip confirms the diagnosis of OA.]

        Treatment of OA

          -  Inadequate or unsatisfactory treatment with an NSAID for OA of the knee or hip with no
             previous use of an opioid for OA (i.e., need for &quot;step up&quot; to opioid treatment).

        Flare of OA

          -  Complaint of acute pain in the knee or hip (i.e., &quot;flare&quot; of osteoarthritis of the
             knee or hip)

          -  Pain in the signal joint(s) with onset ≤ 14 days

        Pain Severity

          -  Baseline PIS score must be ≥ moderate

             glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, or any drug contraindicated with hydrocodone,
             acetaminophen, or promethazine. Use within 4 months of Visit 2 of any intra-articular
             or oral corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid.
