  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this EffTox dose escalation study, up to 3 dose levels will be tested. The optimal dose
      (OD) of rSIFN-co will be determined using the EffTox design. Additional subject cohorts will
      not be enrolled until all subjects at the current dose level complete 28 days without DLT.
      The optimal dose (OD) will be determined by evaluation of safety in each cohort and disease
      response by RECIST 1.1 at 8 weeks. Once the OD is determined, enrollment will continue until
      at least 9 subjects total are accrued at the OD. Pharmacokinetics of rSIFN-co will be
      conducted for all tested dose levels to characterize dose proportionality.

      The initial cohort will be 3 subjects. Escalation to the next dose will continue unless a
      subject experiences a DLT, at which time a cohort will be expanded to up to 6 subjects.
      Provided there is only one DLT in that cohort, the dose will be escalated. However, if there
      are 2 DLTs in that cohort of up to 6 subjects, previous dose level will be expanded to total
      of 9 subjects.

      If none of the dose levels are acceptable at study completion (i.e., &gt;33% of subjects
      experiencing a DLT), an OD will not be identified, and the drug does not warrant further
      investigation.

         18. Has any mental or medical condition that prevents the subject from giving informed
             consent or participating in the trial
