  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a dynamic embryo microenvironment impacts embryo
      development and reproductive potential in comparison to static culture.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research design is a prospective randomized control trial. Patients with normal
      ovarian reserve, who would be expected to have reasonable outcomes after in vitro
      fertilization, will serve as the subjects. Embryos from the same patient will be randomized
      to either static or dynamic culture. They will then be cultured to the blastocyst stage of
      embryo development and biopsied for preimplantation genetic screening. The best chromosomally
      normal embryo from each culture group will be selected and transferred to complete a double
      embryo transfer in a subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycle the following month.

    <description>Embryos randomized to the dynamic arm will be placed on the NSSB-300 microvibration platform within the designated incubator. The platform will vibrate at a strength setting of 4 for 5 seconds every 60 minutes. The embryos will be placed on the platform at the two pronucleur stage of development and remain on the platform until the blastocyst stage of development at which time the embryos will be biopsied for preimplantation genetic screening and frozen.</description>

    <description>The embryos randomized to the static or control arm of the study will be placed directly into the incubator and will not have any additional vibration, per routine care. The embryos will be placed in the incubator at the two pronucleur stage of development and remain in the incubator until the blastocyst stage of development at which time the embryos will be biopsied for preimplantation genetic screening and frozen.</description>
