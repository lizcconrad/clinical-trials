    <measure>The reduction of glabellar lines</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The reduction of glabellar lines will be assessed by a panel of 3 independent reviewers with expertise in dermatology and/or plastic surgery of the change in glabellar lines measured from baseline to 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post procedure. Photographs will be presented in a random order and the reviewers will be blinded to whether the photograph is baseline or a follow up. Effectiveness of the procedure is defined by a ≥ 1 point improvement in score (i.e., numerical decrease) on the Mertz Aesthetics Scale™ (Merz Scale) for dynamic glabellar lines. At each time point the severity of the glabellar lines is assessed on a 5 point scale.</description>
