      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of BAC patients with
      Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia.The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate
      the safety of BAC patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled and parallel trial
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BAC in patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular
      dementia. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive either one of topical
      application of BAC or BAC matched vehicle, topical application on external nasal skin, scalp,
      and neck, 30mL/day, 2 times daily.

      The treatment duration for each patient is 12 weeks, which consists of 6 visits located at
      Screening, Baseline (Week 0), Weeks -2, -4, -8, and -12. During the treatment period,
      patients may continue to receive routinely used medications or treatments for Alzheimer's
      disease or vascular dementia except those prohibited under this protocol.
