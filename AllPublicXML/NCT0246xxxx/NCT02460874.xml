    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

      Pilot Portion: To determine the feasibility and safety of administering oral glyburide to
      non-diabetic patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for newly diagnosed brain
      metastases.

      Randomized Portion: To determine the number of patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases
      who have an increase in edema as measured on volumetric FLAIR imaging and the number of
      patients that require dexamethasone administration (or any corticosteroid administration with
      the purpose of treating cerebral edema) from the day of SRS to one month follow-up MRI in the
      group receiving glyburide versus placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with cancer that has spread to the brain have side effects caused by swelling
      around the tumors. A common treatment for this swelling is a medicine called dexamethasone.
      Dexamethasone is a steroid. Long-term use of steroids has several known side effects.

      Recent studies have shown that a drug commonly used in to control high blood sugar in
      diabetes, called glyburide, can decrease brain swelling in patients with brain damage or
      stroke. Animal studies have shown that this drug may also reduce swelling from tumors in the
      brain. Researchers are interested in whether glyburide could treat brain swelling as well as
      dexamethasone with fewer side effects.

      This study is being done to see whether glyburide is safe to be used in patients without
      diabetes in combination with receiving SRS for brain metastases. This study will also find
      out if glyburide will decrease brain swelling in patients that get radiosurgery (SRS) for
      brain metastases. This study will also find out if taking glyburide will decrease the chance
      of needing steroids due to brain swelling that is causing symptoms. It is not yet known, but
      it is the investigators' hope that glyburide will both decrease brain swelling and lessen the
      chance of needing steroids.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with 1-10 newly diagnosed brain metastases deemed to be eligible for
             radiosurgery.

          -  Subject must have cytologically or histologically confirmed malignancy (this is the
             original malignancy, not the brain metastases).The largest measurable brain metastasis
             must be at least 1.0cm in short axis dimension.

          -  A diagnostic contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain must be performed within 60 days prior
             to registration. The contrast-enhancing intraparenchymal brain tumor must be well
             circumscribed and must have a maximum diameter of ≤ 4.0 cm in any direction on the
             enhanced scan. If multiple lesions are present and one lesion is at the maximum
             diameter, the other(s) must not exceed 3.0 cm in maximum diameter.

          -  History and physical with neurological examination, height, and weight within 14 days
             prior to registration

          -  No dexamethasone use (or any other corticosteroid use with the purpose of treating
             cerebral edema) starting 5 days prior to the treatment planning MRI. Patients may be
             tapered to meet this criterion if deemed safe by the treating physician.

             radiotherapy.

          -  CBC with differential and CMP including Liver Function Tests (LFTs) obtained within 14

                  at most 60 days prior to registration. Patients are allowed to have Whole Brain
                  Radiotherapy (WBRT) or corticosteroid use between the time of pretreatment MRI
                  and SRS (as long as the corticosteroids can be safely tapered at least 5 days
                  prior to the treatment planning MRI and WBRT is at least 4 days prior to

             and/or those with renal, hepatic or adrenal insufficiency).

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women due potential damage to the fetus

          -  Patients treated on any other therapeutic clinical protocols within 10 days prior to
             registration or during participation in the study.

          -  Inability to undergo MRI or SRS (e.g. due to safety reasons such as presence of a
             pacemaker).

          -  Deemed by the treating physician to be unable to eat regular meals.

          -  Patients currently on beta blockers.
