    <textblock>
      This pilot study is crucial to determining whether treating individuals who are at high risk
      for transmission or re-infection will impact HCV reinfection rates. It will establish the
      feasibility of DAA treatment in corrections facilities, as well as delineate the underlying
      immune basis of HCV cure and reinfection.
