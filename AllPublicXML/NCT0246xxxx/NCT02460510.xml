  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ALF (Acute liver Failure) would undergo a detailed clinical evaluation.
      Information would be collected regarding the onset and duration of symptoms, etiology, and
      severity of disease, other baseline clinical features, demographic characteristics, routine
      biochemical and hematological investigations. Patients would also be screened for the
      assessment of raised intracranial hypertension by either clinical or neuroimaging or by ONSD
      (optic nerve sheath diameter) and TCD (Transcranial doppler ultrasonography). Patient found
      to be having risen ICP (Intra Cranial Pressure) would be randomized in the two groups of the
      study. The group A would receive intravenous mannitol 20 to 30 minutes every 4 hourly where
      as those in the group B would be given 3% hypertonic saline as continuous infusion at a rate
      of 25ml /hr and titrated q4 hrs per sliding scale to achieve a target serum sodium level of
      144-155 mmol/L .Both the groups would receive other supportive measures such as head end
      elevation, oxygen supplementation, dextrose infusion to maintain normoglycemia standard
      medical treatment.
