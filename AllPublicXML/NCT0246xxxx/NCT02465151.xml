  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to identify how much protein is required at breakfast
      to promote positive whole body protein balance over the following 9h period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to establish the role of eating protein at breakfast on whole
      body protein balance in healthy children.
