  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to assess the potential of information structuring for
      improving discharge communication. Specifically, the investigators aim to examine the
      advantages of an information-structuring skills training for physicians (compared to an
      empathy skills training) on discharge communication and associated patient outcomes, such as
      patients' information recall and adherence to physician recommendations. The investigators
      hypothesize that patients receiving structured discharge information from their trained
      physicians will be able to recall more information and show higher adherence to
      recommendations relative to controls (i.e., patients receiving discharge information from
      doctors trained in empathy skills).
