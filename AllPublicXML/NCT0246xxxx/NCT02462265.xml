      The study will be a prospective open-label single-center study in previously treated patients
      with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL). Treatment efficacy and
      safety of the combination of Oshadi D (DNase in Oshadi carrier) and Oshadi R (RNase in Oshadi
      carrier) with Salvage Chemotherapy will be evaluated. Oshadi D and Oshadi R were shown to
      have anti-tumor activity and good safety profile.

      Patients will receive Oshadi D and Oshadi R oral treatment combined with salvage
      chemotherapy. Patient will be evaluated throughout the study for safety and tolerance to
      multiple dose regimens of Oshadi D and Oshadi R.

      Efficacy will be determined by percentage of bone marrow blasts assessment at day 28 post
      therapy initiation.
