  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A keystone in preventing diabetic complications in patients with type 1 diabetes is good
      glycaemic control. Frequent self-measurements of blood glucose (SMBG) levels have been an
      essential part of insulin dosing before meals. However, in recent years continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) has become a treatment option to inform the patient when glucose levels may
      be too high or low.

      In some countries, including Sweden, CGM is reimbursed only when combined with continuous
      subcutaneous insulin infusions (CSII) in patients with very poor glycaemic control or a
      history of repeated severe hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. This is based on
      existing clinical trial data showing a beneficial effect on HbA1c when CGM is combined with
      CSII. However, despite the fact that the majority of adults with type 1 diabetes are treated
      with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI), studies on the effect of CGM in patients with
      type 1 diabetes treated with MDI are sparse. Therefore, the investigators initiated the
      CGMMDI trial, an ongoing, cross-over clinical trial including 161 MDI patients receiving CGM
      over 6 months, followed by conventional therapy over six months, with a four-month wash-out
      period in-between treatment. Evaluations include glycaemic control, hypoglycaemia, quality of
      life, fear of hypoglycaemia, treatment satisfaction, physical activity, and safety.

      From a research or regulatory standpoint, long-term data on treatment effects are expected to
      a greater extent today than in previous years, due to various reasons, e.g., to evaluate any
      sustained beneficial effects over time, or long-term patient safety. Accordingly, follow-up
      of treatment in an extension phase after randomized diabetes trials have become more common
      over time, especially where many novel glucose-lowering treatments are concerned. Therefore,
      the aim of the current study is to evaluate long-term effects of CGM in patients with type 1
      diabetes treated with MDI. Patients who consent in an extension phase over 1 year of the
      CGMMDI trial will receive CGM, and evaluations will be performed on sustained glycaemic
      control effects, hypoglycaemia, glycaemic variability, quality of life, fear of
      hypoglycaemia, treatment satisfaction, physical activity, and safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Completion of the CGMMDI trial.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, planned pregnancy for the study duration or pregnancy during the last six
             months

          -  Severe cognitive dysfunction or other disease, which is adjudicated by a physician as
             not suitable for inclusion.

          -  Required continuous use of paracetamol. Paracetamol must not have been used the week
             before the study and shall not be used during CGM-use because it disturbs the
             interpretation of blood glucose levels estimated by the Dexcom. However, other pain
             killers can be used throughout the study duration.

          -  History of allergic reaction to any of the CGM materials or adhesives in contact with
             the skin, or to chlorhexidine or alcoholic anti-septic solution.

          -  Abnormal skin at the anticipated glucose sensor attachment sites (excessive hair,
             burn, inflammation, infection, rash, and/or tattoo).

          -  Other investigator-determined criteria making patients unsuitable for participation.
