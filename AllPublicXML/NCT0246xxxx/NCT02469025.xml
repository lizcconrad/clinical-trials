  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb osteoarthritis is a major health problem in the westernized countries. The current
      gold standard treatment is joint replacement. However clinical guidelines recommend physical
      therapy as first option for these patients. Manual therapy has reported good reports in
      function, range of motion and pain in patients with hip osteoarthritis. The main aim of this
      study is to test the effects of a manual therapy protocol based on manual traction
      mobilization of the hip joint in an end range position and compare them with the effects
      achieve with the same protocol based on manual traction mobilization of the hip joint in a
      resting position. The investigators will use the caudal traction mobilization described by
      Kaltenborn. The study will test the effects of both treatments in passive range of motion,
      function and pain after three weeks of treatment, three weeks after finalizing the treatment
      and six weeks after.
