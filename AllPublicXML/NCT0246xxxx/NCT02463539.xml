    <textblock>
      Descriptive study of the residual anti-pneumococcal immunity in patients with Anti-neutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) who have previously gone through
      pneumococcal immunization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine, through serotype-specific enzyme linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and opsonophagocytosis (OPA) titres whether AAV patients who have
      gone through pneumococcal vaccination are protected against invasive pneumococcal diseases
      (IPD).

a/ For each of the following serotypes (3, 4, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F), opsonophagocytosis (OPA) titers will be measured in ELISA-protected patients at V0. Opsonophagocytic antibody activity is considered positive if the antibody titer is above a serotype-specific predefined threshold.

    <description>For patients already included in the PHENOVASC study (V-1) ≤6 months before receiving pneumococcal immunization, anti-pneumococcal immunity will be assessed for serotype 3 , 4 , 6B, 7F, 9V, 14 , 18C, 19A , 19F , 23F, 10A and 12F (with ELISA only for the two latter).
For each serotype:
In ELISA, we will describe the proportion of responding patients (i.e. with a two-fold increase from V-1 to VO and a ≥1 μg/ml titre at V0.
In VO ELISA-responding patients, OPA titers will be measured. An opsonophagocytic antibody activity is considered positive if the antibody titer shows a four-fold increase from V-1 to V0 and is above a serotype-specific predefined threshold.</description>
