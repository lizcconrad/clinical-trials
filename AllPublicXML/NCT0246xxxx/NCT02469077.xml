  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Pain (CP) management has increasingly utilized long-term opioid analgesic therapy, a
      change associated with increased opioid abuse (via greater exposure in vulnerable
      individuals), non-pain health consequences (hormone changes, falls), and a dramatic rise in
      opioid-related overdoses and deaths. Treatment strategies that minimize the need for chronic
      high-dose opioids are sorely needed. This project will test the novel hypothesis that
      effective pain relief can be achieved at lower opioid analgesic doses by increasing levels of
      endogenous opioids (EOs).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will determine whether enhancing endogenous opioids (via aerobic exercise
      training) permits achieving desired levels of analgesia with lower dosages of opioid
      analgesics, and fewer side effects and abuse-relevant drug effects. This 4 year project will
      test study hypotheses in a sample of 116 chronic low back pain patients. The study will have
      two key elements: 1) a randomized, controlled aerobic exercise manipulation in CP patients
      completing daily electronic pain diaries and 2) laboratory evoked thermal pain protocols pre-
      and post-exercise permitting direct examination of changes in both opioid analgesic effects
      (in response to a series of incremental morphine doses) and EO activity (indexed by comparing
      pain responses after placebo vs. opioid blockade).

      The study will employ a mixed between/within-subjects design using double-blind,
      counterbalanced, placebo-controlled administration of both an opioid antagonist (naloxone)
      and an opioid agonist (morphine). The study will use a 6 week supervised aerobic exercise
      manipulation, with subjects randomly assigned to the exercise protocol or a no exercise
      control condition. All participants will undergo three identical laboratory pain-induction
      sessions (each ≈5 days apart) prior to randomization to experimental condition, and again at
      the end of the 6 week exercise manipulation period (regardless of exercise group assignment)
      during which they will receive the 3 study drugs and participate in controlled laboratory
      evaluation of evoked thermal pain responsiveness.

    <description>Participants assigned to the control condition will not undergo any manipulation during this 6 week period, and will be asked to continue their current activity levels and not engage in any additional exercise activity during the study period.

    <description>Each exercise session will consist of a 5 minute warm-up, 30 minutes of aerobic exercise, followed by a 5 minute cool-down period. Aerobic exercise will consist of treadmill walking/running, stepping, elliptical, or cycling exercise as preferred by the participant. Duration of exercise will be standardized at 30 minutes with a target exercise intensity between 70-85% Heart Rate Reserve (RPE = 15, hard). Because of the focus on de-conditioned individuals with Chronic Low Back Pain, the duration and intensity of exercise will be progressively increased up to target during the first two weeks to avoid symptom exacerbation and minimize study drop-out.</description>
