      This study evaluates maternal psychological distress and the impact of early palliative care
      team consultation on maternal anxiety and depression symptoms, coping, and quality of
      life/family functioning in the care of neonates born with single ventricle physiology. Half
      of the participants will receive early palliative care team consultation, while the other
      half will receive usual care (no or late palliative care intervention). The investigators
      hypothesize maternal stress, anxiety, and depression will be lower in the palliative care
      intervention group compared with the control group, and maternal coping mechanisms and
      perceived quality of life and family functioning will improve at the pre-discharge
      assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mothers of children with congenital heart disease are at increased risk of psychological
      morbidity including stress, anxiety, and depression. In particular, mothers of patients with
      single ventricle physiology who require neonatal surgery, face a great deal of stress related
      to the risk of serious complications including neonatal death. Previous studies have
      suggested that providing emotional psychosocial support may modify the development of
      significant psychosocial problems in parents of children with congenital heart disease. The
      pediatric palliative care team specializes in multiple elements of psychological and
      spiritual care for families of such children.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate maternal psychological distress and to examine
      the potential impact of early palliative care team consultation on maternal anxiety and
      depression symptoms, coping, and quality of life/family functioning in the care of neonates
      born with single ventricle physiology. Mothers will complete four questionnaires measuring
      anxiety, depression, and quality of life/family functioning at a prenatal follow up visit and
      again prior to neonatal surgical hospital stay discharge (or at 30 days). Infants will be
      randomly assigned (by date of birth) to receive early palliative care team consultation or
      usual care (no or late palliative care intervention).

      The investigators hypothesize maternal stress, anxiety, and depression will be lower in the
      palliative care intervention group compared with the control group, and maternal coping
      mechanisms and perceived quality of life and family functioning will improve at the
      pre-discharge assessment.

    <description>The palliative care team will evaluate the patient and family with the following core palliative care goals in mind: evaluating maternal understanding of their child's diagnosis and eliciting maternal concerns regarding their child's physical symptoms, identifying maternal social support systems and additional life stressors, identifying maternal expectations and hopes for their child's medical care, and assessing maternal fears surrounding their child's diagnosis and medical treatments. Palliative care team support and resources will then be provided in areas of necessity identified for the family. Palliative care team follow up will then be determined based on the level of need identified for each individual study participant.</description>
