      Objectives to investigate the incidence and associated factors for early postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction in the patients with peritoneal surface malignancies undergoing
      cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemo-therapy(CRS-HIPEC).Methods fifty
      patients aged 18-65 yr were included in the research and were grouped base on the score of
      neuropsychological assessments which had done in the ward at 7 day before and after the
      surgery. The investigators monitored various indicators in the perioperative period, such as
      age, body weight, sex, education, duration of operation, intraoperative blood loss,
      cardiovascular events, amount of fluid infused per hour. Meanwhile, the concentration of
      serum amploid A (SAA),IL-1beta,TNF-alpha,HMGB1,S100b,cortisol and Abeta40 were measured at
      the various stage of the operation and 24 hours after the operation, and the differences of
      data between postoperative cognitive dysfunction(POCD) and Non-POCD groups were analyzed.
