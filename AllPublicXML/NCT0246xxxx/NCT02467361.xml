  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study of BBI608 administered in combination
      with immunotherapy in adult patients with advanced cancers. The goal of the study is to
      determine the RP2D of BBI608 in combination with each of the immunotherapeutic agents.
