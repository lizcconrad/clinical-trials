  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluate multiple-portal VATS and uniportal VATS lobectomy for NSCLC, half of
      participants will receive multiple VATS, while the other half will receive uniportal VATS
      lobectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional VATS and uniportal VATS lobectomy can be performed each for NSCLC. Conventional
      VATS lobectomy employ 3 or 4 ports for completing the operation. Usually the camera port is
      performed at the seventh or eighth intercostals space within the trocar, so it's easy to
      cause the intercostals nerve and vessel injure, and still create obvious pain.

      However, the lobectomy for lung cancer can be accomplished with a single incision. According
      to the initial results, Uniportal VATS (UVATS) lobectomy procedure has been wide adopted by
      less acess trauma, relieve postoperative pain. But these were retrospective and descriptive,
      not randomized study. Further randomized control studies will be required to demonstrate that
      there are more benefits in UVATS techniques compared with conventional VATS for lobectomy.
