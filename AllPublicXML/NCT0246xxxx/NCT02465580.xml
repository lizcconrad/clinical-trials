  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunction of regulatory T (Treg) cells has been detected in diverse autoimmune diseases,
      which can be promoted by interleukin-2 (IL-2). In a previous small sample trail performed by
      the investigator's group, the investigators found that the Low-dose IL-2 was effective and
      well tolerated in active SLE, and the effect was associated with selective modulation of CD4+
      T cell subsets.

      This clinical study will confirm the efficacy and safety of low dose IL-2 treatment in SLE.

      The investigators perform a single-centre, double-blind pilot trial with hrIL-2 in SLE.The
      investigators evaluate the effectiveness and safeness of low-dose hrIL-2 for Systemic lupus
      erythematosus by randomized controlled study (hrIL-2 (N = 30) versus placebo group (N = 30)).

  <detailed_description>

      Each SLE patients (n=60) with Scores&gt;=8 on SLEDAI received low-dose IL-2 or placebo (active
      group: placebo group =1:1, 1 million units every other day subcutaneously (HrIL-2 1X 106, ip,
      Qod) for a period of 14 days. After a 14-day rest, another cycle started) for 3 cycles. The
      end points were safety and clinical and immunologic response.
