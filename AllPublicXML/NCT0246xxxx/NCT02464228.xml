  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II studyis designed to investigate the antitumor activity in terms of objective
      response rate (ORR) of tipifarnib in 18 subjects with advanced Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma
      (PTCL). The total number of patients could be extended to 30 pending on the degree of
      response observed at an interim analysis. Tipifarnib will be administered until disease
      progression then followed approximately every 12 weeks for survival until either death or 12
      months after accrual of the last study subject, whichever occurs first.

    <textblock>
      This Phase II study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in
      subjects with relapsed or refractory PTCL. Up to 30 subjects may be enrolled in the study.
      The first 18 subjects may be of the following PTCL sub-types: PTCL, not otherwise specified
      (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), ALK-positive and -negative anaplastic
      large cell lymphoma (ALCL), hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, enteropathy-associate T-cell
      lymphoma (EATL), extranodal natural killer (NK) T-cell lymphoma, nasal type and subcutaneous
      panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. The AITL expansion cohort (N=12) will enroll only subjects
      with AITL.

      A two-stage study design will be used for the first 18 subjects in order to minimize the
      number of study subjects treated if tipifarnib were considered not sufficiently efficacious
      to grant further development in this subject population. Tumor response assessments will be
      conducted according to IWC and/or mSWAT criteria.

      Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 8 weeks on cycles 2-6 and at least
      once approximately every 12 weeks thereafter (Cycles 9, 12, 15, etc.), and will continue
      until disease progression. Subjects who have experienced a complete response may be
      considered for transplantation. Upon disease progression, all subjects will be followed
      approximately every 12 weeks for survival and the use of subsequent therapy until either
      death or 12 months after accrual of the last study subject, whichever occurs first. All
      subjects will be followed-up for safety during treatment and up to approximately 30 days (30
      +/- 7 days) after treatment discontinuation or until immediately before the initiation of
      another anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Additional follow up may be implemented
      until the subject recovers from any emergent treatment related toxicity or the adverse event
      is considered irreversible by the investigator.
