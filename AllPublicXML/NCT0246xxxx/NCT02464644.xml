  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) affects 1 in 5,000 people. The purpose of this
      study is to provide data regarding the frequency of common health conditions and the
      tolerability of therapies in HHT by using a questionnaire.

      This will be filled in by both people with HHT, and controls who will be members of the
      general population without HHT.

      The questionnaire has been designed primarily for web based entry, but can also be circulated
      in paper format on request

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) affects 1 in 5,000 people, usually causing
      nosebleeds, skin blood spots, and/or anemia as a result of bleeding from the nose or gut. The
      majority of people with HHT also have abnormal blood vessels (arteriovenous malformations) in
      internal organs such as the lungs, liver and brain. Management of this multisystem disorder
      is highly challenging.

      The Lead Applicant has spent 20 years working on this rare disease, and identified multiple
      areas where more evidence is required to assist clinicians and patients with this lifelong
      condition. A particular issue is what happens when people with HHT have other common medical
      conditions such as asthma, cancer, diabetes, or heart disease. Do they have the same pattern
      of problems as the general population? Can they use the same drugs? Are further safeguards
      needed? For these important questions, current advice can only be based on theoretical
      considerations and anecdotal data.

      The ultimate goal of this study is to use information derived from a questionnaire to provide
      evidence to assist clinicians treating people with HHT.

      Data will be entered from April 2012. Data will be analysed on average 6-8 months after
      entry.

    <description>To capture large sufficiently large numbers of individuals for appropriate statistical power (see below), a web based questionnaire design was considered the most appropriate tool. SurveyMonkey was identified as the most suitable means to generate the questionnaire, facilitate confidential answers by the target populations, and for analysis of questionnaire data. The designed survey can also be presented in paper format, and used in our clinical service.</description>
