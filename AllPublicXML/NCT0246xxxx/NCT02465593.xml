    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II study is a prospective, open-label, single arm, nonrandomized study of
      PEP503(radio-enhancer).

      There are 2 portions in this study.

        -  Escalation phase (Part Ib): A 3 + 3 dose escalation study design will be adopted in this
           phase to identify the recommended injection volume of PEP503 for intratumor injection.

        -  Expansion phase (Part II): Following the confirmation of the recommended volume of
           intratumor injection, 18 additional patients will be enrolled at the recommended volume
           level to evaluate for efficacy.

      The target population is composed by patients who have confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum
      which is T3-4, N any, or locally unresectable, with tumor distal margin within 10 cm of the
      anal verge, with no evidence of distant metastatic disease, ECOG performance 0-1, and
      adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function.
