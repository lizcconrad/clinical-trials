  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blinded placebo-controlled study will examine the incidence and significance of
      contrast-induced acute kidney injury following IV iodine-based contrast material
      administration in subjects with stage IIIB or stage IV chronic kidney disease.

      Subjects will be scheduled for clinically indicated CT of the abdomen and/or pelvis to
      evaluate for suspected intra-abdominal infection. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      either weight-based low-osmolality iodinated contrast material or saline. The primary outcome
      measure will be the incidence of stage II AKI by AKIN (Acute Kidney Injury Network) criteria.

      This double-blinded placebo-controlled non-inferiority study will examine the incidence and
      significance of contrast-induced acute kidney injury following intravenous iodine-based
      contrast material administration in subjects with stage IIIB or stage IV chronic kidney

      Subjects will be scheduled for clinically indicated CT of the abdomen and/or pelvis to
      evaluate for suspected intra-abdominal infection. Subjects will be randomized to receive
      either weight-based low-osmolality iodinated contrast material or saline. The primary outcome
      measure will be the incidence of stage II AKI by AKIN criteria.

      Secondary outcome measures will include AKI by other definitions (stage I AKI, traditional
      CI-AKI definition), hospital length of stay, 30-day readmission rate, number of additional
      percutaneous interventions within 30 days, number of additional CT examinations within 30
      days, and 30-day mortality rate. All subjects will receive a minimum of 1 mL/kg/hr (max: 125
      mL/hr) of volume expansion for at least three hours before and after the CT..
