  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-resistant partial epilepsy has a heavy impact on quality of life and sometimes on life
      expectancy itself. Only a minority of patients may benefit from a curative epilepsy surgery.
      Neurostimulation, which can be an effective add-on treatment, is currently mainly represented
      by vagus nervus stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation, a non -invasive
      technique already used in other areas of neurology, may be efficient on some partial
      epilepsies, in particular through the individual configuration of stimulation, made possible
      by recent technological advances.

      Main goal : To study the effect of transcranial electrical stimulation on the frequency of
      seizures in patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy.

      Hypothesis : Reduction of 50% or more in the frequency of occurrence of seizures within 24
      hours following an individually configured TDCS session: responders in real TDCS vs placebo
      stimulation.
