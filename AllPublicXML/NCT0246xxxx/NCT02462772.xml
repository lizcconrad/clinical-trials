    <textblock>
      The CAPRISA 014 trial aims to assess the safety and acceptability of the long-acting (LA)
      injectable antiretroviral agent, cabotegravir LA (GSK1265744), in HIV uninfected women in
      KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

    <textblock>
      The CAPRISA 014 trial is designed to establish the safety and acceptability of cabotegravir
      LA in sexually active, at-risk HIV-uninfected women. A total of 632 HIV uninfected women (18
      to 30 years) from two sites in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa will be enrolled. The trial will
      be approximately 24 months, with an additional 12 months post-trial safety observation. The
      study is divided into three periods:

      Period 1 - Clinical trial oral lead-in (up to 34 days) - Consenting participants will be
      randomized to receive daily oral cabotegravir (30mg tablets) or daily oral placebo for
      approximately 30 days, to assess safety and tolerability prior to exposure to the LA
      injectable formulation.

      Period 2 - Clinical trial follow-up with injectable (approximately 48-96 weeks) -
      Participants who have successfully completed Period 1 will receive intra-muscular (IM)
      gluteal injections of cabotegravir LA (800 mg, administered as two 400 mg injections) or
      placebo every 12 weeks. The end of Period 2 marks the completion of clinical trial follow-up.

      Period 3 - Post-trial safety follow-up off-product (approximately 12 months) - During this
      post-trial safety observation period, participants will be followed up (off product) for
      approximately 12 months after completion of period 2.
