      This study consists of 2 parts: Part 1 and Part 2. [Part 1] An open-label, un-controlled
      study Examine the safety for the ASP4070 intramuscular vaccination group (high dose x 4
      times) and the ASP4070 intradermal vaccination group (high dose x 4 times).

      [Part 2] A placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized, parallel-group comparative study
      Assess the immunological response and safety for the ASP 4070 intramuscular vaccination group
      (high dose x 1 time and high dose x 4 times) and the ASP4070 intradermal vaccination group
      (low dose x 1 time, low x 4 times, high dose x 1 time, and high dose x 4 times) as compared
      to those for the placebo group. The study will be double-blinded within the same route of
      vaccination, and non-blinded between the routes of vaccination (between the intramuscular
      vaccination group and intradermal vaccination group).

      The first vaccination to the subjects in Part 2 will start at least 14 days after the first
      vaccination to the subjects in Part 1 (6 subjects).

      For both Part 1 and Part 2, primary study period is for 3 months starting from the last dose
      of the study drug at Day 43 (until Day 127). After the primary study period, safety
      information will be collected for 9 months (for 1 year from the last dose of the study drug)
      as the long-term safety follow-up study period. Safety information will be collected for 1
      year starting from the last vaccination of the study drug also from the patients who
      discontinued the participation in the study during the primary study period if the patients
      agree.
