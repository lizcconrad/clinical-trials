  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if special blood tests and imaging scans can help
      evaluate the effects of the radiation the patient receives as part of standard treatment. The
      patient will undergo either stereotactic or conventional radiation treatment as determined by
      the treating doctor. Previous evidence suggests that blood flow to tumors is affected by the
      amount (dose) of radiation that it receives. This effect may be seen as soon as 1-2 hours
      after the radiation is given. This study will evaluate if these changes can be seen and
      measured by performing a special type of scan called Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM)
      diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and a blood test. IVIM MRI is a research
      exam which is similar to a standard MRI exam, with only a slight difference in the technical
      parameters used to acquire the images.

    <description>Upon enrollment in the study, each patient will undergo a standard pre-treatment evaluation in the Radiation Oncology Clinic. Imaging will include MRI with IVIM DW-MRI (as a research exam). MR imaging will begin within 30 minutes (+/- 15 mins) of the completion of single-dose radiation or the first dose for patients treated with a multifractioned regime. Patients will have corresponding serum samples collected at approximately 1 hour before and 18-24 hours after the first radiation treatment. If radiation therapy occurs on a Friday, the collection of the serum 18-24 hours post-treatment may still be feasible. Patients will be treated with radiation therapy according to our standard clinical guidelines using one of several Varian megavoltage linear accelerators with on-board kilovoltage image-guidance capabilities, using established immobilization devices that are specific to the anatomical site treated at MD's discretion.</description>
