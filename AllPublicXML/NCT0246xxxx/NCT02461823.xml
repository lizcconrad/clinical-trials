  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Porcelain fused to metal (PFM) has been used in dentistry for the last five decades.

      Zirconia (zirconium oxide, ZrO2) is the white crystalline powder oxide of the naturally
      occurring metal zirconium. Research of the medical utilization of zirconia dates back to the
      late 1960s. However, its utilization in dentistry did not start until the 1990s, when
      zirconia began to be used as a form of endodontic posts and implant abutments. The current
      literature contains studies that investigated the influence of zirconia implants and
      abutments on periodontal tissue, but to the investigators' knowledge, no work has been yet
      published which compares the influences of crown types on hard and soft tissues.

      This prospective study will be conducted in the Department of Periodontology and in the
      Department of Maxillofacial Rehabilitation at Rambam Health Care Campus.
