  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study 201682 is a Phase IIa, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled four arm outpatient
      study evaluating the safety, tolerability and clinical effect of danirixin or danirixin +
      oseltamivir combination in comparison to placebo or oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days in
      otherwise healthy adults with laboratory confirmed influenza infection. Danirixin is a
      selective and reversible C-X-C Chemokine Receptor 2 (CXCR2) antagonist that inhibits
      neutrophil transmigration and activation to areas of inflammation. The study endpoints are
      intended to test the hypothesis that inhibition of neutrophil activation by approximately
      50-60% (as previously measured by cluster of differentiation [CD11b] expression in response
      to chemokine [C-X-C motif] ligand 1 [CXCL1] stimulation ex vivo in human studies) will not
      impact safety parameters or worsen clinical manifestations of disease, disease-related events
      of interest, or viral load, and may possibly improve these parameters when administered
      within 48 hours of symptom onset. The aim of this exploratory study is to obtain data on the
      safety, tolerability and clinical effect of GSK1325756 (danirixin [DNX]) alone or in
      combination with oseltamivir (OSV) in otherwise healthy adults with acute, uncomplicated
      influenza prior to future evaluation in hospitalized patients with complicated influenza. The
      primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of DNX with and without a
      neuraminidase inhibitor through the evaluation of AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital
      signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. Safety assessments will also include an
      assessment of disease related events (DREs) of interest and associated antibiotic use. The
      Influenza Intensity and Impact Questionnaire (FluiiQ™) will be used in the study to document
      patient reported outcomes (PROs). The screening visit in Australia will be composed of a
      pre-screen for influenza infection with an influenza rapid antigen test followed by a screen
      for the remaining eligibility criteria for those subjects with a positive result on the
      influenza rapid antigen test. FluiiQ is trademark owned by Measured Solutions for Health
      Private Limited.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 28/withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

          -  Body weight &gt;60 Kilogram (kg) for men and &gt;45 kg for women; and Body Mass Index (BMI)
             between 19 to 35 kilogram per meters squared (kg/m^2), inclusive;

          -  Male or Female subjects could be eligible if :

        Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must comply with the
        following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until
        at least 36 hours (five half-lives) of study medication after the last dose of study
        medication:

        Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia; Male condom plus partner use of one of the
        following contraceptive options: Contraceptive subdermal implant; Intrauterine device or
        intrauterine system; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone; Injectable
        progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring ; Percutaneous contraceptive patches; This is an
        all-inclusive list of those methods that meet the following GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
        definition of highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used
        consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For
        non-product methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent
        and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by the
        International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH). The investigator is responsible for
        ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception;

          -  Female subject: is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a
             negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG] test), not lactating, and at least
             one of the following conditions applies

        Non-reproductive potential defined as:

        Pre-menopausal females with one of the following: documented Tubal ligation; Documented
        Hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal
        occlusion; Hysterectomy; Documented Bilateral oophorectomy; Postmenopausal defined as 12
        months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
        follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause). Females
        on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be
        required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue
        their HRT during the study.

        Reproductive potential agrees to follow one of the options listed below in the GSK Modified
        List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive
        Potential (FRP) requirements from the time of screening, during dosing, and until at least
        36 hrs after the last dose of study medication and completion of the follow-up visit.

        GSK List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive
        Potential (FRP) meeting GSK criteria of highly effective: having a failure rate of less
        than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance
        with the product label. This list does not apply to FRP with same sex partners, when this
        is their preferred and usual lifestyle or for subjects who are and will continue to be
        abstinent from penilevaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis.

        Contraceptive subdermal implant; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system; Combined
        estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive; Injectable progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal
        ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches; Male partner sterilization with documentation of
        azoospermia prior to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole
        partner for that subject.

        These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly
        and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that
        subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</title>
        <description>AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

        <description>Urinalysis parameters included urine pH. pH is calculated on a scale of 0 to 14, such that, the lower the number, more acidic the urine and higher the number, more alkaline the urine with 7 being neutral. Urinalysis was done on Day 1, Day 5 and Day 28/withdrawal. Assessments recorded on Day 1 were considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was equal to Post-Dose Visit Value minus Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Urinalysis Parameters- Urine Specific Gravity</title>
        <description>Urinalysis parameter included Urine specific gravity and was measured on Day 1, Day 5 and Day 28. Urinary specific gravity is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine. It measures the ratio of urine density compared with water density and provides information on the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. Assessments recorded on Day 1 were considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was equal to Post-Dose Visit Value minus Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vital Signs- Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)</title>
        <description>Vital signs were measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest and included systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Three readings of blood pressure were taken; the first reading was rejected and the second and third readings were averaged to give the measurement to be recorded. Vital signs were obtained on Baseline (Day 1), Day 3, Day 5, Day 8, Day 14 and Day 28/withdrawal. Assessments recorded on Day 1 were considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was equal to Post-Dose Visit Value minus Baseline.</description>

        <description>Vital signs were measured in semi-supine position after 5 minutes rest and included HR. Three readings of pulse rate were taken; the first reading was rejected and the second and third readings were averaged to give the measurement to be recorded. Vital signs were obtained on Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, Day 8, Day 14 and Day 28/withdrawal. Assessments recorded on Day 1 were considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was equal to Post-Dose Visit Value minus Baseline.</description>
