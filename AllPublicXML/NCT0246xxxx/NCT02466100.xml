    <textblock>
      This study proposes to evaluate, among adults with advanced heart failure (HF) and their
      health care providers, the effects of a communication intervention designed to improve
      patient-provider communication about goals of care (GoC). Patient activated GoC conversations
      can result in providers' better understanding their patients' preferences for end-of-life
      care. GoC conversations that occur over time may allow patients and providers to consider a
      wider range of options earlier in the HF illness trajectory. Preliminary data suggests that
      the proposed GoC intervention increases the occurrence and quality of patient-provider
      communication about end-of-life care for advanced COPD. The proposed study will test the
      effects of the GoC intervention compared to usual care, using a randomized, 2-group (N = 80,
      n = 40/arm), repeated-measures design. Measures will be taken at a patient's baseline study
      entry and after the next scheduled clinic visit. Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate change in
      number of GoC conversations between patient and provider between the two groups. Specific Aim
      2 is to examine whether the intervention increases patient quality of life, referrals to
      palliative care, advance care planning, decreases depression and anxiety. Specific Aim 3 is
      to describe the feasibility, acceptability, perceived benefits, burden, and implementation
      success of the intervention in the heart failure clinic setting. Patients will be randomized
      to the GoC intervention or to receive usual care. Patients in the GoC intervention group,
      telephone coaching by a research nurse to help patients role-play talking with their HF
      providers. Both patients and their providers, will be provided with summaries of
      individualized, patient-centered information about patient preferences for communicating
      about end-of-life care and patient self-identified barriers to and facilitators of
      communication about end-of-life care with tips on how to initiate goals of care discussions.
      Providers of patients in the intervention group will also be provided with patient-specific
      prognostic information based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model. The GoC intervention will be
      tested in a real-world clinic setting. This intervention is expected to be relatively
      cost-effective and easily translated into general cardiology practice in the future. The
      study is expected to make significant contributions to provision of earlier access to
      palliative care in the advanced HF disease trajectory.
