  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare 3 treatment groups (ketamine plus naltrexone vs. ketamine
      alone vs. placebo) for treating major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder
      (AUD) in an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects trial.
      First, prior to the double-blind trial, the investigators will conduct an open-label trial
      that will include 5 patients with comorbid MDD and AUD to test safety and efficacy of
      repeated ketamine treatment (0.5 mg/kg; once a week for 4 weeks; a total of 4 ketamine
      infusions) with a follow-up of 4 weeks. Second, after reviewing the safety and efficacy of
      repeated ketamine treatment from the open-label trial, the investigators will conduct an
      8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that will include 60 patients with
      comorbid MDD and AUD to test safety and efficacy of repeated ketamine treatment (0.5 mg/kg;
      once a week for 4 weeks; a total of 4 ketamine infusions) plus naltrexone with a follow-up of
      4 weeks. The 4-month follow-up session will also occur.
