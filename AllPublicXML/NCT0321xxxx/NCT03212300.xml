  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study to examine whether aerobic exercise training (AET) before total
      shoulder replacement (TSR) surgery reduces the incidence of post-operative delirium (POD) and
      shorten time to recovery in elderly patients. POD is a form of sudden change in mental
      function that could be experienced after undergoing surgery.

    <textblock>
      In this study, patients awaiting TSR who consent to participate in the study will be randomly
      assigned to receive 4 weeks of high intensity interval aerobic exercise training or treatment
      as usual for the 4 weeks prior to surgery. Exercise training will be on a recumbent cycle
      ergometer provided by the study. All patients will receive cognitive testing before and on
      several days after surgery. Blood also will be drawn on several occasions throughout the
      study to measure inflammatory markers.

    <description>patients will engage in 4 training sessions/week over a 4-week period, with 24-hour rest-periods after each training day. Each session begins with a 3 min, low intensity warm-up on a stationary cycle, then patients cycle as rapidly as they can for 20 sec, aiming to reach 85% of their maximum heart rate (HR) as established during cardiorespiratory fitness testing. This 20 sec period is followed by 40 sec of low intensity cycling. Patients complete 8 such intervals for sessions 1 and 2, 10 intervals for sessions 3 and 4, and 12 intervals thereafter</description>
