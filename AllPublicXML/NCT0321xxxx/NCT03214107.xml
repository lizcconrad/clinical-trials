  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prevent hypoglycemia during prolonged exercise (&gt;30 minutes), additional carbohydrate
      intake is frequently required. Carbohydrate intake required will vary with insulin regimens,
      timing and type of exercise as well as starting blood glucose level. In addition to the
      amount of carbohydrate ingested, the timing of carbohydrate intake could also have an impact
      on glucose control during exercise. Therefore, the objective of this study will be to compare
      the efficacy of two snacking strategies to maintain glucose levels in the target range during
      an exercise period in adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes: 1) a snack containing
      ~0.5g of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight - rounded to the nearest 5g - given 5
      minutes before exercise; 2) a snack containing ~0.5g of carbohydrates per kilogram of body
      weight - rounded to the nearest 5g - distributed this way: ~40% given 5 minutes before
      exercise, ~30% after 20 minutes of exercise and the last ~30% after 40 minutes of exercise.

    <description>Participants will be admitted at IRCM at 14:00. At 15:30, participants will performed a 60-minute exercise on the ergocycle at 60% of VO2 peak (moderate intensity). During exercise, capillary glucose levels will be measured every 10 minutes. At 16:30, the exercise will be completed and capillary glucose levels will be monitored every 20 minutes for 1 hour. At 17:30, the participant will be discharged.</description>
