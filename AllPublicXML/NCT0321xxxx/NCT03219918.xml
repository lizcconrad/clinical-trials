  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to examine whether colonoscopy using an EndoRings cap has a higher
      adenoma detection rate than conventional colonoscopy. Secondary end-points is to compare
      completion rate, completion time, complication rate and detection of malignancies. Half of
      the patients will be randomised to colonoscopy using cap and the other half to no cap.

    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is recognised as the standard method for finding and removing colorectal
      adenomas, which are precursors of most colorectal cancers. It has been shown that there is a
      direct correlation between adenoma detection rate and the risk of developing colorectal
      cancer subsequently. However, patients undergoing colonoscopy are still at risk of developing
      colorectal cancer, mainly because precursor lesions are missed during the procedure. This may
      be due to insufficient bowel preparation, difficulties in visualising flat lesions or the
      location of lesions behind haustral folds.

      Improving the ADR can be achieved by different means; better training of endoscopists,
      improved bowel preparation, optimal sedation and medico technical developments. The technical
      improvements have mainly been in the optimising of image and improved scope thickness and
      flexibility, including devices that improve visualisation by increasing the exposed colonic
      surface . One of these new inventions is the EndoRings II Distal Attachment.

      According to the Danish Colorectal Cancer Screening Database, the ADR of standard screening
      colonoscopy is between 34 and 67 % with a national average of 49 % of patients with detected
      adenomas. Due to the known adenoma miss rate in standard screening colonoscopies, it is
      important to increase the ADR on average as well as finding ways to improve ADR for centres
      with a lower than average ADR.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a single-centre prospective randomised clinical trial. Patients are included if they meet the specified inclusion criteria and accept to take part in the study after proper oral and written information (see patient information below).
Specimens i.e. removed adenomas and biopsies of suspected malignancies are analysed by pathologists according to standard procedure. The pathologist will not know the nature of specimen collection (colonoscopy with or without EndoRings). The specimens are not saved for any other study related activities.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>It is partially blinded in the way that the endoscopist knows whether the procedure is performed with or without the EndoRings but neither patient, pathologist nor investigators will have this information, which is only to be revealed to the investigators at the end of data processing.</masking_description>
