  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To provide a point-in-time measurement of the oral health of elderly inpatients across the
      trust (elderly defined here as over 70 years). This will provide information about the number
      of teeth, need for restorative and periodontal treatment, and extractions, the health of the
      oral mucosa, quality of any dentures and hygiene of the teeth and dentures.

      Such information will allow identification of any problems with oral health in this hospital
      population, thereby allowing development of strategies and protocols for managing these
      problems. There have been a number of studies examining these variables in elderly residents
      in care homes and a few in long term hospital settings (over 1 year admission), but only one
      in the UK previously in acute hospitals. Therefore the published literature is sparse, and
      requires further data collection. The oral health of the elderly, but particularly the
      institutionalized, is increasingly recognised for its important relationships with general
      health, wellbeing and quality of life. This study will provide useful information to address
      these concerns.
