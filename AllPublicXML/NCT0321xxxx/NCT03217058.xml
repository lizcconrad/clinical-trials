    <textblock>
      Substance use disorders (SUDs) and depression in HIV-infected patients result in poor HIV
      outcomes, yet are often unrecognized and untreated. To address these problems, this study
      examines the implementation and effectiveness of a clinical intervention consisting of
      self-administered tablet-based SUD and depression screening at routine HIV primary care
      clinic visits, followed by evidence-based treatments for SUD and depression delivered by a
      behavioral health specialist. If successful, this study has potential to reduce SUD- and
      depression-related problems and reduce HIV treatment disparities for patients with these
      comorbidities.

      Substance use disorders (SUDs) and depression are common among HIV-positive patients and lead
      to poor HIV treatment outcomes and increased mortality. Yet these disorders often go
      unrecognized and untreated, despite the availability of effective interventions. To enhance
      HIV care, this study examines the impact of self-administered tablet-based screening for SUD
      risk and depression using validated measures, with results integrated into the electronic
      health record and reviewed by behavioral health specialists (BHSs) embedded in primary care
      HIV clinics. Based on screening results, BHSs will initiate motivational interviewing (MI)-
      and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based clinical interventions. Using a hybrid study
      approach, we will evaluate both implementation and effectiveness of screening and
      intervention. Specifically, we will employ a stepped-wedge trial design, with a 12-month
      intervention phase implemented sequentially in the 3 largest HIV primary care clinics serving
      4600 HIV-positive patients in Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), with a 12-month
      usual care period prior to implementation in each clinic functioning as an observational
      phase for comparison. This design, a variation of a cross-over RCT, allows for intervention
      refinement at each clinic and provides the opportunity to compare outcomes among patients
      before and after implementation. We will evaluate patient-level (e.g., demographics, HIV, SUD
      and depression severity) and provider-level (e.g., provider attitudes) factors affecting
      implementation and effectiveness, and will analyze cost effectiveness. The results of the
      study will provide insights regarding the implementation of evidence-based treatments for SUD
      and depression, such as: 1) How self-administered computerized SUD and depression screening
      and corresponding behavioral interventions can be effectively and efficiently implemented in
      HIV primary care clinics and sustained over time; 2) What patient and clinic characteristics
      influence screening and intervention rates; 3) To what extent implementation of screening and
      treatment impacts SUD and depression outcomes, as well as HIV outcomes, including retention
      in care, viral suppression and Veterans Aging Cohort Study index score, and 4) What are the
      barriers, facilitators and costs of implementation. The study setting is generalizable to
      other HIV clinics and health systems and will provide key data regarding the effective
      delivery of treatment options within primary care settings, and in coordination with SUD and
      psychiatry specialty care. Furthermore, the study addresses NIH-identified high priority HIV
      research topics since effective treatment of SUDs and/or depression would alleviate HIV
      treatment disparities for these individuals and reduce SUD- and depression-related medical
      comorbidity and mortality.
