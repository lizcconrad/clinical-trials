  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective hospital-based cohort study of the association between preoperative
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPEX) variables and short-term postoperative morbidity
      following oesophagectomy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the correlations between preoperative CPEX variables
      (VO2max and Anaerobic Threshold) and 30 day postoperative all cause morbidity in a sample
      large enough to allow (should significant associations exist) calculation of a threshold
      value. Secondary aims are to examine associations between the VO2max, AT and cardiopulmonary,
      non-cardiopulmonary complications as well as specific complications (atrial fibrillation,
      pneumonia, and anastomotic leak) as well as 30 and 90 day mortality.
