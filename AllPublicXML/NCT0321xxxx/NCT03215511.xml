  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of LOXO-195 when administered orally to patients age ≥ 1 month and older with NTRK
      fusion cancers treated with a prior TRK inhibitor.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation (Phase I ) and dose expansion (Phase
      2) . Patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors are eligible if progressed or
      intolerant to prior TRK inhibitor. During Phase 1, a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended
      dose for further study will be identified for in patients age 12 and older and patients age
      &lt;12. During Phase 2, the same patient population as designated for Phase 1 will be treated
      with the dose of LOXO-195 which has been identified during phase 1 to assess specified
      endpoints.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 4 weeks

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function.

          -  Patients with stable CNS primary tumor, brain metastases, or treated spinal cord
             compression are eligible if neurological symptoms and steroid use (if applicable) have
             been stable for 7 days prior to the first dose of LOXO-195

          -  Ability to receive study drug therapy by enteral administration

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Required treatment with certain strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.

          -  Clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or history of myocardial
             infarction within 3 months prior to planned start of LOXO-195 or prolongation of the
             QT interval corrected (QTcF) &gt; 480 msec within the past 6 months

          -  Major surgery within 7 days of enrollment

          -  Uncontrolled systemic bacterial, fungal or viral infection

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.
