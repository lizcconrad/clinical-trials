  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no definite evidence about the most effective treatment approach in early-stage
      rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty surgery. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effects of mobilization exercises applied with classical exercises on pain,
      joint range of motion, edema, function, quality of life and patient satisfaction in early
      stage rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty surgery.

      There is no definite evidence about the most effective treatment approach in early-stage
      rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty surgery. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effects of mobilization exercises applied with classical exercises on pain,
      joint range of motion, edema, function, quality of life and patient satisfaction in early
      stage rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty surgery. Patients with bicompartmental
      total knee arthroplasty operation due to knee osteoarthritis will randomly assign to 2
      groups. Patients in group 1 will treat with mobilization exercises in addition to classical
      exercises performed in the early post-op period; patients in group 2 will treat only with
      classical exercises.
