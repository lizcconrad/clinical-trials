    <textblock>
      Purpose of the single arm study is to clinically and histologically evaluate alloplastic
      in-situ hardening, moldable beta-tricalcium phosphate(TCP) bone graft material and
      polylactide membrane in alveolar ridge preservation following extraction of non-molar teeth
      with non-containable extraction sockets.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adequate restorative space for a dental implant restoration, if the subject decides
             previous to study participation that they would like an implant. Note, agreement to
             implant placement is not a requirement of the study

          -  minimum of 10-mm vertical bone without impinging on adjacent vital structures
             (Maxillary sinus, neurovascular bundles)

          -  single-rooted tooth to be extracted

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status Classification I or II

          -  age &gt;18 years old

          -  subjects who had &gt;50% of height on any portion on the buccal wall of dehiscence and/or
             fenestration of the extraction socket following extraction will be included from this
             study

          -  adjacent teeth to extraction site will be present during healing period

          -  willingly sign informed consent and authorization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  do not meet any inclusion criteria

          -  pregnancy or nursing woman

          -  subjects with active systemic or localized infection (exclude chronic periodontitis)

          -  subjects with a history of any medical conditions that contraindicated or weighed
             against dental implant placement such as history of bisphosphonate drug use,
             chemotherapeutic or immunosuppressive agents, autoimmune disease, or poorly controlled
             diabetes (HBA1c&gt;7%)

          -  subjects with smoking habit (more than 10 cigarettes per day)
