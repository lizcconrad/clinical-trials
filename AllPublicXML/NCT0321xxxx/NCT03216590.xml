  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strategies to minimize soft tissue swelling during shoulder arthroscopy are constantly sought
      after. The investigators propose an unfamiliar method which may reduce tissue swelling during
      shoulder arthroscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid extravasation into the surrounding tissue is common in shoulder arthroscopy. It
      frequently leads to soft tissue swelling and edema which results in poor visualization and
      prolonged surgical time. While usually resolves uneventfully within 12 hours, excessive fluid
      extravasation into the soft tissue around the shoulder may lead to serious consequences and
      complications such as airway compromise, tracheal deviation, neuropraxias, habdomyoloysis and
      skin necrosis have been reported in the literature. Methods aimed at reducing soft tissue
      swelling during shoulder arthroscopy in order to avoid complications (e.g., low pump
      pressure, short arthroscopic time) are routinely practiced. Nevertheless, fluid extravasation
      and soft tissue swelling remains a concern in shoulder arthroscopy.

      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate whether applying local compression to the
      shoulder by preoperative compressive draping will reduce soft tissue swelling during shoulder
      arthroscopy. To the investigators' knowledge, no previous study evaluated the influence of
      applying compressive draping to the shoulder on soft tissue swelling in shoulder arthroscopy.
