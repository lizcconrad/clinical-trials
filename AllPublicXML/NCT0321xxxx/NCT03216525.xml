  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if Alvimopan during open or robotic radical cystectomy with urinary diversion
      results in quicker return of bowel function (GI-2 recovery = time to upper [first toleration
      of solid food] and lower [first bowel movement] gastrointestinal recovery) compared to
      placebo.

      A prospective, randomized, single-center double blind trial of Alvimopan versus placebo for
      improving patient outcomes and cost during radical cystectomy and urinary diversion will be
      performed. A randomized trial is necessary to control for all the known and unknown
      confounders associated with instituting this novel intervention into a surgical procedure. We
      will recruit 136 subjects (63 patients in each arm of the study per sample size calculation
      below, plus additional 10 subjects to account for drop outs). A control group will be
      administered a placebo in order to directly compare if the Alvimopan intervention is
      effective.
