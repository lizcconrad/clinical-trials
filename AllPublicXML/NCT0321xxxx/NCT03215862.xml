    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial. This study is a head to head
      comparison of normal saline (NS) infusion versus Lactated Ringer's (LR) infusion in patients,
      with the primary outcome of post-ERCP pancreatitis occurrence. Patients will be randomized to
      either the NS infusion group or the LR infusion group. IVF will be started pre-procedurally
      and will be continued throughout the procedure. A IVF bolus will be given at the end of the
      procedure and then continued as a continuous infusion. Our null hypothesis is that there will
      be no significant difference in the rate of occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis between the
      infusion of LR and NS solutions. Our alternative hypothesis is that patients receiving LR
      solution infusion will experience a decreased rate of post-ERCP pancreatitis compared to
      patients receiving NS solution infusion.
