  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CK-301 is a fully human monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype that directly binds to Programmed
      Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) and blocks its interactions with the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and
      B7.1 receptors. The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of CK-301 when administered intravenously as a single agent to subjects
      with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers.

    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of CK-301,
      a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody targeting PD-L1. The study will consist of 3 periods:
      Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (28-day cycles), and Follow-up (up to 6 months).
      Following the dose escalation portion of the study, additional evaluable subjects may be
      included in order to further characterize safety and efficacy at selected doses and/or in
      specific patient sub-groups.
