    <textblock>
      Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a highly prevalent but poorly
      understood condition with limited treatment options. Current therapies, including a
      nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin or diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP), show efficacy in 50% or less of
      patients. In this proposal, we will randomize IBS-D patients to receive either rifaximin or
      low FODMAP dietary intervention.

    <textblock>
      Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a highly prevalent but poorly
      understood condition with limited treatment options. Recent evidence has established small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and alterations in fecal microbiota as potential
      etiologies in the pathogenesis of IBS-D. Current therapies, including a nonabsorbable
      antibiotic rifaximin or diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides,
      monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP), show efficacy in 50% or less of patients [1-4]. It has
      been postulated that limited responses to therapies may stem from failure to identify
      distinct subgroups in IBS-D stratified by gut microbial profiles. In this proposal, we will
      randomize IBS-D patients to receive either rifaximin or low FODMAP dietary intervention. We
      will then longitudinally follow the results of fecal microbiota-derived data as well as
      hydrogen breath tests to define SIBO. We will use these methods to test the hypotheses that:
      (i) distinct IBS-D phenotypes can be generated by defining fecal microbial populations as
      well as delineating the presence or absence of SIBO; and (ii) longitudinal analyses using
      microbe-derived metrics and SIBO status may relate to response to treatment with rifaximin or
      low FODMAP dietary intervention.
