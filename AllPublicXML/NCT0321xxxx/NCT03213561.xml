  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with locked-in syndrome cannot move their limbs or talk because of a motor impairment,
      but remain conscious and intellectually awake. Restoring the ability to communicate to people
      with locked-in syndrome will have a positive effect on their quality of life, will enable
      them to reintegrate into society and increase their capacity to lead productive and
      fulfilling lives. This study sims to develop a new assisted communication device based on a
      brain-computer interface, a system that allows the user to control a computer with his brain
      activity. The investigators will develop this brain-computer system for long-term stability
      and independent use by using adaptive decoders. The investigators will test the long-term
      stability and independence of this system with healthy volunteers, people with tetraplegia
      and people with locked-in syndrome over time periods of several months.

    <description>The investigators will measure the text-entry rate achieved using the brain-computer interface in each session by the number of correct characters per minute (CCPM). At the end of the study, the investigators will calculate the average brain-computer interface performance, and the correlation between the performance and the duration of brain-computer interface use (performance-use correlation). Brain-computer interface stability will be established if the performance-use correlation is greater than -0.5 CCPM/year. Primary objective of the study will be met if the brain-computer interface performance is stable for 75% of participants or more in each of three study populations, and if the average brain-computer interface performance for participants that show stable performance is greater than 5 CCPM.</description>

    <description>The participants will perform an MRI head scan, which the investigators will use to construct 3D head models of participants. The investigators will use these modele to reconstruct the activity of brain sources from EEG signals. The participants will then take part in a series of EEG recording sessions. During the initial &quot;calibration&quot; sessions, the participants will react with real or attempted movements to visual cues. The investigators will use the EEG signals from these sessions to calibrate the text-entry interface used in the validation sessions that follow. During the validation sessions, the participants will control the text-entry interface to write messages using their EEG signals.</description>
