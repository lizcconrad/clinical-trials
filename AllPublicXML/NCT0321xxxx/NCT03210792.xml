  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study for a prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare subjects
      using the CCO (Group-A) with those using the ER-splint (Group-B) before and after the
      intervention.

      The primary outcome was difference in the level of pain based on the visual analogue scale
      (VAS) between before and after intervention in each group during forceful and resting
      respiration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators performed VAS assessments to determine the level of pain in the subjects with
      RFs during resting and forceful respiration. Investigators applied either the CCO rib splint
      or the ER splint to the RF subjects in a randomized order. At 30 minutes after splint
      application, investigators repeated the VAS assessments during resting and forceful
      respiration. Subsequently, additional pain control was provided via intravascular drug
      injection.
