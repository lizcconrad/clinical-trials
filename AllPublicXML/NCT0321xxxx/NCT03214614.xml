  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating
      multiple ascending oral doses of GLPG2451 and the combination of GLPG2451 and GLPG2222 given
      for 14 days in healthy male subjects.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending
      oral doses of GLPG2451 given to healthy male subjects compared to placebo, as well as of
      multiple oral doses of the combination of GLPG2451/GLPG2222 compared to placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive, on the date of signing the Informed
             Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Judged by the investigator to be in good health based upon the results of a medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical safety
             laboratory tests prior to the initial study drug administration. Clinical safety
             laboratory test results must be within the laboratory reference ranges or test results
             that are outside the reference ranges need to be considered non clinically significant
             in the opinion of the investigator. One retest is allowed during screening period, if
             deemed appropriate by the investigator.

          -  Liver function tests must meet the following criteria: a. Aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST), ALT, or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt;1.5x ULN.

             b. Bilirubin not greater than ULN, however documented Gilbert's syndrome is acceptable
             but no more than one subject with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome is allowed per cohort.
             One retest is allowed during screening period, if deemed appropriate by the
             investigator.

             as an individual who has abstained from smoking for at least 1 year prior to
             screening. A non-user is defined as an individual who has abstained from any nicotine
             containing products for at least 1 year prior to the screening.

             cannabis, cocaine, opiates, methadone, and tricyclic antidepressants) and negative
             alcohol breath test.

          -  No evidence of lens opacity on slit lamp examination or similar system (e.g. ITrace

             virus [HIV] infection).

          -  Clinically significant illness in the 3 months before the initial study drug
             administration.

          -  Presence or sequelae of gastrointestinal, liver, kidney (creatinine clearance ≤80
             mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula; if calculated result ≤80 mL/min, a 24-hour
             urine collection to determine actual value can be performed) or other conditions known
             to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has been treated and with no evidence of recurrence).

          -  Active drug or alcohol abuse (more than 3 glasses of wine or beer or equivalent/day)
             within 2 years prior to the initial study drug administration.

          -  Participation in a drug, drug-device combination or biologic investigational research
             study within 12 weeks or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug (whichever is the
