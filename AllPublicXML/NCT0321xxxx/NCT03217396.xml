  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective and retrospective cohort study of about five years will be performed on blood
      and cerebrospinal fluid samples taken for diagnostic reasons from recruited patients within
      the Neuromed Neurology Unit. Subjects with other chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD),
      and healthy subjects subjected to blood sampling and / or lumbar puncture for clinical
      reasons will be recruited As control groups.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples will be subjected to the procedures required for the
      isolation of the different components immediately after the withdrawal. Subsequently, the
      levels of microRNAs, cytokines, chemokines, cell growth factors, neuronal damage markers
      (tau, phosphorylated and truncated tau, neurofilaments) and mitochondrial (lactate) and free
      d-amino acids (Objective 1) will be determined. Furthermore, synaptic alterations will be
      evaluated in the ex vivo chimeric model of MS, using the patch-clamp technique (Objective 2).
      Genotyping studies will be conducted in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) in coding and / or regulating regions of genes (microRNAs or proteins) involved in
      alterations of the synaptic transmission of MS and its murine experimental model (i.e.
      SLC1A3, NGFB, PDGFA, etc.), which correlate with specific clinical parameters (i.e. EDSS,
      BREMS, disease progression index, MS type, disease activity, etc.) and with the levels of
      potential biomarkers identified
