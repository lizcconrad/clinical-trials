  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biotine is proposed by neurologists to patients with a progressive form of Multiple sclerosis
      (MS) in the context of a nominative temporary authorization for use (TAU) as a
      disease-modifying treatment for their MS. A recent study showed that with this treatment,
      more patients experienced an improvement after one year in comparison with patients given a
      placebo.

      The objective of this study is to identify blood biomarkers to determine good responders as
      early as possible. In addition, the blood parameters studied will make it possible to better
      understand the mechanisms of action, that have a beneficial effect on multiple sclerosis.

      The management of patients will not be modified: same number of consultations (at the
      prescription, at 3 months, at 12 months), same clinical examination, and the same number of
      blood samples (at the prescription, at 3 months, and at 12 months).

        25 patients with progressive (primary or secondary) MS will be encountered over time during
        consultations at Dijon CHU. Treatment with biotine will be proposed to patients and a
        nominative TAU will be requested.
