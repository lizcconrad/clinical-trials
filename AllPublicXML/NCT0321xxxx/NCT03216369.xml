  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotid artery stenting(CAS) and endarterectomy(CEA) are both important treatment strategy
      for patients with ICA (internal carotid artery) stenosis. Three dimensional pseudo-continuous
      arterial spin labeling (pCASL) is a noninvasive perfusion imaging modality to detect
      reperfusion for recanalization therapy. And it provides information about absolute CBF (ml
      100 g−1 tissue min−1) at the brain tissue level. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
      the series hemodynamic changes in patients who had conducted CAS or CEA by using 3D
      pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) to explore the potential pattern of CBF
      alternation and thus to improve the prevention strategy for hyperperfusion syndrome.

      Patients:

      Patients with unilateral severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis of stroke eligible
      were enrolled who underwent CAS vs CEA.All patients underwent previous scan in 7 days before
      CAS and CEA and consecutive scan once per 24 hours after CAS and CEA.

      Baseline characteristics of patients were recorded including age,gender, hypertension,
      hypercholesterolemia, diabetes melitus, smoking, obesity, qualifying stroke event.

      Protocols:

      MRI scan protocols T2 weighted image,T1 weighted image,diffusion weighted
      image(DWI),fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR),arterial spin labeling(ASL) with Post
      labeling delay (PLD) of 2.0s,Territory ASL(TASL)(PLD=2.0s),3-dimensional Fast Spoiled
      Gradient Echo(3D-FSPGR).

      Imaging evaluation：

        1. Pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) with post labeling delay (PLD) of 2.0s
           evaluation of cerebral blood flow in target downstream territory.

        2. FLAIR hyperintensity vascular sign.

        3. Collateral pattern assessment by Territorial ASL(TASL) (PLD=2.0s).

      Treatment strategy:

      Patients were randomly treated by CEA(carotid endarterectomy) or CAS(carotid artery
      stenting).

      Follow up:

      Patients were followed up every 24 hours after treatment procedure, and would have a repeat
      MRI scan after 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.
