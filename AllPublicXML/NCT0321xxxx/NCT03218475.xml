  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common form of malignancy world-wide. Surgery,
      chemotherapy and radiation are associated with a high burden of side effects; tumour
      recurrence within the neck continues to be a major cause of treatment failure. To our
      knowledge, this research is the first clinical study in human subjects to utilize magnetic
      resonance guided focused ultrasound to treat cancer of the neck. The goal is to evaluate the
      safety and technical feasibility of this therapy in order to guide future clinical
      applications such as ablation, radiosensitization or drug delivery that could ultimately
      improve clinical outcomes. A total of 10 patients will be treated with MR guided high
      intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).

      This is a single institution, prospective pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility
      of MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment for cancer of the neck in 10
      patients. The procedure will consist of a planning MRI scan and a treatment session where
      real time MRI thermometry is used in conjunction with a focused beam to produce hyperthermia
      (55-90 degrees celsius for 20-30 seconds) within a pre-selected target lesion. All patients
      will be assessed by a physician investigator and clinical research assistant (CRA) on the day
      of treatment (day 0) and days 1, 7, 14, 30 and 90 post MR guided HIFU. In addition, at each
      visit including the treatment date, a Pain and Analgesics Form and an Anticipated Adverse
      Effects Screening Assessment will be completed by the CRA and physician with the patient. If
      specific adverse effects are identified, then the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
      Criteria (NCI CTCAE v4.03) will be used to assign a grade/score to the severity of the
      effect. All patients will undergo a follow-up MRI on day 14 and begin standard palliative
      radiotherapy/chemotherapy beginning no sooner than day 14 after the HIFU treatment.
