        Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Medicare Supplemental Databases is used. The
        Truven Health MarketScan® Research Databases capture person-specific clinical utilization,
        expenditures, and enrollment across inpatient, outpatient, prescription drug, and carve-out
        services. Individuals enrolled in the MarketScan databases are largely representative of
        the United States population in terms of age, sex, and type of health insurance coverage.
        The data come from a selection of large employers, health plans, and government and public
        organizations and contain claims from approximately 100 employers, health plans, and
        government and public organizations representing about 50 million covered lives across all
        age groups. The data elements to be used in the proposed study will include health plan
        enrollment records, participant demographics, inpatient and outpatient medical claims and
        outpatient prescription drug dispensing records.
