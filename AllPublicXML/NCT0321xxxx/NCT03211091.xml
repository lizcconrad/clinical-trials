      PROVE program started in 2015, the registration of stroke continued but followed the WHO
      Stepwise method instead of WHO/MONICA .Patients are followed up for two years. The
      corresponding questionnaire covered the patients' demographic data, medical history upon
      hospital admission, history of comorbidities, medications used prior to the treatment,
      history of drug abuse, heart and brain imaging, history of blood tests and blood diseases,
      hospital treatments received, hospitalization complications, medications prescribed at the
      time of discharge, discharge status and the definite diagnosis of type of stroke according to
      CT or MRI.

      The patients were followed-up over the phone or in person from the 1st, 3rd and 12th months
      to two years. The patients' disabilities were measured using the Barthel Index and the
      Modified Rankin Scale (MRS). The reliability and validity of these two questionnaires have
      already been investigated in Persian. In addition, secondary prevention measures,
      rehabilitation status and the incidence of new cardiovascular events were also examined in
      the follow-up. The stroke registration personnel received an initial training of three
      two-hour sessions and monthly one-hour retraining sessions. They visited the archives of
      various hospitals on a daily basis and registered the data contained in the records
