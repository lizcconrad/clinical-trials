  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) refers to the presence of
      bothersome pelvic pain symptoms without an identifiable cause. Common symptoms of CP/CPPS
      include discomfort in the perineum, suprapubic region, and lower urinary tract symptoms. It
      affects men of all ages without apparent racial predisposition, among which, 36-50 years old
      are the most commonly influenced. Yet, few effective therapies are available for treating
      CP/CPPS.

      Acupuncture may be an effective treatment option for CP/CPPS. However, effects of acupuncture
      on CP/CPPS remain uncertain because of the small sample sizes or other methodological
      limitations.

      The objective of this multi-centre, randomized, sham acupuncture-controlled trial is to
      assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for relieving symptoms of CP/CPPS. The results will
      provide a robust conclusion with a high level of evidence.

    <description>The participants in the acupuncture group will receive treatment that consists of 20 acupuncture sessions over an 8-week (3 sessions in each of the first 4 weeks, and 2 sessions in each of the remaining 4 weeks) period after baseline, each for 30 minutes. Hwato brand disposable acupuncture needles (size 0.30 × 75mm; size 0.30 × 40mm) will be used. Sanyinjiao (SP6), Zhongliao (BL33), Shenshu (BL23), and Huiyang (BL35), were selected as acupoints protocol. SP6 is on the tibial aspect of the leg, posterior to the medial border of the tibia, 3 cun superior to the prominence of the medial malleolus; BL32 is in the sacral region, in the second posterior sacral foramen; BL33 is in the third posterior sacral foramen; BL35 is in the buttock region, 0.5 cun lateral to the extremity of the coccyx.</description>

    <description>The participants in the sham acupuncture group will receive shallow needling at bilateral sham BL23, BL33, BL35 and SP6. The protocol includes the same duration and frequency of sessions as for the acupuncture treatment, but the treatment was delivered superficially at non-acupuncture points 10-15 mm to the lateral of corresponding acupuncture and not above a meridian line (15mm to BL23, BL33 and BL35; 10mm to SP6). The Hwato brand disposable acupuncture needles (size 0.30 × 25mm) will be inserted with a depth of 2-3 mm without any manipulation.</description>
