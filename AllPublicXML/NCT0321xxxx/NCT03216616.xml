  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is common and debilitating in rheumatic inflammatory diseases as for other chronical
      medical conditions. The purpose of this study is to develope and evaluate a cognitive
      behavioural intervention targeting fatigue. The aim of the intervention is to improve fatigue
      self-management by changing behavioral and cognitive factors contributing to perceived
      fatigue. Levels of fatigue, depressive symptoms and self esteem will be measured before,
      after and three months after the intervention.
