  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The medical treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases has improved
      dramatically during the last decades primarily due to the introduction of biological disease
      modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). However, bDMARD treatment failure occurs in 30-40%
      of patients due to lack of effectiveness or side effects. The tools to predict treatment
      outcomes in the individual patient are currently limited. The objective of the present study
      is to identify diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, which can be used to 1)
      diagnose inflammatory rheumatic diseases early in the disease course with high specificity
      and sensitivity, 2) improve prognostication or 3) predict treatment effectiveness and
      tolerability for the individual patient.

      Methods and analysis: Observational and translational open cohort study with prospective
      collection of clinical data and biological materials in patients with inflammatory rheumatic
      diseases treated in routine care. Patients contribute one cross-sectional blood sample (i.e.
      whole blood, serum, EDTA-plasma and -buffy coat, and blood in PAXgene RNA tubes) and/or are
      enrolled for longitudinal follow-up upon start of new DMARD (blood sampling after
      0/3/6/12/24/36/48/60 months' treatment). Demographics, disease characteristics, comorbidities
      and lifestyle factors are registered at inclusion; DMARD treatment and outcomes are collected
      repeatedly during follow-up. Currently (June 2017) &gt;5,000 samples from ≈3,000 patients have
      been collected. Data will be analysed using appropriate statistical analyses.

      Ethics and dissemination: The protocol is approved by the Danish Ethics Committee and The
      Danish Data Protection Agency. All participants give written informed consent. Biomarkers
      will be evaluated and published according to REMARK, STROBE and STARD guidelines. Results
      will be published in peer-reviewed medical journals and presented at international
      conferences.
