          4. Considered generally healthy upon completion of medical history, full physical
             examination, vital signs, laboratory parameters (including thyroid function and
             serological tests, hematology, urinalysis, and biochemistry), 12-lead ECG, and
             abdominal ultrasound, as judged by the Investigator.

          5. Agrees to use a highly effective method of contraception, i.e. condom and suitable
             contraception for his female partner e.g. oral contraceptive or intrauterine

             or practice sexual abstinence throughout the study period and for 30 days following
             final dose of study drug, and must agree to refrain from sperm donation from Day -2
             until at least 30 days following final dose of study drug.

          6. Negative drug screen (including alcohol) at screening and on admission to clinical
             site.

          7. Able to understand the study procedures and the risks involved and must be willing to
             provide a written informed consent before any study-related activity.

             Investigator and the Sponsor:

        1) Prescription medication within 2 weeks of Day 1. 2) Over-the-counter medication within 1
        week of Day 1. 3) Use of any over the-counter, nutraceuticals, or prescription medications
        that might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of SHR4640
        (proton-pump inhibitor, fluconazole, indomethacin, ranitidine, flurbiprofen, probenecid,
        aprepitant, etc.) within 1 month of Day 1.

        18. Received the last dose of a study drug (or treatment with a medical device) within 30
        days or 5 T1/2 (whichever is longer) of the study drug of Day 1 or are currently
        participating in another study of a study drug (or medical device).

        19. Any other medical or psychological condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator,
