  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double blind comparative study examining the effectiveness of the rTMS
      treatment on Freezing of Gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The
      investigators hypothesize that treatment with rTMS on supplemental motor area will improve
      gait quality and decrease the frequency of FOG in PD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with Parkinson's
      disease (PD), characterized by sudden and brief episodes of inability to produce effective
      forward stepping. FOG is a major risk factor for falls, and greatly contributes to reduced
      mobility and quality of daily life. Treatment of FOG has been perceived as a very challenging
      task. Although various treatment approaches exist, including pharmacological and surgical
      options, evidence is inconclusive for many approaches and no clear treatment protocols are
      available until now.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a noninvasive neural modulation
      technique, has been closely applied as a treatment for various neurologic and psychiatric
      disorders. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that rTMS could improve motor symptoms for PD
      patients with a moderate effect size. To date, however, only few rTMS studies have focused on
      its efficacy on FOG in patients with parkinsonism, and most of them targeted the primary
      motor cortex or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Even though some evidence indicates the
      involvement of the SMA in FOG, no report has described the SMA rTMS in PD patients with FOG.

      Moreover, few studies combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and rTMS to
      unravel the mechanism of its beneficial effects. To address these issues, the investigators
      conducted a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study to explore the efficiency of
      SMA-rTMS on FOG in PD patients.
