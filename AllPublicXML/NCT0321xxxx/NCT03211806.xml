  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to develop and test a technology-supported intervention to
      reduce sedentary behavior before and after cancer surgery. Surgical oncology patients are at
      elevated risk for postoperative complications and readmissions. Sedentary behavior increases
      markedly after surgery and hospitalization, and reducing sedentary behavior around the time
      of cancer surgery could reduce risk while also empowering cancer patients to take a more
      active role in their recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal or peritoneal cancer patients scheduled for surgical resection (n=60) will be
      randomized to either the sedentary behavior intervention or monitoring only. The intervention
      will use a Bluetooth-enabled activity monitor to detect prolonged sedentary bouts, which will
      prompt a message delivered via smartphone suggesting that patients walk. The intervention
      will begin at least two weeks prior to scheduled surgery and will continue through the first
      30 days at home following hospital discharge. Outcomes will include objective activity and
      sedentary behavior, patient-reported symptoms and quality of life using standardized
      instruments, inflammatory biomarkers, and morbidity and hospital readmission 30-days after
      index discharge.
