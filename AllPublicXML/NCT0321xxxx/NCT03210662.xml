  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of external beam
      radiation therapy (EBRT) and pembrolizumab can help control relapsed (has come back) and
      refractory (has not responded to treatment) non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). The safety of this
      combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially approved for
      many types of cancer, including classical Hodgkin Lymphoma. EBRT will be performed using FDA
      approved and commercially available methods. The combination of EBRT with Pembrolizumab to
      treat NHL is investigational.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drug and radiation therapy combination are
      designed to work.

      Up to 70 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration and EBRT:

      If you are found to be eligible for this study, you will have a CT scan while lying still on
      your back. This is called a &quot;CT simulation.&quot; You will not be injected with a contrast agent
      (part of the normal CT process) during the CT simulation. After you complete the CT
      simulation, your radiation oncologist will need about 1 week for radiation therapy planning
      before you begin your radiation therapy treatment.

      You will receive EBRT 1 time each day for a total of either 12 or 22 treatments, depending on
      the type of NHL you have.

      EBRT is considered part of your standard care. You will be given a separate consent form
      which will discuss this procedure and its risks in greater detail.

      Starting the day after you begin EBRT, you will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 1
      hour, every 21 days for up to 35 doses.

      Study Visits:

      Each cycle of pembrolizumab treatment is 21 days.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2-16:

      °°You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Every 2 cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on), part of this blood sample will also be used
           to check your thyroid function.

        -  Every 4 cycles (Cycles 2, 6, 10, and so on), part of this blood sample will also be used
           to check the status of your immune system.

        -  During Cycle 4 only, you will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  During Cycle 5 only, urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  During Cycle 8 only, you will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      At any time, if your doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a bone marrow biopsy and
      aspirate and/or a CT or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may take pembrolizumab for up to 35 doses, which may take about 2 years. You will no
      longer be able to receive the drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects
      occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed follow-up.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After you stop receiving the study drug(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of
           the disease.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after your End-of-Treatment visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, thyroid function testing,
           and immune system testing.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months after that until you start a new therapy,
      the disease gets worse, or the study ends:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, thyroid function testing,
           and immune system testing.

        -  You will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         18. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         20. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         21. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
