    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 when
      given together with docetaxel in treating patients with solid tumors with PTEN or PIK3CB
      mutations that have spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery.
      PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 and docetaxel
      may work better in treating patients with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 (AZD8186) when administered in combination with docetaxel in
      patients with PTEN or PIK3CB mutated advanced solid tumors.

      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of AZD8186 when administered in combination with
      docetaxel in patients with PTEN or PIK3CB mutated advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To assess the objective response rate (ORR)
      of AZD8186 when administered in combination with docetaxel in patients with PTEN or PIK3CB
      mutated advanced solid tumors.

      III. To assess the clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks of AZD8186 when administered in
      combination with docetaxel in patients with PTEN or PIK3CB mutated advanced solid tumors.

      IV. To investigate a drug-drug interaction between docetaxel and AZD8186 and correlate drug
      exposure with pharmacodynamics response.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the pattern of co-mutated genes in PTEN or PIK3CB mutated tumors and their
      association with treatment response or resistance.

      II. Describe possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to PI3Kbeta inhibition. III.
      Evaluation of protein expression of the PTEN gene and its association with treatment response
      or resistance.

      IV. Examine isoform-specific AKT inhibition and other downstream target modulation from
      PI3Kbeta inhibition with AZD8186.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186.

      Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and PI3Kbeta inhibitor
      AZD8186 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 5 days each week. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 3
      months.

    <description>Will examine the pattern of co-mutated genes in PTEN or PIK3CB mutated tumors and their association with treatment response or resistance. Associations of pre-treatment pattern of co-mutated genes (grouped by pathway for e.g. mutations affecting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway - binary covariate) and response (CR/PR at 6 weeks; binary covariate defining responders and non responders) will be assessed. These associations will be performed using non parametric methods such as the Mann Whitney U test due to the small targeted sample size of this proposed study.</description>

    <measure>Mechanisms of acquired resistance to PI3Kbeta inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will describe possible mechanisms of acquired resistance to PI3Kbeta inhibition. Sequencing data from pre- and post-treatment specimens of patients that initially responded to PI3Kbeta inhibitor AZD8186 will be compared to identify newly acquired mutations or deoxyribonucleic acid copy number alterations. Given that the number of patients and recurrence rate of specific events will be low, this analyses will be primarily descriptive with graphical representation in order to uncover any trends such as a pathway specific clustering of resistance mutations or second-site mutations or focal amplifications, that might inform potential mechanisms of acquired resistance. Results will be used to generate future hypotheses that will be tested in larger patient samples.</description>
