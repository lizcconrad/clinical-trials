  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project will evaluate a gamified electronic medication administration record
      (eMAR) system simulator as a mechanism to improve students' learning of medication
      administration in simulated clinical education. The gamified eMAR simulator will be evaluated
      using a pragmatic randomized controlled trial design in order to determine the effectiveness
      of the game as a technology-enabled, online learning intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to examine whether the use of a gamified medication
      administration simulator improves nursing students' medication administration safety within
      simulated practice; increases student self-efficacy and knowledge of the medication
      administration process; and, improves motivational and cognitive processing attributes
      related to student learning in a technology-enabled environment. It is hoped that by
      completing this trial, the effectiveness of using an eMAR simulator as an educational tool to
      better prepare nursing students to administer medications using eMAR technology for practice
      will be ascertained.

    <description>Number medication errors generated by nursing students, as assessed by a previously modified researcher-developed rubric that assists observers to quantify the number of medication errors generated during a return-demonstration in clinical simulation (DOI:10.1097/NNE.0000000000000361 / 10.1016/j.ecns.2017.05.016). The quantity of medication errors are codified in six categories: infection control; assessment; verification; scan; administration; documentation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy of eMAR medication administration instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 4-9</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy of eMAR medication process will be assessed through a pre/post survey. The scale is 6 item scale (1=not confident; 7=absolutely confident). The higher the index, the higher an individual's perceived self-efficacy toward eMAR medication administration. Used as a pre/post test, this instrument will measure changes over time related to eMAR medication administration self-efficacy</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Game motivational and cognitive attributes of participants instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Cross-sectional data will be collected using questions modified from the Huang et al. (2011) validated instrument that measures motivational (i.e., attention, relevance, confidence, satisfaction) and cognitive processing of learning in technology-enabled environments (20 questions, Cronbach's alpha = 0.91). This composite outcome is reported through tests of dimensionality, using a canonical correlational analysis, providing standardized coefficients between the instrument's sub-components.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of eMAR medication administration instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 4-9</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge of eMAR medication process will be assessed through a pre/post survey. The scale is 8 item scale (1=not prepared; 7=absolutely prepared). The higher the index, the higher an individual's perceived knowledge toward eMAR medication administration. Used as a pre/post test, this instrument will measure changes over time related to eMAR medication administration knowledge</description>
