  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In China, there's no effective prevention and treatment on preterm birth for pregnant women
      ≥35 years old, so this study is necessary.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the policy of &quot;Two-child&quot; in China, there are more and more women more than 35 years
      old choose to have another baby. It is necessary to find out a way to prevent them who is
      older than 35 from preterm labor. About 1500 pregnant women will be recruited at about
      gestational age of 14 weeks for this study. All of them will be taken samples (i.e. blood,
      hair, cervical secretion ) to be saved before and after delivery. After all data collected,
      the investigators will do analysis of all data and find out strategy and mechanism of preterm
      labor.

    <description>Preterm delivery (PTD) is one of the most common and most serious complications of pregnancy. In China, preterm delivery is defined as delivery after 28 weeks completed but before 37 weeks of gestation. PTD rate varies between 5-18 %. Outcome also varies with the quality of neonatal care. create the highest burden for the society.</description>

    <measure>Social Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>1 years</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome varies with the quality of neonatal care. create the highest burden for the society. A 2006 report from the Institute of Medicine estimated the annual cost of preterm birth in the United States to be $26.2 billion or more than $51,000 per premature infant .</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Morbidity of Chorioamnionitis</measure>
    <time_frame>1 years</time_frame>
    <description>The main hypothesis of the etiology of spontaneous PTD is ascending infection from the lower genital tract up in the sterile uterus invading the decidua, chorioamniotic membranes, amniotic fluid and, in some cases, the fetus. This is responsible for an inflammatory condition that might trigger myometrial contractions, rupture of the membranes and cervical maturation leading to PTD. Investigations have shown that the amount of bacteria present in the amniotic fluid is correlated to the level of intrauterine inflammation. Inflammation is also related to the presence of bacteria in the amniotic fluid and to histological chorioamnionitis.</description>

    <description>the short-term outcomes of the preterm delivery, which will cost money, time and source to beat. The treatment is not satisfactory, but create the highest burden for the society.</description>

    <measure>Cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease, blindness caused by retinopathy, auditory nerve abnormalities, mental retardation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 years</time_frame>
    <description>the long-term outcomes of the preterm delivery. The main areas that are affected are the respiratory function and the neurodevelopment of these babies due to the early arrest in the lung and brain development, respectively. Moreover, the overall general health of this population is affected in the long-term and ongoing follow up studies are required to provide a better understanding in the field.</description>
