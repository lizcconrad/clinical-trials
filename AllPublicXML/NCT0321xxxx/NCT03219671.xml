      A Phase 2 study of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in previously treated classical Kaposi Sarcoma
      (CKS)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single arm, interventional study. All patients will receive IV nivolumab
      3mg/kg every two weeks and ipilimumab 1mg/kg every 6 weeks. Patients will be treated until
      disease progression or intolerable toxicity for a maximal period of two years, with an option
      to re-initiate therapy upon progression in patients with prior documented response to
      investigational therapy (unless treatment was held for progression of disease).
