      In the proposed method of sensing the vital health sign related to CVDs, thermal heat
      transfer performance of the skin will be evaluated using a non-contact based IR temperature
      sensor. The temperature of the skin is significantly dependent upon the heat source as blood
      vessels (veins and capillaries) in the vicinity of the skin. However, there are several
      locations in the human body, where arteries are also at a relatively less depth from the
      outer skin surface (radial or ulnar arteries at the wrist and carotid artery in the neck). If
      it is possible to track the flow of blood from the thermal performance of the skin, then it
      could be useful in predicting various states of the human health related to cardiovascular
      activities.

      Subjects will undergo Existing Procedure EP- Passive Thermography PT for Phase I and Existing
      Procedure EP- Active Thermography ATLIC/ATPC for Phase II, with Duplex Ultrasound being the
      existing procedure that is considered as more reliable in clinical practice. Existing Passive
      Thermography will be used to setup the baseline data for Phase I. The currently
      under-development temperature mapping method (Active Thermography) that involves application
      of cooling (either pulsed or lock-in cooling) over the skin will be utilized for Phase II.

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE In the proposed work, vital health sign related to
           cardiovascular activities will be sensed and quantified with the application of a
           non-invasive and minimal contact based method. In the new technology, an intensive
           investigation will be done to find a method to diagnose coronary diseases, stenosis and
           blockages through thermal heat transfer performance of the skin above the carotid artery
           on the neck of human subjects (as a probable region of measurement) using an IR
           temperature sensor/thermography.

           In the study protocol includes invasive/non-invasive data collection from Common Carotid
           Artery (CCA) through three different techniques: 1. Conventional and widely available
           routine methods (both invasive and non-invasive); 2. Passive thermography (Non-invasive
           and non-contact); 3. Active thermography with cold stimulation (Non-invasive and
           minimally contact). For this purpose 100 human subject (both male and female) with
           normal and stenosis carotid artery will be recruited in the age group of 35-70 years to
           establish the baseline for healthy subjects as well as contrasting the diagnosis for the
           mostly diseased aged subjects. It is well established that skin thermal properties and
           blood vessel size also varies with age which justifies the wide age group selection for
           the study. It is believed that the study will give an invaluable and significant set of
           data for the further development of a diagnosis instrument.

        2. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES In the proposed method of sensing the vital health sign
           related to CVDs, thermal heat transfer performance of the skin will be evaluated using a
           non-contact based IR temperature sensor. The temperature of the skin is significantly
           dependent upon the heat source as blood vessels (veins and capillaries) in the vicinity
           of the skin. However, there are several locations in the human body, where arteries are
           also at a relatively less depth from the outer skin surface (radial or ulnar arteries at
           the wrist and carotid artery in the neck). In any scenario, if it is possible to track
           the flow of blood from the thermal performance of the skin, then it could be useful in
           predicting various states of the human health related to cardiovascular activities.

             -  In the proposed hypothesis, a momentarily higher heat transfer window will be
                created using localized cooling of a small section of the skin over the superficial
                blood vessel (minimally contact) and hence, the warming process will be tracked
                using a non-contact and non-invasive IR temperature sensor. With the formation of
                plaques in the arteries at main aorta, carotid bifurcation or anywhere in the
                vessel, the flow turns into chaotic turbulent kind or in the case of blockage a
                very low or no blood flow, which impacts the heat transfer from the blood flow and
                can be easily detected from the heat transfer over the skin during that momentarily
                higher heaty transfer window.

             -  In order to apply this approach to CVDs diagnosis one of the probable method could
                be scanning temperature change at two locations of the body:

      1. On both carotid artery on left and right of the neck. 2. On both superficial temporal
      artery on the left and right of the forehead. 3. It is expected that skin thermal variation
      at the forearm will always be in a relation to the blood flow in carotid artery for a healthy
      person that could be used as a signature marker for an individual to make comparison.
      Therefore, temperature mapping of the left forearm (upper limb).

      3. STUDY POPULATION 3.1. List the number and nature of subjects to be enrolled. A total of
      100 human subjects in the age group of 35-70 years will be enrolled throughout the study
      duration at National Heart Centre Singapore itself.

      3.2. Criteria for Recruitment and Recruitment Process

      Patients with clinical indication for Duplex Carotid Ultrasound for arterial stenosis
      detection will be identified by the physicians at National Heart Centre Singapore. These
      patients are considered suitable for recruitment if they fully met the inclusion criteria in
      the following sections.

      3.3. Inclusion Criteria

        1. Aged between 35 - 70

        2. Planned for Duplex carotid artery duplex scan

        3. Ability to provide informed consent 3.4. Exclusion Criteria

      1. Known significant stenosis / disease in subclavian artery 2. Known multiple stenoses or
      occlusion in cerebral (carotid / vertebral / intracranial ) circulation

      This study involves 3 different techniques to be tested on 100 human subjects as shown in
      Figure 1. Existing procedure to be used will be readily available Duplex Ultrasound that is
      considered as more reliable in clinical practice. Since the new technology involves
      temperature mapping, existing potential thermography technique (Passive Thermography) will be
      used to setup the baseline data. Other than this, currently under-development temperature
      mapping method (Active Thermography) that involves application of cooling (either pulsed or
      lock-in cooling) over the skin will be utilized. Accordingly, the whole study is divided into
      two parts: phase-1 and phase-2 as shown in Figure 2. By the time, the Active Thermography
      technique will be developed; data collection with the techniques mentioned in phase-1 will be
      completed. By this time, it is expected that the first prototype of the new technique will be
      developed that leads to the start of phase-2.

      Phase-1

      Existing Technology: Duplex Ultrasound exam will be done on all the subjects to divide them
      into two groups as healthy and diseased (Fig. 3)

      Passive Thermography (PT): The study procedures involve taking 2 thermoscans of the following
      parts:

        1. Both carotid artery on left and right of the neck.

        2. Both superficial temporal artery on the left and right of the forehead.

        3. Left forearm (upper limb).

      No relaxation time will be given between any of the two tests. Each thermoscanning of
      individual regions of measurement (ROM) will take around 60 seconds. The complete procedure
      will take around 10-15 minutes of time.

      Phase-2

      Existing Technology: Duplex Ultrasound exam will be done on all the subjects to divide them
      into two groups as healthy and diseased (Fig. 4)

      Active Thermography (AT): For this case, temperature mapping over both carotid arteries will
      be done with the application of maximum cooling (within comfort limit) for 45-60 seconds
      either in pulsed or lock-in manner. While pulsed mode is the continuous application of
      cooling, lock-in cooling will be intermittent. The frequency of application of cooling under
      lock-in cooling method is yet to be decided. However, for both the methods, maximum cooling
      time will remain fixed as 45-60 seconds. The final cooling method to be used is yet to be
      decided. Cooling will be done either through a cooling pad or using a cold air blower. The
      temperature of the cooling fluid in the cooling pad and air for the blower will be maintained
      in the range of 0oC to 5oC (provisionally), respectively. Due to application of cooling, the
      localized skin tissue will cool down and start rewarming to attain equilibrium temperature
      with the ambient as earlier (before application of cooling). A continuous thermoscanning will
      be done from the instance of application of cooling to the reaching of a fixed temperature
      (to be decided) during the rewarming. However, the maximum acquisition time after the removal
      of cooling will be kept fixed to 180 seconds. This procedure will be done 2 times for each
      subject on both carotid arteries. The relaxation time between every procedure will be 10
      minutes. A warming pad or hot air blower will be used after every run of the test so as to
      quickly bring the skin temperature to normal. Temperature of the hot fluid in the warming pad
      or warm air through blower will be kept slightly higher than room temperature but less than
      body core temperature (provisionally in the range of 25oC to 35 oC). The total time for the
      complete procedure would be around 60 min.

      For either of the thermography methods under Phase-1 and Phase-2, action required by the
      subjects are as follows:

        1. Should rest without physical activity in the testing room maintained at 22 ± 0.5 oC for
           15 minutes before the measurement.

        2. Cannot drink alcohol, smoke and take drugs and medicines affecting blood circulation at
           least 12 hours before the examination.

        3. Should not eat and drink especially hot meals and drinks immediately before the
           measurement.

        4. Just 4 hours before the examination, no coffee, tea, soda or other beverages containing
           caffeine.

        5. Must not use creams, lotions, ointments, deodorants, antiperspirants, powders or any
           other skin product.

        6. If it is possible, medicines and interventions affecting the body temperature should not
           be administered during 24 hours before the thermoscan examination. If you are under any
           such drugs, please inform the investigator beforehand.

        7. 24 hours prior to the examination, subjects are to avoid chiropractic care, physical
           therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, saunas, steam baths, hot tubs, magnets, heating
           pads, hot water bottles, analgesic creams or balm.

      No procedure will be placed on the audiotape, film / video, or other electronic medium.

      Taking all the standard clinical procedure care, there is no risk of any adverse condition as
      the whole process of data collection is completely non-invasive and minimally contact (only
      for phase-2 study).

      In this study, Carotid duplex ultrasound data will be collected. These scans are done as per
      usual clinical and investigational protocol in National Heart Centre Singapore. The scan
      images are usually acquired by sonographers, and supervised or verified by physician(s). The
      data is stored in NHCS Cardiology Image and Information Management System. This system is
      meant to be a long-term storage, or at the very least, provide at least 7 years of data
      storage. The nature of the data acquired is part of the clinical assessment of the patient.
      Hence the data will not be destroyed even after completion of the study.

      1. SAFETY MEASUREMENTS

      No reporting on adverse event or serious adverse event is required for this study.
