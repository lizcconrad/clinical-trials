  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess a cognitive dissonance-based eating disorder
      prevention intervention program on its ability to reduce attentional biases in
      body-dissatisfied women.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are some of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders affecting women in
      Westernized cultures, and are associated with a range of medical complications; in severe
      cases, eating disorders can lead to death. Unfortunately, a large proportion of individuals
      with eating disorders do not receive treatment, and of those who do receive treatment, only
      approximately 40-50% of clients are symptom-free at the end of treatment. In addition to
      limited efficacy, existing treatments can be time-consuming and costly. From both public
      health and humanitarian perspectives it is best to prevent eating disorders prior to their
      emergence.

      This study will use a randomized, controlled design to investigate the effects of a cognitive
      dissonance-based intervention on attentional biases for weight words in body-dissatisfied
      women. Cognitive dissonance is thought to occur when there is a discrepancy between one's
      beliefs or attitudes, and behaviour. The experience of dissonance is thought to create
      discomfort, and resultantly individuals change their beliefs to be in line with their
      behaviours. Thus, the core tenet of cognitive dissonance-based interventions is the concept
      of engaging participants in counter-attitudinal behaviours (e.g., speaking out against the
      thin ideal) to enact change through cognitive dissonance. This cognitive dissonance-based
      intervention (The Body Project) targets body dissatisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, and
      eating disorder symptoms.

      Almost all research on the Body Project has assessed its efficacy via self-report, however,
      this study will use an eye-tracker to measure the gaze. Attentional biases are less
      susceptible to self-reporting biases than traditional pencil-and-paper questionnaires and so
      are a more reliable measure of cognitive processing The participants in this study will be
      placed into one of three different conditions: cognitive dissonance (CD), media
      psychoeducation (MP), or waitlist control (WL), and a similar number of women will be
      allocated to the body-satisfied (BS) condition. Both the CD and MP intervention groups will
      consist of two approximately 2-hour sessions scheduled one week apart, as well as a 30-minute
      online follow-up questionnaire 1 month after the second intervention/assessment session.
      Individuals allocated to WL will begin to receive the intervention approximately 5 weeks
      after the CD and MP groups (after their 1 month follow-up survey). The BS group will consist
      of two approximately 35- to 40-minute assessment-only sessions scheduled one week apart.

      All groups of participants will full out several self-report questionnaire as well as
      participate in a brief eye-tracking assessment both before and after their allocated
      intervention group (the BS condition and waitlist control will only complete the
      questionnaires and eye tracking assessment). Participants will sign up for a group time slot,
      and the group time slots will be randomly assigned to be given either the CD, and MP, or the
      WL condition.

      Participants will be recruited through the University of Calgary Department of Psychology
      Research Participation System (RPS) as well as campus community participants recruited
      through campus advertisements. Potential participants will be pre-screened for the presence
      of body dissatisfaction (or body satisfaction for the BS assessment only group).

The assessments consist of self-report questionnaires (which will be scores by a masked assessor), and eye-tracking, which is an objective measure of time spent gazing at various stimuli.</masking_description>

    <description>Participants in the Cognitive Dissonance condition will complete tasks from Becker et al.'s (2005) 2-session adaptation of the Body Project. In the intervention groups, participants will be asked to consider the costs of pursuing the thin ideal in verbal, written, and behavioural exercises. Participants will be asked to assume the role as a body activist, and will be given several opportunities to vocalize opposition to the social forces that drive the thin ideal throughout the sessions.
The first session will involve exercises and discussions about the thin ideal and the costs associated with pursuing it. They will be given a homework assignment to complete at home over the next week. In the following week's session the participants will engage in a role-play exercise, as well as continuing the discussion on the costs of pursuing the thin ideal.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Mediapsychoeducation condition will complete two sessions of tasks as outlined for Becker et al.'s (2005) media psychoeducation group, which includes no cognitive dissonance tasks. The first session will have the participants discuss the thin ideal and the media's influence on it. They will then watch a 35-minute psychoeducational video on the influence that advertisements have on body image and perpetuating the thin ideal. They will be assigned homework to complete at home during the week between the sessions. The second session will include a discussion surrounding the attainability to the thin ideal, and this discussion will also be expanded to include all forms of media. Participants will then be asked to consider and discuss differences between media images and themselves, as well as whether achieving this &quot;ideal&quot; is realistic, and the costs in trying to achieve this thin ideal. They will then watch a 20-minute video on eating disorders.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Body-Satisfied Assessment Only Condition</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Body-satisfied women will be recruited to engage in the assessment portion of the study only (i.e. they will be given NO intervention but are serving as a control in terms of eye-tracking assessment). Body-satisfied women will be assessed to compare their attention to weight words with body-dissatisfied women's attention to weight words. This comparison will be done with an aim of replicating the findings of Tobin (2015), to ensure that for this particular sample, body-dissatisfied women exhibit stronger attentional biases for weight words than body-satisfied women. Attention to weight words in body-satisfied women will be assessed at two time points, one week apart, to ensure there are no spurious changes in attention in body satisfied women.</description>
