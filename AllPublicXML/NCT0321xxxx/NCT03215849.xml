      A random-order cross-over pilot trial of a CE marked device (pacemaker) outside its current
      intended purposes.

      The study will comprise 10 patients. Recruitment of patients will take place from The
      University Hospital of Wales (Cardiff &amp; Vale University Health Board [CVUHB]). All patients
      recruited will have septal flattening during exercise demonstrated using contrast stress
      (exercise) echocardiography.

      All 10 patients will be implanted with a CRT-pacemaker device and will be tested on all three
      of the following settings on separate visits (with a gap of up to 5 days between visits) in
      random order:

      Routine Medical Therapy Routine Medical Therapy + LVP Routine Medical Therapy + BiVP

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical features consistent with heart failure. All patients will have symptoms of
             moderate to severe heart failure with New York Heart Association (NHYA) classification
             III or IV symptoms (for at least 3 months).

          2. LV Ejection Fraction less or equal to 50%, with no evidence of significant valvular
             disease, no hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy, and no evidence of pericardial
             constriction.

          3. A peak Vo2max less than 80% predicted, with respiratory exchange ratio (RER) more than
             1 and a pattern of gas exchange on metabolic exercise testing indicating a cardiac
             cause for limitation.

          4. Additionally all patients will have demonstrated evidence of septal flattening during
             exercise using contrast echocardiography.
