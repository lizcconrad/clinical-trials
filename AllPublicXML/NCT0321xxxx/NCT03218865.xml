      Evaluation of the effect of a vitamin E coated high flux polysulfone dialyzer on the
      inflammatory state of patients' end stage renal disease and its clinical benefits in terms of
      anemia Objectives : To assess the benefits of a vitamin E coated polysulfone membrane on the
      micro-inflammatory state of chronic dialysis patients Prospective multicenter controlled and
      randomized study Number of patients : 120 patients (60 patients per group)

      Coordinator : Pr JP.CRISTOL Montpellier hospital university Rational : The hemodialyzed
      patients are subject to inflammation due to their pathologies and to the technique. The VIE
      dialyzer polysulfon coated to vitamin E has been shown to have a favourable action on
      inflammation and anemia. The investigators want to highlight the influence of vitamine E
      graft using as controlled dialyzer a similar polysulfon from the same manufacturer without
      vitamin E.

      Medical device : ViE High flux dialyzer -&gt; vitamin E coated polysulfone membrane manufactured
      by Asahi Kasei Medical, with CE mark and intended for use in hemodialysis for the patient
      suffering from acute or chronic renal failure Controlled medical device : Leoceed H high flux
      dialyzer : polysulfone membrane manufactured by Asahi Kasei Medical, with CE mark and
      intended for use in hemodialysis for patient suffering from acute or chronic renal failure
      Objectives : To assess the benefits of a vitamin E coated polysulfone membrane on the
      micro-inflammatory state of chronic dialysis patients Primary end point : Evolution of the
      well-known inflammatory marker : High sensibility-CRP Secondary end point : Evolution of the
      following inflammatory markers : IL-6, TNFa, fibrinogen, antibodies anti- LDLox Evolution of
      Hemoglobin and ERI Evolution of Nutritional parameters : albumin and pre albumin Study design
      : Prospective multicenter controlled and randomized protocol study Duration : 12 months
      Number of patients : 120 patients : 60 patients per group 120 patients : 60 patients per
      group Adult ESRD patient, whatever the origin, treated by HD, thrice a week for about 4 hours
      and hemo dynamically well balanced Inclusion criteria : Dialyzed patient on synthetic high
      flux dialyzer for 3 months Patient with a vascular access allowing a blood flow rate ≥ 250
      ml/min Patient with micro inflammation, i.e an average CRP between 5 and 20 mg/L on the two
      last check-up of CRP Patient informed of the study and having signed the inform consent.
      Exclusion criteria : Underage patient Subjects who are pregnant or planning to become
      pregnant during the study Patient with an infection influencing the Hb level

      Patient with an Iron deficiency showed with :

      Transferin saturation &lt; 20 % and/or Ferritin &lt; 100 µg/L, Hemo transfusion in the last two
      months Patient treated by HF, HDF, biofiltration Patient with infectious risks Subjects who
      participated in a clinical study involving dialyzers in the last two months

      Criteria of exit :

      Patient wish Medical decision Hemo transfusion Departure for another dialysis center
