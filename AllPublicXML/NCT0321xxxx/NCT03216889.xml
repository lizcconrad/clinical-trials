  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI consists of 7 questions, each rated on a 0-4 scale. The range of scores on the ISI is 0-28, with a score of ≥ 10 suggesting clinical insomnia. The lower the score the less severe insomnia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI consists of 9 items within 7 sleep categories. The 7 sleep category scores are summed to form a single global score ranging from 0-21. A global score of &gt;5 reflects poor sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The MFIS assesses the impact of fatigue on daily activities for the month prior. The MFIS consists of 21 items with 3 subscales: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial. The score on the 21 items are scored with a range of 0-84 with a higher score indicating a greater impact of fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The FSS assesses the impact of fatigue on activities for the week prior and consists of 9 questions. The mean of the 9 scores is calculated with a range of 0-7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 7</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29). MSIS-29 is total of 29 items scale, with subscales of physical (20 items) and psychological (9 items). Responses computed in a range from 0-100, and higher scores indicating a worse quality of life due to physical and physiological impacts of MS.</description>
