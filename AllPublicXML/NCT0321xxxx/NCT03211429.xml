  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fear of falling is a major health problem among community-dwelling older adults that may
      contribute to avoidance of activities that they are capable of performing. Studies show that
      the fear of falling may lead to a continual, complex decline in older adults that includes a
      loss of auto efficacy, restriction of physical activities and social participation, physical
      frailty, falls and disability. Apart from these effects, the fear of falling may also have
      financial implications for health care systems and the general public. Several interventions
      have been shown to reduce fear of falling with multifactorial interventions, including
      physical and behavioral components, being most successful. Behavioral components usually
      comprise strategies to reduce catastrophic thinking and fear-related avoidance behaviors
      while physical components usually comprise falls prevention exercise programs. However,
      multifactorial programs are not always feasible or preferred by older people. In this
      framework, the objective of this works is to assess the effects (benefits and effectiveness)
      of three interventions programs (Tai Chi, postural control exercises and behavioral therapy
      intervention) to improve functionality and decrease fear of falling in older people living in
      the community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fear of falling is common among elderly people. Fear of falling can be associated with
      reductions in physical and social activities and negative impacts on quality of life. Several
      interventions have been shown to reduce the fear of falling, but their effectiveness has not
      been compared. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of three
      interventions programs to improve functionality and decrease fear of falling in the Elderly.
      Effective interventions to lessen fear of falling could therefore have significant
      consequences for individuals, their families and healthcare delivery systems.

      Methods/Design: This is a controlled, randomized clinical trial of individual assignment,
      carried out on community living elderly, from Manizales (Colombia) who reporting fear of
      falling with restriction of activities of daily living.

    <description>The program aims to teach participants how to deal with their concerns about falls and related avoidance of activity, in order to increase their physical, social and functional activities. The cognitive behavioural intervention program, provides by psychologists, consists of eight group sessions, 60 minutes each. During each session a main theme is addressed. The themes of the program are: concerns about falls; thoughts about falling; physical exercise; asserting oneself; overcoming personal barriers; safe behaviour; and managing concerns about falls.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the Tai Chi group undertook supervised Tai Chi training in the Yang style of 24 movements, for one hour, once a week for 8 weeks. The first 5 min was allocated for warm-up, with the rest of the time for Tai Chi practice.</description>

    <description>Individually adjusted progressive and specific postural control training, provided by physiotherapists for one hour, one time per week for 8 weeks. The exercise is progressive and specific to functional postural control tasks. It comprises elements that represent activities included in, and required for, independent daily living, such as maintaining balance when sitting, standing and walking; and also reacting to loss of balance.</description>
