  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine within a randomized controlled trial the
      feasibility of a 60-second acceptance based mindfulness exercise for patients with
      musculoskeletal pain versus usual medical care. Feasibility will be evaluated as the number
      of individuals approached who agree to participate and the number of individuals who drop out
      prior to completion of post intervention questionnaires.

      The investigators aim to determine the usefulness and acceptability of the 60-second
      acceptance based mindfulness exercise for patients with musculoskeletal pain as compared to
      usual medical care. Usefulness and acceptability will be assessed with the Client
      Satisfaction Scale-3 (CSQ-3).

      The investigators also aim to determine whether participating in a personalized 60-second
      acceptance based mindfulness exercise (e.g., intervention) is associated with significantly
      more improvement in patients' ratings of state anxiety and pain intensity (co-primary
      outcomes), and to determine if Distress, Anxiety, Depression and Anger (secondary outcomes)
      decrease compared to a brief educational pamphlet (e.g., control).

      The investigators also aim to determine whether any improvements observed will maintain
      within a 3 month follow up.

    <textblock>
      A cognitive behavioral therapy practice called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
      focuses on acceptance rather than control of thoughts, emotions and physical sensations,
      regardless of their quality. The crux of ACT is teaching patients to separate themselves from
      their thoughts (e.g., cognitive defusion) and thus decrease the importance placed on them.
      ACT has been successful in treating psychological disorders and emotional disturbances alone
      or when associated with physical illnesses, those that cause pain in particular. While ACT is
      effective, it may not be feasible for busy orthopedic practices. However, simple exercises
      that teach patients to deemphasize the importance they place on thoughts might be feasible in
      orthopedic settings where patients present with pain and strong emotions. An ACT exercise,
      delivered before the orthopedic appointment, has the potential to set the tone for a more
      positive experience for both patient and provider, by lowering a patient's pain intensity,
      state anxiety (e.g., anxiety symptoms in the present moment) as measured comprehensively by
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire, distress, depression, anger, and anxiety,
      all four measured by 1 item emotional thermometers (visual scales used to rate different
      emotions). This exercise might help patients see ACT exercises as a helpful part of their
      recovery. Some might be motivated to learn more and to continue using them at home. This
      could improve their recovery from and adjustment to the medical condition.
