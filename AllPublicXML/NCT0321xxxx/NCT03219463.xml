  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our graduate student research study is to observe the effects of ginger on
      hsCRP, IL-6, and TNF-α levels in exercising individuals based on their level of activity.

  <detailed_description>

      Participants will fill out a demographic questionnaire and a quality of life survey, (SF-36).
      Take a 3g supplement of ginger in powder form with meals once/day (preferably in the morning)
      for 8 weeks. By end of week 4 (halfway through the study), subjects will do another blood
      test for mid-intervention CRP, IL-6, and TNF-α values. By end of week 8, participants will do
      a final blood test for CRP values and fill out the SF-36 survey for post-intervention levels.

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the 36-item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-36). It was developed by the RAND corporation. The SF-36 is a well accepted and valid survey used to assess overall health measuring 8 different dimensions including physical and social functionality and limitations, mental health, vitality, pain, general health perception, and health change.20 It is a self-administered survey that takes about 10 minutes to complete.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory Bio Markers</measure>
    <time_frame>A composite measurement from :1) at baseline 2) mid point (at 4weeks) and at 3) end of 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Inflammation will be measured using the biomarkers Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α), and C-reactive Protein (CRP) using a venipuncture blood draw. Venous blood will be drawn from the antecubital vein using a standard venipuncture protocol for a total of 8 mL or 0.5 tablespoons of blood.</description>
