  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the bioavailability of a generic product of
      methyldopa with that of a reference product when administered to healthy volunteers under
      fasting condition. The test product is BF-Methyldopa Tablet 250mg (HK Reg. No. HK-62917)
      manufactured by Bright Future Pharmaceuticals Factory O/B Bright Future Pharmaceutical
      Laboratories Limited, and the reference product is Metopa Tab 250mg (HK Reg. No. HK-44620).
      The plasma pharmacokinetic data of Methyldopa obtained from two formulations will be used to
      access the interchangeability of the products.

      It is planned to enroll 16 to 30 healthy subjects, with an aim to obtain at least 12
      evaluable subjects. The study design is a single-dose, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence crossover with a washout period of one to two weeks. During each study session,
      the subjects will be administered a single oral dose of 250mg methyldopa (one BF-Methyldopa
      Tablet 250mg or one Metopa Tab 250mg) after an overnight fast of approximately 10 hours.
      Venous blood samples will be collected at pre-dose (0h) and at 0.75 (45min), 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,
      3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post-dose. The plasma concentrations of methyldopa will
      be determined by a validated assay. The non-compartmental method will be used to analyze the
      plasma concentration-time data and calculate the main pharmacokinetic parameters such as
      Cmax, Tmax, AUC0-last, AUC0-inf, and T1/2. Anylasis of variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on
      logarithmically transformed Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf using the General Linear Model. The
      two one-side tests will be used to calculate the 90% confidence intervals for the mean
      difference in AUC0-last, AUC0-inf and Cmax and to assess the bioequivalence of the two
      products.
