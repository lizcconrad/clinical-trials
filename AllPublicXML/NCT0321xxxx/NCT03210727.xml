    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a single arm design and deliver a new supportive intervention
      entitled, &quot;Ready to Connect, Actively Relax and Exercise (CARE).&quot; The purpose of the study is
      to describe the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of the Ready to CARE
      intervention. Effectiveness outcomes include caregiver self-efficacy, distress, and coping
      style, and patient quality of life, symptom burden, and healthcare utilization.

    <textblock>
      During the first phase of this study, the investigators enrolled caregivers of patients
      undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) into a descriptive study. The
      investigators used quantitative and qualitative measures to describe the caregivers
      self-efficacy, distress, and coping style, and solicit their opinions about how to improve
      our supportive care for caregivers.

      Informed by those data, the investigators now will study the effectiveness of the supportive
      intervention.

      The long-term goal of this research is to develop a pragmatic, replicable intervention that
      supports caregivers and promotes the health and well-being of the caregiver-HSCT patient
      dyad.

    <description>The intervention is built upon a model of caregiver well-being that identifies four domains of quality of life: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. For each domain, there are stressors (i.e., factors that make it hard to be a caregiver) and buffers (i.e., factors that help people be effective caregivers). Our Ready to CARE intervention begins by presenting caregivers with the model in order to generate a profile of personal stressors and buffers. From there, caregivers select from a &quot;menu&quot; of strategies that can be used to minimize stressors and create buffers in their daily life. The investigators will have six 45-minute sessions with the caregivers that will primarily occur while the patient is admitted for stem cell reinfusion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Providing informal, unpaid care for a person who is 18 years of age or older and is
             scheduled to receive an allogeneic or autologous HSCT within the next three months.

          -  The caregiver's loved one (&quot;patient&quot;) undergoing the transplant will be asked to
             enroll in the study to provide data regarding quality of life and symptom burden and
             to allow access of the medical record to ascertain healthcare utilization data.
             (Caregivers will not be excluded from the study if the patient declines to enroll.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Under the age of 18 for either caregiver or patient.
