  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) life support system can provide both cardiac and
      respiratory support to patients with heart and respiratory failure. It can save time for
      these patients to regain organ function or to receive transplantation. Both our team and Ince
      et al. from the Netherland found that the microcirculatory dysfunction is more severe in ECMO
      non-survivors. The next step of research is to find out the key factors that affect
      microcirculation in ECMO patients. Because the blood flow supplied by the venoarterial ECMO
      (VA-ECMO) is directly related to macrocirculation, this study aims to investigate the effect
      of adjustment of VA-ECMO blood flow on microcirculation. We hope that the results of this
      study can help the medical team to improve the quality of ECMO care. After evaluation,
      explanation, and acquisition of agreement, the sublingual microcirculation will be examined
      within 24 h and at 48 h after placement of VA-ECMO. The VA-ECMO blood flow will be recorded,
      and the baseline microcirculation will be examined. After the ECMO technician adjusting the
      ECMO flow, sublingual microcirculation will be examined 2 minutes after each adjustment, and
      the change of ECMO blood flow will be recorded. When the ECMO team plans to weaning off the
      ECMO within 72 h, the sublingual microcirculation will be examined. The VA-ECMO blood flow
      will be reduced by ECMO technician, and sublingual microcirculation will be examined 2
      minutes after each adjustment of the blood flow. The ECMO parameters, medications, and
      clinical data will be recorded, and the prognosis will be followed up on the 28th day.
