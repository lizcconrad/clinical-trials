  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of
      abnormal liver (hepatic) function on the amount of trial drug getting into the body and
      removal of the drug from the body (this is called pharmacokinetics).

      In this trial the participants will receive three subcutaneous (under the skin) injections of
      the trial drug somapacitan. Somapacitan is a long-acting growth hormone analogue (a drug
      similar to human growth hormone) intended for once-weekly subcutaneous administration.

          -  Subjects with normal hepatic function or hepatic impairment (mild or moderate)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant, breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant or is of
             child-bearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method (adequate
             contraceptive measure as required by local regulation or practice) for at least 16
             days after the last trial product administration

          -  Male of reproductive age who or whose partner(s) is not using adequate contraceptive
             methods (adequate contraceptive measures as required by local regulation or practice)
             or male who is not willing to refrain from donating semen for at least 16 days after
             last trial product administration

          -  Any blood draw in excess of 25 mL in the past 30 days, or donation of blood or plasma
             in excess of 400 mL within the 90 days preceding screening

          -  Any disorder, except for conditions associated with hepatic impairment in the group of
             subjects with compromised hepatic function, which in the investigator's opinion might
