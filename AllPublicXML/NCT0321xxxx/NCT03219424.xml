      To evaluate return to work (RTW) status after moderate and major trauma in Hong Kong at one
      year after injury. To derive reliable prediction models for return to work.

      Background:

      Trauma is a leading cause not only of death worldwide but also of disability, and in Hong
      Kong it ranks sixth as a cause of death for all age groups. The implementation of trauma
      systems has improved the survival of injured patients in many settings including Hong Kong.
      However, the aim of trauma care for the injured person is not only to prolong life but also
      to restore patients to the best possible health status, and where applicable, to return to
      work. Survivors of trauma often experience late sequelae that have a major impact on almost
      all aspects of everyday life, and improvements in functional outcome and health status may
      continue for at least five years post-injury.

      Objectives:

        1. to evaluate return to work (RTW) status after moderate and major trauma in Hong Kong at
           one year after injury;

        2. to derive reliable prediction models for RTW.

      Study design:

      This is a multi-centre, prospective long-term follow up cohort study of the 1163 trauma
      patients admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH), Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) and
      Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) in Hong Kong in 2017-2018. Patients will be recruited within four
      weeks of ED attendance as soon as the patient is clinically stable and conscious. The
      follow-up period for return to work status of the 1163 trauma patients will extend from
      baseline to one year after trauma.
