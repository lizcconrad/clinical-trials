  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate and determine the time course and distribution on
      muscle hyperalgesia and muscle pain in a repeated, low dose NGF model. It is hypothesized
      that low dosages i.m injections of NGF are able to induce mechanical hyperalgesia and muscle
      soreness in a same manner (effect of duration) as for dosages previously used in NGF studies.
      Furthermore, it is also speculated if several injections of low dose NGF into the muscle
      combined are able to course immediate pain sensation and spreading of muscle
      hypersensitivity.

      Effects of pain responses, symptom development and pattern (time course and distribution)
      following 5 i.m low dose injections of NGF injected into the tibialis anterior muscle will be
      compared to a high dose i.m injection of NGF injected into the contralateral side in healthy
      pain-free subjects.
