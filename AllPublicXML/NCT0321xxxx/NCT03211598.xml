  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of the Surefire Infusion
      System (SIS) for delivery of Drug Eluting Beads Transcatheter Chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) in
      the HCC population. This study will allow us to determine the effectiveness of SIS for HCC in
      terms of disease response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm pilot study to evaluate the technical feasibility and safety of
      performing DEB-TACE using the investigational delivery device: Surefire Infusion System
      (SIS). Patients presenting with primary liver cancer without evidence of metastatic disease
      or vascular invasion will be considered for the trial. Patients enrolled in the trial will
      undergo 1 or 2 sessions of DEB-TACE delivered through SIS as determined by the performing
      interventional radiologist. Decision for second treatment will be based on the degree of
      disease burden and vascular anatomy demonstrated on the first treatment session. To limit
      potential hepatotoxicity, patients with multifocal disease in a single lobe may be treated
      with a 2nd treatment with the investigational device. Patients with a large lesion being
      supplied by multiple vessels may also undergo a 2nd treatment session based on the
      investigator's judgement. The decision to proceed with a second treatment will be determined
      at the time of the first treatment based on disease burden and vascular anatomy. There will
      be an interval of 2-4 weeks between treatments. All patients undergoing 2nd treatment will
      have a repeat laboratory evaluation with treatment deferred for 2-4 weeks for those not
      meeting initial inclusion criteria. For patients who labs have not normalized at this time
      will not undergo a 2nd treatment.
