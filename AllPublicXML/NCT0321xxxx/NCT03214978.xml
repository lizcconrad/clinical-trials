    <textblock>
      The prevalence of papillary thyroid micro-carcinoma (PTMC) increased rapidly in recent years
      but the design of treatment is controversial because a majority of them are indolent.
      Therefore, to recognize which PTMC is of strong progressive potential which should be
      operated is very crucial. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) pre-surgery could obtain tumor cells
      which could be used in genetic analysis. To date, there is no specific way to evaluate the
      aggressive potential of a PTMC pre-surgery. So, the purpose of this proposal is to screen
      genetic mutations of the aggressive type of PTMC. The candidate did a whole exome sequencing
      on 3-3 pairs of PTCs and found some SNPs and Indels in TP53、TTN、PDF. To further investigate
      those mutations, a target region sequencing will be done in 40 pairs tumor samples. And
      ultimately to find out which genetic event could contribute to strong aggressive potential of
      PTC. The mutations details would be design to test the FNA and tissue sample to validate if
      the genetic testing based on FNA is reliable. The gene test results would be evaluated with
      sonographic features to predict the potential of small thyroid carcinoma before surgery. This
      project won't aim to study the function and mechanism of specific genes but just screen them
      out. So, the fund would cover the fee of the whole study and this study is very likely to
      achieve the goal.
