  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue biotype is a critical factor for success of implant in the esthetic zone .
      Different soft tissue augmentation techniques have been employed to increase soft tissue
      thickness such as: autogenous grafts, allografts, xenografts and living cellular construct
      (LCC). Studies showed that, allografts and xenografts were inferior when compared with
      autogenous graft . However, few studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of soft
      tissue augmentation with platelet rich fibrin in order to overcome the patient morbidity with
      SCTG.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with missing maxillary anterior toot teeth.

          2. Thin gingival biotype.

          3. Adequate inter-arch space for placement of the implant prosthetic part.

          4. Good oral hygiene where gingival index is (0, 1) (Loe and Silness 1963).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with medical condition that is contraindicated with the surgical procedure

          2. Patients receiving treatment that affect the healing ability.

          3. Patients with local pathological defects related to the area of interest.

          4. Smokers or pregnant women.

          5. Patients with parafunctional habits that may jeopardize the implant longevity and
             affect the results of the study.
