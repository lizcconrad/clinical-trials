    <textblock>
      In this study the clinical relevance of the use of commercially available virtual reality
      games in the rehabilitation of balance will be assessed in children with cerebral palsy. It
      will be investigated how different commercially available platforms (i.e. Xbox One + Kinect
      and Nintendo Wii + balance board) will affect the compensations of children with cerebral
      palsy to preserve their balance. The effect of 1 training session will be assessed as well as
      the effect of a long-term training of 8 weeks.
