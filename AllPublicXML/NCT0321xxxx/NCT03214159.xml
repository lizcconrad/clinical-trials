      The study design is an Open-Label Randomized, Single-Dose, 2-way Crossover Bioequivalence
      Study with a washout period of 6 days. During each session, the subjects will be administered
      a single dose of 100mg Ritonavir (one Ritonavir Tablet 100mg or one NORVIR Tablet 100mg)
      under fasting condition.
