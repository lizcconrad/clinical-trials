  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a nonmyeloablative conditioning
      regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in pediatric patients
      with sickle cell disease (SCD) who have a matched related major ABO-incompatible donor. The
      nonmyeloablative regimen will use alemtuzumab, total body irradiation (TBI) and sirolimus for
      immune suppression. This study will expand the access of HSCT for patients with SCD who are
      currently not eligible because of donor restrictions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating chronic blood disorder with multi-system
      end-organ damage that leads to morbidity and early mortality. The only cure for SCD is
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which given the risks with unrelated HSCT, is
      only an option for a minority of patients who have a matched sibling donor.

      In the field of HSCT, blood group ABO incompatibility between donor and recipient is not a
      contraindication and several studies do not show compromised outcomes. However, in the
      context of nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning and major ABO-incompatibility, when the
      recipient has existing antibodies to donor red blood cells, pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) may
      occur.

      This phase II pilot study will enroll SCD patients with a matched related major
      ABO-incompatible donor to determine the safety and efficacy of NMA-HSCT. Biological studies
      will include a plan to study and monitor red cell engraftment in this population to
      facilitate early detection and interventional measures to prevent and treat PRCA.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be ≥ 12 months and &lt; 19 years of age at the time of study enrollment.

             follows:

               -  homozygous Hb S disease (HbSS),

               -  sickle-Hb C disease (HbSC),

               -  sickle beta-plus-thalassemia (HbS/β+), or

          -  Patients must meet standard eligibility criteria to undergo HSCT, including but not
             limited to one or more of the following:

               -  history of repeated (more than 1) bony (vaso-occlusive) crisis

               -  history of stroke

               -  elevated transcranial Doppler velocity not eligible for hydroxyurea, as per
                  TWiTCH trial (ie. severe vasculopathy)

               -  history of acute chest crisis or splenic sequestration crisis
