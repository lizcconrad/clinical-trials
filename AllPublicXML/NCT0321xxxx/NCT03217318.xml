  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After providing informed consent, patients will be randomized into one of two groups
      (single-blinded): Group 1 will receive a standard PercuflexÂ® (Boston scientific) ureteral
      stent. Diameter: 6F, length according to surgeons' estimation. Patients in Group 2 will
      receive a Suture-Stent adjusted to the individual stone location.

      All participant receive standardized patient information, using a validated leaflet on
      ureteral stenting and associated morbidity.

      In both groups, patients will complete the Ureteral Stent Symptoms Questionnaire (USSQ) 1
      week after stent insertion, prior to stent removal (i.e. 2-6 weeks after insertion) and after
      (2-6 weeks) stent removal. USSQ results after stent removal serve as an assessment of
      &quot;baseline symptoms&quot;. During secondary stone removal, stents are removed and ureteral
      dilatation / access is assessed.

      The removed stents will be assessed for biofilm formation within the framework of an approved
      and ongoing study on the development of a Biofilm-model (EKSG 15/084). Potential
      complications and adverse events are assessed at all scheduled and unscheduled patient
      visits.

    <description>In Group 2, a modification of the standard ureteral stent will be inserted. The stent will be cut through obliquely according to the position of the ureteral calculus. The extend to be removed can be easily measured by the retrograde probing catheter and is replaced by a monofilament, non-absorbable suture as described previously by Vogt et al. (W J Urol, 2015). This suture can be easily attached by puncturing the bevelled stent end.</description>
