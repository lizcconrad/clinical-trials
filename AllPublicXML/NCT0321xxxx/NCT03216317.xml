      Objective: analyze the effects of isometric handgrip exercise on arterial pressure and on the
      autonomic cardiac modulation of hypertensive individuals treated in the Unified Health System
      (UHS).

      Intervention: Patients were randomized into Supervised group (SG) and control group (CG). SG
      will perform supervised isometric handgrip exercise for three weekly sessions in four sets
      with two minutes of isometric contraction with 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), In
      CG, individuals will be encouraged to increase their level of physical activity.

      Measurements: Blood pressure, autonomic modulation

      The objective of this study is to analyze the effects of isometric handgrip exercise on
      arterial pressure and on the autonomic cardiac modulation of hypertensive individuals treated
      in the Unified Health System (UHS). Two prospective, randomized, controlled trials will be
      conducted with hypertensive patients in the public health network of Petrolina (PE) and São
      Paulo (SP). Included in the study will be individuals with an age group over 18 years of both
      genders, with systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) controlled with the use of
      antihypertensive medication, non-smokers and without the presence of diabetes or other
      cardiovascular diseases that will be allocated randomly in two groups: supervised group (SG)
      and control group (CG). SG will be instructed to perform supervised isometric handgrip
      exercise for three weekly sessions in four sets with two minutes of isometric contraction
      with 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the subjects and interval between
      two-minute series. In CG, individuals will be encouraged to increase their level of physical
      activity. Prior to initiation and after 12 weeks of intervention, blood pressure, autonomic
      cardiac modulation and level of physical activity will be obtained.

    <description>The subjects will remain for ten minutes in the seated position, following the guidelines of the VII Brazilian Direction of Hypertension. Three consecutive measurements, one minute apart, in the non-dominant arm and with a cuff size suitable for the circumference of the arm will be performed. The value used will be the average of the last two measures, as recommended by the VII Brazilian Arterial Hypertension Guideline.</description>

    <description>The patients will remain 10 minutes lying down, during which the heart rate variability (HRV) intervals will be registered, using a valid heart rate monitor for this function (RS800CX, Polar Electro, Finland). It will be considered a valid signal those with at least five minutes of signal stationary.</description>
