  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if using a type of therapy called repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can help improve chemotherapy-related peripheral
      neuropathy (CIPN). Peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage with possible numbness, pain, and/or
      loss of motor function. Researchers also want to learn if it can improve quality of life and
      mental health.

      rTMS is designed to change brain activity by introducing small magnetic impulses to the scalp
      that encourage the brain to change its activity.

      In this study, rTMS will be compared to sham rTMS. Sham rTMS is not an actual treatment. It
      is designed to look like rTMS, but does not treat any disease or illness. It will be compared
      with rTMS to learn if rTMS has any real effect.

      This is an investigational study. The equipment used in this study is FDA approved and
      commercially available. Using rTMS equipment to treat CIPN is considered investigational. The
      study doctor can explain how the equipment is designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Baseline Tests:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have the following baseline tests:

        -  You will complete 5 questionnaires about your symptoms, how you have been feeling, basic
           information about yourself, and your general quality of life. It should take about 25
           minutes to complete them.

        -  You will have an EEG to measure the electrical activity of your brain. During the EEG,
           researchers will place a cap containing 19 electrodes on your scalp and 1 electrode on
           each earlobe. The electrodes will measure and record your brain wave activity, similar
           to the way a doctor listens to your heartbeat from the surface of your skin. The EEG
           should take about 45 minutes to complete.

      Study Groups:

      After completing the baseline tests, you will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of dice)
      to 1 of 3 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is better, the
      same, or worse than the other group.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 1, you will receive rTMS.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 2, you will receive sham rTMS. If you have any questions
           about how sham rTMS is designed to work, talk with the study doctor or study staff.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 3, you will continue to receive standard care. You will not
           take part in rTMS, but you will take part in the follow-up visits (described below).

      If you are assigned to Groups 1 or 2, you will not be told if you are receiving rTMS or sham
      rTMS.

      Length of Participation:

      Your active participation on this study will be over after your last follow-up visit. You
      will take part in this study up to a month and a half total.

      rTMS Sessions: If you are in Groups 1 or 2, you will have 10 sessions over a 10 business day
      period. The timing of these sessions will be based on your schedule.

      At each rTMS/sham rTMS session, you will also be asked to rate any pain or symptoms you may
      be having on a scale of 0-10 before you begin the session and again after the session is
      complete. This should only take a few minutes.

      During each session, you will sit quietly and relax in a chair while the study staff places
      the rTMS stimulator on your head.

      Each rTMS/sham rTMS session should take about 30 minutes to complete.

      A member of the study staff will be present during each session to make sure you are
      comfortable and that you are relaxed during the procedure. You may stop the session at any
      time if you feel uncomfortable.

      Follow-Up:

      All participants, within 1 week after your last rTMS session (if you had them) and again
      about 1 month later:

        -  You will fill out the same questionnaires you completed at baseline.

        -  You will have an EEG.

      After you have completed the visit 1 month later, you will be told which group you were in
      and offered rTMS if you were in Groups 2 or 3.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with stage I-IV cancers who received oxaliplatin chemotherapy

          2. Understand and read English, sign a written informed consent, and be willing to follow
             protocol requirements

          3. ECOG Performance Status of 0-2

          4. Grade 2 or higher neuropathic symptoms according to the National Cancer Institute's 4
             point grading scale

          5. Neuropathic symptoms must be related to chemotherapy (in the opinion of the treating
             physician)

          6. Patients must have neuropathic symptoms for a minimum of 3 months

          7. No plans to change the type of pain medication (if a patient is on pain medication)

          8. Willing to come to MD Anderson for the therapy sessions

          9. Patients who are 18 years of age or above

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are taking any antipsychotic medications

          2. Patients who have evidence of brain metastases or any with any active central nervous
             system (CNS) disease at their time of entry into the trial

          3. Patients who have ever been diagnosed with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia

          4. Patients who have a history of head injury, focal brain lesions, or known seizure
             activity

          5. Patients who are withdrawing from drugs

          6. Patients with intracranial implants or a cardiac pacemaker or any device that is not
             considered MRI safe. Colorectal patients are sometimes prescribed Tramadol to help
             control the symptoms of CIPN. Tramadol does lower the seizure threshold, however these
             patients will be considered eligible for the study if they discontinue the drug 48
             hours before the baseline and do not use it during the duration of the study.
