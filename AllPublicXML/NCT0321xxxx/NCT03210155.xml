  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The birth of a child is a major life event that can be filled with excitement, anticipation
      and joy. However, the transition and adaptation to new demands, roles, responsibilities, and
      changes in relationships can be stressful, especially for new mothers. In addition, new
      mothers typically encounter physiological changes and struggle with concerns about weight
      gain, body image, sexuality, and other physical difficulties such as fatigue. These problems
      may generate or exacerbate stress, lead to an actual or perceived crisis and psychological
      distress.

      Psychological distress, defined as anxiety, depression, and insomnia, in this study, often
      increases during the postpartum period and can negatively affect maternal mental health
      status, maternal and family relationships, and infant-child health. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the effects of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) on anxiety, insomnia,
      depression, and maternal functioning in first time new mothers following childbirth.

      The birth of a child is a major life event that can be filled with excitement, anticipation
      and joy. However, the transition and adaptation to new demands, roles, responsibilities, and
      changes in relationships can be stressful, especially for first-time mothers. In addition,
      new mothers typically encounter physiological changes and struggle with concerns about weight
      gain, body image, sexuality, and other physical difficulties such as fatigue. These problems
      may generate or exacerbate stress, lead to an actual or perceived crisis and psychological
      distress.

      Psychological distress, defined as depression, anxiety and insomnia, in this study, often
      increases during the postpartum period and can negatively affect maternal mental health
      status, maternal and family functioning, and infant-child outcomes. These conditions commonly
      present as co-morbidities, but are often unrecognized in clinical practice or under-treated
      as co-morbidities in new mothers. This unrecognized cluster of co-morbidities may lead to
      psychological distress and subsequently poor outcomes for mothers, their infants and
      children.

      Current treatment recommendations for depression, anxiety and insomnia are primarily
      pharmaceutical or psychotherapy, both of which have limitations related to cost, time
      involved and ineffectiveness for some women. Consequently, there is a need to examine other
      treatment approaches including complementary modalities, such as cranial electrotherapy
      stimulation (CES), particularly in light of current evidence that shows the efficacy of early
      detection, intervention and treatment for pregnant and postpartum women.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of CES on anxiety in new
      mothers following childbirth. The secondary objectives are to: (1) determine the effects of
      CES on depression and insomnia; (2) explore the effect of CES on maternal functioning in new
      mothers following childbirth, and (3) to examine if items 1 &amp; 2 on the 14 item Hamilton
      Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A14) perform well as a screening test for anxiety. Please see the
      enclosed Instrument Description document for detailed information related to this scale.

    <masking_description>The blocked randomization method will be used to assign participants to active and sham groups. Participants will be assigned to CES treatment or sham CES using a 1:1 ratio. Electromedical Products International, Inc. (EPI) will randomize the assignment of appropriate devices to active or sham groups by using a random list of computer generated numbers (1 for active and 2 for sham) in randomly selected block sizes. The PI and participants are blinded to which participants have Alpha-Stim® CES active or sham devices until data analysis is complete. After the completion of data analysis, blinding will be broken.</masking_description>
