  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to identify neonates who are predisposed to Necrotizing
      Enterocolitis (NEC). the investigators will determine the effectiveness of non-invasive
      measures as well as biochemical markers to identify neonates early in the disease process.
      Thus, the investigators aim to identify infants with NEC prior to the onset of symptoms to
      institute or test treatments in the long term to prevent the progression of the disease in
      these infants.

      The study will enroll premature, low birth weight infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care
      Units (NICU). Potential study subjects will be identified upon delivery, or transfer to the
      NICU, and notification by the neonatology service. Infants born at less than 30 weeks
      gestational age, birth weight less than or equal to 1500 grams will be eligible for
      enrollment in the study. The purpose of the study designed is to compare the splanchnic
      tissue oxygenation index and gut inflammatory biomarkers of patients with any stage of NEC
      with healthy controls. Since we will not be able to determine which patients will develop NEC
      a priori, we will anticipate enrolling up to 450 neonates to identify 15 neonates with NEC.
