    <textblock>
      With the increased incidence of lung cancer and prevalence of low dose CT screening, treating
      of early lung cancer has becoming an important issue in the clinical practice of thoracic
      oncology. In this clinical study, the investigators will evaluate whether superDimension
      (superD) ENB (Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy) in combination with interstitial
      photodynamic therapy can provide the chance of tumor eradication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the one the major cause of cancer death all over the world especially in Asia.
      The prevalence of low dose CT screening has made more patients of lung cancer treated in the
      early stage. The treatment of choice for of early lung cancer is surgical resection. However,
      several difficulties exist in surgery for treating early lung cancer. eg. Some presenting as
      multi-focal lesions, which cannot be completely eradicated by surgical resection.

      Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB)（superDimension™ Navigation System, super-D ENB)
      is a novel technique, which uses an image guided localization system to direct steerable
      bronchoscopic tools to predetermined points within the bronchial tree. This technology allows
      improved access to peripheral lesions in particular.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been adopted an effective treatment option for the central
      located lung cancer by using photosensitizer which is focally retained in the tumor leading
      to tumor-specific abrasion by irradiating with a certain wave-length of light. The most
      frequently used and commercially available photosensitizer for lung cancer is PDT with
      Photofrin under 623 nm red light irradiation. For the peripheral lung cancer which cannot be
      approached by bronchoscopy, interstitial PDT with the aids of CT guided catheter implantation
      has been adopted. However, there are potential disadvantages of such approach including 1)
      bleeding or hemothorax during CT-guided catheter implantation; 2) dislodging of the catheter
      after lung collapse in the procedure; 3) unable to treat other lesion after pneumothorax.

      In the current proposal, the investigators use ENB in combination with PDT to handle to test
      the feasibility of super-D ENB guided-PDT to treat small lung cancer which cannot be
      eradicated through surgical resection.
