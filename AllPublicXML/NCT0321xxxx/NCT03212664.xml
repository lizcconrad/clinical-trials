  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim was to assess whether a one-time physical therapy program for hyperkyphosis
      is effective. Participants received physical therapy exercises and were followed for 6 months
      for pain intensity, quality-of-life, and perceived spinal appearance.

      All participants were instructed in a one-time physical therapy exercise treatment. The
      exercise treatment consisted of five exercises. Participants were instructed to perform each
      exercise for 100 seconds. Participants were instructed to performing these 5 exercises for at
      least 3 days a week for 6 months.

      In addition, each participant was given access to a software application (app) called &quot;Pt
      pal&quot; on their smart phone or tablet. Participants were asked to use the app whenever they
      performed their exercises throughout the 6- month period.
