    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the role of Intraoperative Radiotherapy (IORT) in Ductal
      Carcinoma In-Situ (DCIS) and to improve the understanding of the clinical, radiographic, and
      patient-related impact of adopting IORT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With advances in technology and screening, the overdiagnosis and overtreatment of ductal
      carcinoma in situ (DCIS) have increased. Minimizing treatment toxicity and cost is a high
      priority area of research. Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT)is a form of radiation
      where a single high dose of irradiation is applied to the tumor bed at the time of
      lumpectomy. Its use has not been previously studied in DCIS. Proposed advantages include
      decreased toxicity to adjacent tissue and organs, reduction in healthcare costs, and improved
      quality of life. The investigators hypothesize that IORT is a safe and patient-friendly
      alternative to whole breast irradiation.
