  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral oxygen desaturation during cardiac surgery measured using near infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS) derived cerebral oximetry has been associated with significant postoperative
      morbidity. If significant desaturation occurs during this period, it may represent an ideal
      opportunity to further optimize the postoperative care of these patients.

    <textblock>
      Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (SACP) is a commonly used technique for maintaining
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) during the use of hypothermic cardiac arrest (HCA) for aortic arch
      reconstruction. However, even with an intact Circle of Willis, asymmetric CBF is a common
      occurrence during HCA when SACP is used. The investigators have previously shown that
      ultrasound guided extrinsic compression of the left carotid artery can increase left cerebral
      oxygen saturation, and improved symmetry of CBF; however, this has not been investigated
      formally. In this study, the investigators will firstly formally assess the incidence and
      severity of asymmetrical cerebral flow between the left and right hemispheres in patients
      undergoing aortic arch repair (n=20). CBF will be assessed indirectly through regional
      cerebral oxygen saturation (SrO2) measured via near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral
      oximetry. In addition, a number of clinical outcome parameters (up to 30 days post-op) will
      be evaluated. The investigators expect that significant left-side cerebral hypoperfusion will
      consistently be observed in patients undergoing aortic arch repair using SACP.
