    <textblock>
      Pleth Variability Index (PVI) is a variable that is derived from photoplethysmography (PPG)
      signal. It is used as a surrogate for intravascular volume status intraoperatively. PVI can
      have significant amount of baseline variability which appears to oscillate at a very low
      frequency (5-10 minute cycles). This study aims to investigate the origin of these baseline
      oscillations.

      PVI is derived from the infrared photoplethysmography signal. Intraoperatively during
      mechanical ventilation it reflect fluid responsiveness which is a surrogate endpoint of
      intravascular volume.

      PVI signal appears to have significant baseline variability which can not be explained by
      rapid changes in intravascular fluid volume. The baseline PVI changes also appear to
      oscillate at a very low frequency, much below any previously identified spontaneous vascular
      oscillations.

      The aim of this study is to investigate weather the PVI variability originates from changes
      in the infrared photoplethysmography signal or if they are possibly due to the algorithm
      calculating PVI.

        Neurosurgical and neurointerventional patients will be enrolled as these patients do rarely
        have sudden intravascular volume changes. Neurointerventional patients typically have no
        significant intravascular fluid changes, but do not routinely have intra-arterial
        catheters. Neurosurgical patients have slow, steady fluid shifts due to mannitol
        administration. Since most all of these patients have intra-arterial cannulas, it allows
        arterial waveform data collection which can be compared to the PPG signal.
