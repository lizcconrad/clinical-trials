  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder is one of the most common mental diseases,which increases
      health-care costs and the financial burden to families and societies. Considering its complex
      clinical symptoms and diversity of comorbidity, depressive disorder's
      recognition，diagnosis，and antihistone are based on symptomatology,which is lack of
      multidimensional diagnosis technique based on clinical pathological characteristics,as well
      as lack of individualized therapy strategy based on quantified evaluation. Besides, other
      physical diseases，such as nervous system diseases, cardiovascular diseases，endocrine
      diseases, have the high comorbidity of depressive disorder. However，there is no precise
      diagnosis technique or standardized therapy strategy. With all those taken into
      consideration,our study is aimed to adopt E-mental health and m-Health to explore
      multi-dimensional diagnosis, individualized therapy and management technique based on
      molecular biology,nerve electrophysiology，and neuroimaging technology etc.

      Four parts included in our study:

      Part 1:The research, development and verification of indicators based on biomarkers and
      clinical characteristics to guide the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders

        1. to screen biomarkers, to explore its pathophysiology, and to analyze the correlation
           between clinical subtypes/characteristics and biomarkers.

        2. To differentiate the subtypes of depressive disorder（depression/underload, atypical,
           anxiety/somatization) based on clinical symptoms and clinical assessement.

        3. To establish personalized therapy strategies,and to explore tool kits for diagnosis and
           treatment based on biomarkers and clinical characteristics.

        4. to choose appropriate indicators to monitor therapy and side effect by collecting and
           analyzing blood/imaging/neuropsychological data.

      Part 2: The development,transition and application of hierarchical model diagnostic technique
      for physical diseases combined with depressive disorder.

        1. to recruit patients with physical diseases combined with depressive disorder, and
           explore potential biomarkers.

        2. To chose appropriate therapy strategies based on measurement based care（MBC）, providing
           hierarchical model diagnostic technique for patients.

        3. To weigh therapy efficiency and adverse effect among different medicine therapy groups.

      Part3: The development and application of comprehensive prevention， diagnosis,and
      intervention model of depressive disorder.

        1. To explore and establish online screening and assistant diagnosis system for patients
           with depressive disorder.

        2. research ,development and application of intelligent e-MBC. Part 4: The

    <intervention_model_description>Part 2: all patients before receiving any medicine treatment are divided into four groups which adopt different therapy strategies :treatment with fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, mirtazapine and treatment as usual(TAU).Meanwhile，patients with different subtypes of depressive disorder were randomly assigned to different therapy groups.Each therapy groups contains 50 participants.Therefore, the total sample size is 50*12+200=800.
Part3:To find out efficiency of different kinds of therapy strategies.p=60%, error=5%,a-0.05,the amount of samples nearly is:867,considering the nearly 30% expulsion rate, the final total sample size is 867+260=1127.Therefore,sample size in each group is nearly 376.
Part4:p=60%,error=0.05, a=0.05, exculsion rate=30%,N=867+260=1127.the amount of samples of each group is 1127/3=nearly 400.</intervention_model_description>
