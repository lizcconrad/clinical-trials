    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with glioma,
      cholangiocarcinoma, or solid tumors with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations that have spread to other
      places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Olaparib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall response rates of olaparib in subjects with recurrent/progressive
      IDH1/2-mutant solid tumors, who will be recruited to 3 cohorts: a. glioma, b.
      cholangiocarcinoma, c. other solid malignant tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the distribution of progression free survival (PFS) of olaparib in adults with
      recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant glioma and cholangiocarcinoma.

      II. To estimate the overall survival (OS) in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2- mutant
      glioma and cholangiocarcinoma.

      III. To determine the duration of response in adults with recurrent/progressive IDH1/2-mutant
      glioma, cholangiocarcinoma or other solid malignant tumors.

      IV. To confirm the safety and tolerability of olaparib monotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) signal in
      patients with intracranial glioma and correlate with treatment response prior to beginning
      treatment and after cycles 2, 4 and 8 of therapy and at time of confirmed evidence of
      progression.

      II. To describe 2HG concentration in plasma by mass spectrometry and correlate with treatment
      response, prior to beginning treatment and after cycles 2, 4 and 8 of therapy and at time of
      confirmed evidence of progression.

      III. To describe 2HG levels in tumor biopsies from prior to the beginning of treatment and at
      specific timepoints and correlate with treatment response.

      IV. To evaluate in tumor biopsies and in liquid biopsies performed at baseline and at
      specific timepoints if co-occurring alterations detected via mass cytometry (cyTOF),
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and/or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing can be
      associated with differential levels of 2HG production, treatment response and resistance.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be able to understand the nature of this trial and provide written
             informed consent, prior to any study specific procedures; patients with Impaired
             Decision Making Capacity (IDMC) who have a close caregiver or legally authorized
             representative (LAR) may be considered eligible for this study at the treating
             physician's discretion, provided that the physician is reasonably sure that the
             possible risks and benefits of the study are clear and that the patient will take the
             drug as prescribed

          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with a glioma, cholangiocarcinoma or other solid malignant
             tumor that has progressed despite standard therapy, or for which no effective standard
             therapy exists, with biopsy-confirmed evidence of an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation associated
             with neomorphic activity of the encoded proteins

          -  Patients must be willing to provide archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
             or frozen specimens for central analysis, if available

          -  Patients must have tumors determined to be easily accessible for biopsy and must be
             willing to have serial biopsies (with a third biopsy upon evidence of disease
             progression); tumor biopsies will be performed on the most accessible biopsable site
             of disease; all possible precautions to avoid complications will be taken, including
             discussions in multidisciplinary meetings, if needed; patients affected by glioma will
             not be considered for study biopsies

          -  Patients must be willing to undergo extra blood sampling for correlative studies

          -  If no adequate archival tumor biopsy is available, patients must undergo a new biopsy

          -  Patients with previously identified IDH1/2 mutations from a Clinical Laboratory
             Improvement Act (CLIA) certified laboratory can be enrolled on the trial, but must be
             verified in the central study laboratory

          -  Subjects with extracranial disease must have evaluable disease by Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1); subjects affected by glioma must
             have evaluable disease by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO)
             criteria

          -  For subjects with glioma, specific inclusion criteria are as follows:

               -  The disease should be recurrent or transformed glioma; subjects must not have had
                  prior surgery (biopsy allowed) or radiation therapy within 3 weeks of enrollment

               -  There must be an enhancing component of disease, as evaluated on pre-treatment
                  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

               -  For patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV glioma and
                  progressive disease &lt; 12 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, progression
                  can be defined by the following set of criteria:

                    -  New enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high-dose region
                       or 80% isodose line)

                    -  If there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathologic sampling
                       (e.g., solid tumor areas. i.e., &gt; 70% tumor cell nuclei in areas), high or
                       progressive increase in MIB-1 proliferation index compared with prior
                       biopsy, or evidence for histologic progression or increased anaplasia in
                       tumor);

                    -  Note: Given the difficulty of differentiating true progression from
                       pseudoprogression, clinical decline alone, in the absence of radiographic or
                       histologic confirmation of progression, will not be sufficient for
                       definition of progressive disease in the first 12 weeks after completion of
                       concurrent chemoradiotherapy

               -  For patients with WHO grade III or IV glioma and progressive disease &gt;= 12 weeks
                  after completion of chemoradiotherapy, progression can be defined by the
                  following set of criteria:

                    -  New contrast-enhancing lesion outside of radiation field on decreasing,
                       stable, or increasing doses of corticosteroids

                    -  Increase by &gt;= 25% in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters
                       between the first post-radiotherapy scan, or a subsequent scan with smaller
                       tumor size, and the scan at 12 weeks or later on stable or increasing doses
                       of corticosteroids

                    -  For patients receiving antiangiogenic therapy, significant increase in
                       T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) non-enhancing lesion may also
                       be considered progressive disease; the increased T2/FLAIR must have occurred
                       with the patient on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared
                       with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy and not be a
                       result of comorbid events (e.g., effects of radiation therapy,
                       demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes,
                       or other treatment effects)

                    -  Note: Clinical deterioration alone is not attributable to concurrent
                       medication or comorbid conditions is sufficient to declare progression on
                       current treatment but not for entry onto a clinical trial for recurrence

               -  For patients with WHO grade II glioma progression is defined by any one of the
                  following:

                    -  Development of new lesions or increase of enhancement (radiological evidence
                       of malignant transformation)

                    -  A 25% increase of the T2 or FLAIR non-enhancing lesion on stable or
                       increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best
                       response after initiation of therapy, not attributable to radiation effect
                       or to comorbid events

          -  For subject with extracranial disease, they must have at least one lesion, not

             received these therapies for 30 days or five half-lives of the drug (whichever is
             less) prior to the initiation of study treatment; toxicities from these therapies
             should have recovered to =&lt; grade 1, with the exception of stable chronic grade 2 that

             ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil); the required washout
             period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks

          -  Concomitant use of known strong (e.g. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin,
             rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's wort) or
             moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil); the required washout
             period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3
             weeks for other agents

          -  Persistent toxicities caused by previous cancer therapy; toxicities should have
             recovered to =&lt; grade 1, excluding alopecia and stable chronic grade 2 toxicity that
             is not overlapping with presumed toxicities of olaparib

          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or with features
             suggestive of MDS/AML

          -  Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases; a scan to confirm the absence
             of brain metastases is not required; the patient can receive a stable dose of
             corticosteroids before and during the study if these were started at least 4 weeks
             prior to treatment; patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to have
             received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease for
             28 days; patients with known uncontrolled brain metastases should be excluded from
             this clinical trial

          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment; effects from surgeries
             should have recovered to =&lt; grade 1, with the exception of stable chronic grade 2 that
             is not overlapping with presumed toxicities of olaparib

          -  Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection; examples
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent and would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication

          -  Women who are actively breast feeding

          -  Immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients who are known to be serologically positive
             for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); HIV-positive patients on combination
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the
             product; history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to olaparib

          -  Patients with known active hepatitis (i.e. hepatitis B or C)

          -  Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood
             transplantation (dUCBT)

          -  Whole blood transfusions in the last 120 days prior to entry to the study (packed red
             blood cells and platelet transfusions are acceptable)

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with olaparib
