      The purpose of this study is to test the reliability of using telemedicine so a neurologist
      can remotely identify residents of a long-term care facility who should be referred to a
      neurologist for an in-person spasticity consultation.

      The aim of this study is to improve spasticity (a form of muscle rigidity) diagnosis through
      validation of telemedicine as a tool for spasticity evaluation or referral. This study will
      test the reliability of using telemedicine so a neurologist can remotely identify residents
      of a long-term care facility who should be referred to a neurologist for an in-person
      spasticity consultation. The telemedicine referral tool will be tested for bedside
      implementation in all consenting participants residing in Tennessee State Veteran's Home,
      which is a long-term care facility in Murfreesboro, TN. Each of the 140 residents will
      receive one neurological examination and one physical examination guided by the
      teleneurologist. A medical record review will also be performed.

    <description>A Vanderbilt neurologist will examine all consented residents for spasticity using a telemedicine platform, with the assistance of a nurse at the subject's bedside. The findings of the exam will be recorded by the research coordinator. Agreement on spasticity referral between the Vanderbilt neurologist who performed the teleneurological examination and the neurologist who performed the &quot;gold standard&quot; examination will be determined.</description>

    <measure>Spasticity Diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to three months after consent is obtained</time_frame>
    <description>There is no biomarker for spasticity. Therefore, the diagnosis will be made on physician impression. A neurologist trained in movement disorders will examine each consented patient to determine if they have spasticity. The severity of the subject's spasticity will be documented, including the following measures: presence of fixed contractures and presence of pain on movement.</description>

    <description>The subject will undergo elements of the neurological examination during which the movement disorders neurologist will look specifically for the presence of spasticity. If spasticity is found to be present during the examination, the neurologist will rate the severity of the spasticity in all affected limbs and record whether they would recommend treatment for spasticity, and if so, which treatment(s) they believe would be beneficial for the subject.</description>

    <description>A Vanderbilt neurologist will examine all consented residents using a telemedicine platform, with the assistance of a nurse at the subject's bedside.
