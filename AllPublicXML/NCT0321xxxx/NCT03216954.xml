    <measure>Reinforcing Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>After at least four days of placebo or n-acetylcysteine maintenance</time_frame>
    <description>The reinforcing effects of alcohol will be determined using a self-administration procedure in which subjects choose to take previously sampled doses. Reinforcing effects are measured during maintenance on placebo and n-acetylcysteine.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scales of Alcohol Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>3 sessions over approximately 4 weeks of study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete measures using visual analog scales to report alcohol effects during three sessions while they are admitted to the inpatient unit. These items will ask about alcohol effects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breath Alcohol Level</measure>
    <time_frame>3 sessions over approximately 4 weeks of study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Breath alcohol level will be recorded during three sessions while subjects are admitted to the inpatient unit. Breath alcohol level will be recorded in percent.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>3 sessions over approximately 4 weeks of study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure will be recorded during three sessions while subjects are admitted to the inpatient unit. Systolic blood pressure will be recorded in mmHg</description>
