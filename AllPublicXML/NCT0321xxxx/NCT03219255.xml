  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of RELVAR® 100 ELLIPTA®
      (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Relvar&quot;) in daily clinical practice in subjects with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who are naive to RELVAR. A total of 1000 subjects, from
      approximately 200 medical institutions, will be registered for this study and 332 of them
      will be considered for safety analysis. In the investigation, subject registration and data
      collection will be conducted using an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.
      Post-registration, the investigator will monitor the information regarding the safety and
      efficacy of RELVAR for one year from the start date of treatment with RELVAR. Pneumonia,
      systemic effects caused by corticosteroids and cardiovascular events will be considered as
      the priority investigation matters. At the end of observation period, the investigator will
      enter the obtained information into the EDC system and submit it. RELVAR 100 ELLIPTA is the
      registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) group of companies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and drug related AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>One year from the start of RELVAR treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will collect the information about all AEs (e.g., a disease, symptom, abnormal laboratory value) occurring after the start of RELVAR administration, regardless of whether or not RELVAR is related to an AE. The AEs assessed as 'related' to RELVAR will be handled as adverse drug reactions (ADRs).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with pneumonia, systemic effects caused by corticosteroids and cardiovascular events</measure>
    <time_frame>One year from the start of RELVAR treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pneumonia, systemic effects such as suppression of adrenal cortical function, bone disorders, eye disorders, etc. caused by corticosteroids and cardiovascular events will be considered as priority investigation matter for this investigation and its occurrence will be monitored throughout the study period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy rate based on global efficacy assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>One year from the start of RELVAR treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy rate is the proportion of subjects assessed as &quot;effective.&quot; Efficacy will be globally assessed based on the courses of subjective and clinical symptoms, COPD exacerbation, changes in values for respiratory function tests, change in COPD assessment test (CAT) scores, etc. during the period between the start date of treatment and the end of the observation period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to COPD exacerbation</measure>
    <time_frame>One year from the start of RELVAR treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The COPD exacerbations are episodes, which may refer to an increase in the severity of disease or its sign and symptoms. The presence or absence of exacerbation for one year before and after the start of treatment with RELVAR (or at the time of withdrawal/ termination), presence or absence of hospitalization, treatment with antimicrobial agents and/or systemic steroids and exacerbation not corresponding to the above-mentioned parameters in each exacerbation episode will be determined.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in CAT score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to one year from the start of RELVAR treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is a questionnaire designed to measure the impact of COPD on subject's life and how it changes over time. Investigator will record the information of CAT completed by subjects at the start of treatment with RELVAR, Month 3 and Year 1 or at the time of withdrawal/termination.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to one year from the start of RELVAR treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory function test will be performed by spirometry. Information regarding presence or absence of tests, date of tests, presence or absence of short-acting Beta-2 agonists within four hours before measurement, and FEV1 at the start of treatment with RELVAR, Month 3 and Year 1 or at the time of withdrawal/termination will be collected.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to one year from the start of RELVAR treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory function test will be performed by spirometry. Information regarding presence or absence of tests, date of tests, presence or absence of short-acting Beta-2 agonists within four hours before measurement, and FVC at the start of treatment with RELVAR, Month 3 and Year 1 or at the time of withdrawal/termination will be collected.</description>
