      A study to determine if a three-treatment protocol with the RenewalNail™ plasma treatment
      system over a week will result in mycological cure and/or clear nail growth on the treated
      hallux toe.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical feasibility of DeviceFarm, Inc.'s
      RenewalNail™ system and the treatment protocol that was developed based on extensive
      laboratory testing on human cadaver nails. The Protocol calls for three 45-minute treatments
      performed over a week to achieve mycological cure. Mycological cure will be assessed with two
      consecutive mycological culture tests done over a week following the third treatment. Two
      consecutive negative mycology culture results confirm the elimination of fungus causing
      onychomycosis infection, as recommended by recent FDA guidance. There will be no placebo arm
      in the study. Clear nail growth will be documented and assessed by photography for 5 months
      after treatment.

             disease that might interfere with the study evaluations;

          -  Subjects with established clinical diagnosis of distal subungual onychomycosis;

          -  Subjects with at least one big toe nail involved with 20-75% infection;

          -  Subjects with both positive KOH and culture for onychomycosis dermatophytes in
             screening of nail samples;

          -  Subjects whose infection is confirmed to be caused by T. rubrum or T. mentagrophytes;

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to refrain from employing other (non-study)
             treatments (traditional or alternative) for his or her toenail onychomycosis
             throughout study participation;

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to refrain from the use of nail cosmetics such as
             clear and/or colored nail lacquers during the week of treatment (from Study Visits 1
             through 3);

             treatment. Methods include condoms (male or female), diaphragm or cervical cap with
             spermicide, medically prescribed intrauterine device, oral or systemic hormonal
             contraceptive, surgical sterilization (e.g., hysterectomy or tubal ligation);

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are not currently sexually active must agree to
