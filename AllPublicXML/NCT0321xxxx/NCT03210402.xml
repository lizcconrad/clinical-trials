      New therapy tested in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) patients with
      approved indications for pacing to determine if elevated pacing therapy is tolerated and

    <description>Participant's Ability to Tolerate Night Heart Pacing. The outcome of interest is the proportion of subjects who remain in the study. Study exit reasons will include intolerable symptoms, increase in NT-proBNP levels, decrease in LVEF or increase in troponin. The proportion of subjects remaining in study will be calculated along with the lower bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval.</description>
