    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of administering the
      medication capecitabine along with temozolomide when you start your monthly regimen of oral
      temozolomide for the treatment of your newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

      Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy that is given to patients with other types of cancer.
      The study will evaluate whether the dosage of 1500 mg/m2 of capecitabine is tolerable after
      radiation, when taken along with temozolomide. It will also try to determine if the
      medication capecitabine helps patients respond to treatment for a longer period of time
      compared to just temozolomide alone, which is the standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There were an estimated 22,000 new cases of brain cancers in 2015 in the United States, and
      15,000 deaths (Howlader et al., 2014). Glioblastoma (WHO IV), and Anaplastic Astrocytoma (WHO
      III), are the most common brain cancers, respectively, representing over 70% of all malignant
      gliomas (ABTA, 2015).

      Though rare, there is no cure, and the prognosis for these tumors is poor. Survival at 5
      years for all CNS cancers is approximately 33.3 % (Howlader et al., 2014). For GBM, the most
      lethal of the tumors, with the current standard of care median survival is 14.6 months
      (Walid, 2008). Relative survival with GBM at five years is approximately only 5% (Ostrom et
      al. CBTRUS 2014).

      For newly diagnosed tumors, the current standard of care recommends a multi-modal approach
      with surgery to remove the tumor, when possible, followed by 6 weeks of radiation and a
      concurrent daily dose of temozolomide (Stupp et al. 2005). This is known as the Stupp
      protocol (Stupp et al. 2005). Patients then have a one-month rest period with no treatment,
      followed by &quot;maintenance&quot; temozolomide, given five days out of every 28 days, for a minimum
      of six months. Some providers keep patients on temozolomide beyond 6 months, or until disease
      progression.

      Therefore, more therapies are needed to help improve survival, reduce time to recurrence and
      improve quality of life for these patients. This trial proposes to improve the current
      standard of care by enhancing the efficacy of an active drug temozolomide, currently used for
      treatment of GBM.
