  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The finding of isolated hepatitis B core antibody (isolated HBc) in absent of recent active
      hepatitis could cause by several scenarios, including false positive, remote infection
      without viremia, and occult infection with low viremia. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine
      booster could be a great prevention strategy for those who do not have HBV viremia. There is
      no standard consensus for management of this issue especially among HIV infected population.
      In addition, prior studies revealed that HIV-infected individuals had lower immunologic
      response to HBV vaccine than general population. This study intends to compare the immune
      response and safety of 4- versus 3-standard dose of hepatitis B virus vaccination in
      HIV-infected adults who has isolated HBc. The immunologic response will be evaluated after
      the participants receive vaccination.

      -  A randomized controlled trial to evaluate differences in immunogenicity and safety of
           the two hepatitis B vaccination regimens, including the percentage of responders,
           high-level responders, anamnestic response, geometric mean titers of anti-HBs antibody,
           adverse events and predictive factors associated with vaccine responsiveness

        -  After participant enrollment, data on baseline characteristics, time since HIV
           diagnosis, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, antiretroviral treatment regimen and duration
           will be collected, then the participants will be randomized into 2 groups to receive
           either 3- or 4-standard doses (20 mcg per dose) of HBV vaccination, and follow-up blood
           test for anti-HBs titers at multiple pre-specified time points to evaluate outcomes
