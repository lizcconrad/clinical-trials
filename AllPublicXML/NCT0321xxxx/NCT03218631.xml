  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of a single dose of approximately
      0.1 mg/kg of a medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil oxandrolone solution vs. tablets in a
      small cohort of healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of this study will provide data regarding the relative bioavailability of a novel
      preparation of oxandrolone in MCT oil, which will allow dosing in neonates and small infants.
      This pilot study will provide information to design a larger multicenter study of neonates
      undergoing surgery for complex congenital heart disease.

    <measure>Safety will be assessed by recording adverse events and assessment of hepatic function at baseline and one week following oxandrolone dosing.</measure>
    <time_frame>Liver function will be assessed by measuring serum transaminase levels at baseline and 1 week after each oxandrolone dose in the study participants, and any adverse events throughout the study period and up to 1 week after final dosing will be recorded.</time_frame>
    <description>The risks associated with the 2 doses of oxandrolone given during the course of this study are minimal. Known adverse effects of anabolic steroids, including hepatic dysfunction and virilization, are typically associated with longer-term use (months of daily dosing) and are very unlikely to occur in this study.</description>
