  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether continuous infusion of beta-lactam
      antibiotics or intermittent infusion or beta-lactam antibiotics, offers more health
      advantages to patients or if there is no difference.

      The investigators will be looking to see whether patients receiving beta-lactams via one
      administration method or the other have a better chance of recovering from their illness.
      They will also be looking at long term outcomes such as quality-of-life and healthcare
      resource use.

      Sepsis is caused by toxic substances (toxins) from bacteria and other organism entering the
      bloodstream from a site of infection. In some people, the infection can progress to sepsis
      and septic shock where the functions of organs in the body are affected. Patients suffering
      from sepsis and septic shock are commonly managed in the intensive care unit (ICU) where they
      are prescribed antibiotics as standard therapy, as well as other therapies to support the
      functions of the body.

      Beta-lactam antibiotics are a group of antibiotics commonly used to treat infection in
      patients with sepsis and septic shock.

      Currently, beta-lactam antibiotics are most commonly given to patients be intermittent
      infusions, that is, given at regular intervals throughout 24 hours. New research suggests
      that giving beta-lactam antibiotics as a continuous infusion may mean that antibiotic
      concentrations in the blood remain more consistent and may be more effective at killing
      bacteria.

      However, the benefit to the patient by giving beta-lactams via continuous infusion has not
      been tested in a high-quality, large clinical trial.

      Aim To conduct a multicentre randomised, controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether
      continuous infusion of a beta-lactam antibiotic (piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem)
      results in decreased all cause Day 90 mortality compared with intermittent beta-lactam
      antibiotic infusion in critically ill patients with sepsis.

      Hypothesis The BLING III Study will test the hypothesis that patients managed in the ICU with
      sepsis, the administration of beta-lactam antibiotics via continuous infusion decreases Day
      90 mortality compared with intermittent infusion Design This BLING III study is a
      prospective, multicentre, open, phase III, RCT. Participants commenced on one of two
      beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem) will be randomised to receive
      the beta-lactam antibiotic via either continuous infusion or intermittent infusion over 30
      minutes for the treatment course while in the ICU for up to 90 days after randomisation. For
      participants where the beta-lactam antibiotic is subsequently changed from
      piperacillin-tazobactam to meropenem or vice versa for ongoing treatment of the infectious
      episode, the new prescription will continue to be administered in the allocated method
      (continuous infusion or intermittent infusion over 30 minutes).

      Permuted block randomisation with variable block sizes and stratified by site will be
      conducted via a password-protected, secure web-based interface.

      The primary endpoint for this trial will be death from all causes at 90 days.

      7,000 patients will be enrolled into this study from approximately 70 ICUs worldwide, with
      approximately 35 ICUs in Australian and New Zealand hospitals.

      For eligible patients, the administration method of beta-lactam antibiotic, either
      piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem, will be randomised to either continuous infusion or
      intermittent infusion over 30 minutes. The choice of beta-lactam antibiotic and the dose and
      dosing interval (i.e. the dose the patient will receive in 24 hours) will be determined by
      the treating physician prior to randomisation.

      For all patients, data will be collected at baseline and daily whilst in the ICU. Patients
      will be followed up to day 14, regardless of location in the hospital, to determine test of
      cure and to identify new acquisition, colonisation or infection with an multi-resistant
      organism. Additional follow up will occur at 90 days post randomisation.

    <description>Clinical cure will be defined as the completion of the beta-lactam antibiotic treatment course (on or prior to Day 14) without recommencement of antibiotic therapy within 48 hours of cessation.
Participants discharged from hospital within 14 days following randomisation will be considered to meet the definition of clinical cure. Participants who decease while receiving the antibiotic treatment course or where antibiotic therapy is ceased in the setting of death being deemed imminent and inevitable, will be assessed as not meeting the criteria for clinical cure.</description>

    <description>A cost-effectiveness analysis at Day 90 following randomisation will be conducted as a nested cohort in Australian sites. Cost data will be derived from health care utilisation to Day 90, estimated through standard per diem ICU and hospital costs. The analysis will be conducted from a health care payer perspective, comparing health care utilisation costs and quality-adjusted life years gained (measured by the EQ-5D-5L) between treatment arms. Where feasible, the cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted in other country-specific regions. and quality of life between treatment arms.</description>
