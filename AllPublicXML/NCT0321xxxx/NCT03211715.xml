  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In contemporary era of rectal cancer treatment, development of surgical technique and tool,
      adaptation of chemoradiation therapy, as well as multidisciplinary approach have led
      increased survival as well as rate of sphincter preservation. However, poor anorectal
      function, such as fecal incontinence and/or urgency, has also been increased. Such anorectal
      dysfunction is named as low anterior resection syndrome, and its rate has been reported in 40
      to 90% in rectal cancer patients who received sphincter preserving surgery. Low anterior
      resection syndrome is known to debilitate quality of life in survivors of rectal cancer.
      Previously, several studies attempted to evaluate the low anterior resection syndrome via
      questionnaires and scoring system. Adapting the low anterior resection syndrome score system
      created in Denmark, this study investigates the validity of the scoring system in Korean
      language.

      In this study, the low anterior resection syndrome score questionnaire proposed by Therese
      Juul is translated to Korean language by 3 different professional translators. Patients who
      received sphincter saving surgery to treat rectal cancer will be asked to fill up the
      questionnaire. Compiling the results, the quality of life after sphincter preserving surgery
      will be investigated in the association with the low anterior resection syndrome.
