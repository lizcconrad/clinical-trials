  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endurance performance during high intensive exercises is mainly determined by the capacity of
      the aerobic metabolism. It generally induces muscle fatigue defined as the reversible decline
      in skeletal muscle contractile performance. Fatigue is multifactorial and is often associated
      with many physiological parameters including reduced neural input and disruptive metabolic
      changes in skeletal muscles such as lactic acidosis and the production of oxidative free
      radicals. Moreover, it could lead to oxidative stress as a result of an imbalance between
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and intrinsic antioxidant defense.

      To alleviate oxidative stress, some ergogenic strategies have been tested. Numerous studies
      have reported that different types of supplementation such as selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C
      or polyphenols were of interest to protect against these mechanisms. Indeed, although some
      studies demonstrated no or harmful effects, most studies observed positive effects of
      antioxidants on oxidative stress or performance. More particularly, polyphenols, have great
      antioxidant capabilities and protective effects and it increases the synthesis and
      bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO)which is well known to be the most important mediator of
      vasodilation. To date, most of the studies exploring the effects of polyphenols on exercise
      investigated several days or weeks of supplementations on vascular, blood parameters (blood
      pressure, NO concentration, oxidative stress markers) or endurance performance. Conflicting
      results are often obtained. Only few studies investigated the effects of a single intake on
      immediate performance and recovery capacity. Therefore, the present work aimed to study the
      effects of an acute intake of a specific profile polyphenols from grape and apple on physical
      performances. More specifically, performance, in the present study, referred to high
      intensity cycling exercise until exhaustion revealing the capacity to maintain a constant
      strong effort hereafter named endurance. The hypothesis was that an acute of polyphenols
      would increase the time to exhaustion during a high intensity cycling exercise.

    <description>Vinitrox™ (Nexira - France) is a combination of specific profile polyphenols from grape and apple. The main polyphenol classes are proanthocyanidins (as catechins, B2 dimer), phenolic acids (as chlorogenic acids, gallic acids) and anthocyanins (as malvidin-3-glucoside). It was administrated the night and the morning before the endurance test (oral administration)</description>
