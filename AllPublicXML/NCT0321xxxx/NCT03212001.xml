  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the overall impact of Telehomecare on COPD and HF
      patients and system level outcomes using a comparison group of patients that did not
      participate in the program (for up to 18 months). This evaluation study will explore costs,
      participants' experiences, perceptions, and patterns of use related to Telehomecare. The
      study will include eight Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) across Ontario, Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The key question to answer is how different models of Telehomecare enabled self-management
      impacts patient outcomes, experiences and system costs across Ontario. The evaluation study
      will also attempt to answer questions on who is benefitting the most from the program and the
      quantifiable benefits a patient would experience from participating.

      The intervention evaluation study will use a mixed-methods design comprising of four
      components (sub-studies), using both qualitative and quantitative research methods: (1)
      Comparative Effectiveness Study that evaluates patient-level clinical outcomes (e.g.
      hospitalization, ED visits) using administrative data in comparison with usual care; (2)
      Economic Evaluation Study that will evaluate costs associated with the program and patient
      level outcomes as well as cost-effectiveness of the program in comparison with 'usual care';
      (3) Evaluation study of Telehomecare use that will evaluate the patterns of program use and
      perceived quality of life, disease management, satisfaction and caregiver strain; and (4)
      Adoption study that will use ethnographic fieldwork, semi-structured interviews (during and
      after program participation) and review of documentary sources to gain understanding of
      program adoption.
