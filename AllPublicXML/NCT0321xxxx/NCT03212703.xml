  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of a mindfulness-based skills training
      program for parents of children with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The investigators
      will explore if parents involved in this group experience any change in their levels of
      stress, feelings of being an effective parent and family relationships compared to a waiting
      list control period. The investigators will look at how the family manages OCD in their
      lives. In particular, if mindfulness skills training will help increase the parents ability
      to tolerate distress in their child secondary to OCD and as such reduce the family
      accommodation of OCD. As family accommodation is an important negative prognostic predictor
      for children with OCD, changes in OCD symptom severity and functional impact in these child
      will also be measured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating psychiatric illness that frequently
      begins in childhood. It is characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions that are
      distressing, time consuming and significantly impairing. OCD is distinct in the extent to
      which it disrupts family functioning, in that there is intense parental pressure to become
      involved in rituals and to change home environments and schedules to avoid triggers, thus
      accommodating the OCD. It is also well known that OCD severity tends to worsen in the context
      of stressful environments and situations. While effective treatment approaches for pediatric
      OCD have been identified, partial response and treatment refusal are all too common, leading
      to chronicity of both the illness itself and of its deleterious familial effects.

      The investigators plan to study a novel approach to help manage the stress of parenting a
      child with OCD, thus facilitating more effective resistance to OCD family accommodation and
      supporting the child in fighting this difficult illness. The investigators will explore the
      role of group-based mindfulness-based skills training (P-MBST) in supporting parents of
      OCD-affected youth, in particular investigating the possibility that increased distress
      tolerance as a result of mindfulness practice may help parents reduce OCD accommodation.

    <description>Parental stress levels is measured using the Parenting Stress Index - Short Form (PSI-SF) for parents with children under 13 years of age and the Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents - Short Form (SIPA-SF) for parents with children who are 13 years and older.

    <description>The Mindfulness Personality Profile (MPP) will be used to assess Mindfulness over the following four domains:
Self-description - adapted from the Self-Description Questionnaire (Marsh, 1994)
Awareness and attention - adapted from Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (Brown and Ryan, 2003)
Self-compassion and time - adapted from the Self-Compassion Scale (Raes et al., 2011) and Adolescent Time Inventory (Mellow and Worrell, 2007; Mello et al., 2013)
