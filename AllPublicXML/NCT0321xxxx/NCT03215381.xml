  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single centre exploratory study to analyse brain exposure of AZD1390
      in healthy volunteer males.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 12 healthy male volunteers, 20 to 65 years of age will participate in the study. The
      study population chosen is sufficient to examine variability in pharmacokinetic and imaging
      measurements. All male volunteer subjects will have a baseline brain magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) for eligibility and anatomical delineation of brain regions to be applied in
      positron emission tomography (PET) image analysis. An arterial line will be inserted on day
      the healthy volunteer arrives for the administration of study drug and PET imaging (Day 1).
      The arterial line will be placed in the opposite arm than the one being used to administer
      the single intravenous microdose of [11C]AZD1390. Blood samples will be collected after the
      administration of microdose [11C]AZD1390 bolus injection and during the PET imaging
      procedure. The arterial line will be removed at the conclusion of the PET imaging study after
      the last blood sample has been collected. Standard institutional procedures will be followed
      for arterial line removal. The study will conclude with a telephone follow-up call within 7
      business days after the PET measurement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures.

          -  Healthy Male subjects, aged 20 to 65 years (inclusive).

          -  Subject should be healthy as determined by medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory parameters, ECG and brain MRI performed before administration of the
             investigational product.

          -  Subject should have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 and must weigh
             at least 50.0 kg and no more than 100.0 kg.

          -  Male subjects must be willing to adhere to true sexual abstinence or use condoms and
             spermicide (refer to Section 4.3); and refrain from donating sperm during the study
             and for 3 months plus 5 half-lives after the last administered radiolabelled infusion
             of [11C]AZD1390.

          -  Subject should be willing and able to participate in all scheduled evaluations, abide
             by study restrictions, and complete all required tests and procedures.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Known or suspected neurological or behavioural disorders or symptoms that may
             interfere with the conduct or interpretation of the study, dementia (significant
             concomitant neurological disease are included under this category).
