      Chiauranib , which simultaneously targets against VEGFR/Aurora B/CSF-1R, several key kinases
      involved in tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell mitosis, and chronic inflammatory
      microenvironment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chiauranib is a novel orally active multi-target inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the
      angiogenesis-related kinases (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGFR3, PDGFRa and c-Kit), mitosis-related
      kinase Aurora B and chronic inflammationrelated kinase CSF-1R in a high potency manner with
      the IC50 at a single-digit nanomolar range. In particular, Chiauranib showed very high
      selectivity in the kinase inhibition profile with little activity on off-target non-receptor
      kinases, proteins, GPCR and ion channels, indicative of a better drug safety profile in terms
      of clinical relevance.

      Because of its broad preclinical anti-tumor efficacy and the potential to improve
      conventional TKI kinase inhibitor therapy in various cancer indications,Chiauranib has now
      entered phase Ib clinical trials.

      This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of chiauranib works in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer, in the meantime, exploreing the
      latent biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well as the relevancy of which and clinical
      benefit.
