  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators compared the incidence of trimming-induced retinal breaks, retinal
      redetachment rate, and final LogMAR BCVA; between scleral self-indentation and
      non-indentation during chandelier-assisted peripheral vitrectomy under air for eyes with
      primary retinal detachment. Self-indentation enables complete trimming of the vitreous base
      without causing iatrogenic retinal breaks, with a higher retinal reattachment rate, and with
      less need for chandelier shift than with non-indentation approach.

      Retrospective cohort study. One hundred and thirty eyes of 130 participants with primary
      rhegmatogenous retinal detachment were identified. All the participants had undergone a
      chandelier-assisted peripheral vitrectomy under air. Scleral self-indentation had been used
      in 68 eyes (study group) (Indentation group), while non-indentation had been used in 62 eyes
      (comparison group) (Non-indentation group). Outcome variables included: Trimming-induced
      retinal breaks (TIRB), retinal redetachment rate, final LogMAR BCVA, and intraoperative
      complications.
