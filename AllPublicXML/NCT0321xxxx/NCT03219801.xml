      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal
      stem cells transplantation in systemic lupus erythematosus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To ensure that all patients of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) completed 6-months
      follow-up, twenty SLE patients ranging from 14 to 60 years old were enrolled in this trial.
      Participants matched with the inclusion criteria were allocated randomly into two
      groups:Human Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hUC-MSCs) treated group and
      control group. Clinical trials are being increasingly established to investigate the
      therapeutic potential of these cells for SLE. The aim of the present study is to investigate
      safety and efficacy of vein infusion of allogeneic hUC-MSCs in patients with SLE.

    <description>Selected SLE patients were randomly divided into treated group and control group. In the treated group, 100-300 million allogeneic human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells were infused intravenously for one SLE patient. The possible adverse events, including immediately after mesenchymal stem cells infusions, as well as the long-term safety profiles were observed.</description>

    <description>SLE patients in the treated group were given human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells by intravenous infusion and conventional therapy. There was only conventional treatment in the control group. All patients after treatment for 1, 3 and 6months were evaluated respectively the curative effect.</description>
