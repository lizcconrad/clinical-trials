    <textblock>
      A panel of highly sensitive circulating biomarkers for acute liver injury have been
      identified and demonstrated to identify liver injury on first presentation to hospital before
      standard tests are elevated in patients with paracetamol overdose. The investigators wish to
      test these biomarkers in patients with active and latent tuberculosis to see if they can be
      used to stratify patients undertaking anti-tuberculosis drug therapy. Anti-tuberculosis drug
      induced liver injury is the most frequent side-effect of anti-tuberculosis therapy, affecting
      2-5% of tuberculosis patients seen at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh and hindering their
      effective treatment. Patients will be recruited from the TB out-patient clinic at the Royal
      Infirmary Edinburgh. Blood samples will be taken every time the patient visits the clinic and
      also retrieved from the biochemistry lab. The biomarkers in the blood samples will be
      analysed to determine if they rise in patients who develop liver injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To improve patient stratification, the investigators have developed a panel of novel
      circulating liver specific and mechanistic biomarkers that report early acute liver injury.
      Such biomarkers are needed as current early biomarkers of liver injury lack sensitivity and
      specificity. The panel of biomarkers either have enhanced liver specificity or provide
      mechanistic insights. Currently, antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI) is the
      most frequent side-effect of anti-tuberculosis therapy and this hinders the effective
      treatment of TB, as it means that treatment regimens are not completed. At present, the risk
      of ATDILI means that monitoring of liver function is required, with levels of ALT measured
      monthly. If levels of ALT rise to 2-5x the upper limit of normal levels (ULN) and the patient
      is unwell the frequency of monitoring is increased to biweekly monitoring. Antibiotic therapy
      is only changed if levels of ALT remain greater than 3xULN, the patient continues to display
      symptoms and there is a positive causality assessment that the anti-tuberculosis drugs are
      causing ATDILI. This project will recruit patients taking antituberculosis drugs and
      determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of the biomarker panel, in relation to liver
      injury as a result of anti-tuberculosis therapy.

    <description>Anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury defined as ALT elevation more than three times the ULN in the presence of hepatitis symptoms and/or jaundice, or five times the ULN in the absence of symptoms.
This is a 'proof of concept' study to determine whether a panel of biomarkers are elevated in tuberculosis patients who develop anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury.</description>
