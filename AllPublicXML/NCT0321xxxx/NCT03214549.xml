    <time_frame>immediately before laminates delivery up to 4 week sfter tooth preparation</time_frame>
    <description>marginal adaptation of laminates veneers will be assess as follows, before laminates cementation, an impression material will be placed in the fitting surface of the veneers and placed over the reduced tooth using finger pressure, after material set the impression replica is separated from the laminates and the replica is section and measures under stero-microscope for marginal adaptation, measurement will be performed in eight different points on the buccal and mesio-distal sections, measurement will be in micrometer.</description>

    <description>intervention: gull wing preparation in laminates veneers proximal margin of the preparation is placed toward the lingual .The area of the proximal margin between the contact area and the gingival papilla is placed even further to the lingual. This preparation design helps to hide the margin when the restorations are viewed from an angle.</description>
