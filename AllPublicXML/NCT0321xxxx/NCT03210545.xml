  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DOSCORT is a 2-dose, cross-over study primarily aiming to identify and validate novel
      biological markers (biomarkers) of glucocorticoid effect in the human body. Patients with
      Addison´s disease, primary adrenal insufficiency, with life-long glucocorticoid replacement
      therapy will undergo 2 treatment periods where their usual hydrocortisone treatment will be
      replaced with dexamethasone in physiological and supra physiological doses. Blood, saliva,
      urine, health related Quality-of-life self-assessment forms, measurements of physical
      activity and sleep quality will be collected from both treatment periods.
