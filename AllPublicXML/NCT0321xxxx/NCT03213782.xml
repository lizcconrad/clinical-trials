      INTRODUCTION: Continue stay in ICU can lead to sleep disturbances and poor stress management
      that may result in client's inability to adjust with the situations and use of medical
      support. This experience may lead to increase agitation, anxiety as well as physiological
      stress of client, decrease comfort level and increase recovery time as well as hospital stay.
      There has been great emphasis on non-pharmacological methods that decrease anxiety and stress
      since they are very appropriate and affordable.

      OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to assess the effect of Nature Based Sounds on
      Agitation and Anxiety of patients admitted in Intensive Care Units.

      METHODOLOGY: A Randomized Controlled Trial with pretest posttest control group design was
      used. Sixty patients from Surgical Intensive care unit and were selected conveniently and
      randomly assigned into experimental and control group using lottery method. Data was
      collected by Agitation Behavior Assessment Scale and Beck Anxiety Inventory.
