      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the ability of the product &quot;Sacral
      Savers.&quot; to prevent and/or help healing of bed sores, in patients in health care facilities.

      The Sacral saver device consists of a sheet of strong bubble-wrap -like material, folded at
      one end and covered by a nylon sham with a pocket in which the bubble wrap is placed. The
      assembled device is placed under the bed sheet in such a way that the small of the back rests
      on the fold. This will lift the back and reduce the pressure of the buttocks on the bed. When
      lying on the side, it will reduce the pressure on the hip.

      Participants are being asked to participate in this study because you are at risk for, or
      already have a bedsore on the buttocks or the hip.

Wound healing is greater than 20% healing within two weeks documented by measurement of the wound bed or wound healing to less than the dermal layer documented by photography and agreement of healing between research associate and physician . The bubble wrap mattress will be place underneath the participant. Follow-up will occur weekly for 6 weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This pilot study of 30 participants (15 control, 15 experimental) will test the safety and efficacy of using a bubble wrap mattress for pressure ulcer. Participants in one group would receive standard of care treatment and the other group would receive the intervention of the bubble wrap mattress. Participants would be followed for 6 weeks to assess wound healing and tolerance of the treatment. of ulcers. The outcome measure will measure 30 participants, 15 treated with the SacralSavers device and 15 participants with standard of care treatment up to the resolution of the participant's ulcer.</description>

    <description>Sacral Savers is a combination of a strong bubble wrap sheet with a fold at the head end and a nylon sham with a pocket into which the bubble wrap sheet is inserted. This combination is then placed under the fitted sheet on the patient's mid back and the pressure exerted by the lower back of the patient is markedly reduced or nearly eliminated (tested and proven using computer models), thereby preventing the onset of pressure ulcers in the sacro-coccygeal area.</description>
