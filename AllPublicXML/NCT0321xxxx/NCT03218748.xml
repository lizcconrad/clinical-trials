  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of the group-based
      intervention &quot;Honest, Open, Proud&quot; among soldiers with mental illness.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soldiers with mental illness typically face a two-fold problem. On the one hand, they have to
      cope with the symptoms of their mental illness; on the other hand, they often have to deal
      with stigma and discrimination. Both due to fear of public stigma and due to self-stigma or
      shame, soldiers with mental illness may decide to keep their condition a secret or even to
      withdraw from other people altogether in order to minimize the risk of being labeled. Secrecy
      can help on the short term to protect individuals from public stigma, but usually it has
      negative long-term consequences such as social isolation, distress and avoidance of
      help-seeking. Disclosure, on the other hand, carries the risk to be discriminated by others,
      but can reduce the burden of secrecy, lead to support by others and reduce public stigma.

      In this study investigators aim to test the efficacy (see our outcomes above) of Honest,
      Open, Proud run by soldiers with lived experience of mental illness.

    <description>The group program is about disclosure versus secrecy of one's mental illness. The groups are facilitated by two peers (soldiers with lived experience of mental illness). Each group runs for three weeks, one meeting per week, and two hours per meeting. There is one 2-hour booster session in week 6.

    <description>Three lessons, one for each two-hour session plus one booster session
Considering the pros and cons of disclosure:
Discussion of one's idea of identity and mental illness, weighing the costs and benefits of (non-) disclosure
Different ways to disclose:
Discussion of different levels of (non-) disclosure, considering costs and benefits of each level, selecting persons to disclose to and how to test them out, anticipating responses of others to one's disclosure
Telling one's story:
Practice how to tell one's story, identifying peers who might be helpful with the coming out process
Booster session Reviewing previous intentions to disclose one's mental illness, discussion whether one disclosed and evaluating this experience</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least one self-reported current axis I or axis II disorder according to DSM-5,

          -  Fluent in German (needed for self-report measures)

          -  At least a moderate level of self-reported disclosure-related distress/difficulty
             (score 4 or higher on the screening item 'In general, how distressed or worried are
             you in terms of secrecy or disclosure of your mental illness to others?', rated from
             1, not at all, to 7, very much)

          -  Current inpatient, day-clinic or outpatient treatment at the Center for Military

             non-substance related current psychiatric comorbidity. We will exclude people who only
