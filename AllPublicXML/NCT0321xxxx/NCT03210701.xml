  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 21% of Canadians with HIV are unaware of their infection. There is a need to
      improve access to HIV testing to detect infections earlier so individuals can access care
      early and take steps to prevent transmission to others. Barriers to HIV testing include
      limited access or reluctance to go to traditional testing sites (doctor's offices and
      sexually transmitted infection clinics), and the lengthy wait time to receive test results
      from standard laboratory-based HIV testing (usually 1-2 weeks). These deterrents are
      particularly significant for those at highest risk of infection, who may be socially
      marginalized or stigmatized. In rural areas, HIV testing may only be available through
      doctor's offices and hospitals, yet many Canadians do not have access to a family physician.
      Pharmacists are among the most trusted and accessible healthcare providers, and are well
      positioned to improve access to HIV testing. Point of care tests for HIV are easy to
      administer and results are available within minutes, making them ideal for use in the
      community pharmacy setting. Point of care testing (POCT) by pharmacists can ensure
      individuals receive their test results, and facilitate timely linkages to care and treatment.
      This adaptation grant will look at factors influencing the acceptability and feasibility of
      pharmacist-provided rapid POCT for HIV in two Canadian provinces, including pharmacies in
      both urban and rural areas. The effectiveness of pharmacist-delivered POCT will be considered
      from a variety of perspectives including people living with or at risk of HIV, as well as
      pharmacists as the service providers.

      Background: There is a need to improve access to HIV testing to detect infections earlier so
      individuals can access care and prevent transmission. Barriers to testing include limited
      access or reluctance to go to traditional testing sites, and the lengthy wait time to receive
      results. Pharmacists are trusted, accessible health providers and are well positioned to
      offer HIV testing. Point of care tests (POCT) for HIV are easy to administer and results
      available within minutes, making them ideal for use in the pharmacy setting. HIV POCT may
      overcome barriers to standard testing for those at high risk and in healthcare
      resource-limited settings. Preliminary data suggest pharmacist-administered POCT can reach
      those who have never had an HIV test. Implementation and effectiveness of
      pharmacist-delivered POCT is the focus of this study. Study goals: To determine whether a
      multi-faceted HIV POCT program adapted for community pharmacies in two Canadian provinces is
      acceptable, feasible and effective in reaching those at high risk and those who have never
      been tested. Implementation and effectiveness of an integrated, contextualized model of HIV
      POCT in urban and rural pharmacies in Newfoundland (NL) and Alberta (AB) will be assessed, in
      addition to preliminary costing analysis. . Methods: The investigators will use a Type II
      Hybrid Implementation-Effectiveness study design. The research team will be supported by an
      advisory committee comprised of a diverse group of stakeholders (community members,
      individuals with lived experience, pharmacists and other health professionals, and public
      health decision makers). Advisory committee and research team meetings will be held to foster
      team development, inform adaptation of an HIV POCT model for the pharmacy environment, and
      identify supports to implementation. Emphasis will be placed on establishing individualized
      linkage to care plans for each pharmacy utilizing existing community resources to quickly
      connect clients who have a reactive POCT result with support and confirmatory testing.
      Pharmacies in NL and AB will be selected to offer HIV POCT based on motivation, private space
      and staffing, and linkage to care opportunities. Pharmacists will receive training and
      ongoing support from the research team. A 6-month pilot of the POCT program will be
      implemented in at least one urban and one rural pharmacy in NL and AB. Clients may request an
      HIV test by appointment or walk in during advertised pharmacy HIV testing hours. Clients will
      provide informed consent, and will receive pre/post-test counselling in addition to
      administration of the POCT. Demographic data and surveys assessing the testing experience
      will be collected. Clients may participate in a telephone survey to provide further feedback
      on the program. Pharmacists will document time and resources for each test administered.
      Pharmacists, staff and managers will participate in focus groups to assess barriers, enablers
      and attitudes regarding POCT. Evaluation: Implementation will be assessed using qualitative
      and quantitative methods. The process of developing and implementing the POCT program will be
      described from qualitative data and a program logic model constructed. Acceptability,
      barriers and enablers will be identified qualitatively and from survey responses (primarily
      quantitative). Descriptive statistics and performance measures (satisfaction, acceptability)
      from pharmacists, staff and clients will be analysed; within and between settings variations
      assessed using non-parametric analyses. Bivariate analyses will assess relationships between
      pharmacy setting or pharmacist characteristics, and sustainability. Effectiveness will be
      assessed using descriptive statistics to describe client outcomes and satisfaction. Bivariate
      and multivariate analyses will assess influence of client characteristics on outcomes and
      satisfaction. Preliminary costing assessment will consider the client, pharmacy and
      government perspective. Impact: This study will inform further modifications to the pharmacy
      HIV POCT model to optimize effectiveness and increase scalability prior to full adoption and
      implementation. This will form the basis for a subsequent grant application. Knowledge gained
      can be used to scale up effective testing programs to increase the number of high risk
      individuals getting tested. The pharmacy is a novel venue to offer HIV testing, and if
      successful could be a widely accessible option applicable to other provinces and other
      countries. This study will provide proof of concept for pharmacy based POCT for other
      sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBI) (once tests become available) and
      successful implementation may also lead to pharmacist-delivered pre-exposure prophylaxis
      (PrEP) programs, to further reduce HIV infection rates.
