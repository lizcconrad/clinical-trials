      Compare the analytical and clinical performance of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT assays for the
      diagnosis of acute myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in patients presenting to the
      emergency department in whom serial cTnI measurements are obtained on clinical indication.

      Background: Comparative studies addressing the analytical and clinical performance of hs-cTnI
      and hs-cTnT assays for the diagnosis of acute myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in
      consecutive patients presenting to a United States (US) emergency department are lacking.

      Study objective: Compare the analytical and clinical performance of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT
      assays for the diagnosis of acute myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in patients
      presenting to the emergency department in whom serial cTnI measurements are obtained on
      clinical indication.

      Null Hypothesis: hs-cTnI and or hs-cTnT assays will offer comparable diagnostic performance
      for acute myocardial injury and acute myocardial
