  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, approximately 170 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV); 350,000
      deaths each year are caused by HCV infection (Perz,et al, 2006).The Egyptian Demographic
      Health Survey (EDHS), across sectional survey including hepatitis C virus (HCV)biomarkers,
      was conducted in 2008 on a large nationally representative sample (El-Zanaty F, et al 2009).
      It estimated HCV prevalence among the 15-59 years age group to be 14.7% (El-Zanaty F, et al
      2009).Accordingly, Egypt has the highest HCV prevalence in the world (Lavanchy D, 2011), (
      Shepard CW,et al 2005)..Interferon (INF)-free regimens of combined directly acting antivirals
      (DAAs) have shown improved efficacy and tolerability compared with interferon
      (IFN)-containing regimens, and they have become the standard of care for treatment of HCV
      genotype-1 (HCV-1)(Afdhal, et al, 2014).Insulin resistance is a state in which a given
      concentration of insulin produces a less-than-expected biological effect. The prevalence of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus in hepatitis C in cirrhotic patients is 27.3% which is higher than
      among non-cirrhotic hepatitis C patients (17.5%)(Romero-Gómez, 2006). HCV promotes insulin
      resistance and insulin resistance induces interferon resistance, steatosis and fibrosis
      progression in a genotype-dependent manner.In HCV-1, insulin resistance decreases sustained
      response rate, and increase the risk for the development of steatosis and fibrosis
      progression, However, the impact of insulin resistance in other genotypes seems not achieve
      enough importance to impair sustained response, probably due to the high sensitivity to
      peginterferon. The treatment of insulin resistance, decreasing hyperinsulinemia, could
      improve sustained response rate in patients with chronic HCV-1 infection when treated with
      peginterferon plus ribavirin(Romero-Gómez,2006).

      Objectives: we aim to determine the prevalence of insulin resistance among the patients with
      chronic hepatitis C virus( HCV) infection and to explore the association between insulin
      resistance and therapeutic response by comparing the insulin resistance among responders and
      non-responders to oral treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection Patients and methods:
      The study is intended to include patients of chronic hepatitis C virus infection receiving
      oral treatment for one year period. All patients will have clinical evaluation,
      ultrasonographic examination, and laboratory investigations which include complete blood
      count, liver function tests, estimation of fasting serum glucose, fasting serum insulin, and
      determination of insulin resistance index.The patients will be selected according the
      selection criteria determined by the National Committee for Control of Viral Hepatitis
      (NCCVH).
