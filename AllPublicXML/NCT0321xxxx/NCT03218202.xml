  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two thirds of patients with Crohn's disease require intestinal surgery at some time in their
      life. Intestinal strictures, that is narrowing of the bowel due to inflammation and scarring,
      are the most common reason for surgery. Despite the high frequency, associated disability,
      and cost there are no are no treatment strategies that aim to improve the outcome of this
      disease complication. The STRIDENT (stricture definition and treatment) studies aim to
      determine biochemical and imaging features associated with the development of strictures and
      in related STRIDENT studies develop strategies for treatment.

      Patients with asymptomatic Crohn's disease strictures will be followed prospectively for 12
      months using imaging (including MRI/intestinal ultrasound) and biochemical analyses
      (including CRP/calprotectin). Patient's with symptomatic or asymptomatic ulcerative colitis
      related strictures will be followed similarly. Risk factors for progression of strictures and
      development of symptoms will be identified.
