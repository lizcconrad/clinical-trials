                       [bilateral, diffuse, parenchymal lung disease]), or current unstable or
                       uncompensated respiratory or cardiac conditions, or uncontrolled
                       hypertension, history of, or active, bleeding diatheses (eg, hemophilia or
                       von Willebrand disease) or uncontrolled active systemic fungal, bacterial,
                       viral, or other infection (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms
                       related to the infection and without improvement, despite appropriate
                       antibiotics or other treatment), or intravenous anti-infective treatment
