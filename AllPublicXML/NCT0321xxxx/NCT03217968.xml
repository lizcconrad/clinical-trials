      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the Cefaly® Abortive Program
      device used at home for 2 hours to treat a migraine attack. This open clinical trial will
      study the abortive treatment of migraine using the Cefaly® Abortive Program device, prior to
      development of a sham-controlled trial.

      The main objective of this study is to have a pilot assessment of the efficacy of the Cefaly®
      Abortive Program device used at home for 2 hours to treat a migraine attack, as triptans are
      generally used. That is to say having pilot data to assess the efficacy of the Cefaly®
      Abortive Program device in the abortive treatment of acute migraine as measured by 2-hour
      pain freedom, pain relief and migraine associated symptoms freedom, plus evolution of these
      measurements for 24 hours after the beginning of the treatment session.
