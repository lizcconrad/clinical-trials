  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate longitudinal performance of Epi proColon with respect to test
      positivity, longitudinal adherence to Epi proColon screening, adherence to follow-up
      colonoscopy and diagnostic yield, as well as assay failure rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epi proColon is blood based screening test for colorectal cancer that is FDA - PMA approved.
      It is indicated for average risk patients who are unwilling or unable to be screened with
      other recommended screening tests, including colonoscopy or fecal occult blood tests.

      The PERT study is designed to assess the test performance of Epi proColon when it is used
      annually for two consecutive years. Subjects enrolled in the study will be offered initial
      testing. Subjects with a positive result will be referred for colonoscopy. Subjects with a
      negative test result will be encouraged to be screened the following year. At the one year
      interval, test negative subjects will be reminded to be rescreened. Subjects with a positive
      test will be referred for colonoscopy, while subjects with a negative test will be be
      encouraged to participate in a screening program in subsequent years.

        The study population will be the population defined in the intended use statement, i.e.
        adults of either sex, 50 years or older, defined as average risk for CRC, who have been
        offered and have a history of not completing CRC screening. Tests that are available and
        recommended in the USPSTF 2008 CRC screening guidelines will be offered and declined prior
        to offering the Epi proColon test.

        Eligible subjects will be recruited at a regular visit at their primary health care
        provider, or through typical preventive care outreach by health care providers. Consented
        subjects who agree to participate in the study and agree to be tested with Epi proColon
        will be enrolled.

             disease with myocardial infarction within 6 months, unstable angina or congestive
             heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring home oxygen, other
