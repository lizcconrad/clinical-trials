    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of Transvenous Hypoglossal Nerve
      Stimulation (tHGNS) on tongue position in the upper airway. Activation of the HGN will cause
      contraction of the genioglossus muscle, which will move the tongue forward, opening the
      upper-airway and reducing apnea-hypopnea events in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea
      (OSA). A transvenous approach will be less risky and traumatic than current HGNS systems that
      require an open surgical approach to wrap a cuff electrode around the HGN.

      The primary objective is to determine the effect of tHGNS on tongue position in the upper
      airway in subjects undergoing an EP, cardiac catheterization or device procedure. (Measured
      as changes in the anteroposterior dimensions (2-dimensional) of the retropalatal and
      retrolingual airway spaces.) This will be an acute study lasting no more than 45 min during a
      standard new device implant, cardiac catheterization and/or EP procedure. The hypoglossal
      nerve will be stimulated from the lingual vein using various stimulation parameters. Tongue
      motion, upper airway opening or any side effects will be recorded. At the end of the test
      procedure all hardware - the catheters, lead and/or guide wire will be removed.
