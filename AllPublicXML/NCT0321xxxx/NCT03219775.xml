  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TITAN-TCC (0416-ASG) is a Phase 2, open-label study of nivolumab (BMS-936558) monotherapy
      with additional nivolumab/ipilimumab &quot;boost&quot; cycles in previously untreated and
      platinum-based pretreated, 2nd and 3rd line, advanced or metastatic transitional cell
      carcinoma subjects. Nivolumab is a fully human PD-1 antibody which blocks the respective
      immune checkpoint in a ligand (PD-L1/PD-L2) independent manner.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single arm study of a tailored immunotherapy approach with nivolumab in
      adult (≥ 18 years) subjects with previously untreated (1st line) or pretreated (2nd and 3rd
      line), surgically unresectable or metastatic TCC (further designated &quot;advanced TCC&quot;). The
      study targets to recruit 130 untreated (1st line) and 120 pretreated (2nd / 3rd line)
      patients, respectively. Tumor tissue obtained at least 2 years prior to screening must be
      available for a central pathology assessment. Subjects must have advanced (not amenable to
      curative surgery or radiation) or metastatic TCC, and must not have received more than two
      prior platinum-based chemotherapies for the treatment of advanced TCC.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>max. 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective will be measured by the primary endpoint of ORR (based on investigator assessments) among all treated subjects, first line subjects and second line subjects. It is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response of CR or PR divided by the number of all treated subjects, first line subjects or second line subjects. Best overall response is defined as the best response designation, as determined by investigator, recorded between the date of first dose and the date of objectively documented immunotherapy resistance per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <description>Time to Immunotherapy Resistance (TIR) will be used as a surrogate parameter of progression free survival using a tailored Immunotherapy regimen with &quot;boost&quot; cycles upon initial progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>max. 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined either as the time from first dosing date or initiation of nivolumab/ipilimumab &quot;boost&quot; cycles to the date of the first confirmed response thereafter, as assessed by the IRC. Hence, TTR may be recorded several times per patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>max. 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from first confirmed response (CR or PR) to the date of the documented progressive disease as determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DOR may be recorded multiple times per patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>max. 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented tumor progression based on investigator assessments (per RECIST 1.1), or death due to any cause. Clinical deterioration in the absence of unequivocal evidence of progression (per RECIST 1.1) is not considered progression for purposes of determining PFS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>max. 42 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of death. A subject who has not died will be censored at last known date alive.</description>

                  or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy are eligible and considered first line
                  provided that progression has occurred &gt;12 months from last therapy [for
                  chemoradiation and adjuvant treatment] or &gt;12 months from last surgery [for
                  neoadjuvant treatment]; in all other patients who received cisplatin based
                  neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy and progression within 12 months this
                  will be considered one line of therapy.

                    1. Fine Needle Aspiration [FNA] and bone metastases samples (without soft
                       tissue component) are not acceptable for submission).

                    2. Tumor lesions used for newly acquired biopsies should not be target lesions,
                       unless there are no other lesions.

          -  Age and Reproductive Status

               -  Males and Females, ≥ 18 years of age

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
                  pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24
                  hours prior to the start of study drug.

               -  Women must not be breastfeeding

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to follow instructions for
                  method(s) of contraception for a period of 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle)
                  plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half lives.
                  The terminal half lives of nivolumab and ipilimumab are up to 25 days and 18
                  days, respectively. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23
                  weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives)
                  after the last dose of investigational drug.

               -  Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for
                  method(s) of contraception for a period of 90 days (duration of sperm turnover)
                  plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half lives.
                  The terminal half lives of nivolumab and ipilimumab are up to 25 days and 18
                  days, respectively. Males who receive nivolumab combined with ipilimumab who are
                  sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days plus
                  the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last dose
                  of investigational drug.

                    -  Comment: Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually
                       active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP must still
                       undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section.

        Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on
        the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy
        Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on
        the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective methods of
        contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used consistently and correctly.

        At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of two methods of contraception, with one
        method being highly effective and the other method being either highly effective or less
        effective as listed below:

        HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION

          -  Male condoms with spermicide

          -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal
             ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena® by WOCBP
             subject or male subject's WOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects
             participating in the study may use hormone based contraceptives as one of the
             acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug

          -  Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard®

          -  Tubal ligation

          -  Vasectomy

          -  Complete Abstinence*

               -  *Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse
                  and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Subjects who
                  choose complete abstinence are not required to use a second method of
                  contraception, but female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests.
                  Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed
                  in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.

        LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION

          -  Diaphragm with spermicide

          -  Cervical cap with spermicide

          -  Vaginal sponge

          -  Male Condom without spermicide

               -  Participation in another clinical intervention trial 30 days prior to
                  registration

        Eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safety of
        the study subjects and that the results of the study can be used. It is imperative that
        subjects fully meet all eligibility criteria.

        Subject Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a subject that has
        discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (ie, subject has not been registered /
        has not been treated). If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.
