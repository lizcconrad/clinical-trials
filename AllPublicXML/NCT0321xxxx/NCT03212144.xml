  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll and randomly assign 30 sedentary, healthy overweight men and women to
      two groups. Participants will either start by consuming peanuts for 4 weeks, and then go on
      to exercise at high intensity intervals (HIIT) for 4 weeks, or the reverse order. The study
      will test and compare the effect of peanuts and exercise on inflammation and heart rate
      variability as indicators of heart health. Specifically, the study will measure inflammation
      in the blood because there is evidence that higher inflammation is found in heart disease
      patients. There is also evidence that inflammation is related to death as a result of heart
      disease in healthy individuals. Finally, there are ongoing trials targeting these markers to
      improve heart health. The study hypothesizes that peanuts and exercise will reduce
      inflammation. It is also expected to find less inflammation because exercise and peanut
      consumption activate a part of the nervous system that has been shown to cause a similar
      effect.

      Additionally, previous studies show that inflammation involves the mitochondria in the cell,
      the part of the cell that produces energy. For this reason, it is expected that exercise and
      peanuts will cause changes in the mitochondria. The study will test and compare mitochondrial
      activity in response to peanut consumption and exercise.

    <description>Participants will engage in 4 training sessions per week over a 4-week period, with 24 hour rest-periods between each training day. Each session begins with a 3 min low intensity warm-up, and then participants exercise as rapidly as they can for 20 seconds, aiming to reach 85% of their maximum heart rate as established during the submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. This 20 second period is followed by 40 seconds of low intensity exercise.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Regular daily caloric intake of each subject will be estimated using data from 24hr recalls, the Miflin-St. Jeor equation, and stress/activity factors. Participants will consume dry roasted, unsalted peanuts equivalent to approximately 10% of daily energy intake twice a day (total=20% total daily energy intake), which will range from approximately 400kcal to 600 kcal, which corresponds to about 2.4 ounces to 3.6 ounces. Peanuts will replace protein and fat containing foods so that the daily caloric intake will not differ from participants' typical diet. To assess compliance, participants will be asked to bring back the empty, numbered peanut packets by the end of every week and will be given new packets weekly. Additionally, subjects will be informed that they will be randomly assessed weekly for compliance; they will be asked to provide details of when and where they consumed their packets the previous day. Research assistants will provide guidance on how to maintain compliance.</description>
