        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologic confirmed recurrent and/or metastatic nasopharyngeal
             carcinoma( NPC )

          2. Have failed for ≥1 lines of platinum based chemotherapy

          3. At least one measurable lesion according to the RECIST 1.1

          4. ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years of age

          5. ECOG performance scale 0-2

          6. Life expectancy of more than 3 months

          7. Adequate hepatic, renal and hematologic functions (hemoglobin ≥ 90g/L, platelets ≥
             100×10^9/L, neutrophils ≥ 1.5×10^9/L, serum transaminase &lt; 2.5×the upper limit of
             normal(ULN), (If liver metastases, serum transaminase&lt; 5×the ULN), creatinine
             clearance rate ＞ 60ml/min.

          8. Signed and dated informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior therapy with tyrosine kinase -inhibitor agent targeting at VEGFR and PDGFR

          2. Before or at the same time any, second malignancies except cured basal cell carcinoma
             of skin and carcinoma in-situ of uterine cervix

          3. Any factors that influence the usage of oral administration

          4. Known Spinal Cord compression or diseases of brain or pia mater by CT /MRI screening

          5. Within 6 months before the first treatment occurs artery / venous thromboembolic
             events, such as cerebral vascular accident (including transient ischemic attack), deep
             vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, etc.

          6. Within 3 months before the first treatment occurs myocardial infarction, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac angioplasty or stent implantation

          7. Within 1 months before the first treatment received surgical operation and the wounds
             were not healed

          8. Application of anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin, heparin or
             its analogues; If the prothrombin time international normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5,
             with the purpose of prevention, the use of small doses of warfarin (1mg orally, once
             daily) or low-dose aspirin (between 80mg to 100mg daily) is allowed

          9. Blood coagulation abnormal, having hemorrhagic tendency (eg. active peptic ulcer
             disease) or receiving the therapy of thrombolysis or anticoagulation.

         10. Preexisting serious accompanying disease which may bring great risk or influence the
             patient's compliance( uncontrolled hypertension, grade III - IV cardiac insufficiency,
             severe arrhythmia -QTc duration between 500 m/s, severe liver and kidney insufficiency
             :urine protein+ +, 24 hours urinary protein &gt; 1.0 g, mental illness.)

         11. history of organ transplants

         12. Evidence of significant medical illness that in the investigator's judgment will
             substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in and
             completion of the study.
