    <textblock>
      There is no prospective study published on the Essential Thrombocythemia and the correlation
      between this specific disease, its complications and the biological variations observed.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate a correlation between biological tests of
      haemostasis, as Multiplate analyser and thromboelastometry (ROTEM) and the occurrence of
      clinical complications, thrombosis and/or haemorrhage, in order to determine if this
      biological tests could be biological prognostic factors
