  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort, one center. twenty patients who will undergo percutaneous stent
      implantation with everolimus eluting stent will be include. The primary endpoint was the
      correlation between the change (baseline vs. 1 week) in the number of circulating endothelial
      progenitor cells and in cell functionality following an everolimus eluting stent implantation
      with the grade of neointimal hyperplasia measured by optical coherence tomography

      For the purpose of the study, flow cytometry analyses will be performed before intervention,
      at 1 week, 1 month and 9 months. In addition, cell functionality analyses will be performed
      by quantification of colony forming units, aldehidrodehidrogenase activity, cell
      proliferation by WST-1 and senescence by !-galactosidase enzyme. At 9 months the degree of
      neointimal proliferation will be measured by optical coherence tomography . A clinical
      follow-up will be performed at 1 year. Secondary endpoints include: 1. to correlate the
      change in the number and cell functionality of circulation progenitor cells following
      everolimus eluting stent and the injury score analyses measured by optical coherence
      tomography, and the percentage of non covered struts by optical coherence tomography at 9
      months.

      2.-. To evaluate the role of other subtypes of cells CD 133+/Kinase Insert Domain Receptor
      (KDR+), CD 14+, mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial cell markers (VE cadherina, P1H12),
      integrin expression of Macrophage-1 antigen (MAC-1) and the development of neointimal
      hyperplasia.
