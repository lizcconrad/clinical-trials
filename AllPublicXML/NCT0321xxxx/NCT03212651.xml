    <textblock>
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the
      interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2; Recent phase I trial provided
      evidence of activity of pembrolizumab in advanced platinum-resistant metastatic urothelial
      carcinoma; Recent phase 3 trial showed an overall survival benefit in patients treated with
      pembrolizumab in a trial comparing pembrolizumab to chemotherapy in patients who failed
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical
      cystectomy is the standard of care for cisplatinum-eligible non-metastatic MIBC patients;
      Many patients with MIBC are unfit for cisplatin-based combination treatment; Given its safety
      profile, pembrolizumab may be used in unfit patients; Neo-adjuvant setting is a unique
      opportunity to assess mechanisms of action of pembrolizumab in human

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

             infection (defined as the presence of antihepatitis B core antibody, IgG anti-HBs +)
             are eligible. HBV DNA should be obtained in these patients prior to the first dose of
             study treatment. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if PCR is
             negative for HCV RNA
