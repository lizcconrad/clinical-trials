  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient renal insufficiency is frequently observed in the course of cardiovascular arrest.
      Although elevation of creatinine is reversible in a large majority of cases, severe renal
      insufficiency is sometimes observed and is associated with a dark prognosis. Any intervention
      that may limit the worsening of renal function may have an impact on patient mortality. There
      is currently no validated pharmacological treatment to limit the progression of ARI or to
      accelerate its recovery. A major challenge then concerns the detection of the reversible
      character of renal damage.

      Renal biomarkers have been little studied in the prediction of severe ARI and mortality after
      cardiac arrest. The combination of TIMP2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase) and
      insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP7) in urine showed good diagnostic
      performance in the early detection of the risk of developing acute renal failure within 12
      hours. Measured in the urine, the excretion of these two markers specifically reflects renal
      tubular lesions. Moreover, their rate seems to be strongly correlated with the severity of
      the tubular lesions.

      Thus, it can be reasonably assumed that their very early dosing in post-cardiac arrest could
      detect the presence and severity of renal tubular lesions. A threshold to be defined would
      discriminate patients at risk of developing an ARI within 48 hours post ACR and to
      distinguish between severe transient and severe persistent lesions beyond 72 hours.
