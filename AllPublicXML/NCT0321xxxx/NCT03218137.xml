    <textblock>
      Unblinded, controlled, non-randomized, mechanistic study to determine whether physiological
      mechanisms underlying PVC are sensitive to adenosine. Twenty subjects undergoing
      clinically-indicated, standard-of-care cardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) procedure for
      PVCs will receive adenosine to learn if their arrhythmias are inducible similarly to
      sustained ventricular tachycardia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cellular mechanism of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is unknown. The
      investigators have previously observed that 5% of patients in the investigators
      electrophysiology laboratory with ventricular outflow tract PVCs have inducible sustained
      ventricular tachycardia that behaves in a manner similar to patients who present clinically
      with sustained ventricular tachycardia, i.e., sensitive to adenosine and triggered activity.
      This suggests that outflow arrhythmias may be a continuum of a single mechanism. To further
      determine the mechanism of frequent PVCs, the investigators will determine the effects of
      pharmacologic agents administered prior to catheter ablation.

      The investigators hypothesize that study subjects with ambient PVCs will have the
      participants PVCs suppressed with exogenous adenosine.

      The information from this study will elucidate the underlying cellular mechanism of this
      common arrhythmia. Such knowledge could potentially lead to developing therapeutic targets.
