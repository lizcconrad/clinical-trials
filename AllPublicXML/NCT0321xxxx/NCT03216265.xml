  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this POC clinical study is to investigate the impact of the test product
      (Developmental Cosmetic Moisturising Cream) on skin barrier function and skin moisturisation
      on the forearm and face after 4 weeks of twice daily application compared to no treatment in
      participants with dry sensitive skin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Areas on the volar forearm and each side of the face, will be selected for measurements of
      transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and corneometry to be conducted . A physical challenge and a
      regression period of 5 days is also included to evaluate skin barrier function and
      moisturisation.

      A regression period of 5 days (Days 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34) of no study product use following
      the 4 week treatment phase is also included to evaluate skin barrier function and
      moisturisation.

    <measure>Change from baseline in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements on Day 29 of test product treated versus (vs.) untreated sites on the forearm</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>TEWL measuring principle is based on water vapour gradient determination between two pairs of sensors placed at different distances perpendicularly to the skin. The probe will be held in place on the skin for one measurement, for approximately 40 seconds (sec), to ensure that a stable value has been established. The first part of the measurement belongs to the equilibration phase. The values of the last 10 seconds are averaged as the actual measurement values. An increase in TEWL values shows damage to the skin barrier function.</description>

    <time_frame>At Baseline, Day 1 (30 minutes and 6 hours post study product application), Day 2, 15, and 29</time_frame>
    <description>Corneometry will be used to measure moisture content of stratum corneum using corneometer. The measuring principle is based on changes in the capacitance of the measuring head, functioning as a condensator. Between the conductors of the probe an electrical field is built which allows the dielectricity of the stratum corneum to be measured. Because the dielectricity of the skin varies as a function of its water content. The Corneometer measurements will be taken 5 times in total and then an average reading will be calculated for each site and time point.</description>

    <description>A series of D-Squame discs will be gently smoothed over the designated D-Squame Areas by applying a uniform pressure for 5 sec with a stamp to ensure consistent adhesion to the skin. Each disc will be pulled off the skin with one fluent and decisive movement. There will be a maximum of 12 D-Squame discs (in groups of 4) removed from each forearm repeatedly. TEWL will be measured (as per primary outcome) pre challenge and after 4, 8 and 12 discs have been removed from the forearms.</description>

    <description>The protein content of each D-Squame disc will be analysed using a SquameScan. SquameScan is the instrument used to indirectly measure the protein content extracted from the skin by D-squame tape strips. Determination is performed by measuring the optical absorption of the strip at about 850 nanometres (nm) (infrared light). The value displayed in % is proportionally related to the protein content. The protein content will be analysed for each of the discs obtained the D-Squame stripping on the forearms and reported to 2 decimal places.</description>
