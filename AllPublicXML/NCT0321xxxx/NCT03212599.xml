    <textblock>
      A causal therapeutic approach for treatment of Alzheimer's disease has not been established
      so far. The protein ADAM10 represents a promising target for an A-beta peptide preventing
      strategy. Treatment of human neuronal cells with Disulfiram, a drug which is used in clinical
      routine for recrudescence prevention of alcohol dependency, revealed an increased expression
      of ADAM10. This finding indicates a neuroprotective potential of Disulfiram. The
      investigators' research purpose aims at the verification of the results obtained in cell
      culture experiments in the human organism. Therefore, include alcohol addicted patients were
      included, which take the drug Disulfiram for recrudescence prevention, in our study. Patients
      are recruited from the patient-collective of the University Medical Center Mainz and the
      Central Institute for Mental Health Mannheim. Blood samples (max. 5 ml) are taken from the
      participants before the intake of Disulfiram and about two weeks after treatment. Demographic
      data are collected (such as age or onset of addiction). Gene expression is analyzed via
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) from blood cell-derived messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA).
