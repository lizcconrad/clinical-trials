  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      50%-60% of the known causes of recurrent pregnancy loss(RPL) are associated with embryonic
      aneuploidy, such that preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) on embryos acquired by assisted
      reproductive treatment should improve the rate of pregnancy and live birth in those patients.
      In dispute though the clinical application of PGS has been, a series of studies show that the
      new generation of PGS(PGS 2.0), based on blastocyst biopsy followed by whole genome analysis,
      has significantly improved the clinical outcome of IVF treatment. At present, there is still
      a need for the evidence of the use of PGS 2.0 in RPL patients, who may benefit from this
      emerging technology considering the prevalence of genetic abnormalities and the number of
      transferable embryos in this population.

      An earlier single center RCT conducted by our IVF center displayed higher implantation rate,
      clinical pregnancy rate and ongoing pregnancy rate calculated by per embryo transfer(ET)
      cycle in IVF/ICSI+PGS group compared with IVF/ICSI group.

      This multi-center prospective randomized clinical trial is to provide more data to determine
      whether the clinical outcomes are significantly improved per treatment cycle such that
      provide evidence for the application of PGS in RPL patients. Besides, risk factors of PGS
      outcome are to be analyzed from multi-center data to build a model for prediction of the
      possible outcomes of PGS and direction of the clinical choice.
