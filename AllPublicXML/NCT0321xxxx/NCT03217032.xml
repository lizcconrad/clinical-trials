      This study is a Phase I/II trial using an advanced lentiviral vector to deliver a normal gene
      for human clotting factor VIII or factor IX into patients with hemophilia A or hemophilia B,
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV infusion of gene modified autologous hematopoeitic
      stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells in patients.

    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are genetic bleeding disorders caused by the lack of ability to
      produce blood-clotting factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX (FIX), respectively. Individuals
      with hemophilia A or B suffer repeated bleeding episodes, which can cause chronic joint
      disease and sometimes even death due to the inability for blood to clot efficiently. The
      current treatment is intravenous infusion of clotting factor concentrates, either
      prophylactically or in response to bleeding. The procedure is life time long and expensive
      while still cannot achieve a cure of the disease from the source.

      Gene therapy is a novel medical technology that has been successfully demonstrated in a
      number of clinical studies for diseases such as cancer and genetic diseases. In this study,
      an advanced lentiviral vector system will be used to deliver a normal gene for human clotting
      FVIII or FIX into patients with hemophilia A or hemophilia B. This study is a Phase I/II
      trial evaluating the safety and efficacy for IV infusion of gene modified autologous
      hematopoeitic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells in patients with hemophilia A or
      hemophilia B.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to provide informed consent and comply with requirements of the study.

          2. Males ≥2 years with confirmed diagnosis of hemophilia A or hemophilia B (endogenous
             factor VIII or factor IX ≤2 IU/dL or ≤2% of normal).

          3. A minimum average of 4 bleeding events per year requiring episodic treatment of factor
             VIII or factor IX infusions or prophylactic factor VIII or factor IX infusions.

          4. No measurable factor VIII or factor IX inhibitor as assessed by the central laboratory
             and have no prior history of inhibitors to factor VIII or factor IX protein.

          5. Agree to use reliable barrier contraception until 3 consecutive samples are negative
             for vector sequences.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant liver dysfunction as defined by abnormal alanine transaminase, bilirubin
             and alkaline phosphatase.

          2. History of inhibitor against factor VIII or factor IX.

          3. Evidence of active hepatitis B or C and currently on antiviral therapy.

          4. Have serological evidence of HIV-1 or HIV-2 with CD4 counts ≤200/mm3 (subjects who are
             HIV+ and stable with CD4 count &gt;200/mm3 and undetectable viral load are eligible to
             enroll).

          5. Any evidence of active infection or any immunosuppressive disorder.

          6. Participated in a gene transfer trial within the last 6 months or in a clinical trial
             with an investigational drug within the last 12 weeks.

          7. Unable or unwilling to comply with study assessments.
