  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of dressing is common place following surgery, allowing for wounds to be covered and
      protected. Dressing material with adhesive contact layers or adhesive tape is integral to
      sealing off the wound. Mechanical stripping of stratum corneum during dressing removal causes
      pain and discomfort. During dressing removal, practitioners may at times apologize as a
      function of empathy. Previous study investigated speed of dressing removal and its effect on
      discomfort during dressing change. In this study, the investigators aim to investigate how
      empathy expressed in form of saying &quot;sorry&quot; affect the perception of pain during dressing
      change?

    <description>A small strip of self-adhesive dressing (3cm by 4cm) will be applied to the back of the patients' participants' hand and side of neck. After one minute of acclimatization, the dressing will be removed by the examiner. During the removal, the examiner will say sorry repeatedly. Following the dressing removal, participant will rate their pain with a 10 point visual analog scale.</description>
