  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of childbearing age women with hepatitis B virus infection were still in the
      immune tolerance period. Our recent research had shown that most puerperae after delivery had
      elevated ALT level. However, there is no withdrawal time recommendations after childbirth at
      present.Through the study of hepatitis occurrence after delivery and drug withdrawal, the
      investigators explore the withdrawal time of antiviral treatment during pregnancy.

      Most of childbearing age women with hepatitis B virus infection were still in the immune
      tolerance period. Our recent research had shown that most puerperae after delivery had
      elevated ALT level, and 11.5% of patients with HBV DNA positive would lead to deterioration
      of liver function. Meanwhile, the highest peak of ALT level could occur in 2 weeks after
      delivery, then it would dropped to a low point in 4-5 weeks. However, there is no withdrawal
      time recommendations after childbirth at present.The aim of our study is to investigate the
      changes of serological indexes, the changing rule of the liver function, hepatitis status,
      and its correlation with antiviral therapy in pregnant women with HBV infection after
      delivery, and then explore the withdrawal time of antiviral treatment during pregnancy.
