    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies how well sorafenib tosylate and pembrolizumab work in treating
      patients with liver cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Sorafenib tosylate may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Giving sorafenib tosylate and pembrolizumab may work better in treating
      patients with liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) related to the combination of sorafenib tosylate
      (sorafenib) + pembrolizumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time to tumor progression in patients who received the combination therapy of
      sorafenib + pembrolizumab compared to historical data on sorafenib only treatment in patients
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain data on changes in immune cell function and in the tumor microenvironment pre-
      and post-treatment to screen for potential biomarkers that may be able to predict clinical
      benefit.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -28 to -1 and 1-21.
      Patients also receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      up to 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.
