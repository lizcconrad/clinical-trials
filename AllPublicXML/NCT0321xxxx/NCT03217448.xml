    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized (1:1), open-label study with two parallel
      groups. This study is planned to investigate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate
      comparing with warfarin for the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of Cerebral Venous thrombosis (CVT), with or without intracranial
             haemorrhage.

          -  Patients in the acute or sub-acute phase of CVT.

          -  Completion of anticoagulation therapy for 5-15 days which has been administered until
             randomization; anticoagulation must include full-dose low molecular weight heparin or
             unfractionated heparin.

          -  Eligibility for treatment with an oral anticoagulant.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cerebral Venous thrombosis (CVT) associated with central nervous system infection or
             due to head trauma.

          -  Thrombosed venous sinuses showed completely recanalized by MRV before randomisation.

          -  Planned endovascular treatment for CVT or surgical treatment for other diseases.

          -  Conditions associated with increased risk of bleeding.

          -  History of symptomatic non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage with increased risk of
             recurrence according to investigator's judgment.

          -  Treatment with an antithrombotic regimen for an indication other than CVT and
             requiring continuation of that treatment for the original diagnosis.

          -  Severe renal impairment(CrCL&lt;30mL/min).

          -  Active liver disease (ALTâ‰¥ twice the upper limit of normal).

          -  Preganancy, nursing or planning to become pregnant during the trial.
