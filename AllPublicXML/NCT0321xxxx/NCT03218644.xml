      Introduction: Neck pain is among the most common and costly for industrialized societies. It
      is difficult to know the exact structure causing the pain so most are considered as
      non-specific neck pain. There is a correlation between the alteration of craneocervical
      proprioception and neck pain. The evidence for treatment with proprioceptive exercises is
      very limited.

      Objective: To know the efficacy of a proprioceptive exercise program for neck pain and to
      compare its effects with a cervical mobility program.

      Materials and Methods: Subjects between 18-65 years old with traumatic or non-traumatic neck
      pain are included. They will be randomized into two groups of exercises: proprioception or
      mobility, which will be developed over a period of two weeks, every day, with a total of 10
      sessions per patient.
