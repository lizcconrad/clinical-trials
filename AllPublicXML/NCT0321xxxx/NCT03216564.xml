  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) develops in nearly 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus. Diabetic nephropathy is caused by damage to the small blood vessels in the kidneys
      due to uncontrolled blood sugar levels, which mean that the kidneys become less effective at
      filtering urine. This is associated with albuminuria (protein in the urine). Treatment with
      some drugs reduces the loss of albumin through the urine and delays disease progression.
      There is increasing evidence that vitamin D could also be important in management of diabetic
      kidney disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of a combined
      regimen of calcitriol (active vitamin D) and established drugs for diabetic kidney disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test the efficacy and safety of a combined regimen of calcitriol
      and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in
      type 2 diabetes subjects with albuminuria. In the proposed study, the bioactive form of
      vitamin D (calcitriol) is being used for its ability to synergize with ACEI or ARB and
      prevent renal disease progression. The study expands on preliminary studies demonstrating a
      reduction in proteinuria with vitamin D analogue treatment, in subjects with both diabetic as
      well as non-diabetic kidney disease.

             hypoglycaemic agent for at least 6 months after diagnosis 2.2. Subjects will be
             considered to have newly established T2DM if the diagnosis of diabetes was diagnosed
             with a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or haemoglobin A1c is &gt;6.5% in
             the past 6 months
