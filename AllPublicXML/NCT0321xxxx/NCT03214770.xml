    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical study. 48 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of deep carious
      molars without pulpal lesions were randomized to one of two treatments: Patients treated with
      Light-cured calcium silicate (Theracal) liner, or treated with light-cured calcium Hydroxide
      (Biner LC) liner. Both two Treatments are with the step-wise excavation Technique.

      Treatment will be done at baseline, collecting dentin sample before application of liner
      material, then patients will be dismissed with Resin-modified Glass Ionomer restoration and
      recalled after 6 months. Re-entry of tooth required for completing the step-wise excavation
      technique collecting the second dentin sample after this time interval (6 months) and
      permanently restore tooth with composite restoration. Dentin samples will be
      microbiologically analyzed and the results will be statistically calculated.

      1. Study setting:

           This study will be carried out on adult patients attending to the operative clinic in
           The Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt. The procedures will be
           carried out by postgraduate student Hanaa Mohamed Morsy [B.D.S. 2011 from Misr
           University for Science and Technology] without an assistant.

        2. Variables of the study: A total of 48 carious lesions will be included in the study.
           Divided into two groups 24 each. Thus 48 dentin samples will be collected from each
           group (24 pre-operative dentin sample and 24 dentin sample after 6 months
           post-operative)

        3. Trial Description:

           • Grouping of participants: Patients will be diagnosed to find carious molars reaching
           dentin level. Participants will be divided to two groups randomly according to the type
           of liner that will be placed and sample of dentin that will be taken before placement of
           liner and after placement (6 months); D1 Dentin sample before and after treatment with
           light-cured Calcium Silicate (Theracal) {n=48}, and D2 Dentin sample before and after
           treatment with light-cured Calcium Hydroxide ( Biner LC){n=48}.

           • Intervention/ Control: The procedure will be formed by removing the caries tissue till
           reaching dentin, leaving the deep layer for the application of the step-wise technique.
           Dentin sample will be taken by a spoon excavator for both groups and stored in a media
           to be transferred to the microbiological lab for analysis at the time baseline of the
           study (T1). Liner will be applied in the cavity for Group D1 using Theracal, and D2
           using Biner LC. For both two groups, molars will be restored with Glass Ionomer
           restoration at the time baseline. Patients will be recalled after 6 months for the
           re-entry of the restored teeth , removing the Glass Ionomer restoration and collect the
           dentin sample (T2) for evaluation of the microbiological count. Finally restoring the
           teeth with Composite as the final permanent restoration. the procedure will follow the
           manufacturer's instructions for every material used.

           • Outcome: The outcome will be the bacterial count of Streptococcus Mutans of the dentin
           samples collected from the tooth included in the study. Agar Diffusion test and Digital
           Colony Counter will be conducted for the study. The measuring unit of the bacterial
           count is CFU/ml. The first dentin sample will be collected in the baseline time and the
           second dentin sample after 6 month for each group.

           • Randomization: Randomization will be done according to a check list done by a dentist
           other than the researcher including the number of participants divided into 2 subgroups
           denoting with letter A, B.

           • Microbiological analysis: Samples will be vortexed for 15 s, diluted, and measured
           aliquots of the dilutions will be cultivated in duplicate in 3 different culture media.
           Mitis Salivarius agar supplemented with sucrose and bacitracin will be used for counting
           of mutans streptococci . For isolation of lactobacilli, Rogosa selective Lactobacillus
           agar will be used. Counts of total colony forming units (CFU) will be obtained by
           culture in brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood and enriched with
           k-hemin vitamin. The Mitis Salivarius will be incubated under CO 2 conditions at 37 0C
           for 48 h. Colonies of mutans streptococci will be counted based on their morphology and
           confirmed with catalase test. Rogosa SL Agar and the BHI will be incubated anaerobically
           at 37 8C for 72 h. The BHI will be also incubated aerobically at 37 8C for 48 h to
           determine the total aerobic counts (AE).

           • Sample size calculation: The aim of this study is to evaluate the antibacterial action
           of TheraCal (light-cured Calcium Silicate base/liner), comparing this material with
           Calcium Hydroxide paste. If the expected clinical differences in bacterial count by
           digital colony counter, agar diffusion test is 1± 1. Using power 80% and 5% significance
           level , we will need to study 17 in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis
           that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal. This number
           is to be increase to 24 in each group to compensate for possible losses during follow up
           according to Petrou et al., 2014. The sample size was calculated by PS program.

           • Recruitment: Announcement to residents of outpatient clinic in Conservative Dentistry-
           Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine- Cairo University Egypt, to screen adult patient
           during diagnosis for their chief complain so patients with at least one carious teeth
           with no pulpal symptoms will be enrolled in this study, if they meet the eligibility
           criteria.

           • Allocation:

             1. Sequence generation :

                -Randomization is done by computer software www.random.org.

                -The sequence generates 2 codes (A and B). Sample size 24 in each group to
                compensate for possible losses during follow up.

             2. Allocation and concealment arrangement:

                - A checklist will be designed by a dentist other than the researcher to identify
                each material specimen

             3. Implementation :

                -Allocation sequence will be generated at the Center of Evidence Based Dentistry,
                Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine - Cairo University.

                -Participant enrollment will be done by the principle investigator.

                • Blinding: It will be a single-blinded study so that the participant will be
                blinded, the researcher and the data analysis will be unblinded.

                • Data collection methods: There will be a file for each participant includes
                his/her( informed consent, the 2 time interval appointments, all data including
                address, phone numbers) and all information that will be needed for follow up.

                while for non normally distributed numeric variables will be done by Mann-Whitney
                test. Comparisons between categorical variables will be performed using the chi
                square test. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically
                significant. All tests will be two tailed.( Petrou et al., 2013)
