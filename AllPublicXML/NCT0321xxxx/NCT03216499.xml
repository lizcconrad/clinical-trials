  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well HIF-2 alpha inhibitor PT2385 works in treating patients
      with recurrent glioblastoma. HIF-2 alpha inhibitor PT2385 may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy of HIF-2 alpha inhibitor PT2385 (PT2385) as measured by
      radiographic response rate (by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology, RANO, criteria) in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy of PT2385 as measured by progression free and overall survival in
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      II. To determine the safety of oral PT2385 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of PT2385 in patients with
      recurrent glioblastoma.

      II. To describe baseline intratumoral hypoxia using novel, advanced magnetic resonance
      (MR)-based neuroimaging sequences in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      III. To explore genetic polymorphisms involved in the metabolism of PT2385.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive HIF-2 alpha inhibitor PT2385 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years and
      every 6 months thereafter.
