  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out the differential expression profiling of microRNA
      before and after adiministration of dexmedetomidine in patients undergoing procedures, and
      then investigators will do some in vitro studies to validate the functions of the microRNA.

      Background and objective: The use of dexmedetomidine may have benefits on the clinical
      outcomes of cardiac surgery. MicroRNAs are non-coding RNA sequences that act as regulators of
      gene expression. Investigators conduct a study to determine the role of microRNAs in
      cardioprotection mediated by dexmedetomidine.

      Methods: In this study 3 patients were selected. The blood sample were taken before
      administration of dexmedetomidine.Investigators infused loading dose of dexmedetomidine for
      10 minutes and maintaining dese of dexmedetomidine for 20 minutes.Thirty minutes after the
      administration, another blood samples were taken and stored in the liquid nitrogen and both
      the samples were marked. Those sample were analyzed for differentially expressed microRNA
      with Exiqon miRNA Array.
