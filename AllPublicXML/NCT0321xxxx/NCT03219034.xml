  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of the two leading oral appliances (OAs) designs
      for the treatment of severe obstructive sleep apnea in overweight adults. The effectiveness
      of OAs has come under question since different designs are combined in evaluating treatment
      efficacy, for example when comparing them to continuous positive airway pressure Due to the
      wide range of reported efficacy (53 to 90%), it is of great value to identify the most
      effective design to guide sleep practitioners and patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two prominent oral appliances used in treating obstructive sleep apnea differ in their
      designs, mid-line traction versus bilateral thrust. From a clinical perspective, it is
      important to know which design is superior and should be the 'treatment of choice' for
      improving airway function and sleep quality. These two designs differ in their protrusive
      mechanisms that are categorized in general under four main types: bilateral compression,
      bilateral thrust, midline compression and mid-line traction. Although the two designs
      considered in this proposal have undergone the most rigorous testing individually, well
      controlled 'head-to-head' trials as proposed here have not been conducted to determine their
      efficacy within a single test population.
