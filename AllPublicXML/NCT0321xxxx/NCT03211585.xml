    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further quantify the safety and effectiveness of the
      Syneron-Candela long pulse-duration, extended sub-pulse, larger spot-size prototype Perfecta
      V-Beam, 595nm laser system for the treatment of facial redness associated with flushing and
      blushing, or rosacea. The Perfecta laser system is expected to provide effective treatment of
      rosacea with less bruising or purpura and greater effectiveness than previous generation
      systems. This study should enable optimization of treatment parameters for using the Perfecta
      595nm laser for treating rosacea.

    <description>This s a single study and a prototype of the FDA-cleared, flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser, that is currently on the market, that has evolved over almost 25 years of continuous development. The broad-spectrum flashlamp pumps energy into a cavity containing liquid dye. The dye is excited resulting in the emission of 595 nm orange light.</description>
