  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between January and December 2012, a total of 40 patients underwent GLP. The study will
      assess subject excess weight loss (%EWL) following the study procedure at 3, 6, 12, 36 and 60
      months.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient characteristics extracted from the medical records included age and gender. A
      detailed height and weight history was collected to reflect BMI, excess weight, %EWL, and
      %BMI before LGP and after 3, 6, 12, 36 and 60 months.

      The institutional review board approved the present study.

    <description>The procedure begins with division of the greater curve vessels from 4 to 5 cm proximal to the pylorus to the angle of His. Either ultrasonic energy or bipolar cautery is appropriate for this step.
The greater curvature of the stomach is separated from the greater omentum using a harmonic scalpel starting approximately 3cm from the pylorus and ending at or near the angle of His. As needed, adhesions to the posterior surface of the stomach may be transected.
At least two rows of at least five continuous stitches will be placed laparoscopically about the greater curvature of the stomach starting at or near the angle of His and ending in the antrum</description>

    <description>All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. All patients underwent 2-row gastric plication. Dissection was started at the greater curvature of the stomach in contact to the gastric wall from prepyloric area to 2-cm proximal to the Hiss angle preserving the anatomy of Hiss angle. All vessels along the greater curvature were separated using LigaSure (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). The greater curvature (from the perimeter) was invaginated using 2 rows of 00 prolene or 00 nylon sutures. Two layers of plication were performed with continuous sutures with 1 surgical sting in all patients to prevent any displacement of inverted folds such as eversion outside or intussusception into esophagus or pylorus. All sutures were extramucusal to avoid their absorption by gastric acid. Finally, a tube shaped stomach was achieved in which the greater curvature was inverted in to the stomach.</description>
