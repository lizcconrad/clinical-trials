  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in neonatal intensive care have dramatically increased the survival rate of
      extremely premature infants but the number of survivors with severe morbidity and lifelong
      neurodevelopmental impairment remains high. Perinatal white matter injury is the predominant
      form of brain injury in premature infants, often leading to adverse neurodevelopmental
      outcome. Intrauterine and neonatal infection and inflammation have been identified as major
      risk factors of neonatal brain injury. The fragile gut microbiome of premature infants seems
      to play an important role in health and disease as distortions of the microbiome occur prior
      to sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Furthermore, the close link of the gut microbiome to
      neurological and psychiatric diseases in animal models suggests that the microbiome may
      influence brain maturation and development in preterm infants. Recent studies have underlined
      the importance of regulatory T cells as well as γδ T cells in brain injury, which can be
      directly influenced by the gut microbiome. It is therefore likely that an underdeveloped or
      distorted gut microbiome affects host immune response and may be a risk factor for
      neurodevelopmental disabilities in extremely premature infants who are already challenged by
      the unphysiologic early extrauterine environment after premature birth which affects
      maturation of the gut microbiome and immune system as well as neurophysiological maturation
      alike.

      Therefore, the overarching aim of the PreMiBraIn study is to elucidate the role of the
      gut-immune-brain axis on neonatal brain injury and its impact on long-term neurodevelopmental
      outcome of extremely premature infants. The study cohort will consist of a total of 60
      extremely premature infants with a gestational age &lt; 28 weeks and birth weight &lt; 1000 grams.
      The investigators seek to characterize the orchestrated dynamics of the maturation of the gut
      microbiome and the subsequent impact on maturation of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms
      as well as neurophysiological maturation and neurodevelopmental outcome. Furthermore, the
      investigators will assess the value of the microbiome as a prognostic indicator for neonatal
      brain injury as well as short- and long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of extremely
      premature infants.

      This goal will be achieved by state-of-the-art techniques using 16s rRNA gene sequencing of
      the gut microbiome, holistic analysis of T cell biology using flow cytometry, whole
      transcriptome analysis and proteomics as well as neurophysiological measurements
      (amplitude-integrated EEG, near-infrared spectroscopy, visual evoked potentials) and cranial
      MRI of extremely premature infants. Short- and long-term neurological outcome will be
      investigated using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition at one and two years
      corrected age, and Kaufmann-Assessment Battery for Children at five years of age. The
      investigators expect to find microbiome signatures that are predictive for later
      neurodevelopmental disabilities which may then be used for early screening and intervention
      and may suggest personalized therapeutic options. The prospects of precision medicine
      targeting the gut-immune-brain axis in extremely premature infants hold the opportunity to
      improve the overall outcome of these high-risk patients.
