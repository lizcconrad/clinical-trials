  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate dissemination strategies to support the
      uptake of evidence-based programs and policies (EBPPs) for diabetes prevention and control
      among local-level public health practitioners. Dissemination strategies such as multi-day
      in-person training workshops, electronic information exchange modalities, and remote
      technical assistance are hypothesized to associate with improved access and use of public
      health evidence and organizational supports for program and policy decision making based on
      evidence-based public health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence-based public health approaches to prevent and control diabetes and other chronic
      diseases have been identified in recent decades, and could have a profound effect on diabetes
      incidence and quality and length of life of those diagnosed. However, barriers to implement
      approaches continue because of lack of organizational support, limited resources, competing
      priorities, and limited skill among the public health workforce. The purpose of this study is
      to determine effective ways to promote the adoption of evidence based public health practice
      related to diabetes and chronic disease prevention and control among local health departments
      (LHDs). This stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial aims to evaluate active dissemination
      strategies on local-level public health practitioners to increase adoption and use of
      evidence-based programs and policies for diabetes and chronic disease prevention and control
      among LHDs in Missouri. Twelve LHDs will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of three
      groups that cross over from usual practice to receive the intervention (dissemination)
      strategies at 8-month intervals; the intervention duration for groups ranges from 8 to 24
      months. LHD staff and the university-based study team are jointly identifying, refining and
      selecting dissemination strategies. Intervention strategies may include multi-day in-person
      training workshops, electronic information exchange modalities, and remote technical
      assistance. Evaluation methods include surveys at baseline and at each 8-month interval,
      abstraction of LHD chronic disease prevention program plans and progress reports, and social
      network analysis.
