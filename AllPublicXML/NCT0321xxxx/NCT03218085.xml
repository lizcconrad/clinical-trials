  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical biopsies will be collected from women aged 18 and over whom are virally suppressed
      and taking tenofovir as part of their antiretroviral therapy regimen. Blood plasma,
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and cervicovaginal swabs will also be collected.
      Drug concentrations, hormone concentrations, inflammatory cytokines, and vaginal microbiome
      will be evaluated to understand the role of hormones, inflammation, and the microbiome in
      modulating drug efficacy in the female genital tract.
