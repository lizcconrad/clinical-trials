      Post-Operative Pain After Uniportal Vats Lobectomy: Does A Smaller Incision Result In Better
      Recovery?

      Postoperative pain control remains one of the most common problems after major lung
      resection. Pain is considered a major independent factor responsible for increased
      perioperative morbidity and mortality: in particular, in patients with preoperative
      compromised clinical conditions. In fact, acute pain may compromise the patient's
      mobilization and the secretion's clearance with secondary possible bronchial obstruction and
      parenchymal lung infection.

      Today, the treatment of postoperative pain after lung resection is based on association of
      the pharmacological therapy, including systemic use of opioids and non-steroid drugs,
      epidural analgesia, intercostal nerve block and cryoanalgesia with the minimally invasive
      surgery, like use of mini-thoracotomy, a thoracoscopic approach or intercostal nerve
      protection with the use of muscle sparing. In the literature, reduced tissue damage
      consequent to the use of limited surgical approaches is reported to be significantly
      effective in decreasing early postoperative pain. Thus, the use of a minimally invasive
      surgery for lung resections has proved to produce more tolerable pain and allow quicker
      functional recovery and lower postoperative complications. The aim of this prospective
      randomized study was to evaluate the equivalency of a smaller incision (4 cm) when compared
      to a longer length (8 cm) of incision performing uniportal VATS lobectomy in terms of
      postoperative pain results. Primarily, to evaluate the differences of operative time between
      the groups.

      Secondly, to investigate the differences of pain scores between the two groups and the impact
      of pain reduction on functional results.
