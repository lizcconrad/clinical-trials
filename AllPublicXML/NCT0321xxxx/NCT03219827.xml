  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severity of allergic reactions are highly variable from one individual to another, they can
      range from absent to life threatening. Allergic manifestations and specifically those of
      anaphylactic reactions are generally attributed to an IgE-dependent activation of mast cells
      and/or basophils followed by the release of histamine. Recently however evidence accumulated
      that other pathways might similarly contribute or even trigger anaphylaxis. Moreover, while
      the variance in human populations is an important subject to scientific research, medical
      practices and public health policies typically take a 'one for all' approach to disease
      management and drug development. Indeed, individual heterogeneity in the immune response can
      have a big impact on the likelihood to respond to therapy. Because of the complexity of
      immune responses in the individual and within the population, it has not been possible thus
      far to define the parameters (genetic or environmental) that define the immune system of
      allergic patients and its natural occurring variability. Thanks to the efforts that have been
      made in the framework of the Labex &quot;Milieu Intérieur&quot; study genetic, immunological and
      environmental factors have been identified that can be linked to the heterogeneity of immune
      responses in healthy individuals. By comparing these already available data from healthy
      individuals to a novel cohort of patients with defined severe allergic manifestations, we
      will be able to identify for the first time immunological and environmental parameters that
      are common to patients with severe allergies and identify those parameters that distinguish
      allergic patients from the healthy donor cohort. This analysis will thus open new
      perspectives on deregulated immune pathways in allergic patients allowing to orient future
      treatment approaches. Furthermore, comparing immune responses before and after
      allergen-specific immunotherapy will help understanding, which changes in immune responses
      are causal to a successful treatment. Importantly, this analysis will shed light on the
      individual differences that may predict the outcome of treatment approaches and propose novel
      markers of its success.
