      The primary aim of the proposed study is to assess the efficacy of PST for positively
      impacting distressed military family caregiver's burden, and depression levels, ultimately
      enhancing their mental health QOL (primary outcomes). Data will also be collected to
      characterize physical and social stressors for these caregivers such as illness that limits
      the caregiver's activities, new household management and caregiving responsibilities,
      satisfaction with social roles and activities, lifestyle constraints, the quality of the
      marital relationship, perceived social support, and demographic factors. A secondary aim of
      the proposed study is to determine which of a series of key caregiver sociodemographic
      factors moderate PST- intervention efficacy for caregiving burden and mental health QOL
      outcomes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered the &quot;signature injury&quot; of recent
      conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, with 22% of returning troops experiencing a TBI. After
      receiving acute and rehabilitative healthcare services, Veterans with TBI are typically cared
      for at home, by their female (79%) parent (62%, 32% spouses), and the majority (60%) of these
      caregivers receive little or no help from others with their caregiving responsibilities. Not
      only is TBI a well-documented risk factor for dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD) later in
      life, noteworthy similarities exist between the experiences of family caregivers of Veterans
      with TBI and caregivers of civilians with AD. Symptoms of TBI are very similar to AD and
      include cognitive impairment (deficits in memory, language, attention, and/or planning),
      difficulty communicating, poor impulse control, and poor emotion regulation. Both conditions
      necessitate adaptation to emotional and behavioral changes in the injured family member, and
      personality changes may result in relationship strain between the injured person and his or
      her family caregiver. Similar to AD, symptoms of TBI do not lessen over time, are often
      perceived as burdensome, and are associated with negative mental health outcomes in their
      family caregivers. Similarly, both AD and TBI family caregivers report additional stressors
      (e.g., continuous monitoring for unpredictable behaviors and their consequences) when
      cohabitating with the impaired or injured family member for an extended period of time.

      Objective/Hypotheses: To improve the mental health of family caregivers of Veterans with TBI,
      the proposed study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of an evidence-based, short-term (9,
      60-mintue session), solution-focused, self- management intervention utilizing problem-solving
      therapy (PST) to lessen burden and depression levels, and improve the quality of life (QOL)
      in co-residing family caregivers of Veterans with TBI (military family caregivers). PST is
      based on the premise that real-life problem-solving plays an important role as a mediator of
      the relationship between stressful life events and negative mental health outcomes. When
      deficits in problem-solving lead to ineffective coping attempts, under high levels of stress
      exposure, burden and depression is likely to ensue. Building on our previous work with
      caregivers of civilians with mild cognitive impairment (a proposed precursor for AD) and
      early-stage AD, it is hypothesized that military family caregivers receiving PST training
      will endorse lower levels of caregiving burden and depression, and improved mental health
      QOL, at each follow-up assessment, than caregivers in the comparison (usual care) group.

      Specific Aims: The primary aim of the proposed study is to assess the efficacy of PST for
      positively impacting distressed military family caregiver's burden, and depression levels,
      ultimately enhancing their mental health QOL (primary outcomes). Data will also be collected
      to characterize physical and social stressors for these caregivers such as illness that
      limits the caregiver's activities, new household management and caregiving responsibilities,
      satisfaction with social roles and activities, lifestyle constraints, the quality of the
      marital relationship, perceived social support, and demographic factors. A secondary aim of
      the proposed study is to determine which of a series of key caregiver sociodemographic
      factors moderate PST- intervention efficacy for caregiving burden and mental health QOL
      outcomes.

      Study Design: A randomized controlled trail design (intention-to-treat model) will be used to
      evaluate the effects of an individualized PST-based intervention on burden, mental health,
      and well-being outcomes in family caregivers of Veterans with TBI. We expect to enroll and
      randomize 100 family caregivers of Veterans with TBI from the Joint Forces Explosive Ordnance
      Disposal (the disarming and disposal of bombs) Warrior Foundation and Boulder Crest Retreat
      for Wounded Warriors family caregiver websites. Caregivers assigned to the PST group will
      receive nine PST training sessions (each approximately 60 minutes) delivered face-to-face
      every two weeks (to allow time for problem solving efforts and scheduling conflicts) using
      study-specific webcams (part of the Study Welcome Kit). Software will be utilized that
      permits recording and saving of intervention sessions for review (to ensure treatment
      fidelity over time). Outcomes will be collected through the Internet (to enhance the study's
      sustainability and scalability) and measured baseline, and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-mos.
      post-intervention.

      Study Relevance: Since family caregivers constitute the largest group of adult care providers
      in the United States and the market value of family caregiving exceeds that spent on formal
      health and nursing home care, the mental health and well-being of family caregivers of
      Veterans with TBI - and their subsequent ability to assist wounded Veterans at home (e.g.,
      prevent institutionalization of injured/impaired Veterans) - is of paramount importance. If
      the PST-based intervention reduces burden levels and improves mental health aspects of QOL in
      military family caregivers, the data will be used to lay the foundation for offering PST-
      based mental health services for distressed family caregivers of Veterans with TBI through
      the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers.

    <measure>Change in Mental health quality of life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Overall mental health quality of life (QOL) will be measured with the mental health component of the Medical Outcomes Survey (MOS), Short Form-12 Version 2 (SF-12v2). MOS-SF-12V2 is a multipurpose survey of health related quality of life (both physical and mental) and a practical tool for directly linking norms from large population surveys with the results from more focused RCTs. Both Mental Component Summary Scores (MCS) and Physical Component Summary Scores (PCS) were shown to have high internal consistency reliability (alpha &gt; .80).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression symptom levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D) is composed of 20 items, each response corresponds to the frequency of the symptom in the preceding week, higher score indicate more severe depressive symptoms. A cutoff score of 16 or greater is indicative of individuals at high risk for clinical depression. The CES-D demonstrated high internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .91) in our feasibility study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived caregiver burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived caregiving burden will measured with the Montgomery's Subjective Burden Scale (SBS). The SBS includes a series of 13 questions to establish how the caregiver feels about caring for their family member with dementia. The SBS demonstrated sound psychometric properties in the feasibility study (Cronbach's alpha = .95) and preliminary data shows variability in responses for the target population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Caregiver burden associated with frequently occurring bothersome behaviors (exhibited by the care recipient)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Frequently occurring and moderately to severely bothersome behaviors exhibited by the care recipient will be measured with the Revised Memory and Behavior Problem Checklist (RMBPC). The RMBPC evaluates the frequency of 40 possible behavioral problems exhibited by the care recipient over the past week, as well as the extent of the caregiver's reaction to such behaviors. Preliminary data suggests that this measure accurately identifies behavioral disturbances associated with dementia caregiver reactions to such behaviors. Reliability alphas of the RMBPC ranges from .84 to .91 when used in our pilot work. The original RMBPC format will be modified to include an open-ended question to determine if the care recipient exhibited bothersome and bothersome behaviors that were not covered in the measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Coping Resource - Problem Orientation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6, &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Problem orientation will be assessed with the Social Problem Solving Inventory - Revised: Short Form (SPSI-R: S); which assesses two dimensions of problem solving orientation (positive and negative problem orientation) and three styles of problem solving. A positive problem orientation (PPO) is the extent to which an individual appraises a problem as solvable and believes in one's ability to solve problems successfully. In contrast, a negative problem orientation (NPO) reflects extent to which an individual appraises a problem as unsolvable or doubts one's ability to solve problems successfully. Cronbach's alpha was .60 for the PPO subscale and .73 for the NPO subscale in our preliminary work.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Aspects of QOL - Overall</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 3, 6 &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Physical Aspects of QOL will be assessed with the physical component of as measured by the SF-12v2. Both Mental Component Summary Scores (MCS) and Physical Component Summary Scores (PCS) were shown to have high internal consistency reliability (alpha &gt; .80).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Aspects of QOL - Activity Limitations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp;12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Aspects of QOL will also be assessed with one study-specific item in the sociodemographic questionnaire (are your activities limited by illness?)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Aspects of QOL - Caregiving Tasks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Aspects of QOL will also be assessed with.a questionnaire about the number of new household and personal care responsibilities (Tasks) the caregiver has assumed since their loved one was diagnosed with a TBI. On the Tasks inventory, caregivers indicated which of 11 household (e.g., managing finances, shopping, making appointments) and personal management tasks (e.g., preparing meals, running errands) and which of 8 nursing-related tasks (e.g., helping with medications, help with mobility) they perform for their loved-one with a TBI.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Social Aspects of QOL - Lifestyle Constraints</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery Objective Caregiver Burden Scale will be used to determine perceptions of lifestyle constraint related to caregiving responsibilities (e.g., time, privacy, money, and leisure activities). This scale demonstrated sound psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha .91) when used this measure with new family caregivers of persons with mild cognitive deficits. In the current study, participants rate eight items concerning the degree to which aspects of their life were affected by their loved one's TBI (1 = little or no restriction; 5 = a large degree of restriction).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Social Aspects of QOL - Quality of the Marital Relationship</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of the marital relationship will be evaluated using the Dyadic Adjustment Scale-Short Form (DAS-S). The DAS-S is a 20-item self-report measure of marital quality that yields a summary score, with higher scores indicating better marital quality. Cronbach's alpha in the subsample of married caregivers was .89 in the feasibility study sample.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Social Aspects of QOL - Perceived Social Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Provision Scale (SPS) will be used to assess the caregiver's level of perceived social support. The SPS consists of 24 items, measuring 6 components of social support (Guidance, Reassurance of Worth, Social Integration, Attachment, Nurturance, and Reliable Alliance). A total perceived social support score is computed by summing the subscales. In the feasibility study, the SPS Cronbach's alpha for the total score was .93.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Coping Resource - Perceived Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months &amp; 12 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived self-efficacy will be measured with the Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (CSES). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the CSES revealed three factors: use problem-focused coping (α = .91), stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts (α = .91), and get support from friends and family (α = .80). Internal consistency and test-retest reliability are strong for all three factors.</description>
