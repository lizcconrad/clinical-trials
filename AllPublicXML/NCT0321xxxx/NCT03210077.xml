  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The critically ill patient is one of the most complex cases with regard to the optimization
      of the anesthesia, as well as postoperative management. One of the most important steps in
      the complex management of such patients is the modulation of anesthesia for every patient
      needs. We start with the assumptions that the optimization of anesthesia should depend on
      each patient, being conducted in an individual manner. We also believe that by
      individualizing the anesthesia by monitoring the entropy it is possible to obtain an
      appropriate management regarding hemodynamic complications during anesthesia including
      tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension and hypertension.
