  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematologic malignancies are neoplasms that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.
      Hematological malignancies are the most common forms of leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, with
      numerous subtypes. The general symptoms of leukemia are fatigue, increased susceptibility to
      infection, bleeding, and the formation of bruises easily. Typical lymphoma symptoms are night
      sweats and involuntary weight loss, recurrent fever, fatigue, and itching. Myeloma patients
      often have bone pain, fatigue, anemia, hypercalcemia or infection symptoms.

      Adverse effects of hematologic malignancies and treatments cause abnormality in physical
      function and quality of life. Treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation, which may have side effects on the body systems are used in early
      or late period. The most common side effect due to chemotherapy is fatigue. Vomiting, weight
      loss, anemia, depression, decreased aerobic capacity, loss of muscle strength, decreased
      physical functioning and deterioration in the quality of life are indirect side effects seen
      in patients.

      In the literature, side effects of hematological malignancies have been investigated after
      treatment in patients. However, no study investigated exercise capacity, quality of life,
      physical activity level and pulmonary functions on newly diagnosed hematologic malignant
      patients. Therefore, the investigators aimed to compare aforementioned outcomes in newly
      diagnosed hematologic malignant patients and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to sample size calculation 30 newly diagnosed hematologic malignant patients and 30
      healthy individuals will be included. Before treatment submaximal exercise capacity, physical
      activity, quality of life, pulmonary functions, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength,
      respiratory muscle endurance, dyspnea and fatigue perception, anxiety and depression will be
      evaluated. Primary outcome measurements are exercise capacity, physical activity, quality of
      life, secondary outcomes are respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, respiratory muscle
      endurance, pulmonary functions, dyspnea and fatigue perception, anxiety and depression.
