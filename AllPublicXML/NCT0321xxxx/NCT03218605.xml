  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that a decreased blood flow is a risk factor in the occurrence of
      Achilles tendon (AT) injuries. Based on the current literature, no consensus was reached as
      to the most solid warming-up of the AT. Therefore, knowledge about activities which increase
      blood flow in the AT could be useful in the development of a solid warming-up programme for
      the AT. The aim of this investigation was to define the influence of different kinds of
      physical activity on the vascularisation of the AT in a healthy asymptomatic population.
      Subjects performed five activities in randomized order: running, static stretch, dynamic
      stretch, cycling and rope skipping. The vascularisation of the AT of the dominant limb was
      measured with the non-invasive oxygen-to-see (O2C) device. Blood flow was measured before,
      immediately after, five and ten minutes after activity to investigate the duration of the
      vascular response to activity.
