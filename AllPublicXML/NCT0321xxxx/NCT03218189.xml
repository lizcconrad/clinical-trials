  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a model list of more than 400 medicines and
      recommends that each country adapt the list to its own circumstances. More than 100 countries
      have developed essential medicines lists.

      Some countries have essential medicines lists that are very similar to the WHO's model list
      and other countries have lists that are very different from the WHO's model list. Differences
      between the WHO list and country lists could be explained by features of the country
      including population demographics, disease prevalence, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and
      healthcare system organization. Other factors such as the influence of particular individuals
      or organizations may also explain differences between countries.

      The purpose of this project is to compare the essential medicines lists developed by
      countries with the WHO's model list and to identify attributes of countries that are
      associated with differences from the WHO list. Predictors such as region, population, life
      expectancy, infant mortality rate, GDP per capita, health expenditure per capita, inequality,
      and the corruption perception index will be considered.

      Statistical analysis plan for objective 3 (relationship between the total number of
      differences and country features)

      Plots will be generated to show the relationships between variables. Correlation coefficients
      will be calculated where appropriate. Two separate multivariate models will be fit to the
      data for outcomes 2a and 2b [continuous, between 1 and 500]. A similar model will be fit the
      total number of differences. The analytical method will be determined by the data and may be
      liner regression.

      Predictors:

      Region-Categorical (6)

      Population-Continuous

      Life expectancy-Continuous

      Infant mortality rate-Continuous

      GDP per capita-Continuous

      Health expenditure per capita

      Inequality-Continuous

    <description>The total number of differences between the WHO model list of essential medicines and the essential medicines list in each country is comprised of:
number of WHO model list medicines not on country list including the number of substitutions within class (i.e. a medicine on WHO list not on country's list but a similar agent in the same class is on the country's list); and the
number of medicines on the country list but not on the WHO model list.</description>
