    <textblock>
      The objective of this open-label multicentric study is to determine the adrenal suppression
      potential and the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of halobetasol lotion (HBP) applied twice
      daily for up to two weeks in subjects aged 12 to 16 years 11 months with stable plaque
      psoriasis. Subject enrollment will continue until at least 20 subjects with both screening
      and end of study (EOS) serum cortisol data (pre- and pos-tcosyntropin stimulation) have
      completed the study without any significant protocol violations (evaluable subjects). This
      may require the enrollment of approximately 25 subjects.

      This is an open label, multicenter study of an investigational formulation of HBP Lotion,
      0.05% in male and female subjects aged 12 to 16 years 11 months with stable plaque psoriasis.
      Approximately 25 subjects with stable plaque psoriasis on at least 10% of their BSA
      (excluding the face, scalp, groin, axillae and other intertriginous areas), who fulfill the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled at multiple study sites. All subjects will have
      a screening CST to assess their HPA axis response at Visit 1 (Screening Visit).

      Enrollment into the treatment phase of the study should be timed such that the screening CST
      will be performed a minimum of 20 days before Baseline Visit. At Visit 2 (Baseline), eligible
      subjects with normal adrenal function will be eligible to participate in the study.

      Subjects will apply HBP Lotion, 0.05% to all psoriasis plaques identified at Visit 2 twice
      daily (approximately every 12 hours) for the assigned treatment period or until the
      investigator verifies the subject's psoriasis has cleared. The study is designed to determine
      the adrenal suppression potential and pharmacokinetic properties of the test article after
      the subject applies a maximum of approximately 50 grams per week for up to a two week
      treatment period. All subjects will have a CST to reassess their HPA axis response at EOS (or
      earlier if the investigator verifies the subject's psoriasis has cleared). In this study, an
      abnormal Hypothalamujs Pituitary Adrenal axis response to 0.25 milligram dose of cosyntropin
      is defined as a post-CST serum total cortisol level of less than equal to18 μg/dL.

      Eligible subjects will have blood drawn at Screening for baseline drug concentration in
      plasma. On Day 8, all subjects, regardless of lesion clearance, will have blood drawn for
      assessment of trough drug concentration in plasma. At the Day 15 visit, subjects who have
      continued to treat lesions will have a final PK blood sample collected approximately 12 hours
      after their Day 14 evening application and just prior to the initiation of the CST.

             participation.

          4. Subject has used any phototherapy (including laser), photochemotherapy or systemic
             psoriasis therapy including methotrexate, retinoids, cyclosporine or biologics within

          6. Subject has had prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet
             radiation within 30 days prior to the initiation of treatment or is intending to have

             the subject's disease.

          7. Subject has used topical psoriatic therapy including tar, anthralin, retinoids,
             vitamin D analogs (e.g., Dovonex®) within 14 days prior to the initiation of treatment
             with the test article.

          8. Subject has used emollients/moisturizers on areas to be treated within one day prior
             to the initiation of treatment with the test article.

          9. Subject is currently using lithium or Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine).

         10. Subject is currently using a beta-blocking medication (e.g., propranolol) or
             angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril) at a dose that has

         16. Subject has an irregular sleep schedule or works night shifts (cortisol levels exhibit
             physiological diurnal variation).

         17. Subject has a screening Cosyntropin Stimulation Test (CST) with a post 30-minute
             stimulation cortisol level of less than equal to 18 μg/dL.

         18. Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to comply with the requirements of
             the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, drug dependency, mental incapacity) in
