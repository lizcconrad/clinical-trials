  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After subtotal colectomy, 40% of patients report abdominal pain, gas and diarrhea, and poor
      quality of life; whose etiology is unknown. We determined whether small intestinal bacterial
      (SIBO or fungal overgrowth SIFO) could cause these sympotoms (&gt; 1 year).
