  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, double-blinded study. The present study consisted in applying Stroke volume
      variation fluid guided therapy to old patients (65 years old) undergoing radical resection of
      colon surgery. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of norepinephrine and
      phenylephrine in treating perioperative hypotension, and to find the safest and most
      effective vasopressor for elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid management has a great influence on patient's morbidity, mortality and on the overall
      outcome.Goal directed therapy was proved by multiple studies to be a goal therapy in
      maintaining a stable hemodynamic state. Nevertheless, as the population worldwide is aging,
      elderly presenting for surgery are also increasing. This population is known for the multiple
      comorbidities and physiological changes which makes them prone to dehydration and
      hypotension. That's when we are going to use either Norepinephrine in one group or
      Phenylephrine in the other and compare the effects of both vasopressors.

      Parameters we are going to use are: Hemodynamic (HR, MAP, CO, CI, SVV, SV); Tissue
      Oxygenation and perfusion (DO2, VO2, ERO2, CRT, Lactate, blood gas); Urine output.
