  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Fast-Track SBIR project is designed to address the critical need for an effective
      primary prevention approach for prescription drug abuse (PDA), an urgent public health crisis
      in the United States. The project involves developing and testing an innovative new approach
      to the primary prevention of PDA among high school students utilizing e-learning and small
      group facilitator-led intervention modalities. The intervention is an adaptation of the
      evidence-based substance abuse prevention approach called Life Skills Training (LST). The
      adapted intervention will address the relationship between PDA and alcohol, tobacco and other
      drug (ATOD) use and abuse; positively change social norms surrounding ATOD and PDA;
      discourage diversion of prescription medications; enhance protective factors by building
      social and self-regulation skills through interactive learning and behavioral rehearsal
      scenarios.

    <description>The investigators will assess (via questionnaire) key study variables regarding prescription drug abuse and hypothesized risk and protective factors. These outcomes will be examined and compared in both the intervention group and the control group at a post-test assessment and 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments.</description>

    <description>The proposed preventive intervention for high school PDA will (1) utilize both online e-learning modules and interactive classroom sessions to address PDA and concurrent alcohol/drug abuse; (2) positively change social norms surrounding PDA and alcohol/drug abuse; (3) challenge positive expectancies about the benefits of PDA; (4) discourage diversion of prescription medication; (5) enhance protective factors by building social, self-regulation, and relationship skills through interactive learning and behavioral rehearsal scenarios; and (6) include online booster sessions.</description>
