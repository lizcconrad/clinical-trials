    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy on patients receiving
      first-line eradication and second-line eradication including vonoprazan (Takecab) tablets
      (triple therapy) in the routine clinical setting.

      The drug being tested in this study is called Vonoprazan (Takecab). Vonoprazan is being
      tested to treat people who have gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastric mucosa-associated
      lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, stomach following
      endoscopic treatment of early gastric cancer, or H. pylori gastritis. This study will look at
      the presence or absence of new concerns regarding the safety of triple therapy with
      Vonoprazan tablets, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (first-line eradication) and triple
      therapy with Vonoprazan tablets, amoxicillin, and metronidazole (second-line eradication) for
      supplemental Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication in the routine clinical setting. The
      study will enroll approximately 500 patients.

      first-line eradication

        -  Vonoprazan 20 mg / Proton pump inhibitor

        -  Amoxicillin hydrate 750 mg

        -  Clarithromycin 200 mg

      If H. pylori eradication with a three-drug regimen comprising vonoprazan or proton pump
      inhibitor + amoxicillin hydrate + clarithromycin has been unsuccessful.

      second-line eradication

        -  Vonoprazan 20 mg

        -  Amoxicillin hydrate 750 mg

        -  metronidazole 250 mg

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan.

    <description>In participants who are determined as achieving H. pylori eradication, the proportion of patients negative for H. pylori (eradication rates) will be tabulated by first-line eradication and second-line eradication. Timeframe is defined as duration of triple therapy (7 days) and up to the time of determination of H. pylori eradication after triple therapy (approximately 2 months as maximum duration).</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Vonoprazan 20 mg</arm_group_label>
    <description>For adults, the following three-drug regimen will be administered orally at the same time twice daily for 7 days: 20 mg dose of vonoprazan, 750 mg (potency) dose of amoxicillin hydrate, and 200 mg (potency) dose of clarithromycin. The dose of clarithromycin may be increased as clinically warranted. However, dosage should not exceed 400 mg (potency)/dose twice daily. If H. pylori eradication with a three-drug regimen comprising vonoprazan or proton pump inhibitor + amoxicillin hydrate + clarithromycin has been unsuccessful, as an alternative treatment, the following three drugs will be administered orally twice daily for 7 days to adults: 20 mg dose of vonoprazan, 750 mg (potency) dose of amoxicillin hydrate, and 250 mg dose of metronidazole. Participants will receive interventions as part of routine medical care.</description>
