      The main purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of X-396(Ensartinib) capsule
      in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with
      crizotinib.While exploring the relationship between biomarkers and drug efficacy and safety.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, single-arm study in which the safety and efficacy of
      X-396(Ensartinib) will be assessed in adult Chinese patients with ALK-positive(rearrangement)
      non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with crizotinib. Approximately 144 patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC which carry ALK -rearrangement will be enrolled in
      the study.
