  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To observe the effiacay, safety and risk of developing diabetes, review the patients chars
      who had administrated or neet to administrate the Pravafenix cap for enroll period, it is an
      prospective observational study that only collect the collectable information follwoing the
      hospital visiting date from enroll point to information collecting date. There is no extra
      visit for this study.

      Observe the data which has been collected for 3 yearts every year from enroll point, if the
      patients agree to be participated in this study and are suitable in inclusion/exclusion
      criteria.

      If the lipid-lowering drugs(only Ezetimibe is possible) is add-on the Pravafenix Cap
      administrating period, it will be analyzed by laering analysis separately. But, the reason
      why it is add-on to have to be written on e-CRF.
