  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab has been established in several phase 3
      trials, there is only little documented about the long-term safety and efficacy in the
      'real-world practice' in large populations from different regions.

      Therefore the investigators evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of intravitreal
      treatment with bevacizumab by registration of best corrected visual acuity, side-effects and
      central retinal thickness as measured with the ocular coherence tomography if available. This
      will allow the investigators to compare the results of their centre with the results of
      several phase 3 trials from the literature and will guide improvements in their treatment
      protocols.
