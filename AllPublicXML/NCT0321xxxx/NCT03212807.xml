      PHASE II STUDY OF DURVALUMAB IN COMBINATION WITH LENALIDOMIDE IN RELAPSED/REFRACTORY EBV
      ASSOCIATED SUBTYPES OF DLBCL, PRIMARY CNS LYMPHOMA AND PRIMARY TESTICULAR DLBCL

      Patients with relapsed refractory subtypes of DLBCL who fulfill the inclusion / exclusion
      criteria will be recruited to this trial and treated in this open label, phase 2 trial with
      the PDL1 inhibitor Durvalumab and Lenalidomide. The combination treatment will be given from
      the time of recruitment for 6 months when Lenalidomide will be stopped but Durvalumab will
      continue for a total of 2 years. Response will be assessed by PET / CT scans as per standard
      lugano criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase II study of Durvalumab in combination with
      Lenalidomide for treatment of relapsed/refractory EBV associated DLBCL subtypes, primary
      testicular lymphoma and primary CNS lymphoma using a Simon's Two-stage Minimax design.
      Simon's two-stage Minimax design will be used to investigate if the overall response rate
      (ORR) is at least 45% against a no-interest ORR of 20%.

      In the first stage, 13 patients will be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer responses in these
      13 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 8 additional patients will be accrued for
      a total of 21 patients.This design yields a type I error rate of 5% and power of 80% when the
      true response rate is 45%.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.

          2. Be ≥ 21 years of age on the day of signing informed consent

          3. Histologically proven relapsed / refractory DLBCL classified under the following WHO
             Subtypes.

             i, EBV Positive DLBCL (of the elderly and immunosuppression associated) ii, T-cell /
             histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma iii, Plasmablastic lymphoma iv, Gray zone lymphoma v,
             Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma vi, Primary CNS Lymphoma (DLBCL) vii,
             Primary testicular lymphoma The biopsy needs to have been obtained within 3 months of
             signing informed consent.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.

          5. Patients must have received at least one course (1 - 6 cycles) of Immunochemotherapy
             for example Rituximab + Chemotherapy (CHOP or CHOP like) and must have relapsed or
             refractory disease at the time of trial entry.

          6. Patients should have been deemed ineligible or failed or refused an autologous stem
             cell transplant in situations where stem cell transplant is the accepted standard of
             care. In patients with chemo-refractory DLBCL, even if patient is suitable for ASCT,
             transplant is extremely unlikely to achieve a response and hence such patients can be
             recruited after careful consideration by the investigator in discussion with the
             treating physician.

          7. Have measureable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least two dimensions on a CT scan or MRI scan in PCNSL. Minimum
             measurement must be &gt; 15 mm in the longest diameter by &gt;10 mm in the short axis.

          8. Minimum life expectancy of 3 months.

          9. Adequate hematological function (unless abnormalities are related to lymphoma
             infiltration of the bone marrow) within 30 days prior to signing informed consent,

                  starting study therapy. She must agree to ongoing pregnancy testing during the
                  course of the study, and after end of study therapy. This applies even if the
                  patient practices complete abstinence from heterosexual contact.

               2. Either commit to complete abstinence from heterosexual contact or agree to use,

             in the study, during dose interruptions and for 30 days after discontinuation of study
             therapy, even if he has undergone successful vasectomy.

         14. All patients must:

               1. Have an understanding that the study drug could have a potential teratogenic
                  risk.

               2. Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug, during dose
                  interruptions and for 30 days after discontinuation of study therapy.

               4. Agree to be counseled about pregnancy precautions and risk of fetal exposure.

               5. Females must agree to abstain from breast feeding during the study participation
                  and for 30 days after discontinuation of study therapy.

             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).
