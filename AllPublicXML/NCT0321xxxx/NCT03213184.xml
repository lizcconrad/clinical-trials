  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The environment during the prenatal period and in early life is a major contributor to the
      risk of developing childhood asthma. Birth cohort studies from single research centers have
      identified several factors that affect the risk for developing childhood asthma, including
      being exposed in early life to allergens, pollutants, viruses and bacteria, and psychosocial
      stress. Despite such advances, further progress in understanding the root causes of asthma
      have been hampered by the small size of previous studies, which makes it difficult to: 1)
      identify asthma risk factors with certainty, 2) know how environmental factors across the
      United States (U.S.) affect asthma, and 3) whether there are critical ages when pregnant
      mothers, infants and young children are particularly susceptible to these influences.
      Furthermore, different research groups tend to use different methods to study asthma, making
      it difficult to either compare or pool findings. One other challenge is that there are
      several types (i.e. phenotypes, endotypes) of childhood asthma, but these are poorly
      understood. To help overcome these challenges, investigators leading 12 asthma birth cohorts
      across the U.S. have established the Children's Respiratory Research Workgroup (CREW)
      consortium. CREW proposes to identify specific types of childhood asthma, develop an
      understanding of what early life environmental influences cause these different types of
      asthma and when, and identify targets for future efforts aimed at preventing childhood
      asthma.

      CREW is an NIH-funded project consisting of 12 individual U.S. birth cohorts and two
      scientific centers working together to identify phenotypes and causes of childhood asthma.
      CREW will include data from a large number of children (over 9,000 at birth, 6,000-7,000 who
      are still being followed, and at least 5,667 expected to enroll in CREW) and their families,
      with broad diversity in terms of ethnicity, family characteristics, neighborhoods and
      geographic locations. One of the primary goals of CREW is to put together sets of data and
      samples of participating cohorts to identify phenotypes of childhood asthma (i.e. specific
      subtypes of asthma that can be distinguished by clinical features such as natural history,
      triggers, exacerbation frequency, concurrent allergies, lung function, sex, etc). As we
      obtain mechanistic insights about personal and early life risk factors, we will connect
      asthma phenotypes with underlying causes and pathogenic mechanisms to define endotypes of
      childhood asthma.

        CREW consortium represent a diverse national sample of children and families recruited over
        the past 30 years into 12 early life and birth cohort studies that focused on asthma. The
        total combined study population is 8,985 at the time of birth. The study population is
        quite diverse in terms of current age (ages &lt;1 through 36 years), date of recruitment
        (1980-2017), race/ethnicity, and risk of asthma. There is considerable variation in the
        geographic locations of participants, with representation from East Coast (Baltimore,
        Boston, New York City), Midwest (Cincinnati, Detroit, Madison, Marshfield), South
        (Nashville, St. Louis) and West (Tucson). Most children are healthy (control population)
        while some have asthma or some form of allergic disease.
