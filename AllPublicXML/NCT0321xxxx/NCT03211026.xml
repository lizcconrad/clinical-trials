  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better estimate the prevalence of urinary tract infections
      (UTI) in kidney transplant (KIT) recipients, and especially multidrug resistant (MDR)
      bacteria. KIT recipients have a higher risk of UTI over the 6 first months following the
      transplantation. Urine culture was done in a city lab or at hospital. Current data on
      bacteriuria and candiduria lead mostly to hospital data that are incomplete..

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of UTI after a kidney transplantation is higher than in the general population. MDR
      bacteria, such as extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)-producing enterobacteriaceae or MDR
      Pseumomoas aeruginosa are emerging threats due to antibiotic selective pressure.
      Epidemiological data are mostly data from hospital laboratories that do not show a complete
      overview of the current situation. In addition, the different centers which participated to
      this study received before the beginning of the study a protocol to avoid carbapenem use. The
      main objective of this study is to assess the prevalence of MDR bacteria in an adult
      population of KIT recipients. Through this study, the management of UTI in KIT recipients
      will be improved. Data on bacteria or yeasts responsible for UTI (identification, resistance
      profile), antibiotic use, patients' outcome, and graft outcome will be collected.
