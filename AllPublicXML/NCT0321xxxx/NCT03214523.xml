  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is a clearly necessary neurobiologic process that influences innumerable aspects of
      basic daily functions, physical health, and mental well-being. Recent literature shows that
      college students across the country are experiencing high rates of sleep deprivation.
      Interestingly, some recent studies have implicated this sleep loss in contributing to weight
      gain that occurs in the first year of college, also known as the &quot;freshman fifteen.&quot; Rates of
      depression and other mental health issues, which are closely connected to sleep disturbances,
      are also on the rise in college campuses. The majority of the sleep data obtained in this
      population has been via questionnaires and self report, and the studies usually include
      college students at all seniority levels (e.g., freshmen, sophomores, seniors). Here, the
      investigators outline a novel study investigating how sleep time changes in college freshman,
      and how it relates to multiple different aspects of their health and functioning over the
      course of one quarter.

      As technology has advanced, the ability to easily obtain objective measurements of different
      health parameters has increased dramatically. The investigators plan to use wireless
      actigraphy devices to measure sleep over a baseline seven day period in college-bound UCSD
      students prior to matriculation, and for 2 additional seven day periods during the first
      quarter of college. To the knowledge of the investigators, this is the first study to
      directly measure sleep time in college freshman in their normal environment. Effects of sleep
      time loss will be evaluated through multiple different metrics of physical and mental health.
      Given the recent link between sleep disturbances and weight gain in college freshman, the
      investigators will plan to measure weight changes prior to entering college and at two
      different time points through the first quarter. The investigators will use the PSQ-9 and
      GAD7 batteries as measures of mental health, obtained at the same time points as the sleep
      and weight information. As one of the primary consequences of sleep deprivation is on
      neurocognition in the daytime, the investigators plan to measure vigilant attention using
      psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT) as well. Screen time use has recently been targeted as a
      possible contributor to sleep loss in adolescents as well as adults and is something the
      investigators will attempt to measure as well using a smartphone application. Finally, this
      project will test the efficacy of a one hour sleep education intervention on improving total
      sleep time.

      To the knowledge of the investigators, no other studies have closely examined how total sleep
      time changes during the first year of college in freshman in relationship to weight and
      mental health parameters, nor has PVT been done in this context. Additionally, with the
      increasing concerns regarding screen time use in adolescents and young adults, this study
      provides prime opportunity to examine this issue in the context of sleep.
