  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized crossover study evaluates the plaque and
      gingivitis reducing capacity of Cetylpyridium Chloride (CPC) chewing gum, with mechanical
      oral hygiene. The study will enroll 73 students, faculty, and staff from the UTHealth School
      of Dentistry. Half of the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to get the CPC gum
      in the first treatment period (21 days), a wash-out period of 21 days, and then a placebo gum
      in the second treatment period (21 days). The other half will be assigned to follow the same
      schedule but with the treatment reversed. A statistician will perform the randomization.
      Primary outcomes are assessed by validated tools, such as the Plaque Index (PI), Gingival
      Index (GI), and percent of bleeding sites on probe (BOP).

    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque will be assessed using the Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index(Turesky, Gilmore, and Glickman 1970), where a score of 0 to 5 will be assigned to each facial and lingual non-restored surface of all teeth that are present with the exception of third molars at baseline and week 3 of the study, as follows:
Scores Criteria 0 No plaque
Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth
A thin continuous band of plaque (up to one mm) at the cervical margin of the tooth
A band of plaque wider than one mm but covering less than one-third of the crown of the tooth
Plaque covering at least one-third but less than two-thirds of the crown of the tooth
Plaque covering two-thirds or more of the crown of the tooth</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gingivitis</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Gingivitis will be assessed using the Gingival Index (GI), where a score of 0 to 3 will be assigned to six teeth, representing six segments of jaws, at baseline and week 3 of the study according to the following criteria:
Scores Criteria 0 Absence of inflammation.
Mild inflammation - slight change in color and little change in texture.
Moderate inflammation - moderate glazing, redness, edema, and hypertrophy. Bleeding on pressure.
Severe inflammation - marked redness and hypertrophy. Tendency to spontaneous bleeding. Ulceration.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding sites on probing (BOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percent of bleeding sites on probing (BOP)(Ainamo and Bay 1975) as described in Ainamo &amp; Bay, 1975, where each of 4 gingival areas (disto-buccal, midbuccal, mid-lingual, and mesio-lingual) around each tooth will be light probed and scored from 0 to 2 as follows:
Scores Criteria 0 Absence of bleeding after 30 seconds
Bleeding after 30 seconds
Immediate bleeding</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Discoloration of teeth</measure>
