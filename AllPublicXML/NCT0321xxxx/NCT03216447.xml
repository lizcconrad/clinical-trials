      A study of patient adherence and convenience to immunosuppressive agents in newly liver
      transplant recipients - a prospective, multi-center, open-labeled, randomized clinical trial
      for comparison between once-daily early conversion and twice-daily tacrolimus formulation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, multi-center, open-labeled, randomized study to investigate adherence of
      administration of once-daily tacrolimus formulation (Advagraf®) in newly Taiwanese (Chinese)
      liver transplant patients. The procedure of liver transplantation will follow the
      site-specific procedure. Each subject will be randomized on postoperative day 15 (POD15;
      defined Day 14 +/- 1)
