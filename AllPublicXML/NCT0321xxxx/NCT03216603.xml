    <textblock>
      Health literacy refers to personal and relational factors affecting a person's ability to
      acquire, understand and use information about health and health services. In a need
      assessment study it was found that, the health services need to focus on health literacy
      factors in the follow up of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      Thus, this project evaluate the effect a of a health literacy partnership health promotion
      intervention (hospital, municipalities, university) after discharge from hospital with the
      use of motivational interviewing and tailored follow-ups on re-admission, health literacy,
      self-management quality of life and cost in people with COPD compared with usual care.
