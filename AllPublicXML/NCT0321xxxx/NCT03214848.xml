  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective study evaluating the impact of a brief contraceptive
      education intervention with optional referral for financial counseling on post abortion
      long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) uptake and contraceptive use at three months post
      abortion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As repeat unintended pregnancy and abortion remain public health challenges, increasing
      long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), specifically intrauterine device (IUD) and
      contraceptive implant, use among women presenting for abortion care is a priority. Despite
      its efficacy and safety, LARC methods remain underutilized in the abortion setting.

    <measure>Proportion of Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) methods used in the intervention and standard of care arms three months post abortion.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months post abortion.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome is inclusive of immediate initiators and those who initiate by three months. Proportion of LARC methods used in the intervention and standard of care arms will be calculated based on the 3-month follow-up phone interview.</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness analysis of the study intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months post abortion.</time_frame>
    <description>The cost-effectiveness analysis will involve multiple parts. The study team will initially complete a cost description of the interventions involving time spent in developing the scripts for LARC education and financial counseling, and additional time spent making contact with women and providing the augmented counseling compared to the initial pre-communication session.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the intervention overall will be calculated compared to a 'base-case' of standard of care in the primary analysis. This value will provide cost per additional women using LARC. In a secondary analysis, the study team will compare differences between women receiving the educational component only versus 'base-case', and also women receiving the educational and financial counseling component versus 'base-case'.</description>
