    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the utility of d-cycloserine (DCS) for enhancing the effect of
      a novel psychosocial intervention, imagery rescripting (ImRs), in adult women with mild to
      moderate PTSD symptoms after experiencing sexual assault or interpersonal violence.
      Participants will receive 4 sessions of either cognitive behavioral therapy with imagery
      rescripting or cognitive behavioral therapy with imaginal exposure and will receive study
      medication (DCS or Pill placebo) prior to Session 2 and Session 3.

    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this proof-of-concept-study is to investigate the utility of d-cycloserine
      (DCS; a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist) for enhancing the effect of a novel
      psychosocial intervention, imagery rescripting (ImRs).

      ImRs is a therapeutic technique that has shown positive outcomes for people suffering from
      PTSD and as an adjunct to CBT for PTSD. Patients are asked to recall their memory of a
      specific traumatic experience, and then to imagine an intervention that changes the course
      and outcome of the event to produce a more satisfying result. It is hypothesized that
      reconsolidation of the trauma memory is the mechanism of ImRs. DCS augments exposure therapy
      but also appears to enhance reconsolidation of memory. We hypothesize that DCS will enhance
      the effect of ImRs by incorporating safety cues into the trauma memory.

      Sixty women with PTSD symptoms due to a sexual assault or interpersonal violence at least
      three months prior to intake will receive 4 sessions of either: CBT + ImRs, or CBT + imaginal
      exposure (IE). In sessions 2 and 3, participants who receive CBT with ImRs will be randomized
      to receive either DCS or placebo (PLA). Participants who receive CBT with IE will receive a
      placebo pill prior to sessions 2 and 3.

      We hypothesize that DCS + ImRs sessions will enhance treatment outcome by facilitating
      reconsolidation of the trauma memories incorporating new safety cues. We also hypothesize
      that ImRs + PLA will provide equal or better outcomes as the IE + PLA condition.

      The primary outcome measure will be improvements in PTSD symptoms, as assessed at baseline,
      post-treatment and at 1-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures will be self-report
      questionnaires assessing depression symptoms, general psychological complaints, sleep
      quality, quality of life, and PTSD cognitions.

             3 months prior to intake, with a primary subclinical psychiatric diagnosis of
             post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as measured by the CAPS-5 (structured clinical
             interview to assess for PTSD according to the DSM-5). Eligible participants will have
             a CAPS-5 score of mild or moderate.

          -  Physical examination and laboratory findings within normal limits, as determined by
             the study nurse.

          -  Willingness and ability to participate in the informed consent process and comply with
             the requirements of the study protocol.

          -  Potential subjects must have sufficient command of the English language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A lifetime history of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, psychosis, delusional disorders
             or organic brain syndrome; past history of reported or current seizures; use of
             Isoniazid (a particular antibiotic); cognitive dysfunction that can interfere with
             capacity to engage in therapy;

          -  A history of substance or alcohol dependence (other than nicotine) in the last 6
             months (or otherwise unable to commit to refraining from alcohol use during the acute
             period of study participation). The acute period of study participation is defined as
             during their visit and 24 hours before and after their visit.

          -  Patients with significant suicidal ideation or who have enacted suicidal behaviors
             within 6 months prior to intake will be excluded from study participation and referred
             for appropriate clinical intervention.

          -  Patients cannot be taking psychotropic medication during the study period. They have
             to be off psychotropic medication for three weeks.

          -  Participating in ongoing exposure-based psychotherapy for PTSD or psychodynamic
             therapy focusing on exploring specific, dynamic causes of the traumatic symptomatology

          -  Serious medical illness or instability for which hospitalization may be likely within
             the next year. For example, if people are currently in a treatment for cancer, or
             people that are waiting for organ donation. This decision would be determined by our
             medical staff during the eligibility screen.

          -  Patients with a current or past history of epilepsy or seizures.

          -  Patients who have experienced any cardiac event. Patients with clinically significant
             abnormalities in vital signs (e.g., systolic blood pressure &gt;150 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure &gt;100 mm Hg) at screening will be excluded from further study
             participation and referred for appropriate clinical management.
