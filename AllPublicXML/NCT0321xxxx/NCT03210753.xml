      Background and objective

      The introduction of a proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has significantly improved response
      rates and overall survival in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), and it has soon become the
      cornerstone of treatment in both newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory settings. However,
      the incidence of peripheral neuropathy related to bortezomib (BiPN) is unignorable and which
      becomes an obstacle during treatment with bortezomib, either alone or in combination. Until
      now, there are no consistent findings regarding the risk factors that may cause BiPN. There
      is either lack of large scale study of BiPN in Taiwan. This study aims to clarify risk
      factors of BiPN using retrospective analysis in a large cohort with longer observation period
      as well as the relations between BiPN and gene polymorphisms, and to compare different routes
      in the incidence of BiPN.

      Methods

      This is a retrospective cohort study with a sample size of about 400 MM patients treated ever
      with at least one full cycle of bortezomib in the institution. All the patients enrolled need
      to be adults (â‰§20 years ) with measurable M-component in either blood or urine. The
      investigators will perform a retrospective chart review to collect clinical data, including
      anti-MM and concomitant medications, to evaluate the incidence and severity of BiPN in this
      cohort, as well as any meaningful risk factors contributed to BiPN. The investigators also
      plan to perform genotyping for the possible genetic factors associated with development of
      BiPN.

      Expected contributions

      The successful collaboration between clinical hematologist-oncologist and biopharmaceutical
      researcher would result in the concrete evidence of efficacy and safety of bortezomib in
      Taiwanese patients with MM. The findings in this large cohort study will unveil the risk
      factors of BiPN, including the administration routes and ethnicity. As results, the
      investigators would be able to provide the precision medicine-based bortezomib treatment
      strategy to MM patients in Taiwan.
