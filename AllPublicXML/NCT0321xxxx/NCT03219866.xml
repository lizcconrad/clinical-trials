    <textblock>
      This will be a non-blinded feasibility (pilot) study comparing triple therapy nebulizer vs
      dry powdered inhalers (DPI) for care transitions in COPD exacerbation patients.

      We hypothesize that patients treated in hospital and discharged on respiratory medications
      administered by nebulizers will exhibit better quality of life (QoL), symptom control, and
      lower COPD and all cause hospital readmission rates compared with patients treated with
      respiratory medications delivered by DPI.

      We aim to demonstrate that:

        1. Patients treated and discharged on nebulized bronchodilators will have fewer
           readmissions to hospital at 30 and 90 days compared to the group utilizing DPI

        2. The nebulizer group will demonstrate a longer duration of time until hospital
           readmission for COPD and all cause readmission compared to the group utilizing DPI

        3. The nebulizer group will demonstrate better QoL (measured by the SGRQ - Saint George
           Respiratory Questionnaire) and symptom control (as measured by the CAT &amp; mMRC) compared
           to the group utilizing DPI.

      Drugs used to treat COPD are available primarily in hand held inhaler devices that deliver
      dry powder (DPI), a soft mist or a metered dose of spray (MDI). The frail, arthritic elderly
      are often prescribed DPI rather than MDI or soft mist devices, because they require less
      coordination. DPIs however require the ability to inhale against a resistance with a peak
      inspiratory force (PIF) more negative than 60 L/min to break the dry powder into respirable
      particles. Preliminary data suggests that suboptimal PIF's are common during an acute
      exacerbation of COPD, affecting 48% of hospitalized patients, thus placing them at risk for
      treatment failure and possibly hospital readmission. Use of nebulizers to administer
      respiratory medications may avoid the hazards of insufficient dosing that can result from use
      of DPI however they are cumbersome, expensive and the variety of drugs available in a
      nebulizer format is limited. We hypothesize that patients treated in hospital and is charged
      on respiratory medications administered by nebulizers will exhibit better symptom control and
      lower COPD and all cause hospital readmission rates compared with patients treated with
      respiratory medications delivered by DPI. We aim to demonstrate that 1) patients treated and
      discharged on nebulized bronchodilators will have fewer readmissions to hospital at 30 and 90
      days compared to the group utilizing DPI 2) that the nebulizer group will demonstrate a
      longer duration of time till hospital readmission for COPD and all cause readmission compared
      to the group utilizing DPI and 3) the nebulizer group will demonstrate better symptom control
      compared to the group utilizing DPI. This nonblinded feasibility (pilot) study will enroll
      100 patients hospitalized for an exacerbation of COPD who are &gt; 40 years of age, have a
      clinical diagnosis of COPD. The study will consist of 3 outpatient visits (Transitional Care
      Visit [314 days after discharge], Visit #2 [30 +/5 days after discharge], and Visit #3 [90
      +/5 days after discharge]). Visit #2 and #3 are for study purposes, the Transitional Care
      Visit is standard of care. We hypothesize and aim to demonstrate that patients treated in
      hospital and discharged on respiratory medications administered by nebulizers will exhibit
      better quality of life (QoL), symptom control and lower COPD and all cause hospital
      readmission rates compared with patients treated with respiratory medications delivered by
      DPI.

    <description>The Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire measures health impairment in patients with asthma and COPD. Each component of the questionnaire is scored separately in 3 steps: The weights for all items with a positive responses are summed, the weights for missed items are deducted, and the score is calculated by dividing the summed weights by the adjusted maximum possible weight for that component and expressing the result as a percentage: Score=100 x Summed weights from positive items in that component. The Total score is calculated in similar way: Score=100 x Summed weights from positive items in the questionnaire. Sum of maximum possible weights for each component and Total: Symptom=662.5, Activity=1209.1, Impacts=2117.8, Total=3989.4 (these are the maximum possible weights that could be obtained for the worst possible state of the patient). Thus a higher score would represent a worse outcome, as the state of the patient is deemed worse than if they have a lower score.</description>

    <description>The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a patient-completed instrument that can quantify the impact of COPD on the patient's health. The CAT is a validated, short (8-item) and simple patient completed questionnaire.The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40 and a difference or change of 2 or more units over 2 to 3 months in a patient suggests a clinically significant difference or change in health status. A score of &gt;30 indicates that COPD has a very high impact on daily life, a score of &gt;20 indicates a high impact, 10-20 is medium impact, &lt;10 is low impact, and 5 is the upper limit for healthy non-smokers. A higher score would represent a poor outcome for this test.</description>

    <description>The Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, or MMRC, uses a simple grading system to assess a patient's level of dyspnea -- shortness of breath. The scale goes from 0-4 with a 0 = I only get breathless with strenuous exercise, 1 = I get short of breath when hurrying on level ground or walking up a slight hill, 2 = On level ground, I walk slower than people of the same age because of breathlessness or have to stop for breath when walking at my own pace, 3 = I stop for breath after walking about 100 yards or after a few minutes on level ground, and 4 = I am too breathless to leave the house or I am breathless when dressing. 4 would represent the worst outcome.</description>
