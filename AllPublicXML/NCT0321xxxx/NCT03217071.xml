  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized single-institution, phase II, open-label clinical trial of neoadjuvant
      pembrolizumab with or without low-dose stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT) in stage I-IIIA
      non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who are planned to undergo surgical resection of their
      lung cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two consecutive run-in cohorts will administer pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab with SRT of 12
      Gy to the lateral aspect of the primary tumor. Patients will receive pembrolizumab for 2
      cycles prior to surgery or SRT and surgery. Surgical resection of all involved areas of tumor
      will occur within 6 weeks of the last administration of pembrolizumab. It should be noted
      that surgery is expected to occur within a much shorter window and 6 weeks would represent
      the greatest allowable amount of delay.

      If during the run-in, only the pembrolizumab-alone cohort meets pre-specified safety
      parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter a larger expansion cohort, with
      treatment given according to that cohort only. If during the run-in both cohorts meet
      pre-specified safety parameters, subsequently enrolled patients will enter the expansion
      cohort and be randomized between preoperative pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab with SRT of
      12 Gy.

    <description>The primary endpoint for this study is the change in number of infiltrating CD3+ T cells/ μm2 in the lung cancer tissue from before and after pembrolizumab +/- SRT, based on quantification using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and image analysis. This endpoint was selected as a marker of T cell proliferation and activation. It is expected that immunologic activation would be reflected by the presence of this biomarker. The purpose of this study is to determine whether neoadjuvant pembrolizumab +/- SRT is sufficient to produce a two-fold change in the CD3+ T cell population, comparing pre-treatment biopsy tissue to post-treatment resection specimens.</description>

             Patients with a history of malignancy that has been completely treated, with no
             evidence of that cancer currently, are permitted to enroll in the trial if curative
             therapy has been completed, such as basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell

             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          6. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any

         10. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., less than or equal
             to Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with less than or equal to Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to
                  this criterion and may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from

             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
