      Primary Objective:

      To determine the bioequivalence of a single dose of the commercial tablet of sotagliflozin
      (test) compared to the development tablet of sotagliflozin (reference) under fasting
      conditions in healthy male and female subjects.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of sotagliflozin and its main metabolite
           sotagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide following administration of a single sotagliflozin (test)
           tablet or a single sotagliflozin (reference) table in healthy male and female subjects
           under fasting conditions.

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of a single dose sotagliflozin (test) tablet
           compared to a single sotagliflozin (reference) tablet administered under fasted
           conditions in healthy male and female subjects.

      The study duration per subject will be 36-99 days and will consist of a screening period of 2
      to 21 days, a study period of 7 days for each of four periods, and a washout of 8-21 days
      between each dose administration, and a final follow up visit 10-15 days after final dose
      administration.
