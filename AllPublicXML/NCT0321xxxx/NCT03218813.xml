  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Medication adherence following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is often sub-optimal
      and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Patients' beliefs about medications have been
      shown to predict poor adherence and may be targetable for intervention. Findings novel ways
      to improve adherence is an important area of research with widespread clinical implications.
      Pharmacists may currently be underutilised in promoting and monitoring medication-taking
      behaviour. There have been few effective interventions led by pharmacists to support
      medication adherence in patients with ACS.

      Objectives This study follows on from a feasibility and acceptability study recently
      conducted (NCT02967588). The primary objective is to pilot a pharmacist-led hospital-based
      intervention to support medication adherence following an ACS.

      Methods This study will adopt a non-randomised intervention cohort design (i.e. controlled
      before-and-after (CBA) study). Patients admitted to hospital with an ACS will be recruited
      for this study. Patients must be prescribed medicines for secondary prevention. The study
      will be delivered by hospital pharmacists over two sessions and will target both intentional
      (Session 1) and unintentional (Session 2) adherence barriers. Session 1 will involve
      eliciting and challenging patients' erroneous beliefs about medications. Session 2 will
      involve formulating specific action plans to encourage medication-taking habit formation.

      Outcome Outcome data will be collected at two time points - 6 week and 12 week follow up. The
      primary outcome of this proposed study will be treatment beliefs, measured using the Beliefs
      about Medicines Questionnaire-Specific (BMQ-S) (Horne, Weinman &amp; Hankin, 1999). Our secondary
      outcome will be self-reported medication adherence measured using the Medication Adherence
      Report Scale (MARS-5) (Horne &amp; Weinman, 2002). Depression, medicines-related self-efficacy
      and satisfaction with medicines information provision will also be measured.

      Study timeline Control cohort ('before' group): eligible patients will receive treatment as
      usual (TAU) and will complete all outcome measures (i.e. treatment beliefs, medication
      adherence). Pharmacists will then be trained to deliver the intervention. Intervention cohort
      ('after' group): eligible patients will receive the pharmacist-led intervention and will
      complete all outcome measures.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will adopt a non-randomised prospective intervention cohort design (i.e. controlled before-and-after (CBA) study). Two cohorts of patients will be recruited from a single NHS site over two recruitment periods. Pharmacists will be trained between these recruitment periods to deliver an intervention, thus creating two comparable groups (control/'before' group vs. intervention/'after' group).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention will take place during hospitalisation. Patients will complete the BMQ-S and their responses will form the basis of what will be discussed in Session 1. Pharmacists will elicit patients' thoughts and opinions about their medicines and highlight the need to take them. Any erroneous treatment beliefs will be discussed and any concerns will be addressed.
After Session 1, patients will be given a planning sheet and will be asked to think about their usual daily routine and how taking medicines may fit into it. Session 2 will focus on developing specific action plans for taking medication at home. Patients will be asked to formulate an if-then plan ('If it is time X in place Y and I am doing Z, then I will take my pill dose').</description>
