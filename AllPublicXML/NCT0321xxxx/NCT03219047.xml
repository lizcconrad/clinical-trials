  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to use xenograft models to test the effectiveness
      of certain anti-cancer drugs in relapsed (has come back) or refractory (has not responded to
      treatment) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).

      Xenograft models involve taking a piece of tissue from participant's tumor that was
      previously collected and putting that tissue inside of a mouse in the lab. This allows the
      tumor to grow in the mouse so that researchers can test the effects of certain drugs.

      In this study, researchers will test the following types of drugs in xenograft models:

        -  Drugs that are FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of MCL

        -  Drugs that are FDA approved and commercially available for other hematological
           malignancies (blood-based diseases)

        -  Study drugs/combinations that are currently being tested in other MCL clinical research
           studies at MD Anderson

        -  Study drugs/combinations that have been previously studied in other MCL clinical
           research studies

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Xenograft Models:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, leftover tumor tissue from a previous
      procedure will be collected to create the xenograft model. Information from participant's
      medical record, such as the results of recent routine blood tests, will also be collected.

      Researchers will use the xenograft models to test many types of drugs and treatment
      combinations. If the drugs have an effect on the tumor(s) in the mice, participant and
      participant's doctor will discuss if participant should receive that treatment.

      Participant's xenograft models may also be used for biomarker testing, including genetic
      biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to participant's
      reaction to the study drug(s).

      Study Groups:

      Participants will be divided into 2 groups based on their previous treatment history.

      Group 1:

      If participant has previously received ibrutinib, ACP-196, ACP-319, or BGB-3311, participant
      will be in Group 1. Group 1 participants will receive treatment based on the results of the
      xenograft model. Participant and the doctor will decide participant's treatment based on this
      information. Participant's treatment will either be standard of care or participant will
      participate on another clinical research study.

      Group 2:

      If participant has never received ibrutinib before, participant will be in Group 2 and will
      be treated with ibrutinib as part of participant's standard care.

      If the disease comes back after participant has been treated with ibrutinib and the results
      of participant's xenograft models are available, participant will receive treatment based on
      the results of the xenograft models. Participant's treatment will either be a standard of
      care other than ibrutinib or participant will participate on another clinical research study.

      If the disease comes back after participant has been treated with ibrutinib and participant's
      xenograft model results are not ready, participant will be moved to Group 1 and will continue
      to receive standard care until participant's xenograft model results are available.

      Length of Study:

      After participant has received treatment based on the results of the xenograft models,
      participation in this study will be over.

      If the disease appears to get worse and participant has been enrolled in another clinical
      research study, information about the disease and any follow-up information collected on that
      study will be collected for this study.

      This is an investigational study.

      Participant will not receive treatment directly as part of this study. If participant
      receives treatment, it will either be as part of participant's standard care or as part of
      participant's participation on another clinical research study. The study doctor will explain
      to participant which standard-of-care options are available to participant. In either case,
      participant will receive additional information at the time participant receives treatment
      about the cost of treatment and if the drug(s) you receive are FDA-approved or not.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
