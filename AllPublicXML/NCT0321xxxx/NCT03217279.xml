  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Stroke in France is about 150 000 per year. Stroke represents the leading
      cause of long-term disability. The specificity of stroke is the sequelae polymorphism that
      can occurs: physical disability, cognitive deficit and sensitive trouble. Then this large
      extend of sequelae may have a different impact on daily life. Therefore, we have to consider
      the individual's own resources and in his whole environment to face the situation. We suppose
      that each situation, each post-stroke disability will have a different social impact in
      stroke survivors and their caregivers. Nowadays, Barthel Index and Rankin scale are the
      standards for the assessment of the stroke impact on survivors' daily life. However, what is
      the real impact of an activity limitation in daily life? How consider the psychosocial impact
      of stroke only with functional indicators? For this study we will consider handicap and
      disability in a societal way. In fact, the WHO developed in 2001 the International
      Classification of functioning, disability and health that allows to bring the concept of
      participation restriction, this is to say the consequences of a disability in the real life.
      The ICF allows to bring a conceptual framework of participation restriction.

      Psychosocial consequences of stroke are relatively unknown especially in France. According to
      our hypothesis, patients with major disabilities and their caregivers will experience more
      psychosocial consequences and participation restriction in terms of emotional health, quality
      of life and burden. Also, we hypothesize that stroke severity, the typology of disabilities
      (motor, cognitive and sensorial) will have a different impact on patients and proxys' lifes
      in terms of psychosocial consequences, participation restriction and quality of life.

      TYBRA study is a prospective multicentric cohort study that mixes qualitative and
      quantitative approaches. The first aim of the quantitative approach is to explore factors
      related to patients and their caregivers at 6 months that predict participation restriction
      at 12 months post-stroke. The first aim of the qualitative study is to explore the experience
      of stroke in minor stroke patients and their proxys.

    <description>Patients will receive at home questionnaires about the psychosocial consequences of stroke for them and their caregivers at 6 months and 12 months post stroke.
Scale 2.0 at 12 months. The variable &quot;participation&quot; will be dichotomized in two scores : &lt;50 and &gt;50. A score &lt;50 means that the person presents a significate participation restriction.</description>
