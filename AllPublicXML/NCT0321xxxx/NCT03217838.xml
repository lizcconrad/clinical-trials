      This is a Phase I/II clinical study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of AZD2811 in patients with relapsed
      AML/high risk myelodysplastic syndrome or treatment-naïve patients not eligible for intensive
      induction therapy or allogeneic transplantation. The study was also explore the potential
      clinical activity by assessing anti-tumour activity in patients. The study will be conducted
      in two parts, designated Part A, dose escalation, and Part B, dose expansion.

      In Part A the dose escalation and de-escalation plan for evaluating AZD2811 will follow the
      Bayesian Adaptive Design scheme which combines prior expectations about the dose toxicity
      relationship and applies the data at the end of each cohort to recommend a dose for the next
      cohort. Patients will receive a single 2- or 4- hour IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 4 of each
      28-day cycle. Dosing frequency and schedule may be adjusted during the study on the basis of
      emerging safety and pharmacokinetic data.

      Part B will include up to 24 additional evaluable patients at the maximum tolerated dose
      and/or below, in order to further explore the tolerability, PK and clinical activity at this
      dose.
