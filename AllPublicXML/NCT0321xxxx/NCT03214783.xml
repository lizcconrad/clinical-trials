  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the facial characteristics asscosiated with the
      increased risk of coronary artery diseases. The secondary purpose is to evaluate the
      diagnostic efficacy of appearance factors for coronary artery diseases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several age-related appearance factors were described associated with increased risk of
      coronary artery diseases (CAD). However, several limitations made these facial risk factors
      hard to be utilized in clinical practice, including 1) low prevalence in CAD patients, 2)
      lack of specific definition, 3) poor reproducibility in artificial recognition.

      Thus, we designed a case-control study to explore new, common and well-defined facial
      characteristics associated with CAD and evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of appearence
      factors in CAD. We will recuit 100 patients with triple-vessel or left main diseases (3VD/LM
      group) and 400 patients without coronary lesion stenosis≥ 50% (No CAD group) judged by
      coronary computer tomography or coronary angiography. We will collect patients' baseline
      information and facial images. One hand, we will explore the facial factors associated with
      CAD by comparing the exposure rates of different facial factors in 3VD/LM group and No CAD
      group based on artificial intelligence technology. On the other hand, we will build a new CAD
      risk model by combining Framingham risk score and facial factors associated with CAD, and
      compare the diagnostic efficacy of the new model with Framingham risk score.
