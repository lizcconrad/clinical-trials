      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

        -  For Arms D-G, to establish the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
           of different treatment combinations of avelumab when administered in combination with
           checkpoint agonist(s) with or without radiation, or radiation and cisplatin in patients
           with limited, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors in order to estimate the
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

        -  To correlate pre- and post-treatment CD8 expression with clinical benefit (complete
           response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD] for &gt; 6 months).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the different treatment combinations in patients with
           limited, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors by assessing objective response
           rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 and
           immune-related RECIST (irRECIST).

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of the different treatment combinations in patients with
           limited, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors by assessing progression-free
           survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS).

             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE v4.03) from the
             effects of recent surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other

             individual participating sites.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor or CNS tumor involvement.
             However, subjects with metastatic CNS tumors may participate in this study if the
             subject is: &gt;4 weeks from prior therapy completion (including radiation and/or

          2. Major surgery, radiation therapy or systemic anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks of
             study drug administration (6 weeks for mitomycin C or nitrosoureas). Palliative
             radiotherapy to a limited field is allowed after consultation with the medical monitor
             at any time during study participation, including during screening, unless it's

             not have had prior 4-1BB treatment. For Arms B and E, subjects may not have had prior
             OX40 treatment. For Arms C and F, subjects may not have had prior 4-1BB or OX40
             treatment.

             years (except basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been definitively
             treated).

          5. Clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular
             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months
             prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (&gt;/= New York Heart

          9. Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product(s) or any component in
             its formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal

         10. If in Arm G, significant allergic reaction to cisplatin.

         11. Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following: a. intranasal,
             inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular
             injection); b. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses &lt;/= 10 mg/day of
             prednisone or equivalent; c. Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions

         12. Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immuno-stimulatory
             agent. Patients with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, or hypo- or hyperthyroid
             diseases not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.

         13. Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation.

         14. Known history of testing positive for HIV or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

         15. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening (positive
             HBV surface antigen or HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening test positive).

             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade &lt;/= 2, or other Grade &lt;/= 2 not constituting a
             safety risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.

         18. Other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including colitis, inflammatory bowel
             disease, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent
             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into this study.

         19. Medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with the patient's
             participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.

         20. Pregnancy or lactation.

         21. Men whose partner is a woman of child-bearing potential, (i.e. biologically able to
             conceive), and who is not employing two forms of highly effective contraception.
             Highly effective contraception (e.g. male condom with spermicide, diaphragm with
             spermicide, intra-uterine device) must be used by both sexes during the study and must
             be continued for 90 days after the end of study treatment. Women of child-bearing
             potential is defined as sexually mature women who are not surgically sterile or who
             have not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (e.g., who
             has had menses any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

         22. A diagnosis of active scleroderma, lupus, or other rheumatologic disease which in the
             opinion of the treating radiation oncologist precludes safe radiation therapy.

         23. Has had prior radiation therapy within the past 3 months where the high dose area of
             the prior radiation would overlap with the high dose area of the intended radiation
             based on the judgement of the treatment oncologist.

         24. For Arm G, patients with disease beyond the pelvis, including but not limited to the
             para-aortic nodes as determined by PET/CT will be excluded.
