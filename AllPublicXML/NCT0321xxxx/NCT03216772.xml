      The study is designed to evaluate the safety of performing in-bag morcellation of uterus
      tissues during laparoscopic hysterectomy (LSH or TLH). Pre- and perimenopausal women, aged
      35-50 undergoing laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH) or total laparoscopic
      hysterectomy (TLH)

    <measure>The safety of using the PK MORCELLATOR in conjunction with the PneumoLiner containment device for contained cutting and extracting tissue during laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH) or total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH).</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study - approximately two years</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of using the PK MORCELLATOR within the PneumoLiner containment bag for cutting and extracting tissue during LSH or TLH procedure will be determined by the probability of failure during in-bag morcellation procedure.
Failure is defined as &quot;disruption of the isolation bag (using dye leak testing) or visible tissue dissemination&quot;.
Patient is defined &quot;success&quot; if no failure was detected as a result of the procedure.
Study safety success will be declared if no more than 1 failure (bag rapture) will be observed in 140 procedures.</description>
