    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety of the PrePex device as applied to HIV positive men by
      assessing the rate of clinical adverse events. The study will include adult, HIV + men who
      are eligible to receive the PrePex procedure per the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child
      Care (MOHCC) eligibility criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to mathematical modeling, Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) has the
      potential to have a major impact on reducing HIV incidence in areas with high HIV prevalence
      and low prevalence of male circumcision, as is the case in Zimbabwe. Male circumcision
      devices have the potential to accelerate VMMC scale-up as the procedure is faster and simpler
      and can be safely performed by nurses. However, fear of social stigma and desire to avoid HIV
      testing remain potential barriers to those HIV+ men who would otherwise seek out VMMC. Study
      subjects (n=400) are HIV+ males who elect to undergo VMMC with PrePex as a study subject, and
      healthcare workers involved in implementation of PrePex on HIV+ male subjects. The aim of the
      study is to determine if PrePex can be used safely among HIV+ men with similar rates of
      adverse events to HIV-uninfected men. If so, then the barrier of mandatory HIV testing as
      part of VMMC could be removed, encouraging more men to undergo the procedure. Determining
      PrePex safety in HIV+ men would also allow both those with unknown status and those with
      positive status to undergo MC with PrePex. Determining the barriers to performing VMMC among
      HIV+ men among healthcare workers, if any, would also inform future policy.

    <measure>Rate of adverse events among HIV+ males using PrePex device</measure>
    <time_frame>Device application through complete wound healing (up to 90 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of clinical adverse events and device-related incidents.
Clinical related incidents such as the following:
Site bleeding (bleeding that cannot be stopped with pressure of 30 seconds and requires suturing)
Penis-wide diffuse hematoma
Penis-wide diffuse edema
Incision site infection and related symptoms
Device-related incidents
Necrotic Process not initiated
Device does not remain in situ for the full 7 days (displacement)
Note: This list of AEs is not exhaustive.
Severity of AE will be determined according to PEPFAR/OGAC guidelines</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain assessment at key time points</measure>
    <time_frame>Placement through complete healing (up to 90 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Subject's subjective pain, tingling, and discomfort related to PrePex when applying the system, wearing it and removing it. This will be assessed by numeric pain, tingling and discomfort VAS scale (Pain = VAS x Duration in Minutes). Measured in the post placement recovery at 15 minutes after placement, and then 1, 2, and 3 hours post placement.
As the necrotic process initiates, it is expected that some of subjects will have temporary discomfort during the first 2 hours after deployment (hence anaesthetic cream), which vanishes thereafter for the rest of the weeklong period when the device is in place.
Some pain is expected for a short duration (about 10 seconds) when extracting the Inner Ring during the removal procedure.</description>
