  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effect of the voluntary neck extension in the
      occurrence of an increase in the pulsatility index of the right internal carotid artery in
      the amateur diver, realizing an apnea of two minutes or more.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In literature concerning apnoea, accidents have been described during neck extension.

      Accidental drowning are frequent on the French coast every year and many of them concern
      apneists victims of apnoeic blackout.

      Neck extension is thus suspected to possibly produce an apnoeic blackout at the end of the
      dive since 1965, when Sir Sciarli (diving medicine pioneer) suspected this hypothesis.

      Physiologically, during a dive in apnea, the human cardiovascular system is subjected to a
      parasympathetic dominance, via the apnea reflex and the diving reflex. This parasympathetic
      dominant could be reinforced during a neck extension at the end of snorkeling during the
      ascent.

      Hypothesis: the neck extension at the end of apnea contributes to increase the pulsatility
      index of the right internal carotid artery by vagal component and thus causes a decrease in
      cerebral blood flow and may lead to the initiation of syncope in the healthy amateur free
      diver or underwater fisherman.

    <description>To demonstrate the potential implication of cervical extension in the decrease of cerebral blood flow in amateur diver apnea by measuring the variation in the pulsatility index of the right internal carotid artery (RICAPI), by the intra-individual comparison of the RICAPI in amateur diver in rupture of apnea with neck extension (NE) versus the RICAPI of amateur diver in rupture of apnea without NE.</description>

    <description>The included subjects will make an apnea of two minutes or more, sitting on a chair with cold strips on the face, initially with the head in neutral position. Then, when they feel the end of their apnea, they will have to raise their left hand to signal it to the Doppler manipulator, who will then realize the apnea reference measurement.
As soon as this is done, the subjects will be asked to perform an extension of the neck, so as to look at the ceiling. A final measurement will then be made in apnea, the head always in extension. Subjects then resume their breathing in this same position. A final measurement will then be made.</description>
