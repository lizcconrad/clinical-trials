  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of methoxyflurane (Penthrox®) for the treatment of acute pain in children
      and adolescents from 6 to less than 18 years of age (presenting to an Emergency Department
      with minor trauma). It is conducted as part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) agreed
      with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

      The study aims to provide evidence under blinded controlled conditions that Penthrox is safe
      and effective in patients aged 6 to less than 18 years presenting to ED with pain associated
      with minor trauma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo controlled study in children and
      adolescents aged 6 to less than 18 years presenting to an ED requiring analgesia for acute
      pain, with visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 60 to 80 mm associated with minor trauma. In
      the context of the current study, minor trauma refers to &quot;a non-critical and non-limb
      threatening physical wound or injury of the tissues&quot;, such as, soft tissue injuries,
      fractures of the extremities, burns, penetration by foreign bodies, lacerations, dislocation,
      contusions, etc.

      This study will include screening and enrolment, followed by treatment and day 14 ± 2 day
      safety follow-up post treatment. The procedure for screening and enrolment including
      obtaining consent/assent is to occur on the same day. The expected duration for each patient
      in the study is up to 16 days.

      The clinician/research nurse must ascertain that the patient has not been pre-medicated with
      an analgesic within 5 hours (8 hours if diclofenac and 10 hours if oral morphine) prior to
      arrival at the ED or enrolment into this study.

      Eligible children and adolescents will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio (220 eligible patients;
      176 children and 44 adolescents) to have 110 patients per treatment arm (44 children aged 6
      to 8 years, 44 children aged 9 to 11 years and 22 adolescents aged 12 to &lt; 18 years).
      Eligible patients will receive either methoxyflurane or placebo from the PENTHROX® inhaler in
      a 1:1 ratio.

      Pain scores will be assessed using the VAS or Wong-Baker FACES® Pain Rating scale in younger
      children who cannot utilise the VAS tool. Initial pain scores to establish study eligibility
      will be measured at two consecutive time points, at least 5 minutes apart, as screening pain
      score and validation pain score.

      After randomisation, baseline (time 0) pain score will be recorded. If the baseline pain
      score falls outside the range of 60 to 80 mm on the VAS or 6-8 on WBF, the patient will be
      withdrawn from the study (randomised but not treated). Patients who have a pain score between
      60 and 80 mm on the VAS or 6-8 on WBF at screening, validation and baseline (time 0) will be
      eligible to receive treatment.

      Following enrolment and initial assessments, the research nurse will assist the patient to
      selfadminister ten successive inhalations of PENTHROX® (methoxyflurane) or placebo. The
      research nurse, the treating clinician and the patient will be blind to the treatment
      administered.

      Patients/parents/legal guardians will be advised that rescue medication will be available
      immediately on request at any time during or after the completion of the treatment. The
      rescue medication to be used will be at the discretion of the blinded clinician. The rescue
      medication is dependent on the standard practice at the participating site. For the purpose
      of being all inclusive, rescue analgesia will be intranasal fentanyl, intranasal diamorphine,
      intravenous morphine or oral morphine
