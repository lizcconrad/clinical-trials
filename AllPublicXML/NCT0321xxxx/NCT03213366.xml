  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
      of E-PrEP on reaching young men of color who have sex with men (YMCSM) at high-risk of HIV
      infection to reduce HIV acquisition. E-PrEP is a peer-designed social media-based health
      intervention to increase PrEP awareness, knowledge, and motivation as a tool for HIV
      prevention and to increase linkage to primary care.

    <textblock>
      This study examines a social media based peer-led and delivered intervention focused on
      increasing PrEP adoption in young men of color who have sex with men (YMCSM). While prior
      efficacy trials have included YMCSM 18-29, we will focus on PrEP in YMCSM outside clinical
      trial settings. Rather than an alternative medium for implementation of existing
      interventions designed for in-person contact, social media may be a true 'game changer' to
      engage hard to reach individuals. While many online behavioral interventions exist, including
      some that use social media, this will be one of the few studies to use and test social media
      to facilitate uptake of a biomedical intervention. E-PrEP will connect the target population
      (YMCSM) to a new prevention tool (PrEP) through rapid linkage to medical care, accelerating
      diffusion of PrEP. Given the paucity of data regarding social media-based interventions to
      change health-related behavior, E-PrEP may have a marked impact on future bio-behavioral
      interventions, especially those that include diffusion of innovation. Social media offers the
      power of scale and efficiency for large potential impact, even with relatively low-intensity
      interventions. Similarly, PrEP, if widely adopted in high-risk populations and offered with
      behavioral interventions, could markedly decrease HIV infection rates. Social media-based,
      peer-led approaches like E-PrEP could be used to enhance efforts by community-based and other
      organizations that employ internet-assisted or peer-outreach strategies to improve health.

      Primary Aim: To test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of E-PrEP for increasing PrEP
      adoption in a cluster-randomized controlled trial.

    <description>8 Peer Leaders (PLs) will be randomly assigned to the E-PrEP arm. Each of the PLs will recruit at least 15 participants into a private social media group on one of several social media platforms. PLs will then deliver a behavioral intervention over a 6 week period, posting information and engaging participants in a discussion about PrEP, PrEP access, and other related health issues. All contents will be formatted to be both mobile device accessible.</description>

    <description>BxNow is an attention-matched control. Eight of the 16 PLs will be randomly assigned to the BxNow arm. The BxNow campaign will be a 6-week long social media intervention about general health wellness topics chosen and administered by the PLs assigned into this arm. Similarly to the intervention group, PLs in the BxNow arm will create private social media groups and recruit participants into these private groups. General health information in the BxNow arm will be posted with the same frequency as in the intervention arm.</description>

    <description>Intervention contents and targets were informed by a systematic review of PrEP barriers and facilitators, a locally conducted qualitative study, and key informant and peer leader inputs. The contents were developed or adapted by study staff and peer leaders. Components and associated text have been designed to engage participants in online discussions about PrEP and related health and social topics. Posts will also include information about linkage-to-care, and insurance access. New contents will be posted almost daily.</description>

Contents will be developed or adapted by PLs and posted almost daily. Posts will also include information about linkage-to-care and insurance access. At the end of the intervention, BxNow participants will be exposed to E-PrEP components at the end of the trial.</description>
