    <textblock>
      This study will examine the hypothesis that altered esophageal microbiome leads to the
      development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The aims of the project are, firstly the
      confirmation of relational data on the study cohort, using the methods developed and applied
      at the laboratory at University of Queensland Diamantina Institute (UQDI). Second, to
      generate a tissue microarray resource future tissue in-situ validation of microbes. And
      finally, to develop a biobank of clinical isolates of relevant esophageal microbes for future
      functional studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD, can lead to a change of the esophagus lining to a
      protective cell type, termed Barrett's esophagus (BE). A diagnosis of BE greatly increases
      the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The incidence of EAC has been rapidly
      rising in the last 30 years, and the cancer has a high mortality rate. Understanding the
      involvement of the esophageal microbiota could lead to prevention strategies to this
      increasing health concern.

        Approximately 10 samples of 3 specific tissue types (specified as the 3 groups) will be
        collected as well as control samples. The number of patients enrolled may vary due to the
        variance of tissue type per patient. Patients will be informed that the number of patients
        enrolled will depend on the number of tissues needed for the study.
