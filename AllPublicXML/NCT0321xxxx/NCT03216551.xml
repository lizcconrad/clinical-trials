  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic mediastinal lymphadenectomy is deemed indispensable in lung cancer surgery for
      accurate staging and complete resection. However, extensive lymphadenectomy in patients
      without nodal metastasis may not improve survival and would increase operative duration and
      cause damage to mediastinal structures.Therefore the precise selection of patients without
      mediastinal nodal metastasis is the key to avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomy.The
      investigator's previous retrospective study shows tumor location and histological subtypes
      are exclusive predictors of negative mediastinal nodal disease. The current prospective
      observational study is to further verify the staging accuracy of this selective mediastinal
      lymphadenectomy strategy.

      Background:

      Complete lung cancer lymphadenectomy in patients without nodal metastasis may not improve
      survival and would increase operative duration and cause damage to mediastinal structures.The
      investigator's previous retrospective study showed tumors with adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS),
      minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) or lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA) histology
      had zero mediastinal nodal involvement. Tumors in the apical segment of upper lobes had zero
      inferior mediastinal nodal involvement.

      The current prospective, multi-center, observational study is to verify the staging accuracy
      of a selective mediastinal lymphadenectomy strategy based on intraoperative histological
      subtyping by frozen section and tumor location in patients with clinical T1N0M0 non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      Objectives:

      Primary: To determine the staging concordance rate of the selective mediastinal
      lymphadenectomy strategy with the traditional complete lymphadenectomy strategy.

      Secondary: 1. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative histologic subtyping by
      frozen section. 2. To determine the mediastinal lymph node metastasis rate in clinical T1N0M0
      lung cancer with different histologic subtypes. 3. To evaluate the pattern of mediastinal
      involvement of tumors in different lung segments. 4. To determine the mediastinal nodal
      status of tumors with different radiological features (pure ground glass opacity, mixed
      ground glass opacity and solid nodules).

      Outlines: All recruited patients will undergo complete mediastinal lymphadenectomy. For
      tumors in the left lungs, removal of mediastinal nodal stations 5,6,7,8 and 9 are required.
      For tumors in the right lungs, removal of mediastinal nodal stations 2,4,7,8 and 9 are
      required. Frozen section histologic subtyping will be made intraoperatively. By the selective
      strategy, the patients with intraoperative AIS/MIA/LPA diagnosis will be considered as
      negative mediastinal metastasis and patients with an apical tumor will be considered as
      negative inferior mediastinal metastasis. Otherwise, the mediastinal nodal status will be
      determined by the post-operative pathology. The virtual staging results of this selective
      strategy will then be compared with the final staging results by the complete
      lymphadenectomy.
