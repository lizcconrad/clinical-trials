    <textblock>
      Central venous access device (CVAD)-associated skin impairment (CASI) is a common problem in
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. In this prospective
      randomized pilot study, dressing the CVAD exit site will be compared to no-dressing with
      respect to CASI and CVAD-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) rates in adult outpatient HSCT
      recipients. The purpose of this study is to gain information that can be used to design a
      large randomized controlled trial (RCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous access device (CVAD)-associated skin impairment (CASI) is common in adult
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) recipients. CASI is defined as chemical, mechanical
      or microbiological damage to the skin occurring within a 7 cm radius of a CVAD exit site.
      CASI is associated with discomfort, complex dressing changes, and increased infection risk
      due to disruption of skin barrier function. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT) recipients receiving post-transplant care in the outpatient HSCT setting may be at
      higher risk of CASI. No-dressing of embedded tunneled CVAD (T-CVAD) exit sites may decrease
      CASI without increased risk of CVAD-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), but no studies
      have been conducted to test this hypothesis. A pilot study will determine the practicality of
      testing this hypothesis. The proposed pilot study will be conducted at an outpatient HSCT
      clinic located at a large tertiary hospital. The primary aim is to evaluate the logistics of
      comparing no-dressing to dressing in the outpatient adult allogeneic HSCT population. A total
      of 26 allogeneic HSCT recipients will be enrolled. Enrollment will commence once the
      following conditions are met: REB approval, institutional approval, and assignment of an NCT
      ID number. Eligible participants will have embedded T-CVADs, be within 35 to 60 days of
      transplant, meet criteria for neutrophil engraftment, and be without pre-existing severe
      CASI. Participants will be randomized to either a dressing or no-dressing group. A modified
      version of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) skin toxicity scale will be used to
      grade CASI at baseline and weekly for up to six weeks. Primary and secondary endpoints will
      be tested statistically to generate estimates of effect size and standard deviations, for the
      purpose of future study design. Information useful for planning large-scale studies will be
      reported, such as enrollment metrics, participant compliance, procedure fidelity, and missing
      data characteristics. Feedback will be collected from participants regarding their study
      experience.

    <measure>CVAD-associated skin impairment (CASI) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>The first CASI assessment will occur within one week of randomization. CASI assessments will be conducted every seven days with up to six assessments in total (i.e. the study follow-up period is six weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>CASI is defined as: chemical, mechanical or microbiological damage to the skin occurring within a 7 cm radius of a CVAD exit site (i.e. the &quot;CASI boundary area&quot;). Skin damage will be measured using a modified ECOG Skin Toxicity Scale. The scale has five levels of measurement with &quot;0&quot; = no CASI, and &quot;1, 2, 3 and 4&quot; corresponding to increasing levels of CASI severity. A finding of CASI of any severity will be counted as one episode of CASI. The rate of CASI will be reported as total CASI episodes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CVAD-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>All episodes of CRBSI will be captured during the six week study follow-up period.</time_frame>
    <description>CRBSI is defined as a bloodstream infection linked to a CVAD using a laboratory method with high sensitivity and specificity. In this study differential time to positivity (DTP) will be used to confirm CRBSI. Concomitant peripheral and CVAD blood cultures will be drawn at the new onset of a temperature equal to or greater than 38Â° C. A set of cultures in which the CVAD culture turns positive two or more hours before a positive peripheral culture will be considered one episode of CRBSI. The rate of CRBSI will be reported according to the number of CRBSI episodes per 1,000 catheter days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of moderate and severe CVAD-associated skin impairment (CASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>The first CASI assessment will occur within one week of randomization. CASI assessments will be conducted every seven days with up to six assessments in total.</time_frame>
    <description>All episodes of CASI that meet the modified ECOG Skin Toxicity Scale criteria for levels 2, 3 or 4 will be included to calculate the rate of &quot;moderate and severe&quot; CASI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility Outcome 1: Enrollment rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment data will be collected from the start date of enrollment until the date that the total number of required participants has been enrolled. The planned time period is 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The enrollment rate will be determined by calculating the ratio of participants enrolled to the number of potentially eligible prospective participants invited to participate. The ratio will be reported as a percentage. It will be considered a feasibility concern if &gt; 30% of potentially eligible prospective participants are not enrolled in the study.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility Outcome 2: Time to complete enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment data will be collected from the start date of enrollment until the date 26th participant is enrolled. The planned time period is 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of days from the start of enrollment to the end of enrollment (i.e. date 26th participant enrolled) will be calculated. An enrollment period that is &gt; 25% longer than 16 weeks is considered a feasibility concern.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility Outcome 4: Reasons for lack of compliance with CASI assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>CASI assessment data will be collected from the start of enrollment until the date of the final CASI assessment for the last participant enrolled in the study. The planned time period is 22 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The reasons for not completing the CASI Assessment Form will be categorized as: (1) error; (2) participant refused; (3) lack of nurse/researcher time; (4) lack of participant time; (5) participant absent; and (6) other. The frequency of each reason will be reported. A feasibility threshold has not been established for this outcome.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility Outcome 5: Total number of duplicate CASI assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>CASI assessment data will be collected from the start of enrollment until the date of the final CASI assessment for the last participant enrolled in the study. The planned time period is 22 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>A duplicate CASI assessment is scheduled to occur with every fifth CASI assessment in order to assess whether or not consistent data is captured using the CASI Assessment Form. It is possible some scheduled duplicate assessments may not occur. The intention of this outcome is to determine the number of duplicate CASI assessments performed. A feasibility threshold has not been established for this outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>CASI assessment data will be collected from the start of enrollment until the date of the final CASI assessment for the last participant enrolled in the study. The planned time period is 22 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of total discordant findings in general to total findings in general with respect to the duplicate CASI Assessment Forms completed will be calculated and expressed as a percentage. If it is found that the discordant findings rate is &gt; 10% this will be considered a feasibility concern (i.e. revision and further testing of the CASI Assessment Form is needed).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility Outcome 7: Rate of discordant findings for individual elements for duplicate CASI assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>CASI assessment data will be collected from the start of enrollment until the date of the final CASI assessment for the last participant enrolled in the study. The planned time period is 22 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of discordant findings to total findings for each element of the CASI Assessment Form will be calculated and expressed as a percentage. If it is found that the discordant findings rate is &gt; 10% for a specific element of the CASI Assessment Form, then this will be considered a feasibility concern (i.e. revision and further testing of this specific element in the CASI Assessment Form is needed).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility Outcome 8: Missing data rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected from the date start of enrollment until the date of the final CASI assessment for the last participant enrolled in the study. The planned time period is 22 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The missing data rate will be determined by calculating the ratio of missing data values to total possible data items. The result will be expressed as a percentage. Missing data &gt; 10% is considered a serious feasibility issue.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility Outcome 9: Type of missing data</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected from the date start of enrollment until the date of the final CASI assessment for the last participant enrolled in the study. The planned time period is 22 weeks.</time_frame>
