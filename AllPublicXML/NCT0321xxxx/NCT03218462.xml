  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with intellectual/developmental disabilities (ID/DD) will experience less dental
      anxiety and cooperate better in a Sensory Adapted Dental Environment (modified visual,
      sensory, and somatosensory stimuli in a regular dental setting) than in a regular dental
      environment (RDE).

      The aim of this pilot study is to determine the effect of sensory adapted dental environment
      (SADE) on reducing dental anxiety of children with intellectual and/or developmental
      disabilities (ID/DD). With the growing number of children diagnosed with ID/DD and their
      inclusion in the community, there are more opportunities for dentists to encounter this
      population for their routine oral health care. If improvement in dental anxiety and behavior
      is evident from the study, as other pilot studies have suggested, it can be applied as one of
      clinical tools for treating children with ID/DDs. Furthermore, utilization of a SADE in
      clinical training of pediatric dentists or general dentists can improve clinicians' comfort
      level in managing behavior of individuals with ID/DD. This will encourage more clinicians to
      provide care and address the unmet oral health needs of this vulnerable population.
