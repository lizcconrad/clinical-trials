      The aim of this study was to verify the clinical reliability of ankle dorsiflexion range of
      motion (ADROM) measurement with weight bearing (WB) using an app on the smartphone (iHand)
      and to verify if there is correlation between the limitation of the ADROM and the PFP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The change in lower extremity movement pattern has been previously associated with severe
      knee disorders, including anterior cruciate ligament rupture, patellar tendinopathy,
      iliotibial band syndrome, and patellofemoral pain (PFP). The aim of this study was to verify
      the clinical reliability of ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ADROM) measurement with
      weight bearing (WB) using an app on the smartphone (iHand) and to verify if there is
      correlation between the limitation of the ADROM and the PFP.

    <description>It was used the test with WB, called Lunge Test, in which each evaluator marked a point 15 cm distal to the anterior tuberosity of the tibia (TAT) with a felt tip pen. After that the smartphone (app iHand) will be placed at this point. Between each measurement, the mark was removed with alcohol 70% The demarcated point served as a guide for positioning the smartphone. In order to standardize the smartphone positioning, BHome (home button on the iPhone), was aligned with the TAT pen mark. To ensure the same distance from the foot to the test, the distance of the hallux to the wall was measured (tape measure), recorded and reused for each test.</description>
