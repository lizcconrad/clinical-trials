      The goal of this study was to examine the effect of an online educational program with and
      without a social media experience.The primary goal of this study was to determine whether
      medication adherence would be improved by having adolescents and young adults with systemic
      lupus erythematosus participate in an online educational website, with or without a social
      media experience. The secondary goal was to determine whether secondary outcomes such as
      quality of life, stress, and self-efficacy improved in this model, and whether these changes
      were associated with improvements in medication management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-management skills, including medication management, are vital to the health of
      adolescents and young adults with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Non-adherence with
      medications in patients with systemic lupus has been noted to be as poor as 40%. Success in
      disease control can be significantly impacted by such non-adherence. Poor medication
      compliance is associated with higher SLE disease activity scores and higher SLE disease
      activity in turn has been demonstrated to be significantly associated with a decline in
      quality of life. Much attention has been paid to how to improve self-management skills in
      adults, but less is known about how to target adolescents, an age group with a complex set of
      emotional and developmental needs.

    <description>Sense of agency (SOA) was measured via three Likert scale questions aimed to tap three core concepts of agency: competence (&quot;Blogging… makes me feel I have control over my own voice&quot;), assertiveness (&quot;…enables me to assert myself&quot;), and confidence (&quot;…makes me feel I have a distinct voice&quot;)</description>

    <description>Sense of community (SOC) was measured using a 22-item scale (8, 9, 20). SOC consists of feelings of belonging to the community, having influence on, and being influenced by, the community, being supported by the community while also supporting them; and feelings of shared emotional connection.</description>

    <description>Participants visited the Facinglupustogether.com website and participated in consecutive weekly modules for 8 weeks. At the end of each module there were questions pertaining to the subject of each module. The control group answered the questions in provided journals and these were sent back to the investigator. All subjects completed surveys in REDCap prior to the study intervention and again 6 weeks after study completion to assess secondary outcome measures. Medication adherence was assessed by calculating a medication possession ratio by acquiring information on fill dates at the subjects' pharmacies.</description>

    <description>The intervention phase was 8 weeks in duration. Participants visited the Facinglupustogether.com website and participated in consecutive weekly modules. 8 The SM group answered the questions at the end of each module on a blogging site with other SM participants. SM participants were encouraged to provide feedback or questions about the material or personal questions that arose in response to each module.
