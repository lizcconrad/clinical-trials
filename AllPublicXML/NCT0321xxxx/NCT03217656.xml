      The Jiaxing Birth Cohort (JBC) is the largest prospective cohort study to explore prenatal
      risk factors, early life feeding practice and growth pattern/ adiposity in Chinese
      children.Between 1999 and 2013, 338 413 mother-child pairs were recruited in Jiaxing area in
      south-east China.Children of the recruited women were followed up at 1-2, 3, 6, 9 and 12
      months of age, and subsequently followed up every 6 months to 36 months of age (toddler
      stage), and every year to 6-7 years of age before they went to school (pre-school stage).
      Follow-up rate was 70.8% at the toddler stage and 68.9% at the pre-school stage up to June
      2013.

        Between 1999 and 2013, 363 416 pregnancies were followed from initial registration to the
        end of the pregnancy, with 25 003 children born to the above women having no further
        information (registration) after the birth. Therefore, a total of 338 413 live mother-child
        pairs registered at local clinics, and were enrolled in the Jiaxing Birth Cohort.

        Among the 338 413 children, there were 332 532 singletons, 2883 pairs of twins (n = 5766),
        37 pairs of triplets (n= 111), and 1 pair of quadruplets (n = 4).
