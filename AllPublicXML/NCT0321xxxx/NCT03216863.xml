  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feasibility and impact of respiratory rehabilitation (RR) in patients with advanced or
      metastatic (EGF-R WT or mutated) non-small cell lung cancer treated with oral targeted
      therapy including Inhibitors of EGF-R tyrosine kinases (TKI) and ALK inhibitors.

      These patients will benefit, at the beginning of the chemotherapy whatever the treatment
      line, of a respiratory rehabilitation. The respiratory rehabilitation takes place at the
      patient's home with the HAD's cooperation 3 hours per week, divided into 2 or 3 sessions.
      There is associated educational, nutritional and psychological support for a total duration
      of 8 weeks.
