  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this study is to see how boys and girls aged 1-5 and coughing since 1-2 days
      due to common cold respond to a specific protective cough syrup taken before going to bed for
      one night, with respect to a similar but not specific syrup (placebo). The symptoms evaluated
      include especially cough frequency but also cough intensity, bother, and sleep quality of the
      child and parents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cough is a life saving reflex, therefore it is important, especially in pediatrics, to calm
      cough spells without sedating the reflex. Looking into mechanisms for cough management
      different from mucolytics, or sedatives, such as protection of irritated pharynx mucosa from
      post nasal drip or other irritating substances is theoretically sound and shows practical
      interesting results. A parallel comparison of efficacy and tolerability between such
      protective mechanism (acting through a barrier and radical scavenging action) due to natural
      substances (honey, plantago lanceolata and thymus vulgaris) and placebo has been looked at
      specifically on the clinically critical population of children coughing since 1-2 days and
      not more, including very young children of one year old. The intent of this study is to use
      the protective syrup versus placebo in children with moderate to severe night and daily
      cough, measured with a validated parent questionnaire. Daily cough is assessed to better
      describe and select the general condition of the child however only night cough parameters
      due to treatment are assessed. The degree of disturbance of cough is followed immediately
      after one night administration on all night parameters, with special interest to frequency.

      Assessment of effectiveness of the protective cough syrup as compared to placebo is
      considered very interesting due to the mechanism of the remedy. The study looks at the effect
      of the syrup/placebo on the first night in order to well focus the &quot;first&quot; effect of a
      treatment on the ascending phase of the illness, such as to reduce to a minimum any
      interference due to natural regression of the symptom due to illness progression.

    <description>The intervention product is a medical device in Europe due to its non-pharmacological mode of action, which makes the product compliant to the medical device definition. It is made of specific extracts of plants (plantago and thymus) which provide the product with protective characteristics of the oropharynx. These protective features enable the syrup to reduce the irritative cough promoting stimuli on the throat, which decrease urge to cough threshhold. In addition to these extract, honey completes the formula. The product does not contain any artificial component and no preservatives.</description>

    <description>The placebo intervention is a syrup of same taste and colour without the natural protective components but with the necessary synthetic preservatives and other co-sweeteners to guarantee quality and safety. The placebo has, in fact, all the features of a cough syrup since true placebo syrup is not possible in cough. The lack of specific natural protective components is weighed against the presence of other necessary substances which may still have an effect on cough, but this effect is not envisaged to be a specific protective effect.</description>
