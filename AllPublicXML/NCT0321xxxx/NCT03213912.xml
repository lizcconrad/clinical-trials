    <textblock>
      The investigators determine the half maximum effective concentration (EC50) of the Cet value
      of propofol in target-controlled infusion (TCI) when co-administered with dexmedetomidine for
      the maintenance of general anesthesia during microelectrode recording in the deep brain
      surgery in patients with Parkinson's disease.

    <textblock>
      General anesthesia is sometimes required for DBS (deep brain stimulation) surgery in those
      with excessive fear, anxiety, reduced cooperation, or severe movements due to ' off drug'
      state. Dexmedetomidine and propofol are both used individually in the sedation for DBS
      surgery, and were reported to affect the MER (microelectrode recording) to some extent,
      especially in the higher zone of the dose range. In this study, the investigators plan to use
      the combination of dexmedetomidine and propofol for the maintenance of general anesthesia in
      patients with Parkinson's disease. In this study, dexmedetomidine is given with a loading
      dose of 0.5 mcg/Kg, and continuous infusion with the dose of 0.4 mcg/Kg/hr. Propofol is given
      within 0.8~1.8 mcg/Kg during the MER recording (based on institutional guideline). MER
      recording will be observed and correlated wtih the dose of propofol. The Dixon &quot;up-and-down&quot;
      sequential allocation method was used to determine the EC50 of the value of Cet of propofol.
      The study aims to determine the dose that is adequate for maintaining general anesthesia with
      endotracheal intubation and least interference with the MER recording.
