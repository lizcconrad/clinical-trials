  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TAK-831 versus placebo on upper
      extremity (arm and hands) motor function and manual dexterity. This study will also evaluate
      the efficacy of TAK-831 versus placebo on activities of daily living (ADL) and other
      secondary assessments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is being tested to treat
      people who have Friedreich ataxia. This study will look at upper extremity (arms and hands)
      motor function and manual dexterity of people who take TAK-831. Efficacy evaluations also
      include other neurological, functional, and patient performance assessments.

      The study will enroll approximately 65 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      in a 2:1:2 ratio to one of the three treatment groupsâ€”which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-831 High dose

        -  TAK-831 Low dose

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take three tablets of high dose, low dose, or placebo twice
      a day for 12 weeks.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 13 weeks. Participants will make 5 visits to the
      clinic, and will be contacted by telephone for an exit interview no later than 7 days after
      their final visit or termination. Participants will also receive a safety follow-up phone
      call 7 to 17 days after receiving their last dose of TAK-831.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Inverse Time to Complete 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT-1) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-HPT-1 is a measure of timed upper extremity (arm and hand) function and manual dexterity. The participant picks up pegs 1 at a time (9 in total), using 1 hand only, and places them into holes on the board as quickly as possible, in any order until all holes are filled. Then, without pausing, the participant removes the pegs 1 at a time and returns them as quickly as possible. Each participant performs this task twice with each hand separately. Results on both tests are then averaged for an overall task completion time and the inverse transform is performed.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Component of the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2, 7 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ADL component of the FARS includes 9 subscales: speech, swallowing, cutting food and handling utensils, dressing, personal hygiene, falling, walking, quality of sitting position, and bladder function. Each of these subscales is rated on a 5-point scale where 0=normal to 4=severe disability/inability to carry out activity independently for a total possible score of 0 to 36, with higher scores representing greater disability/dependency.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2, 7, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The mFARS-neuro neurological examination is a clinician-rated measure based on neural substrates affected in Friedreich ataxia including: bulbar on a scale of 0-11, upper limb coordination on a scale of 0-36, lower limb coordination on a scale of 0-16, and upright stability/gait functions on a scale of 0-36 for a total possible score of 0 to 99 with higher scores representing greater disability.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline on the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2, 7, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the participant has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the participant walk back the same distance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline on the 9-HPT and T25FW Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2, 7, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>9-HPT and T25FW will be evaluated together as a performance-based composite measure. The inverse transform of each score will be computed. The inverse scores from each test are tabulated and converted to test-specific Z scores by subtracting the cohort mean from the raw score, and then dividing by the cohort standard deviation (SD) to create a Z score for the test. The composite Z scores will be created by averaging the Z scores of the individual components. A larger Z-score represents a better outcome.</description>
