          -  Subject must be willing and able to follow study procedures and instructions.

          -  Subject affected by moderate to severe peri-implant disease.

          -  Treated chronic periodontitis and proper periodontal maintenance care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects participating (currently or within 30 days prior to enrollment) in other
             clinical trials involving therapeutic intervention (either medical or dental).

          -  Subjects with poor oral hygiene as indicated by a score of greater than 50% on the
             O'Leary Plaque Index.

          -  Subjects with acute infectious lesions in the areas intended for treatment.

          -  Subjects taking chronic (i.e., &gt; 2 weeks), therapeutic doses of medications known to
             affect bone metabolism such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or
             bisphosphonates. Prophylactic aspirin (â‰¤ 325 mg q.d.) for cardiovascular indications
             will be permitted in subjects.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or sexually-active female subjects who
             are of childbearing potential and are not using hormonal or barrier methods of birth
             control. (except for when a result of pregnancy test is negative)

          -  Subjects who are on any chronic antibiotic or steroidal therapy.

          -  Smoker using more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent per day.

          -  Smoker using cigar, smokeless tobacco use or e-cigarette.

          -  Subjects taking medications associated with the development of drug induced gingival
             hyperplasia, e.g. calcium channel blockers.

          -  Subjects with radiographic evidence of pathology.

          -  Implant mobility.

          -  Subjects with parafunctional habits and not wearing bite guard.

          -  Implants with peri implant keratinized tissue &lt; 2 mm.

          -  Implants with consistent horizontal/ suprabony bone loss.
