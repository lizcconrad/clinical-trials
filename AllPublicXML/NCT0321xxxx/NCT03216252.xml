    <textblock>
      2622/5000 Mitochondrial diseases (MM) are the most common metabolic diseases. Since these
      pathologies are very heterogeneous in clinical terms, only the identification of mutations in
      nuclear genes or mitochondrial DNA confirms the diagnosis.

      The full-scale study of mtDNA by high-throughput sequencing (NGS) is a first step in the
      diagnostic approach. The recent introduction of this revolutionary new technology has greatly
      increased the efficiency of mutation identification. However, in addition to known pathogenic
      mutations, NGS reveals numerous variants whose significance is currently unknown. A major
      challenge to obtain a reliable diagnosis is therefore the interpretation of the clinical
      impact of these new rare variants which proves to be very difficult.

      Pathogenicity criteria allow the classification of variants from benign to pathogenic. One of
      the major pathogenicity criteria is a good correlation of heteroplasmic level with tissue or
      cellular involvement. Indeed, mtDNA mutations are generally heteroplasmic, which corresponds
      to the coexistence of normal and mutated molecules in the same cell or tissue, the most
      affected tissues having a high rate of mutation. On a muscle biopsy of an affected patient,
      the fibers often present an enzyme deficiency in cytochrome c oxidase (COX-negative) which
      can be demonstrated in immunohistochemistry. The single fiber study allows to isolate the
      deficient fibers and to quantify the heteroplasmic rate of a variant. The presence of a high
      level of heteroplasm in the COX-negative fibers, unlike fibers without deficit, is a strong
      argument in favor of the pathogenicity of this variant. Currently, this technique is not used
      routinely in diagnostic laboratories but only occasionally in a research framework in some
      laboratories. It is a heavy technique that consists of a first stage of laser microdissection
      of the various muscle fibers followed by a second step of quantification of the variant from
      each fiber. This second step requires a specific focus for each identified variant.

      The aim of this pilot study is to develop a new technique for quantification of single-fiber
      heteroplasmics isolated by NGS laser microdissection. This, independent of the type of
      variant, will avoid the long and costly adjustments required for each new variant identified
      and thus facilitate its use
