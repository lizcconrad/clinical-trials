  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effectiveness of ear plug, eye mask and ocean sound on sleep quality
      among ICU patients. 60 patients were randomly allocated to group 1 and group 2 by lottery
      method i.e 30 in each group. Group 1 received earplugs and eye masks on the first night
      followed by washout period on second night and received ocean sound on third night, while the
      group 2 received ocean sound on the first night followed by washout period on second night
      and received earplugs and eye mask on third night.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      a comparative study was done to assess the effectiveness of ear plug, eye mask and ocean
      sound on sleep quality.

      Ear plug used in this study is a foam earplug made from polyurethane with noise reduction
      rating (NRR=29 dB, SNR=37dB). It is inserted into the ear canal to protect the user's ear
      from loud noise. The earplug used was manufactured by 3 M occupational health and
      environmental safety division company of India manufactured in Bengalaru560.Ear plug helps to
      reduce noise intensity which helps to decrease auditory perceptual processing.

      Eye mask used in this study is a delicate dark colored cloth (black and blue) of fabric
      material, length -18.5 cm, width- 8.5cm, height- 30 millimeter filled with soft cushions like
      substance inside which cover both eyes and 2 elasticized strap that holds the mask on
      patients head which prevents incoming light away from patient's eyes and induces a state of
      pure darkness. The product detail of Eye mask was, model number-SM004 and was ordered from
      Amazon.Eye mask decreases the intensity of the light which enhances melatonin secretion
      (involve endocrine system). Additionally, eye mask helps to use of cognator subsystem as eye
      mask also helps to reduce visual perceptual processing.

      Ocean sound is a type of white noise which is a soothing sound of waves crashing on the beach
      which is provided via ear phone for 30 min. It was delivered via the android application name
      relax melodies meditation of Ipnos software. Ocean sound is a type of white noise which
      prevents intense auditory stimuli less capable of stimulating the cerebral cortex during
      sleep which helps to decrease auditory perceptual processing.
