  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 patients were selected requiring implant placement and divided randomly into two groups
      (10 in each group)

        -  for the study group, starter drill is used to locate the point of insertion as planned
           then pilot drill is also used to the full desired working length after that all other
           sequential drills are used at a low speed (50-70 rpm) without irrigation .

        -  In the study group: implant will be inserted in the low speed osteotomy site.

        -  In the control group: implants will be inserted in the conventional prepared osteotomy
           site.

        -  For both groups there is no surgical guide used.

        -  The flap will then be copiously irrigated with saline in preparation for closure.

        -  The flap will then be closed using interrupted 4/0 resorbable sutures.
