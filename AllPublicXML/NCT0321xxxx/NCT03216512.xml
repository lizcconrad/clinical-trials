      The purpose of this study is to evaluate performance on the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder ( ADHD) Battery of the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB),
      including spatial working memory, inhibitory control, and attention while using either a
      noise cancelling headphone or sham headphone control in the presence of standardized auditory
      distractors in children and adolescents with ADHD.

    <textblock>
      This will be a proof-of-concept, randomized, within-subject cross-over design with the
      administration of noise cancelling headphones or sham headphones on two separate study days.
      Following screening and a baseline assessment session with no headphones, participants will
      be assigned to complete each experimental session. During each session, they will undergo the
      CANTAB and Academic tasks. The order of sessions will be randomized and balanced across
      participants to be either noise-cancelling headphones first followed by sham headphones; or
      sham headphones first followed by noise-cancelling headphones. Eligible participants
      currently taking stimulant medications for ADHD will be asked to stop taking their medication
      on the day of the baseline visit and during the 2 experimental sessions.

          -  Age 6 to 17 at the time of parental informed consent.

          -  Male or female.

          -  Confirmed ADHD diagnosis at screening visit established via MINI-KID (version 7.0.2)
             administered by a trained clinician.

          -  Screening ADHD-RS-IV score ≥24.

          -  Estimated IQ (measured with the KBIT-2) ≥80.

             formulation), off drug on day of Baseline and Experimental Sessions. May resume
             medication after all assessments are completed on these days.

             clonidine, guanfacine).

          -  Current treatment with other psychoactive drugs.

          -  Participant is currently considered at risk for attempting suicide by the
             Investigator, or is currently demonstrating active suicidal ideation or self-injurious
             behavior, as measured by MINI-KID Suicidality Module C.

          -  Documented hearing loss.

          -  Recent history or suspicion (within the past 6 months) of substance abuse or
             dependence.
