      The clinical trial will be a prospective, two strata, non-blinded, single institution, Health
      Canada approved, Window of Opportunity trial with 2 weeks of pre-surgical endocrine therapy
      using either anastrozole or tamoxifen. Tissue from the initial biopsy and from surgery will
      be sent for Ki67 analysis using the NanoString® Assay.
