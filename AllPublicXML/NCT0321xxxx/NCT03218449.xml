  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infective complications after cancer surgery had a significant impact on disease-free and
      overall survival. Postoperative inflammatory markers have been proven useful in predicting
      infective complications. However, it remains unknown whether these markers can predict
      postoperative infection in patients receiving cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) which causes the systemic inflammatory response
      syndrome. Between September 2014 and April 2017, all patients who underwent cytoreductive
      surgery and HIPEC for peritoneal carcinomatosis were assessed for postoperative
      complications. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of infective
      complications. Presence of abscess, positive blood, surgical site, urine or sputum cultures,
      or clinical signs and symptoms with comparable radiologic findings were defined as infective
      complications. Retrospectively, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio,
      white blood cell count, platelet count, mean platelet volume, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio,
      albumin were collected from preoperative day and postoperative days (POD) 0-14.
