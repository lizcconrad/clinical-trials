    <textblock>
      This study will investigate preferences for HIV care among participants enrolled in the
      &quot;Study to evaluate the feasibility of Community-based Test and Treat strategies among men who
      have sex with men and transgender women to increase the uptake of HIV testing and treatment
      services in Thailand&quot; through a model involving linked strategies: The study takes place in
      four provinces at six sites affiliated with the Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Center (TRCARC):
      Bangkok (RSAT and SWING), Chiang Mai (CAREMAT), Chonburi (SWING and Sisters) and Songkhla
      (RSAT). These are all community-based drop-in centers, targeting MSM and TGW.

      Participants who are enrolled in the study at any of the TRCARC affiliated sites and who were
      tested HIV-positive will be invited to participate in the current questionnaire study.

      This will be a cross-sectional questionnaire study. A self-administered questionnaire will be
      used to assess their satisfaction with current clinical services, preferences for location,
      frequency and provider of HIV services, as well as expectations and concerns.

      Furthermore, staff working at the different HIV-care to community-based organizations (CBOs)
      and the health care workers providing HIV services will be invited to participate as well.
      They will also be asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire to assess knowledge and
      attitude, preferences for location, frequency and provider of HIV services, as well as
      expectation and concerns.

      All data collected, from patients, as well as from staff, will be anonymous.
