  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare but their incidence is growing. Alkylating agents (ALKY)
      are one of the main systemic treatments used, at least for advanced pancreatic NETs, with a
      response rate of 30 to 40% and a median progression-free survival of 4 to 18 months.
      Chemotherapy is one of the few therapeutic weapons, along with everolimus, somatostatin
      analogs, and metabolic radiotherapy, for pulmonary NETs, called typical and atypical
      carcinoids, even if the level of proof of efficacy for these treatments is lower than for
      pancreatic NETs. Considering the available retrospective data, O6-Methylguanine-DNA
      methyltransferase (MGMT) appears to be a predictive factor of the response to ALKY.
      Oxaliplatin (OX) has demonstrated an interesting activity, with response rates between 17%
      and 30%. In a first retrospective study we showed that Gemox is effective in NET, and more
      recently that its activity is similar to that of ALKYs, but without being influenced by the
      MGMT status. Prospective studies are needed but our data suggests that ALKY should be offered
      first to patients with methylated MGMT tumors while Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy should be
      offered first to patients with unmethylated MGMT tumors. In this project, we wish to evaluate
      the contribution of the MGMT methylation, evaluated in the tumor, in predicting the Objective
      Response (OR) in patients treated with ALKY and to carry out the first randomized phase II
      study comparing a treatment with alkylating agents to Oxaliplatin in patients with a
      pancreatic or broncho-pulmonary NET.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of tumor MGMT methylation in
      the prediction of the Objective Response (OR) at 3 months in patients treated with ALKY for a
      NET, assessed using the RECIST v1.1 criteria by centralized reading carried out by an expert
      radiologist blinded to the results of the MGMT methylation.
