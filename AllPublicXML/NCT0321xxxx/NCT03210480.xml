  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the tolerability, efficacy and safety of a new lithium
      sulphate prolonged release formulation (Lithiofor®) in patients affected by Bipolar Disorder
      poor tolerant to lithium immediate-release treatment in terms of lithium-induced tremor when
      switched from therapy with a lithium carbonate immediate release formulation (Carbolithium®)
      to a new lithium sulphate prolonged release formulation (Lithiofor®).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IV, randomized, open, parallel groups, multicentre, prospective study.

      The main purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the change in the lithium induced
      tremor when switching from Lithium Immediate Release formulation (Carbolithium®) to Lithium
      Sulphate prolonged-release formulation (Lithiofor®) in Bipolar Disorder patients, poorly
      tolerant to the Lithium Immediate Release treatment. The primary end point will be the
      reduction of the lithium induced tremor.

      Patients in treatment with lithium carbonate immediate-release (Carbolithium®), will be
      enrolled in the study and, after 1 week of maintaining treatment, will be randomly switched
      to Lithium prolonged-release formulation or will continue the previous therapy.
