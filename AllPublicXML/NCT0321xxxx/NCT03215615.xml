  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-carious cervical lesion is frequently associated with gingival recession, resulting in a
      combined lesion that has a different treatment prognosis when the two lesions appear alone.
      The literature presents few studies that propose a multidisciplinary approach (restorative
      and root coverage surgery procedures) to optimize the treatment of this combined lesion. The
      previously proposed approaches and materials have limitations and an optimal clinical
      protocol has not been established yet. Thus the aim of this study is to evaluate a novel
      multidisciplinary protocol with two resin composites and two different adhesive systems
      through a randomized clinical trial and laboratory studies. 120 combined lesions will be
      randomly assigned to one of the following groups: NP + TE (n = 30) - Partial restoration of
      cervical lesions with nanofilled composite and total-etch adhesive system and periodontal
      surgery for root coverage, NP + UA (n = 30) - partial restoration of cervical lesions with
      nanofilled composite and self-etching adhesive system and periodontal surgery for root
      coverage, MH + TE (n = 30) - partial restoration of cervical lesions with microhybrid
      composite and total-etch adhesive system and periodontal surgery for root coverage, MH + UA
      (n = 30) - partial restoration of cervical lesions with microhybrid composite and
      self-etching adhesive system and periodontal surgery for root coverage. Restorations will be
      assessed using the USPHS criteria after one week, six months and twelve months.
