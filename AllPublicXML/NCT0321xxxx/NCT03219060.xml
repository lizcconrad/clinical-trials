  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's objective was to test the efficacy, acceptability and feasibility of a
      motivational interviewing (MI) based smoking cessation intervention with nurses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the important role that health professionals have in reducing tobacco use, many have
      a smoking habit themselves. The prevalence of smoking is particularly high among nurses. A
      smoking cessation intervention for nurses who smoked, based on MI, was designed and evaluated
      following the UK Medical Research Council's (MRC) framework for complex interventions.

    <description>Intervention, four one-to-one sessions on an approximately weekly basis, with 3 components: MI context, toolkit, and relapse prevention. The sessions were embedded in a MI context and followed two phases: exploratory and resolutive. The former explored the potential ambivalence that nurses experienced and constructed motivation for change; the latter reinforced the decision to quit and developed a change plan. Participants could choose over a range of tools: some more helpful in the exploratory phase (i.e. decisional balance sheet) and others in the resolutive phase (i.e. problem solving skills). The third component was directed at maintenance strategies. The therapy stayed with the nurses in terms of where they were in relation to they readiness for change.</description>
