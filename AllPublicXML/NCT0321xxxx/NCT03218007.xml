  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One proposed strategy is the stratification of troponin-negative patients with biomarker
      testing at presentation to facilitate the clinically-appropriate rapid discharge from the
      emergency department of patients who present with low-intermediate risk chest pain, and
      conversely to triage appropriate Non sustained ST elevation acute coronary syndrome
      (NSTE-ACS) patients to Cardiology beds, stress and non-invasive imaging modalities.
      Biomarkers such as high-sensitivity troponin (hs-cTn), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein
      (H-FABP), CRP, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP); and copeptin and ischemia-modified albumin
      are an important advance for diagnostic testing for ACS (4). Regarding novel biomarker
      testing at presentation, the addition of these biomarkers demonstrated increased sensitivity
      at an acceptable QALY threshold, but more evidence is needed (5,6). A reliable method for the
      diagnosis of minimal cardiac ischemia would meet a strong demand for the sensitive diagnosis
      of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain but unremarkable ECGs and biomarkers.
      Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside cardioprotective agent. Its cardiovascular effects are
      mediated throught the activation of A2A Receptor (A2 AR) and play a major role in the
      regulation of Coronary flow CF. As altered coronary blood flow occurs in patients with CAD,
      it has been showed that that A2AR expression and functional activity play a role in CAD. In a
      previous studies the team have developped an agonist-like monoclonal antibody to study
      expression level of this receptor and their functional activity. Recently , Gariboldi
      demonstrated that measuring the expression level of A2AR on peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells ( PBMC) represents a good tool to address in situ expression in coronary tissues of CAD
      patients.

      In the diagnostic setting of ACS, expression and functionnaly activity of A2AR could be a
      sensitive detection method for ischemia. It would be a powerful tool for risk stratification
      of patients presenting with chest pain but unremarkable ECG and blood tests. the
      investigateors therefore designed a blind multicentrique prospective study to evaluate
      expression and functionnaly activity of A2AR in the management of undifferentiated chest pain
      The objective of the study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy between this novel biomarkers
      A2AR and invasive and non -invasive evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery
      disease (CAD).
