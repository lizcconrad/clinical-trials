  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of opioids facilitates angiogenesis and has a proven action in the immune system,
      mainly in the reduction of natural killer cell activity, favoring the migration of neoplastic
      cells and inhibiting humoral and cellular immunity. These factors may contribute to
      recurrence and tumor metastasis.

      Therefore, could opioid-free anesthesia help reduce tumor recurrence? This is a prospective
      randomized controlled clinical trial in which patients undergoing radical prostatectomy will
      be evaluated by conventional means, which have moderate and high D'Amico criteria for tumor
      recurrence.

      In the operating room, patients will be monitored, receive peripheral venoclysis and then
      randomized into two groups: in group I, the anesthetic induction will be done with pre
      oxygenation with 100% O2, propofol, cisatracurium, lidocaine and fentanyl; In group II the
      induction will be done with the same doses of propofol, cisatracurium, lidocaine and placebo.

      In both groups maintenance of general anesthesia will be with propofol 1% target infusion
      controlled with model of Marsh target-controlled infusion plasma between 2.0 and 3.0 mcg /
      ml, ketamine, lidocaine and dexmedetomidine.

      Both groups will receive blockade of the transverse plane of the ultrasound guided
      ultrasound, group I with placebo (saline 0.9% 20 ml on each side) and group II with
      ropivacaine 0.375% 20 ml on each side. And the postoperative analgesia will be based on
      anti-inflammatory and opioid analgesics (pca of morphine) according to the analgesic pain
      scale of the patients.

      In the postoperative period, patients will be followed up for 2 years with serial doses of
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) to diagnose tumor recurrence (2 PSA measures&gt; 0.2 ng / ml)
      and will be evaluated in relation to analgesia, need for analgesia of Rescue with morphine,
      satisfaction with the anesthetic technique, adverse effects (nausea and vomiting).

      The primary objective is to evaluate tumor biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy
      in patients undergoing opioid anesthesia compared to patients anesthetized without opioids.
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the quality of analgesia with the two techniques,
      patient satisfaction with perioperative period, quality of anesthetic recovery and adverse
      effects (nausea and vomiting, pruritus and drowsiness).

      Thus, to answer the hypothesis raised, 146 patients will be needed (73 in each group).
