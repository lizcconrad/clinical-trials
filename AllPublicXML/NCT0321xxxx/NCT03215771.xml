    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to document longitudinal outcomes in persons with traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) using the myoelectric upper limb orthosis with powered elbow and grasp
      using both patient centric performance and patient reported outcome measures. Longitudinal
      observation will allow the investigators to detect both the initial therapeutic effects as
      well as the later functional outcomes of orthosis use. The investigators plan to recruit 15
      Veterans and non-veterans who have TBI and upper limb impairment. The study requires 29
      visits over 22 weeks and is divided into four parts: enrollment, orthotic fitting,
      therapy/training (9 weeks), and home use (9 weeks). Therapeutic and functional benefits will
      be evaluated every 2 to 3 weeks over 18 weeks using simple, short clinical tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has two aims: (1) to evaluate therapeutic and neuroplastic effects of a
      myoelectric upper limb orthosis and (2) to evaluate the functional effects of a myoelectric
      upper limb orthosis. The investigators plan to recruit 15 Veterans and non-veterans who have
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and upper limb impairment, are over 18 years of age and a
      minimum of 6 months from injury. The study requires 29 visits over 22 weeks and is divided
      into four parts: enrollment, orthotic fitting, therapy/training (9 weeks), and home use (9
      weeks). Therapeutic and functional benefits will be evaluated every 2 to 3 weeks over 18
      weeks using simple, short clinical tests.

      Subjects will be enrolled in the study if they meet eligibility criteria assessed at a
      screening visit. Once enrolled subjects will be custom fit with a MyoPro Motion-G
      elbow-wrist-hand orthosis following standard clinical procedures. This process requires up to
      three visits to cast, trial fit and deliver the orthosis. Subjects will then participate in a
      standard-of-care motor learning based therapy protocol in conjunction with the PERL (&quot;Push
      Eat Reach Lift&quot;) training program recommended by Myomo, which consists of a 9 week, 18
      session training plan. Every second week, there will be one session that will combine
      therapy/training and outcomes evaluation.

      Once subjects have completed the therapy/training phase and demonstrated competency with
      orthosis use, they will start a 9 week home use program during which time they will be
      contacted by the therapist and seen as needed in the clinic to trouble-shoot any technical
      issues, monitor for adverse events and/or upgrade their home program. Every third week there
      will be one session at the clinic for outcomes evaluation.
