      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effect of consumption of aged garlic
      extract powder on 24 h systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure in hypertensive
      individuals following 8 weeks of supplementation.

      Additional secondary objectives are to assess the effects of aged garlic extract powder
      intake for 8 weeks on lipid profile (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG concentrations), blood glucose,
      office blood pressure, pulse-wave velocity and augmentation index, body mass index, and waist
      and hip circumference.

    <textblock>
      Forty hypertensive volunteers between 18 and 75 years will be recruited from the Winnipeg
      (Manitoba, Canada) area to participate in a two arm crossover, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled intervention study for 8 weeks per study period following obtainment of
      informed consent.

      The 2 periods of treatment will include:

        1. Treatment period: One capsule twice a day, providing 600 mg each of aged garlic extract
           powder, for a total of 1200 mg/day of aged garlic extract powder.

        2. Control period: The control product will be an identical-looking placebo capsules
           containing cellulose, which is being used as a filler in the treatment capsules.
