  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was an update and amplification of exposure measurements of the EPIC-Potsdam
      Study, which started in 1994-1998.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sub-study was conducted in the German Institute of Human Nutrition according to an
      approved study protocol.

      The study program included comprehensive surveys on diet and lifestyle (smoking, physical
      activity, and anthropometry). The aim was to achieve repeated measurements in a sub-cohort of
      about 600 people to validate (measurement error correction) and calibrate (adjustment of
      insufficient data collected to the actual data location) existing baseline data in the entire
      cohort (EPIC-Potsdam cohort).

      To this end, within age groups and by gender, active EPIC participants were then randomly
      selected in the years 2009 to 2012 from the cohort, contacted and invited to re-visit the
      respective study center. 816 subjects were acquired for re-examination, participation rate
      was 56.4%.

      Each participant gave informed consent. The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics
      Committee of the Medical Association of the State of Brandenburg, Cottbus, on 18/12/2009.

      The information in this section are study hypothesis and contains no results or conclusions.

    <description>Repeated 24 hour dietary recalls. Every participant provided up to three (mean = 2.99) 24 hour dietary recalls at baseline (cross-sectional analysis). The recalls were performed by trained interviewers using EPIC-Soft program and were collected within a period of 4-24 months (mean = 7). The first recall took place in person during the participants' first visit to the study center. The following two recalls took place on random days over the telephone. Food consumption was recorded in 11 eating occasions (before breakfast, breakfast, after breakfast, during morning, lunch, after lunch, during the afternoon, before dinner, dinner, after dinner, during evening) and was recorded for each food in grams per eating occasion.</description>

        Participants of the EPIC-Potsdam cohort study were 35-64 years old at recruitment
        (1994-1998). For this study (re-examination 2010-2012), participants were 47-81 years old
        (mean age 65.5, were largely sedentary and with a mean BMI of 27.5 kg/m2). Participants
        were living in the state of Brandenburg or in Berlin, Germany.
