  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two study arms. Each arm will include a 24-96 hour outpatient
      run-in period prior to their exercise visit wearing the bi-hormonal bionic pancreas. In
      random order subjects will then complete two approximately 5-hour exercise visits, one
      wearing the bi-hormonal bionic pancreas and one wearing the insulin-only bionic pancreas.

      Twenty subjects will participate in two experimental periods. Each will include a 24-96 hour
      outpatient run-in period prior to their exercise visit wearing the bi-hormonal bionic
      pancreas. This will allow the bionic pancreas to adapt to their diabetes management needs.
      After the run-in period is complete, the subjects will participate in an exercise visit
      during which they will arrive fasting and remain fasted until the visit is completed.
      Subjects will walk on a treadmill for up to 1 hour at a comfortable walking pace. Plasma
      glucose (PG) measurements will be performed frequently. In one experimental period the bionic
      pancreas will remain in the bihormonal configuration and will deliver glucagon as needed
      during the exercise visit. In the other experimental period the glucagon will be replaced
      with a placebo during the exercise visit. The two experimental periods will be performed in
      random order. The study will be performed in single-blind fashion in that the participant
      will not know whether the bionic pancreas glucagon pump is filled with glucagon or placebo
      during the exercise visits. The outpatient run-in period will always be with the bi-hormonal
      bionic pancreas delivering glucagon.

             prior to exercise

             impaired memory, unable to speak and read English)

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the judgment
             of the principal investigator, will compromise the results of this study or the safety

             marijuana without a prescription)

          -  Unwilling or unable or to avoid use of drugs that may dull the sensorium, reduce
             sensitivity to symptoms of hypoglycemia, or hinder decision making during the period
             of participation in the study (use of beta blockers will be allowed as long as the
             dose is stable and the subject does not meet the criteria for hypoglycemia unawareness
             while taking that stable dose, but use of benzodiazepines or narcotics or other
             central nervous system depressants, even if by prescription, may be excluded according

             hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver, hemochromatosis,
             glycogen storage disease) may exclude the subject if it causes significant compromise
             to liver function or may do so in an unpredictable fashion.

          -  Renal failure requiring dialysis

             myocardial infarction, proximal LAD critical stenosis (Wellen's sign), prolonged QT
             interval (&gt; 440 ms). Non-specific ST segment and T wave changes are not grounds for
             exclusion in the absence of symptoms or history of heart disease. A reassuring
             evaluation by a cardiologist after an abnormal EKG finding may allow participation.
