    <textblock>
      Intervention targets youth ages 14 - 19 participating in soccer teams. The intervention group
      will be given face to face nutrition lessons and have access to an online immersive learning
      environment. The comparison group will not. The project will test if the immersive learning
      environment is effective in preventing unhealthy weight gain.

    <textblock>
      Active youth are just as likely to develop poor dietary habits that can contribute to obesity
      later in life, after high school sports has ended. However, youth in sports may provide a key
      &quot;window of opportunity&quot; to teach them about eating health foods if that information is tied
      to sport performance. This project will test to see if that is true.

      The virtual world is an idea medium for learning for this project. The project will test
      whether it indeed can result in behavior change more effectively than just more traditional
      face to face learning.

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 12 and 24 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Intakes of fat, sugar, fruits and vegetables are measured by self-reported screener using the Block Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ). Change in intake frequencies are compared baseline, 12 and 24 months later.</description>

    <measure>Physical activity: Meet moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recommendation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 12 and 24 months later</time_frame>
    <description>MVPA is measured by total steps and minutes per day with the use of a wearable lifestyle tracker such as the Fitbit. Average steps during soccer season and outside soccer season are compared.</description>

    <measure>Sleep about 8 hours/day.</measure>
