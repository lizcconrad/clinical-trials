    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial of gene transfer for treating X-linked severe combined
      immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) using a self-inactivating lentiviral vector to functionally
      correct the defective gene(s). The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of the gene transfer clinical protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1) is a genetic disorder caused by defects
      in the common cytokine receptor chain, normally on the surface of lymphocytes. Individuals
      with SCID-X1 lack the normal development of a functional immune system and so have difficulty
      fighting infections, which may lead to chronic or severe illness and death. X-SCID patients
      are normally rescued by a bone marrow transplant from a healthy donor. This trial aims to
      treat SCID-X1 using a self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying a functional gene to
      correct the genetic defect. By collecting an individual's stem cells and modifying them with
      a lentivirus, the gene-corrected cells can be returned into the blood to help produce normal
      healthy immune cells.

      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the self-inactivating lentiviral vector,
      the ex vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of immune reconstitution in
      patients overcoming frequent infections present at the time of treatment, assessment of
      integration sites, and finally the long-term correction of immunodeficiency.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of classical SCID-X1 based on:

               -  A proven mutation in the common gamma chain gene as defined by direct sequencing
                  of patient DNA.

               -  T-cell immune deficiency defined as one or more of the following: CD3+ autologous
                  T cells &lt; 300/ul, or less than 50% of normal value for in vitro mitogen
                  stimulation, or absent proliferation in vitro to antigens.

          2. No available HLA identical related donor.

          3. With severe infections, including but not limited to: pneumonitis; protracted diarrhea

             disseminated BCG infection.

          4. No cytogenetic abnormalities (medullary karyotype) and no detection of main
             rearrangements associated with acute leukemia of children.

          5. No prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
