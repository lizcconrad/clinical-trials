      The specific objective of this study is to validate the practice of remote pulmonary function
      testing (rPFT) conducted in the home through the use of connected mobile health devices and
      the Penn State Hershey ALS Telemanagement program. The central hypothesis is that guided home
      assessment of respiratory function is a valid method for detecting respiratory insufficiency
      leading to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) recommendation. This study has the potential to
      transform the current practice of conducting breathing assessments every three months,
      resulting in timelier detection of respiratory insufficiency, thereby staining quality of
      life and lengthening survival. This protocol has the potential to demonstrate telemanagement
      exceeding the standards of ALS care.

      The study has two parts, which patients can participate in either or both. The first part is
      a self-controlled study which will enroll 40 patients from the ALS clinic. On the day of
      their clinical visit, study participants will perform both a standard PFT as well as a
      simulated rPFT, both generating three valid repetitions of forced vital capacity (FVC) and
      maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) procedures. The simulated rPFT will mimic the practice of
      home telemonitoring by having patients be instructed by a respiratory therapist over the
      telemanagement portal while in a research room within the ALS clinic. The primary hypothesis
      is that there is no difference in the results of PFT and rPFT for respiratory assessment of
      FVC and MIP.

      The second part is a comparison of respiratory outcomes in patients receiving
      telemedicine-guided respiratory assessments monthly vs. those receiving standard of care.
      This is a randomized controlled study which assesses the effects rPFT on respiratory
      outcomes, quality of life, and survival. Forty patients with ALS will be randomized into two
      arms, both receiving standard respiratory assessments for pulmonary function every three
      months, and the experimental group additionally receiving rPFTs in the interim months over
      the course of a year. The primary hypothesis is that home respiratory assessment enables
      thresholds for NIV recommendation to be met in the experimental group significantly closer to
      the initiation criteria, at a time when quality of life is higher, compared to the control
      group.
