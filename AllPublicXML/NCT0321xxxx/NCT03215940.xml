  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study comparing the effects of Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) versus
      Cannabidiol (CBD) versus a placebo on chronic non-cancer pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to examine the effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
      and Cannabidiol (CBD) on chronic pain symptoms, specifically we will examine the effects of
      different doses of THC/CBD on symptoms of chronic pain and life functioning. Participants
      will include individuals with chronic pain, who will be randomized into one of three
      intervention conditions: high THC/low CBD, low THC/high CBD, or placebo. In addition to
      receiving THC/CBD/placebo, participants also will complete symptom assessments of chronic
      pain data (intensity, quality, interference/disability) throughout the study. These measures
      will be gathered prior to and following the fifth doses (dosing will occur once per day for
      five days) of CBD/THC or placebo. A secondary objective will be to examine the association
      between clinical and neurocognitive variables and use of CBD/THC, including the potential
      side effects of THC/CBD. Other secondary objectives include the use of magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), acquired before and after final
      administration with CBD/THC or placebo to examine differences in brain metabolism, brain
      connectivity, and brain structure. Imaging analyses will focus on regional brain changes
      before and after administration of THC/CBD/placebo.

    <description>Participants will undergo MRI scanning designed to assess white matter microstructure and focal brain activation at the baseline visit (day 1) and visit five (day 5) in order to determine whether the administration of Delta-9-THC, CBD, or Placebo will result in changes to these brain indices in participants with chronic pain.</description>

    <description>Using baseline assessment measures gathered at visit 0 (Screening), assessments collected at visits 1-5 and follow-up will be used to determine wether the administration of Delta-9-THC, CBD, or placebo will improve pain relief in individuals with chronic pain.</description>
