      &quot;To determine the efficacy of program of prevention of delirium in critically ill patients
      from the intensive care units of Bucaramanga and Floridablanca. Methods: The study will be a
      randomized controlled clinical trial in 600 critically ill patients recruited at 24 hours
      from arrival on the intensive care units of Bucaramanga and Floridablanca, without delirium,
      with ≥50% in the PREDELIRIC scale score, who comply with the inclusion and exclusion. The
      patients will be randomized in blocks to one of the two groups, intervention group (delirium
      prevention program, n=200) with control group (usual care; n= 400), the study will compare
      the incidence of delirium in both groups. Patients will be followed every day with Confusion
      Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) until the patient presents delirium,
      exit to hospitalization or death. Delirium prevention program includes individualized
      nonpharmacological interventions such as multisensory stimulation, cognitive stimulation,
      activate the functional and family involvement. The study has received ethical approval from
      the University of Santander&quot;

      &quot;delirium predominance in the intensive care unit (ICU) is 20- 80%, depending on the scale to
      which it measures itself and some characteristics of the patients ( Carrillo &amp; Sosa, 2010).
      The development of the delirium in the intensive care unit presents an important impact in
      the treatment of the patient , therefore directly influences the hospital cost , in the stay
      and the mortality .Martinez &amp; others (2004) also , the delirium is diagnosed just in 66-84%
      of the patients who present this complication , because in come circumstances it is confused
      with dementia or anxiety and why there does not exist a diagnostic methodology adequate for
      its evaluation. With regard to the diagnosis of the delirium , several methods exist for the
      diagnosis , the evaluation method of the confusion CAMICU of the english confusion assesment
      method for the ICU is the most used, in the intensive care unit , for its high sensibility,
      reliability and validity to identify delirium when it is used by nurses and doctors of the
      ICU and only it needs 2-3 minutes for its achievement (Ely &amp; others, 2004) This way, Boogaard
      and collaborators decided to construct and validate a model who allows to predict the
      delirium probability in adult patients of intensive care unit (Boogaard

        -  others, 2012), in order to restore preventive measurements to reduce its incidence,
           gravity and duration. The delirium have high frequency and with an impact
           bio-psico-economic in the patient and its environment , the prevention is the most
           effective and economic measure of tackling the delirium in its initial phase and nursing
           contributes to a great extent in this work . It is as well as in a titled previous study
           : validity of the model of prediction of the delirium in intensive care unit of
           Bucaramanga, realized by Torres and Páez in 2014 in the Comuneros universitarian
           Hospital of Bucaramanga brought up to the date an incidence of the delirium of 20.5%,
           with a mortality of 47.5% of the patients who do delirium during its stay in ICU ,
           proving the efficacy od the model PREDELIRIC to predict the delirium in the first 24
           hours of stay in ICU , in patients with high values its like say a PREDELIRIC result
           &gt;50% Taking this study as a precedent there appears the target to determine the efficacy
           of the prevention program of delirium in the population of critical patients in
           Bucaramanga, (the Comuneros universitarian Hospital of Bucaramanga) across a randomized
           controlled clinical essay , in order to predict early in these patients the possibility
           of delirium development and to facilitate the application of preventive measurements not
           pharmacological in patients with high risk . these preventive measurements would be done
           across individualized interventions and they would be focused after the improved
           orientation , cognitive stimulation , early mobilization to listen to music with the
           intention of reduce the delirium incidence, of improving the cognition of the patients
           and avoiding its deterioration during the staying in the ICU , condition that can remain
           after its departure ( Inouye &amp; others, 1999). Also, the results of this investigation
           will appear in a scientific article and scientific congresses in the área of health .
           Also, they will be announced to the universitarian community and the involved
           institution. Key words : Delirium, intensive care, prevention , nursing interventions.
           Like an important antecedent in Santander the group of research of the nursing program
           Everest execute a study to validate the prediction model PREDELIRIC to a spanish version
           , this study expose the need to identify and implement interventions of nursing to
           prevent the delirium in critical patients of Bucaramanga Our priority now is to apply
           the model of prediction PREDELIRIC validated in a spanish version to the population of
           critical patients to predict early in these patients the possibility of development of
           delirium , facilitating the specific application of not pharmacological preventive
           measurements in patient who is in high risk. These preventive measurements would be done
           across an individualized intervention and they would be focused to: to improve the
           orientation, cognitive stimulation , early mobilization, listen to music, in patients of
           high risk, Inouye &amp; others (1999) All this , focused to improve the cognition of the
           patients and to avoid the cognitive deterioration presented during the stay in the ICU
           and that can remain after the departure of the patient in the ICU, Inouye

        -  others (1999) Additionally identifying in a specific way the patients who has a benefit
           from the preventive measurements optimizes the time of personnel of health, reducing the
           incidence of the delirium, turns into a strategy cost- benefit for the persons and the
           relatives also for the institution on having diminished the hospitable stay, adverse
           events and the morbi- mortality . Inouye &amp; others (1990). It is of clarifying and
           admitting that now some institutions make different interventions, which tackle the
           prevention of the delirium, however , these interventions are realized in an isolated
           way, associated with the interest and motivation of the personnel, there do not exist
           organized and systematized processes that they allow to face and link to the whole
           personnel , the recognition of the delirium during the hospitalization in the ICU , and
           although they interfere in the process , there do no exist very few concrete proposals
           that reflect in wich way institutions impact the presentation and prevention of the
           delirium . In the same way , the services of intensive care unit has been unidentified
           that the recommendations with regard to the care and prevention of the delirium tend yo
           be generalized, without dedicating enough time to the recognition of the problems,
           neither is clear the process of pursuit that is done, to the needs and to the result of
           the realized interventions . To the date conclusive studies are not known in this
           subject and there has not been proved the efficacy of not pharmacological interventions
           directed to the prevention of the delirium in critics patients, only there exist the
           modality of the study of doctor Inouye and collaborators in 1999 who verified a decrease
           of 30% of the delirium with the implementation of these measurements in hospitalized
           aged patients. Inouye &amp; others (1999) Bearing in mind the serious and irreversible
           consequences of the delirium to shortly and long term in the critical patients, we want
           to propose the implementation of not pharmacological measurements to prepare this
           phenomenon and simultaneously to prove the efficacy in patients that diagnoses a high
           risk of development of delirium as the application of the scale PREDELIRIC version
           validated in spanish The investigation on the prediction of the delirium , of indirect
           form will tackle these problematic , generating knowledge on the real e situation,
           favoring the identification of courses that will face processes, qualification of the
           personnel and making of a guide of intervention in nursing focus on the diminish the
           frenzy of the intensive unit care of the country One admits that beyond the requested
           for the regulations , the training and permanent accompaniment is needed for the team of
           health as regards the attention humanized in highly specializing and technological
           stages as it is the ICU To obtain new knowledge that they can contribute to the
           comprehension and the sensitization of the situation of the delirium in the persons
           hospitalized in the intensive care unit does part of the contribution to the body of
           knowledge in the área of critical care , it is so to find a predictor of the
           investigation of delirium cost in the intensive care unit strengthens the theoretical
           bases to improve the care . There will be beneficiaries of the results of the present
           investigation, in addition to the patients , relatives and personnel of health, the
           educational institutions of the region , who will have new indications to the academic
           programs realizing on the programs of specialization of the área, this way to validate
           the care interventions for the user who came to the ICU and improve the offered care.
           Generating and applying the results of the present study will be a contribution for the
           generation of models of attention in Colombia, directed to a persons who live through an
           illness situation and who are hospitalized in ICU , thinking about hoe to high light the
           importance of implementing strategies for the advance in the knowledge and the
           employment of the results in the formation, practice and investigation to consolidate
           the proposals to answer for the needs of this population . The results of the present
           study will be presented like a proposal for the institutions and specially for the
           intensive care unit adult with the target to offer tools to the care, this will be a
           progress of the general satisfaction.
