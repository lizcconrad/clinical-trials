    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to study the safety, side effects, and benefits of tumor-infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TILs) when they are given with the drug nivolumab. Nivolumab is a type of
      immunotherapy - a drug that is used to boost the ability of the immune system to fight
      cancer, infection, and other diseases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, these special immune T-cells will be taken from a sample of the participant's
      tumor tissue that will be surgically removed. Certain parts of these cells will be
      multiplied, or grown, in the laboratory, using the drug interleukin-2 (IL-2) during part of
      the process. They will then be given back to the participant by an infusion in their veins.
      These cells are called tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The use of TILs involves a
      combination of drugs, including the following:

        -  Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide - two types of chemotherapy drugs. These drugs will be
           used for what is called lymphodepletion. The purpose of lymphodepletion in this study is
           to temporarily reduce the number of normal lymphocytes circulating in the participant's
           body before they are given the TILs that were grown in the lab. This is so that there
           will be more &quot;space&quot; for the lymphocytes (TILs) that will be infused in their veins.

        -  Interleukin-2 (IL-2) - a drug used to help the body's response to treatment on the
           immune system. A high dose regimen of IL-2 will be given after the participant receives
           the infusion of the T-cells.

    <measure>Rate of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators plan to demonstrate that treatment with nivolumab in patients undergoing TIL therapy is safe with a continuous Pocock-type stopping boundary for serious toxicity of &lt; 17%, with safety reported based upon Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 criteria. DLT defined as: any grade â‰¥3 immune-related adverse event definitely attributable to nivolumab. DLT related to adoptive cell therapy will be defined as a non-hematologic grade 4 or higher adverse event that is immediately life-threatening occurring upon or after the start of therapy that is immediately life-threatening and not related to non-small cell lung cancer or other pre-existing condition. Safety: Toxicity will be assessed within 4 weeks of the adoptive TIL transfer. The accrual will be halted if excessive numbers of participants with toxicity are seen. For example, if there are 5 or more out of 10 participants (full follow-up) with toxicity, the trial will be stopped.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate associated with the treatment regimen. The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. Investigators plan to see if the treatment produces a best overall radiologic response rate in patients who progress on nivolumab monotherapy in unselected NSCLC of 20% or more. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD) taking as references the smallest sum LD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 40 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival associated with the treatment regimen. Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from study entry to disease progression, relapse or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier, will be summarized with the Kaplan-Meier curve. Confidence intervals for the median and survival rates at different time points will be constructed if needed and appropriate. This secondary endpoint will be reported descriptively. Progression (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>
