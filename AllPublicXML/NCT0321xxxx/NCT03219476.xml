      STUDY RATIONALE: Patients with HR+ HER2- node-negative breast cancers generally undergo
      surgical resection upfront, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, if needed, in addition to
      adjuvant endocrine therapy. Because endocrine therapy is primarily delivered in the
      postoperative setting, the ability to assess the tumor response to this treatment modality is
      lost and very difficult to assess. This study offers the unique opportunity to assess the
      responsiveness of breast tumors to endocrine therapy while the tumors are still in vivo by
      treating patients with endocrine therapy before surgery and assessing molecular changes with
      treatment. By comparing pre- and post-treatment levels of molecular markers in individual
      tumors, the team expects to identify predictors of responsiveness to existing agents and
      identify new candidate therapeutic targets.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to determine the frequency of increased HER
      family of receptor tyrosine kinases protein expression in tumors, following treatment with
      neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and their correlation with Ki-67 tumor responses. The team will
      measure cancer cell protein levels of growth factor receptors of the HER family before and
      after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The data will be used to inform a future randomized
      trial of combined endocrine and the most promising anti-HER targeted therapy.

    <description>Once enrolled, patients would be treated with the current standard-of-care endocrine therapy. Choice of endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen) would be decided by medical oncologist, following a review of the patient's medical history and menstrual status. The patient would be treated with endocrine therapy in a neoadjuvant setting for four weeks, with dosing continuing until surgery.</description>
