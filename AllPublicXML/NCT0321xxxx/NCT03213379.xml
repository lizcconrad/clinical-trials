  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to compare the impact of different actigraphy procedures on the
      healthcare organization of Parkinson's disease (PK) patients using an apomorphine pump. To do
      so, the study design includes a patients' randomisation in two groups that will be followed
      during 6 months.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two groups are:

      Referent group with one actimetric report at baseline Actimetry group with one actimetric
      report at baseline and during the follow-up. Using these reports the investigator will be
      able to modify the prescription of the apomorphin pump without seeing the patient.

      It is planned to follow the patients during 6 months of follow-up and 3 medical visits will
      be conducted as per the standard practice:

      1 visit before the installation of the pump

      1 visit after the pump installation straight after the patient comes out the hospital

      1 visit at 6 months

One at baseline before the apomorphim set-up/ the second one 8 days after the hospitalisation/ the third one 28 days after the hospitalisation and the last one before the 6 months follow-up visit One optional measure can be performed 84 days after the hospitalisation.</description>

    <description>The patient will wear actigraphy bracelet during a week that will enable to record patients' movements. The report based on the recording will provide an assessment of daytime somnolence and an indication of propensity for impulsive behaviours.The intervention consisted in 2 supplementary actimetry measures and sending of the actimetry reports to the investigator.</description>
