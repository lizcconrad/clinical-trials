  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 24-week study is to evaluate the impact of recovery coach intervention on
      rates of treatment retention, illicit opioid use, and readmission among hospitalized patients
      newly initiated on buprenorphine compared to the control intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) frequently utilize hospitals due to soft tissue
      infections and other conditions that require inpatient level of care. Prior studies have
      indicated that OUD patients are often amenable to te initiating buprenorphine treatment and
      can be successfully linked to outpatient treatment. However, hospitalized OUD patients
      initiated on buprenorphine have much lower treatment retention rates at 6-months compared to
      OUD patients initiating treatment in the outpatient setting. As such, there is a great need
      to identify strategies to improve treatment retention in this patient population. There is a
      growing body of evidence for the benefits of recovery coaches, who provide peer-delivered
      support services in the community. Tracing their origin to mutual support groups to
      supplement traditional clinical services, recovery coaches are individuals with lived
      experience of recovery. Studies of recovery coaches have demonstrated greater treatment
      retention, reduced substance use, and reduced inpatient utilization. However, no prior
      studies have examined the impact of recovery coaches in improving buprenorphine treatment
      retention. As such, the aim of this 24-week study is to evaluate the impact of recovery coach
      intervention on rates of treatment retention, illicit opioid use, and readmission among
      hospitalized patients newly initiated on buprenorphine compared to the control intervention.
      Patients who are successfully initiated on buprenorphine will be eligible to enroll. .
      Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.

In addition, the coach will conduct weekly sessions on various topics and offer personal insights and facilitate a discussion.</description>
