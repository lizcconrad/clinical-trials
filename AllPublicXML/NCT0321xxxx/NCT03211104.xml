  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial designed with the aim of
      establishing whether curcumin influenced the duration of treatment interruption and rate of
      prostatic specific antigen(PSA) progression, compared with placebo among men with prostate
      cancer receiving intermittent androgen deprivation therapy.
