  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebellar ataxias are a group of disorders caused by cerebellar affections, for which
      currently no specific treatment is available. Some limited studies verified the effects of
      cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on ataxic symptoms, with good results. So
      far it is not known which patients could benefit. Our hypothesis is that cerebellar TMS could
      improve ataxic symptoms in some patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients with cerebellar ataxia will be included in our protocol. Ataxia might be due
      to several aetiologies, from degenerative to genetic and vascular diseases. Patients will be
      submitted to a neuronavigation protocol for the precise location of the dentate nucleus
      contralateral to the most symptomatic side. After that, participants will be randomly
      assigned to 5 active or 5 placebo sessions of 1Hz TMS over the located area. After the first
      5 sessions and a period of at least 4 weeks washout, patients will cross over and receive
      other 5 sessions, active or sham. Clinical and video evaluations will be conducted before and
      after active and sham cluster of sessions.

    <description>Assess 8 items: gait, stance, sitting, speech, dysmetria, kinetic tremor, pro- and supinations of the hand, and the heel-shin slide. Each item is scored by the physician on a 4 to 8 numerical scale based upon the amount of dysfunction observed while performing the task. The maximum possible score for the total scale is 40. Lower scores of SARA represents better task performance.</description>
