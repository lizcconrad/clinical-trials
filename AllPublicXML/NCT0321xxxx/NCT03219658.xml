  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This internal pilot study will determine whether a highly promising primary care based
      intervention that combines group based parenting skills training and public health nurse home
      visits with a focus on healthy nutrition, activity and sleep, will lead to improved weight
      status in 1 to 5 year old children with severe obesity.

      Children with severe obesity will be identified through the obesity management clinical
      program at The Hospital for Sick Children called STOMP (SickKids Team Obesity Management
      Program). The STOMP Early Years Program is a unique and intensive, paediatric obesity
      management program designed for 1 to 5 year-olds with severe obesity and their families.
      Families who participate in this study will be randomly assigned (having an equal chance of
      being in either group) to one of the two study groups that will run for 6 months:

      Group A: Ten weeks of group parenting education sessions with 2-4 public health nurse home
      visits and four one-on-one check-ins with an interdisciplinary team at STOMP.

      Group B: Wait listed to receive parenting education sessions; receive one-on-one checks with
      an interdisciplinary team at STOMP.

      In addition to the measures collected as part of STOMP, families will complete the following
      questionnaires before the start of the trial, and after 6 months:

      Parenting Scale, Parenting Stress Index, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21),
      Cost Questionnaire, and Children's Behaviour Questionnaire (CBQ).

    <description>If assigned to the parenting education session group, families will start with the 10-week group parenting education sessions and 2-4 home visits immediately after being enrolled. During this time, they will also come in for four one-on-one check-ins with the STOMP team. Each check-in will be approximately 1 hour. At least one parent/caregiver will attend weekly parenting sessions which will take place at SickKids. The Toronto Public Health Nurse will arrange 2-4 home visits with the family during the 6 month period of the study. The home visits will focus on helping to apply the messages and skills from the group sessions in their homes, and making connections in the neighbourhood to recreational or nutrition programs or other supports for the family.</description>
