    <textblock>
      Transcranial contrast-enhanced ultrasound for evaluation of cerebral blood flow during
      pediatric cardiac surgery. This study is aimed as a feasibility study prior to conducting a
      lager prospective clinical trial including neurologic and developmental outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cerebral perfusion of infants with congenital heart defects is a critical determinant
      during cardiac surgery. The majority of these interventions is performed during deep or
      moderate hypothermia (25-32°C) with reduced blood flow of the heart-lung-machine (HLM).
      Assuming a symmetrical anatomy of the cerebral arteries (C. Willisii) a single vessel (T.
      brachiocephalicus) is then supplying the cerebral blood flow. Using contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound the cerebral blood flow will be assessed during cardiac surgery interventions.
