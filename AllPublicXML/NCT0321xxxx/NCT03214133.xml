  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of epicatechin-rich cocoa
      in humans on collagen synthesis and power-based performance outcomes (rate of force
      development).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently completed a study looking at the expression of the collagens
      following consumption of increasing doses of epicatechin in rats . This data clearly shows
      that increasing doses of epicatechin, either 0.5 mg.kg-1 delivered once, twice, or three
      times a day, or 2 mg.kg-1 once a day, results in increasing expression of the fibrillar
      collagens (I, III, and V). This preliminary data suggests that epicatechin-rich chocolate
      supplementation can increase collagen expression in humans and that this may improve force
      transfer. From this background, the hypothesis proposed is that supplementation with
      epicatechin-rich chocolate will increase rate of force development and performance in
      athletes. Therefore, this simple nutrition intervention has the potential to simultaneously
      improve performance, decrease injuries and accelerate return to competition through improved
      collagen synthesis.

    <masking_description>Alkalized (0.01 mg epicatechin/g) ) and non alkalized cocoa (4.1 mg epicaetchin/g) will be mixed in various ratios to achieve the desired 0, 1, 2, 3 mg/ kg body mass but maintaining equally weighed dose of cocoa for each intervention.
For Arm 2, the same quantity of either alkalized or non alkalized cocoa will be given to achieve the optimized dosed of epicatechin.</masking_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Collegiate level male athletes between the ages of 18Â¬-25 years of age, currently
             participating in sport, will be recruited to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of more than 3 musculoskeletal injuries within the past 12 months.

          -  Health and dietary restriction (e.g. lactose intolerance) that would be affected by
             the supplementation protocol.

          -  The initial phase will be performed in males since collagen synthesis varies
             significantly throughout the menstrual cycle in females. Since collagen synthesis is
             the main outcome measure for the study this would confound the initial phase of the
             work. Provided this work proves successful then the investigators will aim to proceed
             with similar research in females.
