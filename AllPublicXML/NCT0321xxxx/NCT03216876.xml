  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, active treatment trial to determine the pharmacokinetics of orally
      administered ursolic acid and to assess the potential efficacy and safety of ursolic acid in
      subjects with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first phase of this trial, 6 healthy subjects and 2 PSC subjects will assigned to
      ursolic acid taken orally as a single dose of 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg to determine the
      optimal dose in humans.

      The second phase of this trial will involve 20 PSC subjects assigned to treatment with daily
      oral ursolic acid at the dose determined to be optimal in the first phase of the study. The
      treatment will last for 24 weeks with an off-treatment follow up of 28 weeks.
