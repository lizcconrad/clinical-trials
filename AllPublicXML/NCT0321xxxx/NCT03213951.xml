  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      68Ga-PSMA is a radiopharmaceutical used with PET imaging for the detection of prostate cancer
      under a compassionate IND in patients who have presented with biochemical failure. In this
      study, the use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 will be extended to newly diagnosed patients with high risk
      prostate cancer. Patients enrolled to this study will undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or
      PET/MRI scan for research purposes (in addition to the routine CT or MRI that is routinely
      done for staging), and a second 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration just prior to surgery for
      experimental ex-vivo beta probe testing of resected tissue. Immediately following resection
      of the prostate, the intact tissue will be scanned using a PET camera designed for animal
      research in order to record the 68Ga-PSMA-11 distribution in the isolated tissue at higher
      resolution than can be attained using whole-body PET imaging. The experimental beta probe
      will then be use to measure 68Ga-PSMA-11 counts of the resected tissue.

      Primary Objective To assess beta ray detection of prostate cancer ex-vivo using experimental
      beta probe immediately after prostate cancer removal as determined by pathologist.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Compare preoperative standard of care staging via CT or MRI to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (CT or
           MRI) findings.

        -  Compare preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (CT or MRI) lesion measurements with postoperative
           high-resolution PET of ex-vivo tissue.

        -  To compare the findings of each of the 68Ga-PSMA-11 detection methods to the surgical
           observations and the clinical tissue histopathology findings.

      Exploratory Objective Correlation of beta probe measurements with preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-11
      PET (CT or MRI) lesion measurements, postoperative PET/CT ex-vivo images, surgical
      observations, and pathology findings.
