  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robot assisted urological procedures are often long surgical cases that can potentially
      result in complicated postoperative hospital course. The amount of intravenous (IV) fluids
      administered to patients during these operations fluctuates based on the length of the case,
      surgical blood loss, hemodynamic monitors, and the discretion of the anesthesiologist. The
      goal of intraoperative fluid therapy is to maintain optimal tissue perfusion without causing
      fluid overload. We plan to use a goal directed fluid therapy protocol to optimize fluid
      status and analyze post-operative outcomes.
