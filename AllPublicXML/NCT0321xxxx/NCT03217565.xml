    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to describe the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      intravenous (IV) tedizolid phosphate or an oral suspension of tedizolid phosphate, when
      administered to pediatric participants, full-term neonates, and preterm neonates.
