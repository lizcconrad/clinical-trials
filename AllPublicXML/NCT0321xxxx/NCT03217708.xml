  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to utilize non-invasive, easily measurable biomarkers (heart
      rate, skin temperature, sleep, and activity) in the post surgical discharge period to
      identify trends which correlate with improved outcome and early recovery (return to baseline
      activity). These are measured (captured) utilizing a wearable technology (WT) device.

      Return to baseline (RTB) activity for the purpose of this study is defined primarily as step
      count normalization as a surrogate of activity (pre versus post operative step count), and
      heart rate variability normalization back to preoperative baseline. Increased heart rate
      variability has been studied in acute care settings as a marker of poor prognosis. Please
      note that return to baseline is not defined for the pediatric population in the same way as
      adults (which is primarily questionnaire based and not applicable in children).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wearable technology has tremendous advantages over current methods of assessing RTB activity
      in the post-discharge pediatric population after AT, which rely on quality of life (QOL)
      scales, caregiver and patient reports, as well as nurse phone calls and office visits. These
      methods are biased, time and labor intensive, disease focused, and caregiver dependent. The
      investigators propose to use wearable technology in order to assess RTB activity. The device
      has validated methodology in sleep metrics (as compared to polysomnography), heart rate and
      activity monitoring (optical sensor and 3 plane accelerometry), and temperature measuring
      (galvanic skin resistance). So far, no investigators have utilized wearable technology and
      biomarker (heart rate, skin temperature, activity, sleep) data in the manner proposed. RTB is
      a difficult to measure entity in children and the investigators have defined it using step
      count as a marker of activity. There are no studies or &quot;standard&quot; to measure quality of
      recovery in children.
