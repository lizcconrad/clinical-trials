  <brief_summary>

      Study aims to investigate 2 topics:

        1. Flavour-Nutrient Learning (FNL) FNL proposes that personal food preferences may be
           influenced by unconscious mechanisms which operate to ensure the safeguarding of
           individual nutrient levels. The theory postulates that food preferences may change over
           time to address changing nutritional status (Yeomans, 2012).

           This study aims to explore FNL in humans by investigating the preferences of
           participants with low and high blood-selenium levels in relation to selenium-enriched
           parsnips. Participants will be investigated in a two-week trial in which they will
           undertake two food sensory tests: one before, and one after, the two-week period where
           they will incorporate provided parsnips into their diet.

           Some provided parsnips will contain higher levels of selenium than others, neither the
           participants nor the lead researcher will know which type of parsnip each participant
           receives.

           It is hypothesised that the second food sensory test, performed after the intervention
           period, will show that participants of lower initial blood-selenium levels will
           demonstrate an increased liking for the selenium-enriched parsnips. This may demonstrate
           possible FNL in humans.

        2. Relationship between selenium intake &amp; plasma selenium-status. This study will also
           examine the relationship (if any) between the selenium intake of all participants via
           the different types of parsnips, and their individual blood-selenium levels.

      This will be assessed via blood tests before, during and after the trial in order to observe
      the blood-selenium levels of each participant.

      It is hypothesised that the blood-selenium levels of participants of lower initial selenium
      readings will be the most improved upon consumption of selenium-enriched parsnips.

      1. FNL Despite a wealth of animal studies (Amanoel et al, 2016; Bach et al, 2012), human
           FNL research is in relative infancy.

           This study intends to investigate FNL in humans by exploring preferences of participants
           of different selenium-status regarding selenium-enriched parsnips, with non-enriched
           parsnips and other root vegetables to be used as comparators.

           Participants will be assessed by means of food sensory tests and blood analysis before,
           during and after the trial period.

           The trial aims to recruit 26 lower selenium-status participants of initial
           selenium-status approx. 70μg/L, and 26 higher selenium-status participants of initial
           selenium-status approx. 100μg/L (n=52). (Initial screening sample approx. n=120.) On
           initial screening, potential participants recording a selenium-status of under 28μg/L or
           over 400μg/L will be excluded (and their GP informed) for safety reasons.

           Re parsnips:

           Selenium-enriched parsnips: Se content approx. 0.30ppm. Placebo comparator:
           non-selenium-enriched parsnips: Se content approx. 0.06ppm. Treatment portion: 200g
           fresh weight per day for 14 days. Comparator vegetables: potato, celeriac, turnip.

        2. Relationship between selenium intake &amp; plasma selenium-status. This study will also
           investigate the relationship, if any, between the selenium intake of all participants
           via the different types of parsnips and their individual selenium status. This will be
           assessed via blood tests before, during and after the trial in order to observe
           plasma-selenium status.

      This is deemed an important area for research as research suggests a trend towards selenium
      deficiency in the United Kingdom population (SACN, 2013). It is hoped the current study may
      inform the debate regarding the potential of improving United Kingdom's population selenium
      status via selenium-fortified foods.
