  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that macitentan and tadalafil
      administered as a fixed combination is bioequivalent to both compounds given as separate
      tablets given at the same doses as in the fixed combination (i.e. whether the amounts of
      macitentan and tadalfil which reach the blood are comparable).
