  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will evaluate the neuro-cognitive outcomes of a novel, adaptive attention
      training in a healthy adolescent population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspects of cognitive control, such as attention and working memory, are critical for
      successful goal-directed behavior. Importantly, variability in cognitive control abilities
      can influence real-world functioning, such as scholastic success in children and adolescents.
      The primary goal of this project is to examine the outcomes of a novel, adaptive attention
      training that primarily targets aspects of sustained attention and secondarily targets
      delayed gratification in adolescents. As such, the investigators will validate the
      feasibility and efficacy of this novel training in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study.
      Specifically, healthy adolescents (age 12-16 years old) will be recruited for a longitudinal
      experiment in which they are randomly assigned to the adaptive attention training group
      ('Engage') or one of two expectancy-matched control groups. Depending on the assigned group,
      participants will complete 1 hour (low-dose control group) or 15 hours ('Engage' and active
      control groups) of training as well as pre-, post- and follow-up assessments of cognitive,
      neural, and behavioral measures. We hypothesize that completion of 'Engage' training will
      result in enhancement of fronto-parietal control functions that underlie sustained attention
      and suppression of ventral-striatal reward impulses, ultimately improving these abilities in
      a healthy adolescent population.

    <description>The training group will engage in 15 hours of at-home training on a novel iPad-based adaptive attention training program ('Engage'). Individuals will complete thirty 30-minute sessions over six weeks. Training compliance and performance data (accuracies and reaction times) will be continuously monitored remotely and analyzed over secure online servers to ensure that participants are completing training as scheduled and to deal with any unexpected road-blocks in training.</description>

    <description>The active control group will engage in 15 hours of at-home training on an iPad game ('Boing'). Individuals will complete game play for the same number of hours as the training group to control for the effects of computer exposure and interaction, contact with research personnel, and monetary rewards. Compliance will be monitored similarly to the adaptive attention training group.</description>

    <description>The low-dose training group will engage in 1 hour of at-home training on 'Engage'. Individuals will complete two 30-minute sessions at the beginning and middle of a six-week period. Compliance will be monitored similarly to the adaptive attention training group.</description>

    <description>The training is comprised of a time-based titration of rich audiovisual and sparse audio interactive environments. Training progressively transitions the participants from an immersive and rapid reward setting to a less immersive, sensory impoverished, and slower reward setting. Further, the participants' actions require delayed gratification decisions to accomplish play in the sparse setting, building fronto-parietal control through sustained attention and suppression of ventral-striatal reward impulses.</description>

    <description>Participants in the expectancy-matched active control group will play a visuo-spatial iPad game, in which players use their finger to move an object to different successive square platforms. Expectancy matching to the adaptive attention training was pre-confirmed in 121 participants (18-20 years of age), using targeted surveys on MTurk about their expectations of either training exposure on our specific outcome measures. To balance expectations of potential benefits, this group will receive identical recruitment and experimental instructions as the adaptive attention training group.</description>
