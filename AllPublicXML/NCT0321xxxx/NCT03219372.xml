  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is a major health concern in the United States, particularly
      among people with liver cirrhosis. Out of every 100 patients with liver cancer, only 18 will
      survive 5 years or more. While locoregional therapies are utilized in an effort to combat
      this disease, the recurrence rate of HCC after these therapies are high.

      Statins are widely used drugs that lower cholesterol levels. Some studies have suggested that
      statins lower risk of HCC recurrence, but this possibility has not been studied thoroughly in
      a clinical trial. This study will examine the effects of pravastatin, a type of statin, on
      time to HCC recurrence in patients with early stage HCC. It is possible that pravastatin in
      combination with locoregional therapies may delay or protect against HCC recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, there has been a scarcity of clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of
      adjuvant therapies in patients with early stage HCC, although it is widely considered an area
      of highly unmet need.

      The objective of this randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase II trial is to
      examine the effects of pravastatin use versus placebo after 12 months of treatment on
      hepatocellular cancer (HCC) recurrence in 180 patients with liver cirrhosis, HCC meeting
      Milan Criteria for tumor burden, and initial locoregional therapy (LRT) with complete
      response.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A or B) assessed by the presence of
             clinical signs, symptoms, body imaging (ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or liver biopsy

          -  HCCs must fall within the Milan/UNOS T2 criteria (1 lesion 2-5 cm or 3 lesions all ≤3
             cm without evidence of vascular invasion/metastasis)

          -  Receipt of LRT with verification of complete response at least 30 days following
             treatment

          -  ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥70%; see Appendix A)

          -  Participants must have acceptable organ, hepatic and renal function

          -  Woman who are able to become pregnant must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test
             result prior to enrollment. Women who are ≥ 60 years old or who have had a
             hysterectomy, both ovaries removed, or a tubal ligation will not be required to have a
             pregnancy test.

          -  The effects of pravastatin on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because statins are known to be
             teratogenic, women who are able to become pregnant must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study
             physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             and medical release

          -  Willing and able to comply with trial protocol and follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior or current use of statin medication

          -  Current systemic use of medications known to interact with statins and potentially
             increase toxicity, including (e.g., gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, clarithromycin,
             colchicine, niacin and fibrates).

          -  History of adverse effects, intolerance, or allergic reactions attributed to compounds
             of similar chemical or biologic composition to pravastatin (i.e., other statin
             medications)

          -  Current use of any other investigational agents

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study
             because pravastatin is a lipid-lowering agent with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. It is not known whether pravastatin is excreted into human
             milk; however, a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast
             milk. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pravastatin, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with pravastatin.

          -  Prior liver transplant

          -  Prior HCC (preceding current diagnosis)

          -  Prior cholangiocarcinoma

          -  Physiological Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) ≥30 at screening visit. MELD
             score is calculated using a patient's values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine,
             serum sodium, and the international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR). This
             version of the MELD calculation (MELD-Na) is the United Network for Organ Sharing
             (UNOS) 2016 modification of the original model to include serum sodium as a factor.

          -  History of chronic myopathy

          -  Active malignancy within the past 5 years (excluding HCC, basal/squamous cell skin
             cancer, or prostate cancer with a Gleason score 6 or less)

          -  Known HIV infection

          -  Hemophilia

          -  Concurrent illness which in the opinion of the investigators would compromise either
             the patient or the integrity of the data

          -  Concurrent excessive alcohol consumption (average alcohol consumption of more than 5
             drinks per day)
