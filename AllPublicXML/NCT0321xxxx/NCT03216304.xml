  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate if safinamide at the steady state, obtained after multiple 100 mg once a day
      administrations, has an effect on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, concomitantly
      administered as a single 20 mg dose, with respect to the pharmacokinetics of 20 mg
      rosuvastatin administered alone.

    <textblock>
      Xadago® SmPC reports that safinamide may transiently inhibit BCRP, therefore a time interval
      of 5 h should be kept between dosing of safinamide and medicinal products that are BCRP
      substrates with a Tmax ≤ 2 h (e.g. pitavastatin, pravastatin, ciprofloxacin, methotrexate,
      topotecan, diclofenac or glyburide).

      Following a specific request of FDA, the present interaction study in healthy male and female
      volunteers will be conducted in order to determine if multiple dose administration of
      safinamide with the BCRP substrate rosuvastatin alters the plasma exposure of rosuvastatin in
      vivo. Orally administered rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
      reductase inhibitor, developed for the treatment of dyslipidaemia, represents a sensitive
      probe to assess the magnitude of BCRP inhibition. In PK trials in healthy volunteers,
      rosuvastatin Tmax ranged from 1.7 to 5 h after administration of 10-80 mg doses.

    <description>Transporter-Mediated Interaction (TMI) between safinamide (investigational drug) and rosuvastatin (selected BCRP substrate) evaluated after the FDA - CDER Draft Guidance on Drug Interaction Studies of February 2012. Blood samples will be collected at different time points up to 96 h and the concentrations of rosuvastatin will be measured after single administration of a 20 mg dose with and without co-administration of multiple 100 mg doses of safinamide in a cross-over design. The Area Under the Curve (AUC), calculated with a non-compartmental method will be used as metrics for the plasma rosuvastatin extent of exposure. The parametric point estimators (PEs) for the ratios of treatments (co-administration / rosuvastatin alone) and the 90% confidence intervals will be calculated using the adjusted least squares means (LSMEANS) from an Analysis of variance (ANOVA) on rosuvastatin AUC. Presence of a TMI will be defined as an upper limit of the 90% confidence interval above 125.00.</description>
