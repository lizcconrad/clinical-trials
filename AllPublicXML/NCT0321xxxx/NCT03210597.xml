      The objective of the present study was to compare the neuromuscular, cardiorespiratory and
      metabolic effects of 12 weeks of aerobic training, strength training and combined training in
      the aquatic environment in women with MS. For this purpose, 51 postmenopausal, sedentary and
      MS women were randomly divided into three intervention groups: hydro-aerobic (HA, n = 18,
      63.77 ± 5.03 years), hydro-power (HF, n = 16, 61.01 ± 4.93 years) and hydro-combined (HC; n =
      17; 60.52 ± 6.91). A subsample participated in eight weeks without physical exercise to
      characterize a control period. The three intervention groups performed two weekly sessions of
      60 minutes for 12 weeks. Before and after the training period, blood tests, muscle strength
      tests, cardiorespiratory evaluation, functional tests and a questionnaire were performed. For
      statistical analysis, the Generalized Estimates Equations (GEE) model was used, using the
      &quot;group&quot; and the &quot;time&quot; as factors. The Bonferroni post hoc was used to locate the differences
      and the significance index adopted was α = 0.05.

    <textblock>
      Water-based exercise as a mode of aquatic exercise has been highlighted in the scientific
      literature. Research on different models of training, aerobic, muscle strength and combined
      (aerobic and muscle strength), have already demonstrated their beneficial effects on
      different physical abilities. Recent studies indicate benefits of water-based exercise for
      the population with metabolic diseases such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemias
      and obesity. However, for subjects with metabolic syndrome (MS) there are few studies that
      investigated which training model in the aquatic environment could generate physical and
      metabolic improvements.

      This study is characterized as a randomized clinical trial, which treated three intervention
      groups with physical exercise programs. A subsample participated in a period of eight weeks
      without physical exercise to characterize a control period. The subjects in this subsample
      were later randomized into the intervention groups.
