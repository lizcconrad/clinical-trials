  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of a high-fat meal (food effect) on the bioavailability
      and pharmacokinetics of 60mg ER Torsemide tablet after single dose oral administration in
      healthy volunteers. The study will be conducted as a two-sequence to period crossover study
      to compare 60mg ER Torsemide ER bioavailability under fed and fasting conditions. 60mg ER
      torsemide is a new strength and dosage form.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immediate Release (IR) Torsemide is a highly effective natriuretic drug but its short
      duration of action is a major drawback, which allows significant post-dose sodium retention,
      and as consequence, limits salt loss in patients with heart failure unless dietary salt
      intake is severely restricted. Extended Release (ER) torsemide is being developed to address
      this drawback by prolonging the duration of action to increase sodium excretion even in
      patients who consume high salt diet. Since 60mg ER torsemide is a new strength and dosage
      form, this study will test 60mg ER torsemide for a food effect in healthy volunteers who are
      either fasting or consuming a high-fat meal (fed). The primary endpoint of the study is full
      pharmacokinetics measurements after a single dose of 60mg ER torsemide. The secondary
      endpoints are 24h sodium excretion and total urinary excretion.
