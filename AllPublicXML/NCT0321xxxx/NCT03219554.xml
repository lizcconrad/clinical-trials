  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II single center, open-label, single arm study of palbociclib treatment in
      patients with recurrent or metastatic advanced TETs after failure of one or more cytotoxic
      chemotherapy regimens. Patients will receive oral palbociclib 125mg daily for 21days followed
      by a 7-day break. Cycle will be repeated every 28 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will continue to receive Palbociclib until objective disease progression,
      symptomatic deterioration, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawn of consent, whichever
      occurs first.

      Disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks (±7 days) from the date of initiation of
      treatment. Each assessment will be performed as scheduled according to the calendar
      regardless of any dosing delay to prevent the introduction of bias into the assessment of
      efficacy. Tumor assessments will be performed until radiographically and/or clinically (ie,
      for photographed or palpable lesions) documented progressive disease (PD) as per RECIST
      v.1.1, initiation of new anticancer therapy, or discontinuation of patient from overall study
      participation (eg, death, patient's request, lost to follow-up), whichever occurs first.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven thymic epithelial tumor (TET) patients

          2. Be ≥18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Documented progressive disease according to RECIST v1.1 following receipt of at least
             one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen administered for inoperable or metastatic disease.

          4. Measurable disease as defined per RECIST v 1.1. Tumor lesions previously irradiated or
             subjected to other locoregional therapy will only be deemed measurable if disease
             progression at the treated sited after completion of therapy is clearly documented.

          5. Availability of a tumor tissue specimen (ie, archived formalin fixed paraffin embedded
             tissue [block preferred, or 10 unstained slides]), which will be used for
             retrospective biomarker analysis. If archived tumor tissue is not available, then a de
             novo biopsy will be required for patient participation.

          6. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases,
             carcinomatous meningitis, or leptomeningeal disease as indicated by clinical symptoms,
             cerebral edema, and/or progressive growth. Patients with a history of CNS metastases
             or cord compression are eligible if they have been definitively treated with local
             therapy (eg, radiotherapy, stereotactic surgery) and are clinically stable off
             anticonvulsants and steroids for at least 4 weeks before randomization.

          2. Inability to swallow capsules.

          3. Prior treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor.
