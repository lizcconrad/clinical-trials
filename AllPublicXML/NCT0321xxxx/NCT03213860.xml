  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Environmental factors such as noise and light have been cited as important causes of sleep
      deprivation in Intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Previous studies demonstrated a
      hyperalgesic alteration in pain perception following a controlled sleep deprivation protocol.
      Another studies indicated that using eye masks can improve REM sleep in healthy subjects in
      simulated ICU environment, and improve sleep quality in ICU patients. This study aimed to
      determine the effects of using eye masks on sleep and thus on pain quality in postoperative
      cardiac surgery patients in ICU.

    <description>the Arabic version of the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ)The five-point RCSQ was designed to evaluate different aspects of night-time sleep, including: (1) depth; (2) latency (time to fall asleep); (3) number of awakenings; (4) efficiency (percent of time awake), and (5) quality. Each item was scored using a 100-mm visual-analogue scale (VAS), which ranged from 0 mm (worst sleep) to 100 mm (optimal sleep). Total score was calculated by dividing the sum of all scores by five. The RCSQ was administered by the researcher daily, at 7:00am every morning.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will receive protective devices Single use eye masks during nocturnal sleep (Flight Eye-masks; Dreaming, Zhuji City, Zhejiang, China). The caregiver will explain to them that they should wear eye masks during their stay in ICU to ensure rest and instructed patients to use them properly. During the ICU stay, ICU nurses will assist patients with wearing eye masks from 9:00 pm to 7:00 am the next morning.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) age ≧18 years; (2) no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders; (3)
             ability of patients to communicate verbally and understand the sleep questionnaires
             administered in the ICU; (3) length of ICU stay ≥48 hours; (4) Glasgow coma score
             (GCS) &gt;8 in the first to third day. Postoperative Extubation of MV within few hour
             (before the time of 9 pm for postoperative patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over age 65 were excluded from the study because of potential age-related
             differences in sleep. Patients reporting frequent nighttime awakenings, snoring, or
             chronic use of benzodiazepines or opioids were excluded because of potential
             confounding influences of these factors on postoperative sleep, pain, or opioid
             requirement.
