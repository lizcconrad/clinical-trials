  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about how to increase postpartum weight loss and how to
      decrease risk factors for postpartum women at increased risk for diabetes and heart disease.
      The program is delivered using a mobile application (app) and a lifestyle coach. This mobile
      application is developed for women who are at higher risk for diabetes and heart disease.
      Women who have gestational diabetes, (diabetes during pregnancy, or GDM), gestational
      hypertension (high blood pressure), and/or preeclampsia (high blood pressure and protein in
      the urine), and/or small-for gestational-age, and/or preterm (early) delivery during their
      pregnancies have a higher risk for diabetes and heart disease. This mobile application was
      developed using the latest research studies and using the evidence-based Diabetes Prevention
      and Colorado Weigh programs. The goal of the program is to help women lose weight and
      participate in physical activity after delivery.
