    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      1358894 in healthy male subjects following oral administration of single rising doses.
      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK), including dose
      proportionality of BI 1358894 after single dosing.

          -  Willingness to comply with contraception requirements. Subjects who are sexually
             active, must use, with their female partner, adequate contraception throughout the
