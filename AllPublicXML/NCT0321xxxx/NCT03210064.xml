  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study makes an observation over the objective response rate of Apatinib and 5-Fu
      combination regimen in the three-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. All the
      participants will randomly receive the treatment of Apatinib and 5-Fu combination regimen or
      5-Fu.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      5-Fu chemotherapy is an effective therapy for colorectal cancer. Apatinib is a small-molecule
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that highly selectively binds to and strongly inhibits
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), with a decrease in VEGF-mediated
      endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tumor microvascular density. A phase II trail
      of Apatinib has been demonstrated that Apatinib is safe to treat the metastatic colorectal
      cancer and the disease control rate can reach 50%.
