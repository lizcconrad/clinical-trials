  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel methodology was recently developed and validated by the applicants to compute bone
      strength at the distal radius and tibia using second-generation HR-pQCT reconstructions. The
      methodology is expected to improve significantly the assessment of bone fracture risk in
      idiopathic and secondary osteoporosis, but no reference data and no reproducibility data are
      available.

      The objective of the study is the determination of the sex- and age-specific distributions of
      accurate distal radius and tibia strength assessed by HR-pQCT in the Swiss population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: De novo determination of sex- and age-specific reference intervals for vBMD, bone
      architecture, and bone strength assessed by 3D HR-pQCT with a resolution of 61 µm (Xtreme CT
      II, Scanco Medical, Brütisellen, Switzerland) in the Swiss population.

      Design: Population-based, age- and sex-stratified, cross-sectional study in a single centre.

      Study Size: For the main part, 480 valid data sets will be needed for two age reference
      intervals for both women and men. The number of double/triple stack scans will be between 1
      and 3 depending on graded motion artefacts.

      Among the 120 participants of each reference interval, 21 will be needed to assess
      reproducibility. For these volunteers, the number of double/triple stack scans will be equal
      to 3.

      Project Assessments, Procedures: participant demographics and physical activity will be
      obtained and the validated Swiss FRAX questionnaire will be filled to determine the
      epidemiology-based 10-year fracture risk. Grip strength will be measured. A DXA measurement
      at the hip will be done according to the standard protocol of the Universitätspoliklinik für
      Osteoporose. For participants at elevated vertebral fracture risk, lateral and
      antero-posterior DXA of the spine will be added for vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) and
      spine areal bone mineral density (aBMD). The HR-pQCT examination per se consists then of up
      to 3 repeated double stack scans at the distal radius and triple stack scans at the distal
      tibia.

        The project population are female and male healthy volunteers above 20 years old. Following
        international recommendations, the number of participants for the calculation of the
        reference intervals is set to 576. Among these, the assessment of reproducibility of the
        novel bone strength estimation methodology will be performed in 42 participants.
