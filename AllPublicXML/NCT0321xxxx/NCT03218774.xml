  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 2 community intervention
      approaches to maintain community mobility and walking speed in adults with cerebral palsy who
      have previously completed an 8 week course of physical therapy.

      The proposed study will address the lifelong need for fitness in adults with cerebral palsy
      compared to individuals provided with a home exercise program at the end of their
      individualized physical therapy, individuals in the fitness group willâ€¦

      Primary Hypothesis:

        1. Have higher Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory Computer Adapted Test (PEDICAT)
           scores at the +12 weeks post intervention visit

        2. Increase their PEDICAT scores across the study period, while the home fitness group will
           decrease performance on the PEDICAT.

        3. Complete the Timed Up and Go (TUG) more quickly at +12 weeks post intervention

           Secondary Hypothesis (study not powered for these variables):

        4. Walk further on the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) at the +12 weeks post intervention visit
