  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is the destruction of the tooth structure in the presence of organic acids
      produced by cariogenic bacteria located in the dental biofilm (Dowker et al., 1999 and
      Robinson et al., 2000).Tooth enamel comprises 90% substituted hydroxyapatite (Ca10 (PO4)6(OH)
      2), which is subjected to consecutive cycles of demineralization and remineralization. This
      is an interrupted process, with periods of remineralization and demineralization occurring,
      depending on the state of the oral environment in terms of the prolonged accumulation and
      retention of bacterial plaque on the enamel surface (Aoba, 2004).

      Oral bacteria ferment carbohydrates to produce organic acids which lower the pH and cause the
      subsurface dissolution of the hydroxyapatite crystals. Under normal physiological conditions
      (pH7), saliva is supersaturated with calcium and phosphate ions which diffuse into the
      vacancies created during acid-mediated demineralization episodes (Dowker et al., 1999 and
      Robinson et al., 2000). The demineralization of enamel (white spot lesions) is a significant
      problem during and after orthodontic treatment with prevalence 71.1% and various preventive
      measures have been suggested to minimize the incidence (Derks et al., 2004 and Al Maaitah et
      al., 2011).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In orthodontic patients, demineralization usually takes place in the form of white or brown
      spots on the enamel around the brackets and can lead to cavitation (Al Maaitah et al., 2011).
      White spot lesions compromise esthetics and can be extremely difficult or even impossible to
      reverse.

      Natural remineralization through saliva involving a mineral gain in the surface layer of
      white spot lesions has little improvement on the esthetic and structural properties of the
      deeper lesions (Karlinsey et al., 2009 and Cochrane et al., 2010). Management of white spot
      lesion should involve methods of both preventing demineralization and encourage the
      remineralization of existing lesions. In both of these processes, the efficacy of fluoride is
      well established. Fluoride increases the initial rate of remineralization of early enamel
      lesions. Consequently, it slows down the caries process and arresting the lesion. Fluoride
      varnish provides a protective coat over the tooth which adheres longer to the tooth surface
      (Demito et al., 2004 and Ten Cate et al., 2008).
