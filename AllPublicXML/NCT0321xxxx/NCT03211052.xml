    <textblock>
      This study investigates neoadjuvant TAK-700 orteronel for 6 months prior to prostatectomy.
      The three year biochemical free survival is the primary endpoint. There are a number of 2nd
      endpoints such as pathological complete response rate, the need for adjuvant radiation
      therapy, use of post operative radiotherapy an the rate of positive margins at surgery.
      Translational endpoints include measuring tumoural and plasma testosterone as well as other
      androgens.

      Patients with untreated high risk and intermediate risk operable prostate cancer will be
      treated with TAK-700 (plus LHRH agonist) for 24 weeks prior to planned prostatectomy.

      Study Objectives:

      To investigate if neoadjuvant TAK-700 with LHRH agonists and prostatectomy is associated with
      a delay in progression free survival compared to prostatectomy alone

      To evaluate response (CR and PR) after at least 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with the study
      drugs Collection of Plasma, tissue and functional imaging with MRI To evaluate (molecular)
      expression of AR regulated genes and tumour immunohistochemistry. Molecular and protein
      expression will be correlated with intracellular androgen levels and pathologic response to
      ADT

      136 patients will be randomised to this study. 68 patients will receive neoadjuvant therapy
      with TAK-700 and Leuprorelin Acetate followed by surgery and 68 patients will receive surgery
      alone.

      This trial aims to recruit 136 patients with clinically localised prostate cancer. Patients
      will be stratified according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk
      stratification criteria and type of planned surgery. Definitions of risk categories can be
      found in the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
