  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators noticed a variable prescription of blood components to haematological
      patients in the hospital. This study will analyze the prescription and administration of
      blood components to Haematological patients (pre measurement). Based on these results
      guidelines on transfusion triggers will be updated and educated to the physicians and new ICT
      (information and communications technology) implementations will be added to the electronic
      order for blood components. The investigators hope to see afterwards (post measurement) a
      more stable prescription and administration of blood components and a more economic use of
      blood components.

      This study is set up as a first step of implementing patient blood management (PBM) in this
      hospital. PBM is an evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach to optimizing the care of
      patients who might need transfusion. Not only in pre/per/postoperative setting but also in
      haematology PBM guidelines can be implemented. Examples are: use of a restrictive haemoglobin
      trigger for red blood cells (RBC) transfusion, single use policy for the administration of
      RBC and platelets, administration only for correct indications (including the introduction of
      an electronic clinical decision support system for ordering blood components), ...

    <measure>how do haematologists prescribe blood components?</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year pre measurement and up to 1 year post measurement</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators use a questionaire (15-20 questions) to evaluate how haematologists prescribe red blood cells and platelets. Do they analyze the haemoglobin and platelet count before and after each blood transfusion? Do they apply single unit policy for RBC and platelet transfusions? Which triggers are used for RBC and platelet transfusion? Which guidelines are followed? The investigators will send this questionnaire to all haematologists (including haematologists in training) in 2017 (premeasurement) and in 2019-2020 (postmeasurement).
The investigators will also use data (which is already available in the patient files) about blood transfusion to evaluate the ordering and administration of blood components during 1 year. For which indication is blood ordered? Is the Haemoglobin level known before the order is send to the blood bank?</description>

    <description>The investigators will again use data (which is already available in the patient files) about blood transfusion to evaluate the ordering and administration of blood components during 1 year after the intervention phase. For which indication is blood ordered? Is the Haemoglobin level known before the order is send to the blood bank? Did the interventions lead to less prescriptions/administrations of blood components and more single unit transfusion? We will use SPSS for statistical analysis (frequencies, percentages and means, scatter plots)</description>
