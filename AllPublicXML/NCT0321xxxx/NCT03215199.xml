    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing a web-based psychosocial screening
      application to usual care in a cohort of surgically-treated head and neck cancer patients to
      determine its efficacy in monitoring depression and distress, and prompting necessary
      psychiatry/psychology referrals. In addition, treatment adherence, rehabilitation and return
      to work, primary care utilization, and survival will be monitored.

      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing a web-based psychosocial screening
      application to usual care in a cohort of surgically-treated head and neck cancer patients.

      This study will utilize a web-based application available on desktop or laptop computers, and
      smartphones. The application involves monitoring using the NCCN Distress Thermometer Score,
      the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR) score, and the Head
      and Neck Research Network (HNRN-33), a patient-reported, validated functional outcomes score.
      These assessments will be completed at baseline, 2 weeks postoperatively, and monthly
      thereafter until 12 months. Patients will have the option of filling out questionnaires more
      frequently if desired.

      This web-based application, the NAPT App, will allow patients to alert the treatment team of
      their current state of mood or distress. Automatic alerts will be sent to the team if a
      Distress Score of &lt;/=3, a QIDS score &gt;/=11, or suicidal ideation are expressed in the
      application.

      The study duration will be 12 months with a primary endpoint of 6 months. Our primary outcome
      will be NCCN Distress Thermometer Score at 6 months, with secondary outcomes of the QIDS and
      HNRN-33 functional scores at 6 and 12 months. Additional outcomes assessed will pertain to
      completion of adjuvant therapy, weight maintenance, rehabilitation and return to work, and
      survival. Health services delivery outcomes, such as primary care visits, emergency
      department visits, hospitalizations, and narcotic use will also be evaluated.

Patients will be given access to a web-based application that monitors depression, distress, and functional outcomes scores at regular intervals for 12 months. Patients will be able to alert the treatment team of decreased mood, increased distress, and functional issues impacting both. Patients will also be able to track their mood and distress levels throughout the 12 months and involve care-givers in monitoring as well.</description>
