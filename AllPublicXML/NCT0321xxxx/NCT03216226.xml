  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial's objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of repeated single doses of
      dasiglucagon* and GlucaGen following subcutaneous (s.c.) administration in T1DM patients and
      further to evaluate the safety and tolerability of dasiglucagon and GlucaGen.

      *dasiglucagon is the proposed International Nonproprietary Name (pINN) for ZP4207
