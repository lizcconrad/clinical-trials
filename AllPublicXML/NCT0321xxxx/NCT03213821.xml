  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effect of high calorie high protein diet versus high calorie,glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
      based protein intake in non-obese advanced HF patients will be assessed. In this regard,
      protein intake impact will be measured on muscle mass, physical performance and renal
      function as main outcome. Rehospitalization, quality of life, depression an inflammatory
      status are second endpoints.

      Patient examinations:

      Baseline data will be gathered on demographic and clinical characteristics, medical history,
      treatments and medications. Before initiating intervention, individuals will be assessed for
      anemia and 25 (OH) D2 and electrolytes status. Any insufficiency or imbalance will be
      corrected by drug therapy or supplementation. At baseline and at all visits, half or one
      month intervals, routine laboratory tests for heart failure patients (including Complete
      blood count (CBC), electrolytes status, glucose, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride, blood
      urea nitrogen (BUN), C-reactive Protein (CRP),creatinine, uric acid, ferritin, 25 (OH) D,
      B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), thyroid function, Prealbumin, urine analysis), appetite
      status and anthropometric measurements (weight, Hip and waist circumference) will be
      performed. At baseline and by the end of month 6, body composition, muscle mass, hand grip
      strength, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), plasma lactate and interleukin 6 (IL-6),
      GFR, depression status and quality of life will be assessed. Follow up duration will be one
      year for measuring readmission and mortality rate. If a study participant did not attend a
      visit, a staff of randomized clinical trial (RCT) center will attempt to reach her/him,
      her/his designated friend or family member by phone call.

    <intervention_model_description>Study design A randomized, parallel-arm, controlled pilot study is designed. Sample size is determined 50 participants per treatment arm using the stepped rules of thumb, with standardized effect sizes of 0.1 or less and power 80% for main trial (n=100). After baseline assessments, balanced permuted block method will be used for randomization. Concealment of the randomization sequence will be performed by the RCT center of Rajaie Cardiovascular, Medical and Research Center. Intervention will be according to the randomization sequence.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>For each participant, weighed food records of 3 consecutive days will be analyzed for estimation of calorie and macronutrient intake and dietary preferences. To make sure good compliance, diets will be developed regarding patient's dietary habits and preferences individually. High calorie (30-35 kcal/kg Ideal body weight) diets including 6-8 small meals will be formulated. Intervention group will receive high protein diet as recommended to preserve muscle mass (1.2-1.5 g/kg IBW). Comparison group will receive protein based on GFR to preserve renal function. For older adults (&gt;65 years) protein content of diet will be as recommended by the international study group to review dietary protein needs with aging (PROT-AGE). In subjects with lower intake of protein, carbohydrate will be substituted. Both group will receive low fat diet.</description>
