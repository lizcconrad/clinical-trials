  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP)is one of the more serious complications of pregnancies that
      occur after a prior cesarean delivery. No clinical guidelines have been issued for the
      management of CSP. More than 30 treatment methods are reported to be used in managing CSP.
      However, which management can achieve better clinical effects remains unknown. Therefore,
      this prospective study is designed to compare the outcome between MTX + transvaginal surgery
      and UAE + D&amp;C in the treatment of CSP.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Increased levels of serum Î²-hCG and ultrasonography findings. The criteria for diagnosis by
        ultrasonography was the presence of the following: (1) an empty uterine cavity and
        endocervical canal; (2) detection of the placenta and/or a gestational sac embedded in the
        hysterectomy scar; (3) the presence of the gestation sac with or without a fetal pole and
        with or without fetal cardiac activity (depending on the gestational age) in the anterior
        part of the uterine isthmus; and (4) a thin (1-3 mm) or absent myometrial layer between the
        gestational sac and the bladder. All patients had taken Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to
        clarify the diagnosis . Pregnancy tissues were identified by histopathology examinations of
        the surgical tissues.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All enrolled patients had no contraindications for transvaginal surgery or UAE, including
        renal failure, active pelvic infection, clotting disorders, or known allergy to the
        contrast material.
