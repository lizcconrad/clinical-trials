  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to now, no studies are available where a comparison has been made between the accuracy of,
      on the one hand, the gold standard PSG and, on the other hand, a home monitoring sleep
      apnea-diagnostic system, consisting of a pulse oximeter, and accelerometer, a smartphone for
      snoring analysis, and a mattress for ballistocardiographic (BCG) recordings.

      The purpose of this study is twofold. On the one hand, a comparison between the predictive
      performance of an automated home monitoring system and the gold standard PSG in sleep apnea
      diagnosis will be performed. The home monitoring system consists of a pulse oximeter, an
      accelerometer, a smartphone to record ambient sound, and a mattress to record the BCG signal.
      This system will be provided by KU Leuven and Equilli, two partners that work together with
      the Sleep Laboratory at UZ Leuven and the group STADIUS of the KU Leuven in the OSA+ project.
      The system performs automated signal processing and classification in order to determine the
      presence of sleep apnea events. On the other hand, this study aims to improve the phenotyping
      of patients suffering from sleep apnea. This task will be first developed using the classical
      PSG and later an evaluation will be performed on the less obtrusive system.
