      Parallel, double blind, randomized, IRB-approved study involving approximately 160 subjects
      to complete. Subjects were randomly assigned to either the test product (Arm &amp; Hammer Advance
      White Brilliant Sparkle) or the control (Crest Cavity Protection Regular) based on baseline
      mean whole-mouth plaque and gingival scores and age.Subjects brushed with their assigned
      dentifrice 2X daily and were evaluated for gingivitis, bleeding and plaque at Baseline and
      after 4-, 8-, and 12-weeks of product use.
