    <measure>Change from Baseline in Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS score is calculated as the sum of the following components:
0.121 × Back pain (BASDAI Question (Q)2 result) 0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Q6 result) 0.110 × PtGADA, 0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Q3 result) 0.579 × (natural logarithm of the CRP [mg/L] + 1) Spinal pain, PtGADA, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling and fatigue are all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units). The results of these calculations are summed to calculate the ASDAS.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) during the study conduct</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening until Safety Follow-Up Visit (up to Week 64)</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) during the study conduct</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening until Safety Follow-Up Visit (up to Week 64)</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires in patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is as infection that requires treatment with parenteral antibiotics
Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardise the patients, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above</description>

    <measure>Percentage of subjects meeting the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score inactive disease (ASDAS-ID) response criteria at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS-Inactive Disease score is defined as: ASDAS &lt; 1.3.
The ASDAS score is calculated as the sum of the following components:
0.121 × Back pain (BASDAI Question (Q)2 result) 0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Q6 result) 0.110 × PtGADA, 0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Q3 result) 0.579 × (natural logarithm of the CRP [mg/L] + 1) Spinal pain, PtGADA, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling and fatigue are all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units). The results of these calculations are summed to calculate the ASDAS.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of subjects meeting the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score major improvement (ASDAS-MI) response criteria at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ASDAS-MI is achieved when there is a reduction (improvement) &gt;= 2.0 in the ASDAS relative to Baseline. The ASDAS is calculated as the sum of the following components:
0.121 × Back pain (BASDAI Q2 result) 0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Q6 result) 0.110 × PtGADA 0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Q3 result) 0.579 × (natural logarithm of the CRP [mg/L] + 1) Back pain, PtGADA, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling and fatigue are all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units).

    <description>The 18F-fluoride positron-emission tomography - magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRIs) of the whole spine will be performed by using a whole-body PET/MRI system. Alternatively, subjects will be examined in supine position on a combined PET-computerized tomography (CT) system permitting the acquisition of co-registered CT and PET images in the same session. The PET-MRI or PET-CT scan will be performed at time points provided in approximately 25 subjects at selected sites.</description>
