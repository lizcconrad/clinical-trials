  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance has become a major threat to global public health. It is driven by a
      multitude of factors, however one of the leading factors is antibiotic prescribing.
      Inappropriate antibiotic use and overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics can lead to the
      development of resistant strains. Since in Malta the vast majority of antibiotics are
      acquired through prescription, targeting providers' prescribing behavior is an important
      strategy needed to try to curb antibiotic overuse and resistance.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a multifaceted social marketing
      intervention in changing general practitioners' (GPs) antibiotic prescribing behavior for
      patients with acute respiratory tract complaints in Malta. This quasi-experimental
      intervention study using an interrupted time series design includes three phases; a formative
      pre-intervention phase, an intervention phase and post-intervention evaluation phase, and
      will last a total of four years.

      During the pre-intervention phase, various stakeholders, including GPs, pharmacists and
      parents will be interviewed in order to get a better contextual understanding of antibiotic
      use in Malta. A 1-year baseline surveillance system will also be set up to collect actual
      diagnosis-specific antibiotic prescribing by GP. This data will, at a later stage, be used to
      measure the change in antibiotic prescribing behavior post-intervention stage. GPs stage of
      behavior change and intention to prescribe antibiotics will also be measure pre-intervention
      using questionnaires based on the theory of planned behavior and the transtheoretical model.

      The intervention stage will last 6 months and will include multiple components, including,
      delayed prescription pads, educational sessions, educational materials for patients and
      distribution of antibiotic guidelines. The intervention will be monitored closely through
      numerous process indicators.

      Following the intervention, GPs' stage of change and intention to prescribe antibiotics will
      be re-measured using the same questionnaire used pre-intervention. Surveillance data
      collection will be also be resumed and will provide data to measure the primary outcome as
      well as additional secondary outcomes.

      The primary outcome of interest is the change in the rate of antibiotic prescribing for
      patients presenting with an acute respiratory tract complaint.

    <description>An interrupted time series design will allow us to measure the change in the antibiotic prescribing rate post-intervention compared with the pre-intervention phase through segmented regression analysis.
