  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (i.e. the course of the blood
      concentrations of the administered trial drug) of faster-acting insulin aspart (faster
      aspart), and the currently marketed formulation of insulin aspart (NovoRapid®) when given as
      a bolus using an insulin pump in people with type 1 diabetes. The pharmacodynamic response
      (i.e. the course of the blood sugar lowering effect of the administered trial drug) and the
      safety and tolerability of faster aspart and NovoRapid® will also be assessed.

      The participants will be in the study for approx. 21 days. Each participant will have 5
      visits to the clinic, with an overnight stay at both dosing visits. Participants will have a
      number of tests, and they will have to give blood and urine samples.
