  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, stratified randomized, single-blind, parallel
      assignment, active control, non-inferiority trial. Patients are randomized 1 : 1 to either
      stent retriever(TonbridgeMT) or Solitaire™ for endovascular therapy for AIS. The study aims
      to evaluate the benefit and safety of stent retriever(TonbridgeMT) for AIS therapy, as
      compared to Solitaire™.

      The main objective is to determine whether stent retriever(TonbridgeMT) will have
      non-inferior successful recanalization rate compared to Solitaire™ when applied to
      endovascular therapy for AIS.

      The secondary objectives is to verify whether there isn't significant differences in time to
      achieve recanalization, NIHSS score, mRS score, and transportation performance between stent
      retriever(TonbridgeMT) and Solitaire™ when applied to endovascular therapy for AIS.

      The third objectives is to verify whether there isn't significant differences in the rate of
      symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, adverse event(AE), serious
      adverse event(SAE), actual condition of AE and device deficiencies between stent
      retriever(TonbridgeMT) and Solitaire™ when applied to endovascular therapy for AIS.
