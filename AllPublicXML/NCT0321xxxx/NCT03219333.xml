  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study that will test how an experimental drug (enfortumab vedotin) affects patients
      with cancer of the urinary system (urothelial cancer). This type of cancer includes cancer of
      the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter or urethra that has spread to nearby tissues or to other
      areas of the body.

      This clinical trial will enroll patients who were previously treated with a kind of
      anticancer drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI). Some CPIs have been approved for
      the treatment of urothelial cancer.

      This study will test if the cancer shrinks with treatment. This study will also look at the
      side effects of the drug. A side effect is a response to a drug that is not part of the
      treatment effect.

      Patients who sign up for this trial must also fall into one of these categories:

        -  Patients have already received treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy

        -  Patients have never received platinum-containing treatment and are not eligible for
           treatment with cisplatin.

      This study will examine the safety and anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin given
      intravenously to patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who
      previously received a CPI and either previously received platinum-containing chemotherapy
      (Cohort 1) or are platinum-naïve and cisplatin-ineligible (Cohort 2). Patients who received
      platinum in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting and did not progress within 12 months of
      completion will be considered platinum-naïve. Approximately 100 patients are expected to be
      enrolled in each cohort. The primary goal of the study is to determine the confirmed ORR of
      enfortumab vedotin.
