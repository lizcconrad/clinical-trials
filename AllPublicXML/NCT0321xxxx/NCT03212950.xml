  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded (for insulin type), single centre, crossover design young adult
      study, on 20 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D), aged 18 to 25 (inclusive) years, measuring
      time in glucose values within 3.9 - 10 mmol/l (70-180 mg/dl) under supervision of DreaMed
      Glucositter using either faster-acting insulin Aspart (Fiasp®, European Medicines Agency
      number EMEA/H/C/004046) or normal acting insulin Aspart.

      Study duration will be about 3 weeks per subject, 5 month overall.

      The objectives of this clinical investigation is:

      1. to evaluate the safety and efficacy of blood glucose control using the DreaMed Glucositter
      with Fiasp® in young adults with T1D during and after unannounced afternoon physical activity
      and unannounced meals, in a controlled in-hospital environment.

      Primary endpoint is significant between-group difference (intervention Fast-CL versus control
      Regular-CL) in time within range of glucose values within 3.9 - 10 mmol/l (70-180 mg/dl)
      during the unannounced afternoon exercise and unannounced standardized meals from 15:00 till
      18:00 next day based on sensor glucose readings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has documented T1D, as defined by the American Diabetes Association and
