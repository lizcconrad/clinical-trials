  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) is defined as the occurrence of fetal death at &gt;20 weeks'
      gestation. IUFD affects about 1 in 160 pregnancies (6-7 per 1000 births). Optimal diagnostic
      evaluation for cases of IUFD is generally based on extensive protocol testing i.e. maternal
      and fetal blood tests, fetal bacteriology, cytogenetic analysis, autopsy, and placental
      examination. This extensive protocol testing may vary in clinical practice and interpretation
      of the results is rarely performed by multidisciplinary staff to establish cause of death.
      These findings are related to the fact that there are very few epidemiological studies to
      validate optimal protocol, no French recommendations on this subject, and a relative lack of
      pathologists with expertise in perinatal pathology. Only, one recent prospective study from
      the Netherlands has concluded that extensive protocol testing should be redefined and some
      diagnostics tests may only be performed with suggestive clinical circumstances. However these
      recommendations may not be applicable to all populations and countries. To date, there are no
      French published series on IUFD to evaluate causes of death in France and thereafter to
      better define optimal diagnostic evaluation tests. Improvement in prenatal diagnosis in
      France may contribute to detection of the vast majority of severe chromosomal abnormalities
      and malformed fetuses and particularly those at risk of death. Retrospective cohort
      unpublished data on IUFD from Lille and Caen have reported exceptional deaths attributable to
      chromosomal or malformation abnormalities. In fact in these two series, most deaths were
      related to placental diseases or fetal growth retardation. The hypothesis is that extensive
      protocol testing is not helpful in clinical practice and selective protocol testing focused
      on specific risk situations can be as efficient.
