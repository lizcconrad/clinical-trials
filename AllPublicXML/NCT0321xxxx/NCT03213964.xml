  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose/maximum feasible dose
      (MTD/MFD) of a single infusion of FATE-NK100 via intra-peritoneal catheter in women with
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer meeting one of the following
      minimal prior treatment requirement:

        -  Platinum resistant: may receive FATE-NK100 as 2nd line (as 1st salvage therapy).
           Platinum resistant is defined as disease that has responded to initial chemotherapy but
           demonstrates recurrence within a relatively short period of time (&lt; 6 months) following
           the completion of treatment.

        -  Platinum sensitive: may receive FATE-NK100 as 3rd line therapy (as 2nd salvage therapy).
           Platinum sensitive is defined as the recurrence of active disease in a patient who has
           achieved a documented response to initial platinum-based treatment and has been off
           therapy for an extended period of time (≥ 6 months).

    <description>FATE-NK100 is a donor-derived NK cell product comprising ex vivo activated effector cells with enhanced anti-tumor activity.
FATE-NK100 is administered to determine the maximum tolerated doze/maximum feasible dose (MTD/MFD).
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) remains the only FDA approved drug that is capable of promoting NK cells activation and survival.
