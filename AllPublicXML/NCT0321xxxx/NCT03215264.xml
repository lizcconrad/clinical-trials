             during screening and a negative urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior to receiving
             the first dose of study drug. If the screening serum test is done within 3 days prior
             to receiving the first dose of study drug, a urine test is not required. If a patient
             is of childbearing potential the patient must agree to use effective contraception
             (see Appendix C for acceptable methods) during the study and for 120 days after the
             last dose of study drug. Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than
             medical reasons):

             (screening) evaluation

          -  Post hysterectomy, oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Documented hysterectomy or
             oophorectomy must be confirmed with medical records of the actual procedure or
             confirmed by an ultrasound. Tubal ligation must be confirmed with medical records of
             the actual procedure otherwise the patient must be willing to use 2 adequate barrier
             methods throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after
             the last dose of study drug

          -  If male, agrees to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first
             dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of study drug

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

             laboratory requirements within 4 weeks of starting treatment

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500 per uL

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

               -  Platelets &gt;100,000 per uL

               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN OR Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 60 by Cockcroft-Gault
                  Equation if Creatinine &gt;1.5

               -  AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN (&lt; 5 x ULN if documented liver metastases)

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 ULN OR direct bilirubin &lt; ULN if total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  INR &lt; 2.0

          -  Experienced resolution of toxic effect(s) of the most recent prior anti-cancer therapy
             to Grade &lt;1 (except alopecia or neuropathy). If patient underwent major surgery or
             radiation therapy of &gt;30 Gy, they must have recovered from the toxicity and/or
             complications from the intervention.

             participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator, including, but not limited

             preclude adequate absorption.

          -  Allergy to benzamide, inactive components of entinostat, or any of the other
             administered therapies

          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation

          -  Known G6PD deficiency, severe psoriasis, porphyria, macular degeneration, or severe
             diabetic retinopathy due to greater potential HCQ toxicity

             and have a blood pressure ≤ 150/100 mmHg at the time of enrollment.
