  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study requiring only three patients to serve as a proof of concept that
      gadoxetate disodium (a liver specific contrast agent) can be used to improve images taken
      just before liver SBRT treatments.

      The hypothesis of this research is that if gadoxetate disodium improves image quality at the
      time of treatment, then it can be used for image guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Image guidance
      is the procedure where the 3D CT image that is used to plan a radiotherapy treatment, is
      aligned to a 3D image taken just before treatment. The better the alignment, the more
      accurate the treatment, which is crucial for high dose treatments such as SBRT.

      This research is important for two main reasons. First, it is much less invasive than the
      standard of care which involves surgically implanting markers in the liver that can move over
      time. The benefit to harm ratio for surgery, compared to an injection, is much more dramatic.
      Furthermore, not all patients are surgical candidates, and therefore in those cases radiation
      oncologists must prescribed a larger area to treat to ensure that none of the cancerous
      region is missed. The drawback to this method is the irradiation of more normal tissue than
      necessary, which although deemed to have a greater benefit than harm, is not ideal. Secondly,
      this research has strong implications in the field of radiation oncology to move towards
      patient oriented radiotherapy treatments. If successful, radiation treatment to the liver
      could be performed in less treatments because of the confidence given to radiation
      oncologists of the cancer location; knowing exactly the healthy liver regions to avoid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary testing has already been performed and proves the notion that to achieve adequate
      image quality in a CT imaging phantom, at least 4 times the MRI administration dose would be
      required. These conclusions were supported qualitatively by a radiologist, radiation
      oncologist, and medical physicist, while also being backed up by quantitative measurement
      that has been accepted in the medical imaging literature. It is important for this work to
      first ensure that the imaging system is optimized, to have confidence that it will be
      successful for patients. Therefore before this study begins, substantial time and effort will
      be spent using phantoms and optimizing the imaging parameters and protocol.

      The current procedure for a patient that presents with liver cancer begins with a referral
      from the patient's primary care physician for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). A
      radiation oncologist makes the decision whether the patient is suitable for SBRT.

      If the patient is deemed acceptable by the radiation oncologist, the next step is to undergo
      diagnostic imaging so that the radiation oncologist can identify where exactly the disease is
      located, and start the SBRT plan. Using the diagnostic images, the radiation oncologist
      outlines the areas to treat, as well as the areas that they want to spare. This information
      is given to a physicist who then plans the optimal way of delivering radiation based on the
      oncologist's specifications. Once the plan is approved by the radiation oncologist, the
      patient can be treated.

      At the time of treatment, the patient is placed in an immobilization device on a treatment
      couch by a radiation therapist. Once the patient is immobilized, an x-ray imaging system that
      is attached to the treatment machine extends out towards the patient. The machine performs a
      180-degree rotation with continuous x-ray imaging. Once sufficient imaging has been
      performed, the therapists then align these images with the previous diagnostic CT image that
      was used to plan the radiation treatment. This alignment process tells the radiation
      therapists how much to adjust the patient on the treatment couch to ensure the most accurate
      treatment delivery. Once the patient is in the proper position, the radiation treatment is
      delivered and then the patient can leave.

      The treatment procedure is then performed on five separate days each separated by 48 hours.

      The proposed research follows the same procedure with addition of a contrast injection at the
      treatment stage. A consent form will be given to the patient entailing the purpose of this
      study. It will highlight the risks and benefits of receiving contrast prior to the radiation
      treatment, as well as a complete outline of the research. If the patient consents to
      receiving an intravenous contrast injection of gadoxetate disodium then the treatment
      procedure will change as follows:

      Before the patient is placed in the immobilization device, a MRI technologist with experience
      giving gadoxetate disodium injections will give the prescribed injection according to the
      patient's body weight. After the injection is given, a liver SBRT trained radiation therapist
      will lead the patient to the treatment machine and set them up in the immobilization device
      as per standard treatments. The same time-of-treatment imaging will be performed, with the
      hypothesis that the image quality will improve because of the addition of the contrast agent.
      The contrast agent will only be administered at the first treatment because of the limited
      data on repeat injections of the drug in humans. Furthermore, for the first treatment when
      contrast is administered, a radiation oncologist, radiologist, medical physicist, MRI
      technologist, and three radiation therapists will attend.

      The patient will then be monitored for another 30 minutes with support equipment ready in the
      rare event that a side effect occurs.

      As per standard treatments, the radiation oncologist will follow up with patients at regular
      intervals during and after treatment, making sure to check with the patient for possible side
      effects of using the contrast agent.

    <description>Because this is a proof of concept study, only one arm will be considered which is the patients that receive the one time contrast injection prior to their first treatment. The intervention is that although this drug is approved, an off label dosing regiment is being used to improve a separate imaging modality than what it was approved for. Based on preliminary phantom experiments and toxicity results in the literature, four times the dose was deemed safe and required to use for CBCT.</description>

    <description>Primovist is currently a drug marketed for MRI. In this study it will be administered intravenously at 4 times what it is quoted for MRI to enhance the different imaging modality (CBCT) to improve the accuracy of liver SBRT. Although liver SBRT usually consists of 5 treatments, contrast will only be administered during the first treatment.
Consulting Health Canada and Bayer HealthCare Canada (the drug manufacturer) deemed this use &quot;off label dosing&quot; which in Canada is at the discretion of the physician. Based on preliminary imaging testing, and a review of toxicity literature for this drug, the administration for this specific use was deemed appropriate to give adequate image quality, while simultaneously maintaining patient safety.</description>
