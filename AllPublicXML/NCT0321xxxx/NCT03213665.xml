    <textblock>
      This phase II Pediatric MATCH trial studies how well tazemetostat works in treating patients
      with solid tumors, non-hodgkin lymphoma, or histiocytic disorders that have spread to other
      places in the body and have come back or do not respond to treatment and have EZH2, SMARCB1,
      or SMARCA4 gene mutations. Tazemetostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with tazemetostat with advanced solid tumors (including central
      nervous system [CNS] tumors), lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor gain of function
      mutations in EZH2, or loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF complex subunits SMARCB1 or
      SMARCA4.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival in pediatric patients treated with tazemetostat
      that harbor gain of function mutations in EZH2, or loss of function mutations in the SWI/SNF
      complex subunits SMARCB1 or SMARCA4.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of tazemetostat in children with relapsed or
      refractory cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to tazemetostat and specifically,
      whether tumors that harbor different missense mutations or fusions will demonstrate
      differential response to tazemetostat treatment.

      II. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
