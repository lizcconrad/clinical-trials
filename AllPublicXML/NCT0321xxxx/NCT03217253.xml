  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effect of tazemetostat in treating patients
      with solid tumors or B-cell lymphomas with liver dysfunction that have spread to other places
      in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Tazemetostat may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tazemetostat in
      patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of tazemetostat in patients with varying
      degrees of hepatic dysfunction.

      II. To observe preliminary antitumor activity of tazemetostat in this population, especially
      in tumors with aberrations in EZH2 or SWI/SNF complex pathways.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive tazemetostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid tumors or B
             cell lymphoma that are metastatic or unresectable and for which standard treatment
             options do not exist; patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are eligible without

          -  All patients must have completed any prior chemotherapy, targeted therapy and major
             surgery, &gt;= 28 days before study entry; for daily or weekly chemotherapy without the
             potential for delayed toxicity, a washout period of 14 days may be acceptable, and
             questions related to this can be discussed with study principal investigator

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

             as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or bowels

          -  All prior treatment-related toxicities must be Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
             Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 grade =&lt; 1 (except alopecia) at the time of enrollment

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL

             institutional normal

          -  Patients with abnormal hepatic function will be eligible and will be grouped according
             to criteria; patients with active hemolysis should be excluded; no distinction should
             be made between liver dysfunction due to metastases and liver dysfunction due to other
             causes; this data will be captured in the case report form (CRF); registration
             laboratory investigations will be used to assign a patient to a hepatic function
             group; hepatic function tests should be repeated within 24 hours prior to starting
             initial therapy and may result in patients' group assignment being altered if
             different to registration test results

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate
             of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for 30 days after tazemetostat
             discontinuation

               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (&gt;= 12 continuous months of amenorrhea
                  with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus)

               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established, proper use of hormonal
                  contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices,
                  and copper intrauterine devices

               -  Female subjects who use hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier
                  method of birth control while on study treatment and for 30 days after
                  discontinuation of study treatment

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below:

               -  With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men
                  must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for at
                  least 4 months after the last dose of study drug; men must refrain from donating
                  sperm during this same period; in addition, female partners of male subjects
                  should adhere to the following:

                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD)(must provide medical documentation of IUD)

                    -  Hormonal contraceptive (partner must be on a stable dose of the same
                       hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before receiving study
                       drug) AND a condom (hormonal contraceptives must be supplemented with
                       condoms)

               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the
                  duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
                  patient; periodic abstinence and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening

          -  Whenever available, archival tissue (block or minimum 10 slides) is requested for
             molecular characterization, e.g. detection of somatic mutations and/or candidate
             biomarkers of response; this is not mandatory and lack of available tissue would not
             be an exclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  bisphosphonates in patients without bone disease is not permitted, except for the
                  treatment of osteoporosis
