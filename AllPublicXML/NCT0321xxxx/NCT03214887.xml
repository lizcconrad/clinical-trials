    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-blinded and randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of hyaluronan (HA) combined with autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) therapy for
      critical peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) patients.

      A total of 30 subjects will be recruited into the study. The subjects will be randomized into
      3 different arms. During the Phase I study, 9 subjects recruited while another 21 additional
      subjects will be recruited in Phase II after the review of DSMB and consultation of Taiwan
      FDA on the results of the Phase I study.

      Each subject will be administered 5~10 injections of RV-P1501, the number of injections
      depends on the size of the subject's ischemic leg. Each subject will receive treatment once.
      Subjects will be assigned to the treatments in random order. Evaluations including ABI,
      PWT/PFWT, clinical status, EF, CTA, biochemistry and hematology checked during the inclusion
      and exclusion evaluation, and will be taken at baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks,
      and 24 weeks after the treatment.
