  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a current opioid epidemic in the United States partially fueled by excess
      prescribing practices after surgery. The objective of this study is to decrease the amount of
      opioids needed after ambulatory hand surgery. In this randomized control trial, patients will
      be randomized into a patient education group and into a control group. The education group
      will be provided with a pre-operative video detailing proper indications for opioid use after
      hand surgery, alternative pain management strategies to try before using prescription opioid
      medications, and side effects associated with opioid use. Patients will also receive
      information on the current opioid epidemic. Patients will be reminded of the information
      given pre-operatively after surgery in the post-anesthesia care unit. The control group will
      not receive pre-operative education and will only receive standard of care post-operative
      counseling by nursing in the post-anesthesia care unit. All patients will be given a pain
      log, pain medication diary and participate in phone/email surveys to determine number of
      opioid pills taken, pain levels, and satisfaction with surgery. The investigators hypothesize
      that the education group will have decreased opioid intake and increased patient satisfaction
      compared to the control group.
