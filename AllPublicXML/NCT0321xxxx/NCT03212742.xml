  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Stupp protocol is the standard treatment of glioblastoma multiform (GBM) which prognosis
      remains poor.

      The non-dividing nature of normal brain cells provides an opportunity to enhance the
      therapeutic ratio by combining radiation with inhibitors of replication-specific DNA repair
      pathways such poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, thus inducing more cytotoxic
      effects of DNA-damage related to treatment modalities, including alkylating reagents like
      temozolomide (TMZ).

      Olaparib, a potent PARP inhibitor, overcomes apoptotic resistance and sensitizes GBM cells
      for death receptor-mediated apoptosis induced by TRAIL (Tumor necrosis factor-Related
      Apoptosis Inducing Ligand). Moreover, inhibition of PARP activity increases cellular
      sensitivity to ionizing radiation: it was even suggested to be more pronounced in tumors than
      in normal tissue.

      Lastly, progress in technical imaging and intensity-modulated-radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques
      provide new possibilities for sparing healthy tissues.

      HGGs are the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor. There is a real need to
      improve care management of GBM patients. Attempts to achieve cure by increasing radiation
      dose result in unacceptable neurotoxicity. As for radiosensitizers, they can exacerbate
      normal tissue damage.

      Since GBM represent a rapidly dividing cell population within the nonreplicating normal
      brain, the therapeutic ratio may be enhanced by specific radiosensitization of proliferating
      cells. Resistance to apoptosis is a paramount issue in the treatment of HGG. Targeting PARP
      by the inhibitors like olaparib can reduce proliferation and lowers the apoptotic threshold
      of HGG (effect showed in vivo and in vitro).

      In this context, we propose a phase I-IIa trail to investigate the toxicity and efficacy of
      olaparib and TMZ concomitantly with radiotherapy in first line treatment of unresectable high
      risk HGG.

      Correlation between treatment response and tumor profiling will allow us to identify
      biomarkers that can be useful in treatment improvement and/or present a prognostic value.
      Then, the transfer of this approach will be evaluated in terms of compatibility with the
      requirements of diagnostic.

    <description>The therapeutic regimen will be divided into 2 different periods:
Radiotherapy period The patient will start IMRT (60Gy/30fr/6 weeks), TMZ(Temozolomide) chemotherapy (75mg/m²/day), and olaparib on the same day, on a Monday (day 1), within 6 weeks after surgery. The daily dose of TMZ (75 mg/m²) will be continued until the end of radiotherapy (6 weeks) and olaparib will be continued with the same dose until 4 weeks after the end of IMRT, as a single agent.
Maintenance period TMZ will then be re-introduced 4 weeks after the end of IMRT at the dose of 150 mg/m2/day on days 1 to 5 every 28 days, for a total of 6 cycles. Concomitantly, olaparib will be daily given at the maintenance dose level up to confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.
We propose 7 dose levels to reach the target dose of 400 mg per day (200 mg twice daily) of olaparib continuously</description>
