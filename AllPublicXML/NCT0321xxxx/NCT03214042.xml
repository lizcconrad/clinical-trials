  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a prospective, single-center, self-controlled, clinical trial to verify the
      efficacy and safety of K-Rod dynamic stability system in the repair of lumbar degenerative
      diseases following 2 years follow-up, aiming to provide references for clinical treatment of
      lumbar degenerative diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Posterior internal fixation and fusion systems are still one of the main methods for the
      treatment of chronic back pain due to intervertebral disc degeneration, but adverse
      reactions, such as accelerated regression of adjacent segments, are often inevitable during
      the treatment.

      At present, various pedicle screw-based posterior dynamic stability systems of the lumbar
      spine have become an alternative fusion therapy for lumbar degenerative diseases. Dynamic
      stability is defined to reduce the loading on the intervertebral disc/articular surfaces, to
      maintain movement under mechanical load, to limit the abnormal movement of the spinal
      segment, and to reduce the stress on the bone-screw interface dynamically and stably. An
      ideal fixation system will be stable enough to maximize the fusion rate without the need for
      excessive rigidity, as well as to maintain maximum load and physiological posture of the
      vertebral segment, thereby reducing the horizontal stress of the adjacent segment.

    <description>To quantify disability for pain. The Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire contains ten questions concerning intensity of pain, ability to take care of oneself, lifting, ability to walk, ability to sit, ability to stand, sleep quality, sexual life, social life, and ability to travel. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability.</description>

    <description>Sixty-seven patients with lumbar degenerative diseases were treated with K-rod dynamic stabilization system. All patients were followed for 2 years. K-rod dynamic stabilization system was purchased from Biotech, USA, consisting of titanium alloy pedicle screw, titanium alloy line and polyether ether ketone (PEEK) shell between pedicle screw heads.</description>
