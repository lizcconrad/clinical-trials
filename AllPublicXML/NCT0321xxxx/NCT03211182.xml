    <textblock>
      The lifestyle intervention program focusing on healthy dietary habit and exercise effectively
      prevents progression to diabetes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the
      effectiveness of lifestyle intervention program on pre-diabetics subjects in Taiwan.

    <textblock>
      The study is a 2-parallel groups' randomized controlled trial. Participants with elevated
      fasting plasma glucose concentrations (FPG 100-125 mg/dl) or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C
      5.7-6.3%) are enrolled. All study subjects are randomized to receive a lifestyle intervention
      (intervention group) or regular prevention education (control group). The parameters are
      obtained from physical examination and biochemical assessments by well-trained case manager
      at baseline and each follow visit (3th months, 6th months and 12th months). All participants
      complete a structured questionnaire, including basic information, disease history, physical
      activity, food-frequency, stage of change, and social support situation.

    <description>healthy lifestyle education and individualized counseling by well-trained case manager. The main goals of the lifestyle intervention included regular moderate intensity physical activity 150 min per week or more, and dietary strategies which reduce the risk of developing diabetes. The dietary suggestion was modified by Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet. Participants with BMI&gt;= 24 kg/m2 were encouraged to gradually lose weight at a rate of 0.5-1.0 kg per week until they achieved a BMI of 24 kg/m2.</description>
