  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teicoplanin is an antibiotic used very commonly to prevent infection during surgery. Its use
      has expanded rapidly in the last few years, with around 18,500 doses administered in Leeds
      Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust alone, in 2014-15. Unfortunately, anaphylaxis (a severe allergic
      reaction) to the drug appears to be increasing. These reactions can result in admission to
      intensive care, prolong hospital stay, or even be fatal.

      It is vital that patients who suffer anaphylaxis have tests to accurately identify the cause,
      so they can avoid the drug in future. However these tests are currently very limited, because
      we don't have any diagnostic tools proven to confirm or refute a diagnosis of teicoplanin
      allergy. We have to make a 'best guess' diagnosis, leaving patients vulnerable to harm in the
      future, should they require antibiotics again. We need to reliably diagnose teicoplanin
      allergy to reduce this arm. Where a diagnosis of teicoplanin allergy is confirmed, patients
      and their doctors know to avoid it. Importantly, where allergy is excluded, teicoplanin can
      be safely used, avoiding alternatives that may be less effective, more toxic, and more
      expensive. This directly benefits individuals, saves the NHS money by reducing avoidable
      harm, and helps improve antibiotic stewardship at a population level - which in the long term
      helps reduce antibiotic resistance. The clinical need for this work has become imperative.

      Collaborating with our industry partner ThermoFisher (significant expertise in this area), we
      aim to:

        1. Standardise the current skin testing protocols being used when testing patients with
           suspected teicoplanin allergy.

        2. Develop laboratory tests to support the skin tests, and give a more confident diagnosis
           to patients.

        3. Understand how and why people develop allergy to teicoplanin, to better predict and
           modify the allergic response.
