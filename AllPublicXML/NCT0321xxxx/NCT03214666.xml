  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center phase I/II clinical trial of CD16/IL-15/CD33 (161533) tri-specific
      killer cell engager (TriKE) for the treatment of CD33-expressing high risk myelodysplastic
      syndromes, refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia or other CD33+ myeloid malignancies.
      The hypothesis is that 161533 TriKE will induce natural killer cell function by targeting
      malignant cells as well as CD33+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) which contribute to
      tumor induced immunosuppression. Because CD16 is the most potent activating receptor on NK
      cells, this single agent may induce a targeted anti-CD33+ tumor response.
