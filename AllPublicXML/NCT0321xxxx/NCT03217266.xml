      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 and radiation therapy
      in treating patients with soft tissue sarcoma. MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 may stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving MDM2 inhibitor
      AMG-232 and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount
      of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 (AMG 232) in combination
      with standard-dose radiotherapy in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in two separate patient cohorts
      (A, extremity or body wall; B, abdomen/pelvis/retroperitoneum).

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose (maximum tolerated
      dose/recommended phase 2 dosage [MTD/RP2D]) of AMG 232 in combination with radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine % necrosis and pathologic
      complete response (pCR) in final surgical resection specimen.

      III. To determine % local failure (LF), disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)
      at 2 years.

      IV. To determine pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of AMG 232 when combined with radiotherapy by
      assessing serial serum macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC)-1 levels.

      V. To determine AMG 232 exposure (pharmacokinetics)-response relationships (PD, toxicity, and
      efficacy).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine tumor volume changes determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
      computed tomography (CT) with and without contrast pre- and post-radiotherapy.

      II. To characterize clinical outcomes in patients treated with AMG 232 by genomic biomarkers.

      III. To determine the correlation between mdm2/4 expression determined by next-generation
      sequencing (NGS) and the protein levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

      IV. To explore the possibility of identifying tumor genetic mutations in (1) cell-free (cf)
      circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA), (2) deoxyribonucleic acid/ribonucleic acid
      (DNA/RNA) isolated from exosomes, and determine the concordance of these results and that
      from NGS.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 orally (PO) on day 2, days 2 and 4, days 2-4, days
      2-5, or days 1-5 of weeks -1 to 5. Patients also undergo radiation therapy daily on weeks
      1-5. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then at 2.5 years.
