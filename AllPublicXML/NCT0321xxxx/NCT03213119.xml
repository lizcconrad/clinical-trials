  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exploration of space is more effective when intrinsically rewarding elements are located
      in the visual scene. Thus, rewards could be exploited as a novel rehabilitation approach to
      various attentional disorders. The first part of the project aims to characterize these
      effects at the behavioural level. The interventional part consists then in the administration
      of Caloric Vestibular Stimulation (CVS), which by means of injection of a small quantity of
      water in the external ear activates the vestibular organs and subsequently vestibular-related
      brain areas. Among the observed brain activations, the possibility to reach cingulate areas
      appears particularly interesting because it foreshadows the possibility to further enhance
      attentional capture by rewards.

      CVS will be delivered to patients with brain lesion of the right hemisphere, engaged in
      cancellation tasks requiring the processing of targets of different nature (e.g. monetary or
      neutral). The main prediction is that CVS administration would enhance spatial exploration in
      terms of center of gravity of the cancellation and improved accuracy as a function of the
      type of target processed (e.g. its value).

    <description>For line bisection defined as the difference between participants' mark and the objective center of the line. For cancellation tasks it is calculated as the grand average of horizontal and vertical coordinates of all the marks. In both cases smaller indices indicate a leftward exploration bias, whereas larger indices indicate rightward bias.</description>
