  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization at home is booming. It is designed to meet the demands of patients and their
      families to continue care at home. It partially solves the problem of the lack of places in
      the &quot;long-term care&quot; structures and allows to respond to a desire of the health policy to
      reduce the lengths of stay in the hospital. Hospitalization at home is also an alternative in
      the management of chronic patients. Nevertheless, at the moment a certain number of requests
      for hospitalization at home remain unsuccessful or their implementation is complicated. In
      addition, the number of home health care provider has increased significantly in recent
      years. According to the federation of home health care provider, the number of beneficiaries
      increased by 1.7% in 4 years. The home health care provider would support 1,200,000 patients
      per year.

      The objective of the study is to analyze the factors participating in Implementation of a
      return home with a Hospitalization at home or a home health care provider during a return
      home project constructed with the patient and his / her relatives from the services of
      Oncology, oncology, hematology of the University Hospital of Strasbourg.
