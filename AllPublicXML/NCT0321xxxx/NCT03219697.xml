  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a primary care based intervention that combines group based
      parenting skills training and public health nurse home visits with a focus on healthy
      nutrition, activity and sleep, compared to regular health care will lead to improved weight
      status in 18 months-3 year old children.

      Healthy children at risk for obesity will be identified through primary care practices
      participating in TARGet Kids!. Families who participate in this study will be randomly
      assigned (having an equal chance of being in either group) to one of the two study groups
      that will run for 6-months:

      Group A: Receive 10-weeks of group parenting education sessions with 2-4 public health nurse
      home visits Group B: Receive regular health care

      In addition to the measures collected as part of TARGet Kids!, research assistants will
      collect the following information about you and your child before the start of the trial, and
      after 6-months:

      Parenting Questionnaires from the parent Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) from the
      parent A blood sample from your child

      We will measure the differences in weight, height, social, emotional and behavioural health,
      nutrition, physical activity, sleep, risk for heart disease and diabetes, and health care
      use.

    <description>If you are in the parenting education program group, you will be enrolled in our 10-week parenting education program, followed by three monthly 1-hr sessions. You and/or your partner will attend weekly parenting sessions which will take place at the office of your child's primary care provider for 10 weeks, followed by 3 booster sessions. Our Toronto Public Health Nurse, will arrange 2-4 home visits with you and your family during the 6 months. This first home visit will include learning more about your routines at home, and what is available in your neighbourhood. The home visits will focus on helping to apply the messages and skills from the group sessions in your home, and making connections in your neighbourhood that you find helpful such as recreational or nutrition programs or other supports for your family.</description>
