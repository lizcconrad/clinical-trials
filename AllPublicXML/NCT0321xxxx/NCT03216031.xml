  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wandsworth Integrated Falls and Bone Health Service (IF &amp; BHS) provides an evidence-based
      falls prevention exercise programme, but yearly about 500 of 1800 patients decline
      participation or do not continue to exercise. Our study seeks to address this efficiency gap
      by developing a gardening programme as an alternative to traditional exercise. In a
      preparation period (4/17-5/17) we will explore the special needs of the target population
      through interviews and create an age appropriate gardening site at &quot;Growhampton&quot;, a gardening
      project run by the University of Roehampton; from 5/17 to 9/17 a falls prevention gardening
      group will be implemented and evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The key purpose of the study is to provide and test an intergenerational gardening project as
      a choice for about 30 IF &amp; BHS patients who would otherwise decline exercise interventions.
      Patients previously assessed by Wandsworth Integrated Falls &amp; Bone Health Services have
      identified gardening as an enjoyable alternative to exercise classes. Gardening sessions will
      take place weekly (aiming for 3 groups with 10 patients and 2-4 students and/or staff members
      of the University of Roehampton). Through engaging patients in gardening activities the study
      seeks to achieve 4 main aims: 1. Increase physical activity levels; 2. improve mental and
      physical health outcomes; 3. foster self-efficacy and social connectedness; 4. reduce the
      risk of falls. The at falls risk population will benefit by engaging in a meaningful activity
      (designed and supported by clinicians and aided by students and staff members) which delivers
      on the core principles of strength, power, balance and coordination.

    <intervention_model_description>In the implementation phase, a falls prevention gardening group will be implemented. Staff members of the Integrated Falls and Bone Health Service will offer their patients who decline to take part in the standard prevention exercise programme or who have completed the other prevention classes to participate in a gardening programme. The goal is to recruit 30 patients as participants of the gardening programme and to engage them in weekly gardening activities for 8 weeks (either 8 weeks in a row or 8 attendances over 3 months to allow for sickness / other reasons for non-attendance). 3 groups with up to 10 patients and 2-4 students/staff members each should meet once per week for about 1 hour to engage in gardening activities at the new growing site. Only participants who have passed the risk screening of the Integrated Falls and Bone Health Service and who meet all inclusion criteria will be invited to join the gardening programme.</intervention_model_description>
