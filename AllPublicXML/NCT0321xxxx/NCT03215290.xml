  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-anatomical liver resection with appropriate resection margin was regarded as a potential
      curative treatment for selected major hepatic carcinoma due to preserving maximal normal
      liver, especially in cirrhotic patients. But occurrence of cutting surface related
      complications become a main challenge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to better manage the cutting surface after liver resection, we further applied
      trans-parenchymal compressing suture to &quot;not good&quot; cutting surface in hope of decreasing
      cutting surface related complication. A majority of studies investigating cutting surface
      management are limited to non-surgical treatments, such as the application of hemostasis
      agents including fibrin sealants, oxidized cellulose, and absorbable gelatin sponge13-15 .
      But there is no consensus regarding the necessity of the hemostatic agent application to the
      liver cutting surface. Up to date, few studies investigate surgical suture management of the
      cutting surface in liver resection.

For patients with any positive findings including bloodstain and (or) bile staining, the cutting surface was recognized as &quot;not good&quot; cutting surface and further trans-parenchymal compressing sutured, if possible, using a hepatic needle.</description>
