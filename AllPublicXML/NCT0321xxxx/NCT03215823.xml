  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The usefulness of videolaryngoscope has been verified by several studies, and the frequency
      of videolaryngoscopy is increasing in clinical practice. Data on the use of
      videolaryngoscopes, however, were not sufficiently accumulated when compared with data on the
      use of previously used macintosh laryngoscopes. In addition, videolaryngoscopy increases the
      success rate of endotracheal intubation compared to conventional macintosh laryngoscopy, but
      endotracheal intubation with videolaryngoscope is not successful in all cases with one
      intubation attempt. Therefore, if the difficult endotracheal intubation with the
      videolaryngoscope can be predicted in advance, it may be possible to improve the success rate
      of intubation by reducing unnecessary use of the videolaryngoscope and preparing other
      equipment. There are many studies on the preoperative examination that can predict the
      difficulty of intubation when using a macintosh laryngoscope. However, there are still
      attempts to find screening tests that predict precisely the difficult endotracheal intubation
      because the accuracy of screening tests is not high. In particular, there is a lack of
      research on factors that can predict difficult endotracheal intubation when using
      videolaryngoscope. Therefore, the investigators aimed to investigate the factors predictive
      of difficult endotracheal intubation when attempting intubation using videolaryngoscope.
