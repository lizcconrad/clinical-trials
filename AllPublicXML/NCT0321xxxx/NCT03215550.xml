  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischaemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. In patients with recent
      stroke, the 18F-fluoride positron emission tomography-computed tomography highlights
      high-risk culprit carotid plaque and is more discriminatory than 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.
      Using hybrid positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging investigators propose to
      build upon these findings by prospectively assessing 18F-fluoride uptake in a broad range of
      patients with acute transient ischaemic attack or ischaemic stroke. Investigators will
      specifically examine the association of 18F-fluoride uptake with multiparametric magnetic
      resonance imaging assessments of atherosclerotic plaque, especially the role of thrombus and
      lipid. Finally, using transcranial Doppler and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance brain
      imaging, an assessment of the functional consequences of 18F-fluoride-positive
      atherosclerotic plaque will be performed. If successful, this technique has a number of
      valuable translational applications including the better selection of patients for carotid
      intervention.

      The ability to identify the culprit carotid plaque represents a key goal in carotid artery
      imaging. Although an array of non-invasive imaging techniques can detect a wide spectrum of
      complementary high-risk characteristics, no single modality can reliably identify vulnerable
      plaques associated with future stroke development. Substantial histological data suggests
      that specific plaque components identify patients at high-risk for future ipsilateral stroke
      and cardiovascular events. This implies that investigators need to look beyond the
      traditional paradigm where the basis for carotid endarterectomy were formulated by an
      invasive imaging modality that provided no information on the arterial wall composition.
      Alternative imaging strategies are therefore required targeting not only in vivo carotid
      morphology but also plaque biology and disease activity. This is fundamental to optimal
      risk-stratification and appropriate selection of patients for high-risk vascular
      intervention. One new approach is to use non-invasive molecular imaging targeted at plaque
      biology using hybrid systems such as positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging.

      At the time of carotid endarterectomy, which is an established surgical intervention aimed at
      reducing the future risk of stroke in symptomatic patients, tissue will be collected, and
      lesion integrity and geometry will be preserved as much as possible. Specimens will be
      photographed in detail to permit subsequent assessment by independent and blinded reviewers.
      The excised tissue will be aligned and labelled to permit orientation in the carotid artery
      axis before undertaking 7.4 T magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subsequently, carotid plaque
      will be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cellular content, macrophage infiltration, apoptosis,
      and calcification-associated molecules within the plaques will be assessed by RNA analysis,
      immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence using a variety of validated markers.

        Patients with evidence of an acute stroke, transient ischaemic attack or amaurosis fugax
        will be recruited as early as possible, but within 14 days of symptom onset. All patients
        will undergo careful clinical evaluation including carotid Doppler ultrasound assessment
        and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. This cohort will be identified at the point
        they are referred to a vascular surgeon at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
