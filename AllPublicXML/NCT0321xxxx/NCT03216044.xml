      There are different variables that may influence the occurrence of chronic pain after
      childbirth. One of these could be c- section , pain status before childbirth or other
      psychological factors like fear of birth, irrational cognitive beliefs about delivery and
      perinatal complications. The pain status (intensity and location), demographic data,
      anesthesiological details and data about the circumstances of birth are evaluated by
      structured interview during pregnancy and 3 month and 12 moth after childbirth. The pregnant
      women received an individual code for access to the survey on the website of the study. The
      recruitment takes placed in doctors or midwifes office and by advertising. The commuting area
      was the city of Tuebingen (Germany). Women who feel uncomfortable with the media based survey
      supplied a written form. Study population is planned with 500 participants. The Institute for
      Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry support the statistical analysis.
