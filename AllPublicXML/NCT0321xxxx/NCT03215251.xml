    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effectiveness of an Intervention Bundle on Thirst Intensity and Dry
      Mouth among Patients admitted in ICUs. Patients were randomized into two groups -
      Experimental and Control group. Experimental group received intervention Bundle whereas
      control group didn't receive any intervention. Usual care was continued in both the groups.

      The Convenience sampling technique was used to select Maharishi Markandeshwar institution of
      Medical Science and Researches Hospital, Mullana, Ambala. Intensive Care Units and a total of
      60 patients in those units were also selected conveniently. The selected patients were
      randomly assigned to experimental and control group using lottery method. The total sample
      size for the study was 60 patients i.e. - 30 in experimental group and 30 in control group.

      Experimental Group -patients were explained regarding administration of intervention
      bundle.Assessment of patients' mouth and lips was determined firstly. Intervention bundle
      consisted of sterile cold wet oral swab wipes and sterile ice cold water sprays administered
      for in two sessions of 15 minutes each. First session was given in 15 minutes, patients
      received cold wet oral swab wipes in oral cavity 2 to 3 times and mouth spray with 5 to 6
      sprays. A maximum of 9 wipes and 18 sprays of sterile water. After administration of
      intervention bundle, Post test 1 was taken after 15 minutes observation with the same tools.
      Then researcher waited for 15 minutes after post test1 and session two was administered in 15
      minutes with a maximum of 9 wipes and 18 sprays of sterile water. Post test 2 was taken after
      15 minutes of session two.

      Control group: control group was not given any intervention. Sample characteristics and
      clinical data (variables) were recorded in record sheet and thirst intensity and dry mouth
      scores were assessed only. After 30 minutes of pre test scores, post test 1 was taken and
      data were recorded. Then after, 30 minutes of post test 1, post test 2 was taken and data
      were recorded.

      (Intervention to the control group was given after accomplishment of Post test for ethical
      consideration).

    <description>Assessment of the patient's mouth and lips determined, to check any stickiness or dryness in the mouth or around lips or split skin at the corners of the mouth or cracked lips. Intervention bundle consisted of sterile cold wet oral swab wipes and sterile ice cold water sprays administered for in two sessions of 15 minutes each. First session was given in 15 minutes, patients received cold wet oral swab wipes in oral cavity 2 to 3 times and mouth spray with 5 to 6 sprays. A maximum of 9 wipes and 18 sprays of sterile water.
