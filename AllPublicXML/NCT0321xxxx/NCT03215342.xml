  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquired brain injury (e.g., traumatic brain injury, brain tumour, brain infections) is one
      of the leading causes of death and disability for children and adolescents. Importantly,
      injuries affecting the brain in childhood or adolescence appear during a time of development
      when the brain is particularly vulnerable. Thus, pediatric acquired brain injury does not
      only impact cognitive functions at the time of injury or onset of disease, but also cognitive
      functions that are yet to develop. Changes in cognitive function, and in particular executive
      dysfunction due to acquired brain injury, cause significant real-life disability, yet solid
      evidence in support of executive functioning interventions for children and adolescents is
      lacking. In the present study different group-based cognitive rehabilitation interventions
      will be compared. The aim of the study is to investigate if a group-based &quot;brain training&quot;
      intervention is able to improve executive function in children and adolescents after acquired
      brain injury. Efficacy will be assessed immediately after intervention, but also six months
      after the intervention. The project is in line with international research efforts aimed at
      establishing more knowledge about how children and adolescents with brain injuries respond to
      cognitive rehabilitation.
