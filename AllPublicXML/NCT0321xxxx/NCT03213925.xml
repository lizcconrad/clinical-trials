  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients normally receive either conservative breast surgery
      or mastectomy followed by radiation therapy. Some patients achieve a complete response after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Considering that radiation therapy is an effective treatment for
      subclinical microscopic disease, the question arises whether breast surgery before radiation
      therapy can be avoided in the subgroup of patients with complete response after neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

    <description>After clinical response, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed and analyzed by two independent radiologists. Complete image response is defined by no enhanced tumor visible on any serial images.
Radiation therapy to the breast with or without regional nodal area is performed within 12 weeks after completion of chemotherapy with conventional dose (25x200cGy). Additional boost of 16 Gy in the primary involved tumor region.</description>
