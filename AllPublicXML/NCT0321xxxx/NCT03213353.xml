  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, randomized, two-period cross-over study with 72 healthy male and
      female volunteers. The investigational products will be given (after fasting overnight) at
      separate visits separated by 7 ± 3 days. Blood for pharmacokinetic analyses will be drawn
      pre-dose and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 60, 75, 90, 105 minutes, as well as 2, 2.25, 3, 4,
      5, 6, 8, and 12 hours after drug administration. Subjects will also be monitored to capture
      any adverse events that may occur. Bioequivalence will be assessed based on the single-dose
      pharmacokinetics of paracetamol, guaifenesin and phenylephrine, respectively
