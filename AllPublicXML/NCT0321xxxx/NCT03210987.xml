  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient case presentations during ward rounds can take place at the bedside or outside the
      room. The best approach to patient case presentation is yet unclear. Thus, the overall aim of
      this multicenter, randomized-controlled study is to test the hypothesis that outside the room
      patient case presentation compared to bedside patient case presentation results in better
      outcomes across different dimensions including patient understanding and perception of
      quality of care as well as patient outcomes, physicians' preferences, perception of quality
      and effectiveness, and timing of the ward rounds, respectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-centered care may be defined as &quot;providing care that is respectful of and responsive
      to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide
      all clinical decisions&quot;. Involving patients in all steps of the healthcare process is thus
      important. Yet, best presentation of patients' cases during ward rounds remains unknown.
      During outside the room patient case presentation, the medical team discusses difficult
      patient or medical issues in the team, and later presents a &quot;patient-friendly&quot; synthesis to
      the patient. Bedside patient case presentation, on the other hand, allows a patient to be
      part of the whole team discussion. Yet, there is concern that patients may be unable to cope
      with the magnitude of medical information and misunderstandings may occur. Currently, there
      is equipoise regarding both possibilities of patient case presentation with an important lack
      of trial data. We thus aim to compare the effect of bedside patient case presentation with
      outside the room patient case presentation during ward rounds (&quot;Chefarztvisite&quot;) on different
      patient- and physician-related endpoints.

      Therefore, this randomized controlled trial aims to test the hypothesis that outside the room
      patient case presentation compared to bedside patient case presentation results in better
      outcomes across different dimensions including patient understanding and perception of
      quality of care as well as patient outcomes, physicians' preferences, perception of quality
      and effectiveness, and timing of the ward rounds, respectively.
