  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pathology, DMLA, whose evolution is chronic, requires regular follow-up and care (IVTs)
      over a long period (several months or even years).

      Increasing the number of patients to be followed and treated poses increasing problems for
      ophthalmologists to ensure regular follow-up of patients, followed by a need for satisfactory
      functional results.

      Moreover, this regular follow-up imposes enormous constraints on patients and their families
      (some children or patients are still working).

      Studies are beginning to emerge on the reliability of patient follow-up in telemedicine. The
      use of a measure of visual acuity by patients, Electronic Tablet (TE) or computer (O), and at
      home, seems a logical step to help us improve the quality of patient follow-up while spacing
      controls.

      The aim of our study is thus to demonstrate that the measurement of the VA performed by TE or
      O is reliable. Indeed, during the follow-up of the patients, in the case where the patient's
      AV decreases, and whatever the reason

      Our aim is to compare the evolution curves of the Visual Acuity (AV) measured in each patient
      on Electronic Tablet (TE)/ computer(O) and on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy
      Study (ETDRS) scale, in order to check the reliability of the measurements performed by TE /
      O by comparing them with a well-known reference measure And is routinely practiced routinely
      in ophthalmology centers.

      Measurement of visual acuity on TE / O will be carried out on an ETDRS AV scale, the size of
      the letters having been adapted to the reading distance (80 cm by 0.40 cm on the tablet). An
      ETDRS intermediate vision (EVI) or meadow vision (TEU) score according to the group will be
      established in the same way. The VA measurement will be supervised by a CRA trained to the
      extent of the VA, without the orthoptist or ophthalmologist being informed of the results
      obtained.
