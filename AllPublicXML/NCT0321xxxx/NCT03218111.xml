  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done in order to see how gadolinium-based MRI contrast (Magnevist)
      travels through the central nervous system (CNS) when injected through the spinal column, and
      to compare differences between two age groups (age 20-50, and 51-80). This will allow
      investigators to evaluate how much contrast has crossed into the tissue surrounding the
      brain. Such information will help investigators determine whether this kind of contrast can
      be used to model how other drugs might travel through the CNS and evaluate its use as an
      illustrative imaging marker that mirrors the glymphatic system.

      This is a prospective, longitudinal study of MR imaging of intrathecally delivered gadolinium
      contrast (Magnevist, Gd-DTPA) in healthy adult male and female subjects. Subjects will be
      divided into two groups (20-50 years old and 51-80 years old) both of which will receive
      intrathecal injection of the drug Magnevist (Gd-DTPA), followed by serial MR imaging over the
      course of 10-12 hours. The purpose of the study is determine the transport kinetics of
      Central Nervous System (CNS) exposure to gadolinium contrast injected into the lumbar
      intrathecal space (lower back) and evaluate changes with age. This will allow investigators
      to evaluate the brain parenchymal penetration of gadolinium as an illustrative imaging marker
      that mirrors the glymphatic system. Investigators hypothesize the exposure and penetration
      patterns of the neuraxis to neurotherapeutic drugs can be modeled using gadolinium
      intrathecal contrast administered in the lumbar intrathecal space.

          3. Willing to undergo multiple imaging sessions

          4. Normal screening MRI to exclude subjects with a mass (e.g., disk herniation),
             congenital malformation (e.g., Chiari malformation), or an abnormal curvature of the
             spine that could alter CSF flow.

          5. If female of childbearing age: negative pregnancy test
