  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and implement a culturally-appropriate intervention
      to reduce stress in Vietnamese dementia caregivers. A pilot intervention will be done to test
      the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a community setting. This will be
      done by randomly assigning a family triad (primary caregiver, secondary caregiver, and their
      care recipient) into an active intervention or a control condition and monitoring findings at
      baseline, post-intervention, and at three months.The intervention will consist of multiple
      components -enhanced psycho-education that includes discussion of Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
      and cultural impacts on beliefs about dementia and caregiving, management of problem
      behaviors, facilitation of support seeking, and mindful Tai Chi. A secondary caregiver who
      the primary caregiver identifies as providing him/her with the most support will be invited
      to join all components, but the intervention will be flexible depending on caregivers'
      needs/preferences. The care recipient is not required to join the sessions but will be able
      to if he/she or the family wishes. During the intervention, community partners will provide
      respite care for the care recipient.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four (24) caregivers, the identified secondary caregiver, and a care recipient will be
      randomly assigned into the active intervention or a control condition: 16 triads in the
      intervention condition, 8 in the control.

      For the primary caregivers: Primary caregivers will attend six weekly intervention sessions
      lasting 2 hours each. Based on previous Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of a successful
      behavior change (i.e., smoking cessation) intervention in Vietnamese using only 2-3 sessions,
      six sessions were chosen as a middle ground. In the first 45 minutes, primary caregivers and
      a secondary caregiver (who the primary caregiver identifies) will participate in family
      psycho-education delivered by a Master's level trained, bilingual facilitator. Each group
      will consist of no more than four dyads (4 different groups totaling 16 dyads). The
      curriculum will be adapted based on what the Alzheimer's Association and REACH II have
      successfully used as well as what the UC Davis Alzheimer's Disease Center (ADC) has
      implemented. The sessions will cover the following: a clinical model of dementia and helping
      family members come to a shared understanding of the nature and cause of dementia. The
      innovative component is a discussion of cultural values typical of individuals in Vietnamese
      and American cultures and how this can influence perceptions of dementia and caregiving
      strategies. This is important because it will help family members who disagree on the
      etiology of dementia and strategies for care to empathize with each other's perspective.
      Subsequent sessions will help caregivers learn skills and develop self-efficacy in dealing
      with patient symptoms, accessing resources (e.g., in-home support), and gaining family
      support in culturally-congruent ways. Facilitating the use of formal and informal support is
      a critical piece as Vietnamese caregivers may be looking for basic and concrete assistance
      rather than help in coping with caregiving.

      The last part of the intervention is mindful Tai Chi that was chosen for several reasons. In
      a recent review and meta-analysis, Tai Chi showed beneficial effects on depression, anxiety,
      stress management, and self-efficacy. Second, Tai Chi is rooted in East Asian traditions and
      philosophies that promote balance and healing of the mind and body, thus addressing holistic
      beliefs Vietnamese have about wellness. An RCT of Tai Chi recently was successfully completed
      in Vietnam, demonstrating its growing acceptance in the Vietnamese population. The protocol
      will be adapted to meet caregivers' needs and highlight meditation that involves accepting
      stressful circumstances, thus capitalizing on emotion regulation strategies.

      For the care recipients: Care recipients will receive the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
      (MoCA) measure to assess their mental status at baseline. The purpose of the Quality of Life
      - Alzheimer's Disease (QoL-AD) measure is to assess the caregiver intervention affects the
      care recipient's quality of life. The total time to complete these questionnaires is about 30
      minutes per session.

      Participants not randomized to the active intervention will receive educational
      materials/pamphlets on dementia and occasional phone-calls by research assistants to maintain
      contact, as is the standard of care in most caregiver intervention studies. Including a
      control condition will allow for mirroring of the actual larger trial as closely as possible,
      and also ascertain the feasibility of randomization.

    <intervention_model_description>Families will then be randomized (as a team) to either the active intervention or the control condition. Caregivers in the active intervention will then be scheduled for six weekly intervention sessions, lasting about 2 hours each. Following the completion of the sessions, primary caregivers will complete assessment measures (that they completed at baseline) immediately after the intervention (post) and at three months. This is expected to take one hour for each assessment. Primary caregivers assigned to the control condition will also complete these assessment measures around the same those in the active intervention complete them. These caregivers will also have the option of participating in the active intervention after the three-month follow up.</intervention_model_description>
