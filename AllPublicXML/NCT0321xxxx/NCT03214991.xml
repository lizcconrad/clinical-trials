      The aim of this study is to determine the usefulness of circulating tumor DNA as a prognostic
      factor in patients with pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no strong prognostic factor in pancreatic cancer. K-ras is the most
      commonly mutated gene in pancreatic cancer, with a mutation rate of 75% to 95%. These high
      mutation rates are expected to be useful for diagnosis and prognostic factors in future.
      Currently, K-ras mutation tests are often performed in tissues, and there are various
      limitations, in particular, limited obtaining of sufficient tissues. In this regard,
      analyzing the prognosis of pancreatic cancer through non-invasive blood testing has
      significant advantages. And Prognosis analysis through blood tests can be done through blood
      circulating tumor DNA. The relationship between prognosis and blood circulating tumor DNA has
      already been studied in other cancers such as colorectal cancer, and there have been several
      studies in pancreatic cancer. However, there are not many research results yet, and there are
      cases in which the results differ from study to study. Therefore, the purpose of this study
      is to compare the overall survival of patients with pancreatic cancer diagnosed by EUS-FNA
      according to the presence and amount of blood circulating tumor DNA with K-ras mutation.
