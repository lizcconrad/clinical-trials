  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part, open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-treatment (per study part) crossover
      study in healthy subjects (males and females of non-childbearing potential), performed at a
      single study center, conducted to establish the bioequivalence of 2 strengths of
      dapagliflozin/metformin XR tablets manufactured at two different plants.
