      The aim of this study is to determine general practitionners' role in management of women
      with BRCA1/2 mutation.

      This study will be conduct between April 2017 and December 2017 at Montpellier University
      Hospital on women followed-up in the department of genetics and their general practitionners
      (GP). Patients and their GP will be called by the investigators and questionnaire will be
      given to them. Questionnaire includes questions for patients and their GP. The primary
      endpoint was to determine the rate of GP having sufficient knowledge of the adequate
      management of patients with BRCA1 / 2 mutation. Adequate knowledge includes : systematic
      search for a family history of cancer, knowing criteria required to refer women in
      oncogenetic department, and the ability to respond to patients' questions. Secondary endpoint
      was to determine women' opinion on their GP : whether or not well managed for their BRCA 1 /
      2 mutation.
