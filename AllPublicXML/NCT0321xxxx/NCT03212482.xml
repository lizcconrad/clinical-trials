  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is an important support strategy for critically ill patients. It could
      improve gas exchange, reduce the work of breathing, and improve patient comfort. However,
      patient-ventilator asynchrony, which defined as a mismatch between the patient and ventilator
      may obfuscate these goals. Studies have shown that a high incidence of asynchrony (asynchrony
      index &gt; 10%) is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay and
      high mortality. So far, there have been only a few studies on the epidemiology of asynchrony
      in brain-injured patients. Investigators conduct a prospective observational study among
      brain-injured patients to determine the prevalence, risk factors and outcomes of
      patient-ventilator asynchrony. Esophageal pressure monitoring, a surrogate for pleural
      pressure, combined with airway pressure and flow waveforms is used to detect
      patient-ventilator asynchrony.
