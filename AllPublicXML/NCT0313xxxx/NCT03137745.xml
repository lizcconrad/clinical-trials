      To study the changes in coagulation profile in patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery and
      Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The objective of the study is to determine the
      utility of thromboelastography in comparison to standard coagulation tests in assessing the
      coagulopathy in patients undergoing CRS with HIPEC.

      This is a prospective observational study conducted in 60 patients undergoing CRS with HIPEC
      in RGCIRC from march 2015- march2016 after taking permission from the institutional review
      board and informed written consent from the patients.

      Arterial blood samples were collected before and after HIPEC and on first and second
      postoperative day for PT,APTT INR,TEG and ABG. Statistical analysis was done using chi square
      test and unpaired t- test for categorical and continuous variables. Pearson's correlation
      coefficient was calculated for analysing the correlation between the variables .P - value
      &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
