  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose-escalation study will
      evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab in combination with
      idasanutlin and venetoclax in participants with R/R FL and obinutuzumab or rituximab in
      combination with idasanutlin and venetoclax in participants with R/R DLBCL. The study will
      include an initial dose-escalation phase followed by an expansion phase. The dose-escalation
      phase is designed to determine the recommended phase II doses (RP2Ds) and regimen for
      idasanutlin and venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab for FL participants and in
      combination with rituximab for DLBCL participants.
