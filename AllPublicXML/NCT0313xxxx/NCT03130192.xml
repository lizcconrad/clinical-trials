  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common causes of cancer
      mortality. Also, the first leading cause of death is lung cancer in Taiwan 2012. Most
      patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and their median survival with supportive care is
      only 3-6 months. The common regimens used on advanced NSCLC treatment consists of
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, the survival benefit of which is able to extend the
      survival to approximately 10 months. However, disease and treatment-related toxicities in
      cancer patients may result in fatigue and interfered quality of life (QoL). According to the
      others reports, eight QoL areas including physical functioning, fatigue, pain, and appetite
      loss have been showed a statistically significant association with survival rate of NSCLC
      patients.

      Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), an indicator of QoL, has been reported as the most frequent and
      distressing toxicity of lung cancer chemotherapy. Proposed criteria for CRF have been adopted
      for inclusion in the International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health
      Problems, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM). Therefore, more in-depth
      researches on CRF are needed in Taiwan.

      In addition, electrolyte disturbance like hyponatremia has been reported to be counted as one
      of the many contributing factors for fatigue in palliative care patients and associated with
      poorer overall survival rate (OS) in lung cancer. Thus, the correlation between CRF and
      electrolyte possibly would be a strong link for physician to improve the QoL and survival
      rate of NSCLC patients.

      The objective of this observational study is to evaluate the correlation between CRF,
      survival and physiological factors in NSCLC patients under chemotherapy. The study will
      compare the effect of QoL and CRF on survival with or without CRF treatment and investigate
      the correlation between the variation of CRF and physiological factors which have been
      examined and recorded on medical record under clinical practice. These results will supply
      physicians with more understanding about CRF, and help them to enhance the quality on lung
      cancer care to being perfected in the future.

      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with chemotherapy will be enrolled. Patients will
      be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study activity schedule and all regulatory
      requirements that must be satisfied for informed consent. Only patients who give consent to
      participate in this study and meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      eligible to enroll into this study. ICD-10 fatigue criteria, Brief Fatigue Inventory-Taiwan
      Form (BFI-T), the visual analog scale (VAS) for appetite and Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-General quality of life questionnaire (FACT-G7) will be used to evaluate patients'
      fatigue and quality of life. Patients who enrolled in this observational study will complete
      the evaluation and questionnaire of fatigue and quality of life according to clinical
      schedule. The first survey (baseline) will be collected after enrollment, the further surveys
      will be completed every three chemotherapy cycles following subject's chemotherapy schedule
      and after finish the whole course of chemotherapy. Subject demographic and disease-related
      information and routine laboratory data will also be collected from medical record for
      analysis.
