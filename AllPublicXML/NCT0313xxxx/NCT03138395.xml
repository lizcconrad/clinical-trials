    <textblock>
      This study will use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method to quantify and track peripheral blood
      plasma mutant allele frequency (MAF) in MDS and AML patients before, during and after
      chemotherapy treatment. Quantification of MAF from fingersticks and saliva samples will also
      be performed to determine feasibility of obtaining adequate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for
      ddPCR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The greatest challenge in cancer is relapsed disease. Despite best available therapies,
      approximately 20% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and 80% of myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) patients die of relapsed disease. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is the main
      predictor of refractory disease following chemotherapy. In AML and MDS patients, mutant
      allele frequency (MAF) associates with future occurrence of relapse. Current oncology
      practice relies on painful bone marrow biopsies and light microscopy to monitor disease
      progression, remission, and relapse. Because of the bias in disease sampling and low
      sensitivity testing, there is an urgent need for a higher sensitivity test to monitor the
      tumor burden in these patients. The Investigator developed a rapid and ultrahigh sensitivity
      method to detect cancer-associated mutant alleles. This study will use our droplet digital
      PCR (ddPCR) method to quantify and track peripheral blood plasma MAF in MDS and AML patients
      before, during and after chemotherapy treatment. Quantification of MAF from fingersticks and
      saliva samples will also be performed to determine feasibility of obtaining adequate
      circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for ddPCR. Results from this project will generate a
      non-invasive means to monitor cancer response and progression months before current clinical
      methods, and provide an opportunity to intervene before the patient relapses. Furthermore,
      establishing a quantitative method to measure cancer burden will empower clinical researchers
      to measure biological activity in phase II and III clinical trials of new therapeutic agents.
