    <textblock>
      This study aims at investigating the effects of tablet-based puzzle video games on cognitive
      function and emotional well-being. This study extends preliminary findings of studies looking
      at short-term benefits of playing puzzle video games to a long-term intervention in healthy
      older adults and patients suffering from cognitive impairment due to mild cognitive
      impairment or acquired brain injury. To this end, the investigators compare two
      interventions: A tablet-based puzzle video games experimental intervention and a control
      intervention tablet newspaper-reading control intervention. This study uses a 16-week,
      assessor blinded, randomized crossover design with two phases of treatment and three waves of
      measurement. Participants are randomly allocated to either the experimental or control
      intervention for 8 weeks, then interventions are crossed over. Both groups receive both
      interventions in opposite order. At three time points (pre-, mid- and post-test) higher
      cognitive function and emotional well-being are tested using standardised neuropsychological
      tests and questionnaires.

      The focus of the current project is to examine the cognitive and emotional benefits of a
      casual puzzle video game (CPVG) intervention in healthy older adults (HOA), patients
      suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and acquired brain injury (ABI). Although
      there have only been a small number of studies specifically using CPVG interventions, recent
      studies were able to demonstrate the validity of CPVG in improving attentional and executive
      function and speed of processing (Oei &amp; Patterson, 2013; Stroud &amp; Whitbourne, 2015; Styron,
      2015) in healthy older adults as well as their potential in reducing depressive symptoms,
      physical stress and anxiety (Russoniello, O'Brien, &amp; Parks, 2009). These findings match
      general findings from video game training studies reporting improved processing speed,
      attentional, executive and visuospatial skills (Jak et al., 2013). In addition a recent
      large-scale study showed that regular engagement in Sudoku and similar puzzles represents a
      cognitively enriching leisure activity prevents and delays age-related cognitive decline
      (Ferreira, Owen, Mohan, Corbett, &amp; Ballard, 2015). Since depressive disorders affect between
      10% and 20% older adults and even more in persons suffering from MCI and dementia, and that
      mood disorders affect about 31% (anxiety disorders up to 40%) patients after suffering a
      stroke, these populations could potentially draw both cognitive and emotional benefits from
      CPVG intervention (Arba et al., 2016; Barua, Ghosh, Kar, &amp; Basilio, 2011; Robinson, 2003).

      The main objective of this study is to investigate long-term training benefits of a CPVG
      intervention on cognitive and emotional functioning in healthy older adults and patients with
      cognitive impairment.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine whether a long-term CPVG intervention
      significantly improves attentional function (visual search) and leads to in-game learning
      effects in healthy older participants and cognitively impaired patients (MCI, ABI). The
      secondary objectives include: a) improvements on further cognitive outcome measures proposed
      to be engaged by the CPVG (attention, processing speed, working memory and spatial reasoning)
      and b) the efficacy of the CPVG intervention in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety and
      stress and improving quality of life.

    <intervention_model_description>This study uses a 16-week, assessor blinded, randomized crossover design with two phases of treatment and three waves of measurement. Participants are randomly allocated to either the experimental (group T) or control intervention (group C). Group T will first receive the experimental and then the control intervention (T-C) while group C is given the opposite order of intervention (C-T). In phase I both groups take a baseline measurement (pre-test), then group T is given the casual puzzle game task (experimental intervention) while group C is performing the newspaper reading task (control intervention). After phase I (8 weeks) both groups are post-tested (mid-test). In phase II, groups are switched and the control group C is given the experimental intervention (casual puzzle game task) while the experimental intervention group T now serves as control. After phase II (16 weeks) both groups are post-tested again.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>This study will include outcome assessor blinding as recommended in a publication on methodological quality criteria for cognitive rehabilitation research and computer game training in older adults (Bleakley et al., 2015; Cicerone, Azulay, &amp; Trott, 2009).
This will ensure that the person conducting the assessment of outcome measures will be unaware of the participant's treatment condition. For this purpose, a central randomization procedure will be used where a designated staff member not involved in the study will conduct and securely maintain the randomization, contact and allocate participants and use central methods (e.g. phone or secure computer) after the patient is enrolled. This way the treatment assignments are not revealed to the assessors when conducting the outcome assessments. The assessors will also be excluded from any activity pertaining to the intervention activities (e.g. instructing participants, distributing the tablet-computers).</masking_description>
