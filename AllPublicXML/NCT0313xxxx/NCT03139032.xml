             surveillance colonoscopy was performed within 12 months of the initial screening visit
             (if not, the patient should undergo a colonoscopy in lieu of a flexible
             proctosigmoidoscopy during screening).

          3. Previous extensive colonic resection (subtotal or total colectomy).
