  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disruption of social cognition associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD), and
      more specifically categorization of facial emotions, remains largely under-studied, despite
      the high frequency of this pathology in the clinical population. The first results differ
      from the observations made in adults and this confirms the relevance of studying this theme
      specifically in adolescence. On the cognitive level, there is a disturbance of the detection
      and the categorization of the facial emotions in the TPL. The characteristics of this
      disturbance and its possible association with an attack on the connectivity of the brain
      remain unknown in adolescence. No functional imaging studies are published in adolescent TPL.
      This pilot bimodal functional imaging study EEG-NIRS aims to collect preliminary and
      feasibility data to support a response to upcoming PHRC competitions and eventually offer a
      science thesis opportunity.
