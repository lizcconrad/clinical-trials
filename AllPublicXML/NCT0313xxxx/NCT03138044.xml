      Assessment of the overall (OS); one year; two years and three years` survival rates; the
      disease free survival (DFS) and the tumor response rate in the patients undergoing Combined
      Ipsilateral Liver Lobe Devascularization and Alcohol Treatment (CILDAT) of the Large HCC.
      This is a prospective non randomized trial carried out at the Ribat University Hospital

    <description>This modality of palliative treatment includes initial surgical operation where arterial vascular supply of the tumor carrying liver lobe of the corresponding hepatic artery as well as the extrahepatic collateral arteries (EHCAs) feeding the large HCC (&gt; 5 cms size) under general anesthesia. Four weeks after the operation the tumor is injeted (intralesionally and intravascularly) with absolute ethanol alcohol injections on regular weekly percutaneous sessions until the tumor become saturated and its vascularity rendered inactive.</description>
