  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is usually diagnosed at a clinic or doctor's office when a patient has blood
      pressure (BP) that is high for several measurements. However, about 30 percent of patients
      with high BP in clinics have normal BP outside of clinics. This is called white-coat
      hypertension. Correct diagnosis of hyper-tension is important to prevent strokes, heart
      attacks, and heart failure but also to avoid making people worry or take medicines when they
      don't need to.

      To avoid misdiagnosis of hypertension, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), which
      makes national recommendations about disease screening, recommends people should have 24-hour
      BP ambulatory monitoring (i.e., an arm cuff and BP monitor worn for 24 hours, with
      measurements taken every 30 minutes during the day and every 60 minutes at night), with home
      BP monitoring over several days as an alternative. However, most patients have never heard of
      24-hour BP monitoring, and physicians rarely order it. Physicians sometimes use home BP
      monitoring, but not according to recommended guidelines. BP kiosks, for example at drug
      stores, offer another option. Newer models are accurate and easy to use.

      BP-CHECK will identify patients, ages 18 to 85, with high BP at their last clinic visit and
      invite them to a screening visit. Patients with high BP at the screening visit (510 patients)
      will be randomized and assigned to 1) clinic BP, 2) home BP, or 3) kiosk BP diagnostic groups
      for confirming a new diagnosis of hypertension. The clinic BP group will have BP measured at
      two clinic visits. The home BP group will measure BP two times, twice a day, for five days.
      The kiosk BP group will measure BP three times on three separate days at a kiosk at their
      clinic or nearby drugstore. Participants will complete their diagnostic tests over three
      weeks. They will then be asked to complete 24-hour BP monitoring. Participants will complete
      surveys at baseline prior to randomization, after diagnostic tests, and at six months.

      Hypothesis 1: Compared to the reference standard (24-hour BP), home BP and kiosk BP will be
      more accurate than clinic BP. Hypothesis 2: Patients with clinic, home, or kiosk BP results
      concordant with reference standard results will prefer home or kiosk to clinic and 24-hour
      BP. Hypothesis 2: Patients with clinic, home, or kiosk BP results concordant with reference
      standard results will prefer home or kiosk to clinic and 24-hours BP.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare the accuracy and acceptability (i.e., comfort, convenience) of
      clinic, home, and kiosk BP testing to 24-hour BP ambulatory monitoring. The investigators
      will look at the impact of the study, up to six months after the study starts, on outcomes
      that matter to patients: their BP and whether participants feel better or worse overall,
      worry about BP, and change health behaviors (e.g., lowering salt intake). The investigators
      will talk with patients and interview healthcare providers and clinical leaders to understand
      how the recommendations from the USPSTF might fit into ongoing health care.

      Our study team includes patients. The study team also has patient and stakeholder advisors to
      ensure our study is conducted properly and is not a burden to patients and providers. The
      investigators will share study results with patient participants and publish papers in
      scientific journals. The investigators will also create a toolkit to help healthcare systems
      and providers choose accurate BP monitors, train staff on BP measurements in and out of
      clinics, and interpret BP readings.
