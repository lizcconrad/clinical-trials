  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a modular, first time in patient, open-label, multicentre study of OMO-1,
      administered orally, alone and in combination with anti-cancer treatments, in patients with
      locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic solid malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a number of study modules - the first of which is Module 1.

      Combination study modules will consist of a Part A (dose finding) and an optional Part B
      (cohort expansion). The option to start Part B and add further modules will be the decision
      of the safety review committee, based on emerging preclinical anti-tumour data and, safety
      and tolerability information from the study as a whole. A substantial protocol amendment with
      relevant preclinical and emerging clinical data will be put in place before starting a new
      combination module.

      The initial dosing schedule and/or sequence of OMO-1 in each module may be subsequently
      changed between patient cohorts in response to emerging safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PDc) findings. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of OMO-1 for individual
      modules may therefore differ based on the emerging safety profile for each combination.

      Once a minimally biologically active dose (MBAD) of OMO-1 for a module has been identified
      from Part A of that module, the safety review committee may decide to commence Part B. This
      may include cohort expansions of specific patient groups to explore preliminary anti-tumour
      activity or the effect of food or particular drug combinations on drug PK.

      For all modules, Part A cohorts (dose escalation) may be expanded by up to 12 additional
      patients at doses (at or above the MBAD) that have been confirmed to be tolerated. These
      patients will have mandatory serial biopsies to assess the tumour for relevant PDc
      biomarkers, and to explore further the tolerability, safety and PK activity at these doses.

      In all combination modules, the dose of each combination agent investigated will not exceed
      their current recommended dose. The starting dose of OMO-1 in combination modules will not
      exceed the one currently tolerated in Module 1 (monotherapy). For cohorts in which OMO-1 is
      dosed in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, dosing will not continue once the cycles of
      chemotherapy have been completed.
