  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SHR-1210 is a humanized anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody. This is a randomized,Phase III,
      multicenter ,open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 with
      carboplatin and pemetrexed versus carboplatin-pemetrexed in subjects who are chemotherapy
      naive and have Stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC.

      The primary hypothesis is that SHR-1210 combined with carboplatin and pemetrexed prolongs
      Progression Free Survival (PFS) in per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review (ITT
      population and population was indicated by high PD-L1 expression) compared to carboplatin and
      pemetrexed treatment .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either carboplatin and
      pemetrexed for 4-6 cycles followed by pemetrexed maintenance until progression or
      unacceptable toxicity, OR receive SHR-1210 combined with carboplatin and pemetrexed
      chemotherapy for 4-6 cycles followed by pemetrexed maintenance with SHR-1210 until
      progression or unacceptable toxicity (SHR-1210 for a maximum of 2 years).

      Subjects assigned to the chemotherapy arm will have the opportunity to crossover to receive
      SHR-1210 monotherapy once they experience progression of disease (PD) defined by RECIST 1.1
      and meet all the crossover criteria.
