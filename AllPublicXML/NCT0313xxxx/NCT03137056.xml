  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis is the major technique of renal suppleance and membrane improvements allow an
      efficient depuration. During the past fifty years, improving the architecture of the
      membranes increased constantly the clearance of uremic toxins. Online-hemodiafiltration
      allowed a potential interest for decreasing morbi-mortality, but this technique is not
      available in all hemodialysis centers yet. Theranova membrane, by its innovating
      architecture, could be a valuable option for the enhancement of toxin removal in patients who
      are not eligible for online-hemodiafiltration techniques. Interestingly, many works pointed
      adsorptive capacities of dialysis membranes and these observations suggest that adsorption
      cannot be considered as an epiphenomenon. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the
      extent of its benefits in hemodialysis. The efficiency of a session of hemodialysis is
      routinely based on the clearance of only few generic toxins (urea, ß2-microglobulin,
      myoglobin). The eKT/V formula permitted to link a good depuration of urea with a better
      survival. EuTox described in a recent review, a large panel of middle molecules considered as
      uremic toxins. As there are many involved toxins, modern evaluation of hemodialysis
      efficiency can't be still based on the only description of ß2-microglobulin and urea
      removals. Inflammation status is routinely measured with blood levels of CRP. However, its
      accumulation is not leading to a toxicity. Many others inflammatory markers have been linked
      with morbidity and atherosclerosis, the main cause of mortality in ESRD patients. Obviously,
      removal of inflammatory markers by different dialyzers needs to be assess concomitantly but
      single conventional dosages are time-consuming.

      A minimal albumin loss is considered as another important factor for a safe hemodialysis. Due
      to its multiple biological functions, albumin may be one of the most important protein for
      the maintenance of body homeostasis. Recent works were interested in the potential toxicity
      of some isoforms of the albumin and especially in chronic kidney disease. Modified forms of
      albumin have been linked with toxic properties and the removal of modified forms could be
      beneficial. Furthermore, albumin oxidation can lead to an under-estimation of albumin levels
      with the routinely used assay. A modern evaluation of the capacities of depuration of
      dialyzers clearly needs to integrate the evaluation of the clearance and generation of
      modified forms of albumin and proteins.

      Proteomic techniques allow an interesting non-selective integrative approach. This exhaustive
      view would be particularly adequate for building a snapshot of blood uremic toxins,
      permeative and adsorptive capacities of each membrane. Due to a high sensitiveness, proteomic
      techniques can improve dramatically the characterization of the depuration capacities of
      different hemodialysis membranes considering a large range of uremic toxins especially with
      middle molecular weight, a large panel of inflammatory markers and modified forms of albumin.
      Furthermore, proteomic approach can help to build a quasi-exhaustive description of all the
      proteins removed by a membrane.

      This project aims to compare the removal capacities of each membrane on a large range of
      proteins and forms of albumin (native and modified) with a highly-sensitive LC-MS/MS
      proteomic approach. We will also build the complete proteome of depuration of each tested
      membrane.
