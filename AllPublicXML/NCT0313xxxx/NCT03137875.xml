  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specimen transport from peripheral health structures to the National TB reference laboratory
      for MDR-TB identification presents a big challenge in term of sample management, safety,
      contamination and delays. Thus a system that allows specimen to be collected and shipped in a
      safely manner while reducing the possibilities of contamination, the cost of shipment and
      especially the time for detection of MDR-TB by using molecular methods would be very useful.
      Whereas the some studies show promising results for the development and standardization of
      simple specimen collection and transportation methods for molecular DST, more data is needed
      before these can be used in routine.

      The study described here aims at identifying a suitable method, in terms of adapted sample
      support (s) (slide, filter paper (FTA, Genocard ...)) and DNA extraction method. If one or
      several methods are found to give satisfying results, then a larger patient based evaluation
      of this (these) method(s) for molecular DST will be performed in a second phase. The protocol
      for the second phase will be prepared separately.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of PCR in identification and
      detection of tuberculosis using DNA extracts from stained slides (Ziehl Neelsen and
      Fluorescence) and Filter paper (FTA card and Genocard).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the MTB extraction yield from
      smear-negative, low and high bacilli load specimens on slides, filter paper ( Genocardand
      FTA), to determine the amount of sample required to make a detectable PCR reaction and to
      assess the feasibility of storage and extraction methods.

        The study will take place in the Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) located in
        Mbarara Municipality, Mbarara District, and south-west of Uganda.

        Patients suspected of TB are evaluated in the outpatient facility at the hospital or in the
        medical ward when admitted.

        Some samples will be collected from The Aid Support Organisation (TASO) Mbarara. TASO is
        located in the neighbourhood of MRRH and EMRB.
