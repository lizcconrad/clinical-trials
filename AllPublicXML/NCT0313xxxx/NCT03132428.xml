  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospectively defined, observational registry study evaluating the use
      of inhaled nitric oxide (INOMAX) in 84 Premature (P) neonates (at least 27 weeks but less
      than 34 weeks of gestational age [GA]) and 84 Term-Near-Term (TNT) neonates (at least 34
      weeks to no more than 40 weeks of GA), with Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). The 2 groups will
      have a similar number of subjects by severity (mild, moderate, and, severe) and evaluated for
      response to INOMAX during a treatment period of up to 96 hours ± 12 hours and a safety
      follow-up through 7 days (for a total of up to 11 days) or to hospital discharge, whichever
      comes first.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Was either a P neonate born at least 27 weeks to less than 34 weeks of GA or a TNT
             neonate born at least 34 weeks but no more than 40 weeks of GA.

          2. Was administered INOMAX therapy after birth to 7 days of age via any route (invasive
             or noninvasive ventilation) for a minimum treatment period of at least 24 hours up to
             96 ±12 hours. The subjects may receive Inomax for a longer period.

          3. Had PH, as confirmed by echocardiogram or a differential saturation gradient of at
             least 10%.

          4. Received INOMAX administration as part of routine clinical practice in a Level III or
             higher neonatal intensive care unit in the United States.

          5. Has all variables required to calculate OI or SOI (a baseline sample prior to
             treatment and 4 samples obtained during treatment).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Was at risk of imminent death (death expected within 24 hours).

          2. Received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

          3. Had a life-threatening abnormality (cranial, cardiac, thoracic), chromosomal
             abnormality, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital heart defect (other than
             patent ductus arteriosus or small atrial septal defect).

          4. Had been resuscitated requiring chest compressions within 6 hours of receiving INOMAX.

          5. Had Grade IV bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia.

          6. Had active uncontrolled bleeding.

          7. Had disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

          8. Had active seizures while receiving anticonvulsants.

          9. Experienced prolonged asphyxia with evidence of severe acidosis (pH &lt; 7.25).

         10. Received concomitant pulmonary vasodilator therapy (eg, prostacyclin or sildenafil)
             except when sildenafil was used to wean the subject from INOMAX therapy.
