  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic agents used in malignant melanoma treatment such as BRAF/MEK inhibitors and
      anti-CTLA-4/Anti-PD-1 antibodies go along with harmful side effects in a considerable
      proportion of patients and treatment costs may cause relevant medical expenditures per month.
      Currently, therapy response assessment in melanoma patients is performed using RECIST
      criteria which are based on changes in tumour size. PET/CT combines morphological and
      metabolic information. Thus, the so-called PERCIST-criteria were introduced integrating
      change in size and glucose utilization for response assessment in solid tumors. Due to the
      different mechanism of action these new agents introduce different response patterns increase
      in tumor size due to inflammation for antibody therapies). In conventional chemotherapies,
      re-staging is usually performed 3 months after treatment initiation which is the result of
      empirical investigations. Moreover, it has recently been shown, that response to new targeted
      therapies can be detected much earlier using PET or functional MR techniques. This forms the
      rationale for the monitoring of melanoma patients using a combined PET/MR technique after
      only 2 weeks of therapy initiation. Especially for patients in stage IV with a medium
      survival time of 12 months, a 2.5 months earlier re-staging and therapy adjustment would have
      significant consequences for the individual clinical course.
