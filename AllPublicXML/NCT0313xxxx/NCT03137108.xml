  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a transcutaneous protocol of electrical spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) has been
      developed. It was suggested, that this method could be used to improve the therapy process
      after a spinal cord injury (SCI). The aim of this study is to investigate the immediate
      effects of tSCS with different stimulation modalities on voluntary motor control in patients
      with incomplete SCI.

    <description>Study intervention consists of the application of tSCS at three different frequencies (15 Hz, 30 Hz, 50 Hz) using the CE certified electrostimulator RehaMove 3. Stimulation will only be applied by an investigator during the two testing sessions. During the overground walking, the participants will be secured and assisted with the cable-driven body-weight support system FLOAT.</description>
