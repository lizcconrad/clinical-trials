  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol for Varlitinib is developed for the treatment of Gastric Cancer. Varlitinib
      (also known as ASLAN001) is a small-molecule, adenosine triphosphate competitive inhibitor of
      the tyrosine kinases - epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor
      receptor (HER)2, and HER4. Varlitinib may be beneficial to subjects with cancer by
      simultaneous inhibition of these receptors. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      safety and efficacy of Varlitinib in combination with mFOLFOX6 for the treatment of Gastric
      Cancer. Treatment groups are Varlitinib+mFOLFOX6 and Placebo+mFOLFOX6.
