  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to test the effect of a parenting intervention on metabolic syndrome in
      African American youth. The investigators hypothesized that a parenting intervention would
      produce reductions in metabolic syndrome, particularly for those families that started out
      high in difficulties with parenting.

      In this study, the investigators conducted a parenting intervention (Strong African American
      Families, or SAAF). Families (mothers with their 11 year old child) were randomized to either
      the parenting intervention or to a control group. Those in the intervention group received 7
      group sessions with the parent and child aimed at promoting better family relationships.
      Those in the control group received 3 mailings about child development and stress management.
      At age 25, youth were assessed on metabolic syndrome. The investigators hypothesized that the
      parenting intervention would produce reductions in metabolic syndrome relative to the control
      group, particularly for those families that started out high in difficulties with parenting.
