      Introduction: Pancreatoduodenectomy is one of the most complex abdominal operations, usually
      performed for tumors of the periampullary region and chronic pancreatitis. Minimally invasive
      surgery has been progressively developed, first with the advent of hybrid-laparoscopy and
      recently with the total-laparoscopy surgeries, but a number of issues are currently being
      debated, including the comparisons between three dimension laparoscopic
      pancreaticoduodenectomy and the open pancreaticoduodenectomy, the real advantages of three
      dimension vision systems, the reproducibility of a total intracorporeal technique and the
      oncological results achievable during long-term follow-up after pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      Methods/design: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial with two
      treatment arms, three dimension laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy versus open
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. The trial hypothesis is that three dimension laparoscopic
      pancreaticoduodenectomy has advantages in postoperative recoveries and be equivalent in
      operation time, oncological results and long-term follow-up compared with open
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. The duration of the entire trial is two years including
      prearrangement, follow-up and analyses.

      Discussion: Despite the fact more and more studies comparing laparoscopic
      pancreaticoduodenectomy and open approach. This trial will be the first multi-center RCT
      comparing three dimension laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy and open
      pancreaticoduodenectomy.
