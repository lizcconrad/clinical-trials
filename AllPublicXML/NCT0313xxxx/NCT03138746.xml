  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent series of studies performed by our group, we have shown that exposure to
      hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) leads to an increase in insulin sensitivity in male subjects with
      type-2 diabetes (T2DM) and in obese and overweight men without diabetes. The aim of this
      study is to investigate the relationship between pressure and oxygen in producing this
      effect, specifically, is this effect measurable in hyperbaric air or is some higher pressure
      of oxygen required?

      Aims:

        1. To determine whether the insulin sensitising effect of HBO is apparent in hyperbaric air
           at the same pressure as HBO.

        2. To examine mechanisms underpinning the increase in insulin sensitivity following HBO.

      All participants will attend the Hyperbaric Medicine Unit on 4 occasions and metabolic
      testing will be undertaken at the same time of the day. Day 1 will be for baseline
      assessment. Days 2 to 4 will be on consecutive days the following week. An overnight fast
      (10-hours) will be required prior to each day.

      Day 1. Baseline assessment. The participant will attend at 0900 for a hyperinsulinaemic
      euglycaemic clamp, which will be performed with the same protocol as used in our three
      previous clamp studies. Two intravenous cannulae are inserted into veins in contralateral
      forearms using local anaesthetic (lignocaine 1%). Baseline blood is taken for fasting glucose
      and insulin and a primed insulin infusion is started (80mU/m2/min) for 3 hours. Blood samples
      (&lt;2mls) are obtained at 5-10 minute intervals so that blood glucose can be maintained at 5.5
      mmol/L with a variable infusion of 25% Dextrose and a trained individual will be present for
      the duration of the clamping procedure. Insulin sensitivity will be assessed by the steady
      state glucose infusion rate calculated over a stable 30-minute period of the clamp.
      Assessments will be made at two points during the 3-hour clamp; at 2-2½ hours and 2½-3 hours.
      Immediately post-clamp, volunteers are given orange juice and high carbohydrate lunch, and
      the glucose infusion is maintained on halving scale for 5 minutes each for at least 20
      minutes. Blood sugar levels are monitored every 10-15 minutes for 60 minutes. Total blood
      taken during the clamping procedure will be less than 100mls including baseline samples. The
      researchers have performed several hundred clamps.

      Day 2. The following week, the participant will attend at 1015 to undergo a routine 2-hour
      HBO session, 10:90:30 profile (compression of the chamber in air to 2 atmospheres absolute,
      then donning a &quot;hood&quot; supplying high flow oxygen for 90-minutes followed by a linear
      decompression back to 1 atmosphere over 30 minutes). Blood will be taken for glucose, insulin
      and inflammatory markers (30mls) before and after HBO. Food will be provided.

      Day 3. The participant will undergo a second routine HBO session. Blood will be taken for
      glucose, insulin and inflammatory markers (30mls) before and after HBO. Food will be
      provided.

      Day 4. The participant will attend at 0900 for a second 3-hour hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic
      clamp, similar to Day1. The procedure for the two groups (HBO and hyperbaric air) will be
      identical, the only difference will be the breathing gas used during the 10:90:30 hyperbaric
      exposures. The breathing gas delivered to the participant (oxygen or air) will be supplied
      from masked &quot;research&quot; gas outlets, so the participant will be blinded as to which group they
      are in. The participant will enter the chamber after a 1-hour clamp stabilising period and
      assessment of the steady state glucose infusion rate will take place at similar times to
      Day1. This means that during the 2-hour hyperbaric exposure, the assessment periods will
      correspond to 1-1½ hours (pressure constant at 2 atmospheres absolute) and 1½-2 hours (the
      30-minute decompression at the end of the session). Post clamp will be managed as during
      Day1.

      With blood taken during 2 clamps (less than 100mls each) and 4 by 30 ml samples on Days 2 and
      3, total blood taken will be less than 320 ml over a 7-day period.
