  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      oral ascending doses of AJM347 in healthy male participants, and to assess the
      pharmacodynamic response following single and multiple oral ascending doses of AJM347 in the
      same population. This study will also aim to determine the single and multiple oral ascending
      dose pharmacokinetics of AJM347 and its metabolite in healthy male participants, and to
      determine the effect of food on the single and multiple oral dose pharmacokinetics of AJM347
      and its metabolite in the same population.
