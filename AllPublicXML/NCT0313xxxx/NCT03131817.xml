      This study will investigate cortical stimulation to treat mood and behavioral symptoms in
      Parkinson's disease patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression, anxiety and impulse control disorders are among the most prominent
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) that greatly impact patients' and
      caregivers' quality of life. However, the neural correlate underlying these symptoms is still
      largely unknown preventing the development of comprehensive treatment for these symptoms.

      The aims of this study are to 1) Determine the neural correlates of non-motor symptoms, 2)
      Determine how cortical stimulation can reduce these symptoms and normalize the abnormal brain
      signals, 3) Develop closed-loop stimulation paradigms and 4) Teach patients how to
      voluntarily modulate the abnormal brain signals.

      Ten PD patients undergoing deep brain surgery (DBS) implantation and diagnosed with mild to
      moderate mood disorder and/or impulsive behavior will be enrolled in this study. In addition
      to the standard therapeutic DBS electrode used to treat motor symptoms, a flexible electrode
      will be placed over the prefrontal cortex. Both electrodes will be attached to the Activa
      PC+S pulse generator (Medtronic), an investigational device that allows therapeutic
      stimulation and chronic brain recordings. At multiple time points, up to 2 years
      post-implantation, in our clinic or patient's home, brain signals will be recorded while
      patients are resting or performing emotion/cognition tasks. Symptoms will be assessed using
      validated questionnaires and tasks to allow identification of neurophysiological correlates
      of non-motor symptoms. The investigators will then investigate the effect of cortical
      stimulation on both symptoms severity and brain signals that may be related to symptom
      expression. These signals will then be used to implement closed-loop controlled cortical
      stimulation and neuro-feedback controlled strategies.

          -  Movement disorder symptoms that are sufficiently severe, in the setting of best
             medical therapy, to warrant surgical implantation of deep brain stimulators according
             to standard clinical criteria

          -  UPDRS-III score off medication between 20 and 80

          -  Improvement of at least 30% in the baseline UPDRS-III on medication score, compared to
             the baseline off-medication score.
