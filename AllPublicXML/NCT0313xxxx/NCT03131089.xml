      This study is prospective cohort study to investigate and identify comprehensively the
      clinicopathological features and long-term outcome of young breast cancer (YBC).

      We have enrolled Breast cancer patients under 40 year-old and collected their baseline
      characteristics including tumor character, familiar history and other background information.
      Moreover, we have collected breast cancer tissue/blood sample for analyzing genetic
      characteristics, if patient agree to genetic analysis.
