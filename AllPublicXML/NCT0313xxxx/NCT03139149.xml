  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the results of early surgery after 12 h conservative treatment and 48
      h conservative treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction.

    <textblock>
      At the admission patients undergo abdomen x-ray, general and biochemical blood test and
      computer tomography (CT). After exclusion of indications for an emergency operation, patients
      are given a water-soluble contrast. Conservative treatment is carring out to 12 hours from
      admission. All patients with resolution of small bowel obstruction in 12 hours will be
      excluded from the research. Criteria for obstruction release of conservative treatment 1. No
      pain 2. Appearance of gas in the colon 3. Decrease of bloating 4. Contrast in the colon.
      After that, if obstruction is not resolved, randomization is performed. First group undergo
      surgery. Second group undergo conservative treatment with water-soluble contrast evaluation
      until 48 hours. In the second group surgery is performed if the conservative treatment is not
      effective. The results of early and late surgery and the results of conservative treatment in
      groups will be compared.

    <description>After exclusion of indications for an emergency operation, conservative treatment is performed up to 12 hours from the moment of admission. Each patient receive blood test, blood lactate investigation, blood biochemistry, X-ray of the abdomen, ultrasound and CT on the admission. Each patient receive water-soluble contrast in 3 h after admission. In case of of clinical and radiologic signs of obstruction in 12 h after admission, surgery is performed. On the first stage of surgical treatment laparoscopic adhesiolysis is performed. If it is impossible to eliminate the cause of obstruction by laparoscopic technique laparotomy is performed.</description>

Installation of trocars, depending on the prevalence of the adhesion process
Assessment of the peritoneal adhesion index

Removing the obstacle without trying to completely eliminate the adhesion process in the abdominal cavity
If there is no possibility to eliminate the cause of intestinal obstruction laparoscopically laparotomy is performed.</description>
