      This will be a Phase 2 study of intratumoral pIL-12-EP plus IV pembrolizumab. Eligible
      patients will be those with pathological diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic melanoma who
      are progressing or have progressed on pembrolizumab or nivolumab..

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of a Core study (24 weeks), an Extension Phase and a long-term
      safety follow-up.

      Core study: Eligible patients will be treated with intratumoral pIL-12-EP to the accessible
      lesions on Days 1, 5 and 8 every 6 weeks and with IV pembrolizumab (200 mg) on Day 1 of each
      3-week cycle for 24 weeks. As many accessible lesions, may be treated, as deemed feasible by
      the treating physician .

      Extension phase: Patients who completed 24 weeks of treatment (Core study) with the
      investigators discretion, will enter an Extension phase and continue to receive the combined
      treatment of intratumoral pIL-12-EP and pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles of pembrolizumab
      from baseline (approximately 2 years) or until subsequent disease progression.
