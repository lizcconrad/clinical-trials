  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first time in human study is intended for men and women at least 18 years of age who
      have advanced liver cancer which has grown or returned after being treated. Those who did not
      tolerate or refused other therapies may also participate. The purpose of this study is to
      test the safety of genetically changed T cells that target alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and find
      out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with liver cancer. This study is for subjects
      who have a blood test positive for appropriate HLA-A*02 and liver tumor has the AFP protein
      and whose noncancerous liver tissue has very little AFP protein.

      The study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the
      blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study
      will be the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of
      attacking and destroying cancer cells.

      The manufacturing of T cells takes about 1 month to complete. The T cells will be given back
      to the subject through an intravenous infusion after 3 days of chemotherapy. The study will
      evaluate three different cell dose levels in order to find out the target cell dose. Once the
      target cell dose is determined, additional subjects will be enrolled to further test the
      safety and effects at this cell dose.

      Subjects will be hospitalized for at least 1 week after receiving their T cells back and then
      seen frequently by the Study Physician for the next 6 months. After that, subjects will be
      seen every three months. If subjects have disease progression or withdraw from the study,
      they will then be entered into a long-term follow up for safety monitoring. In long-term
      follow up, subjects will be seen every 6 months by their Study Physician for the first 5
      years after the T cell infusion and annually for the next 10 years.
