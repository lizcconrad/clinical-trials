  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of an individually transtheoretical model
      (TTM) tailored intervention on the completion of advance care planning (ACP) behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled trial examining the effect of an individually
      TTM-tailored intervention on the proportion of middle-age and older persons recruited from
      primary care practices who complete four ACP behaviors (completion of a living will,
      assignment of a health care proxy, and communication with loved ones and with their clinician
      about views on quality versus quantity of life) over six months, compared with usual care.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is to assess the proportion of participants that have completed the four ACP behaviors. The measure will be coded as a binary outcome where 'yes' indicates the completion of all 4 behaviors and 'no' indicates no completing the 4 behaviors.</description>

    <intervention_name>Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of health behavior change</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants are assessed for four different behaviors that together represent complete ACP engagement: communication with loved ones about views on quality of life versus quantity of life, communication with clinicians about views on quality of life versus quantity of life, assignment of a health care surrogate, and completion of a living will. The system takes the results of the assessment and results in an individualized feedback report. For individuals in early stages of change for a given behavior, the feedback focuses on changing attitudes, a necessary prerequisite for changing behavior, by addressing common barriers and by reminding individuals they can engage in small steps.</description>
