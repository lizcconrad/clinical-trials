  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible participants. This program is designed
      to provide access to VAL-083 (dianhydrogalactitol) prior to approval by the local regulatory
      agency. Availability will depend on territory eligibility. Participating sites will be added
      as they apply for and are approved for the EAP. A medical doctor must decide whether the
      potential benefit outweighs the risk of receiving an investigational therapy based on the
      individual patient's medical history and program eligibility criteria.
