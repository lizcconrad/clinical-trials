  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test two active evidence-based &quot;practice coaching&quot; (PC) interventions to
      improve opioid treatment programs' (OTPs') provision and sustained implementation of on-site
      1) HIV testing and linkage to care and 2) joint HIV/Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and
      linkage to care among patients seeking/receiving substance use disorder treatment.

      Aims are:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of the PC interventions on improving patient uptake of
      HIV testing in OTPs including the incremental impact of the HIV/HCV intervention on HIV
      testing.

      Aim 2: To examine, using mixed-methods, the impact of the PC interventions on the initiation
      and sustained provision of HIV testing and timely linkage to care.

      Aim 3: To evaluate the health outcomes, health care utilization, and cost-effectiveness of
      the PC interventions compared incrementally to one another and to the control condition.

      Primary Hypothesis:

        1. The two PC interventions will result in significantly higher rates of HIV testing than
           the information control condition in the first period after intervention (initial
           uptake--Primary) and after 12 months of follow-up after initial uptake (sustained
           implementation--Secondary).

        2. The HIV/HCV testing PC intervention will have a significantly higher rate of HIV testing
           in the first period after intervention and after 12 months of follow-up compared with
           the HIV testing only PC intervention (Secondary).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using the most recent National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) data
      available from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as the
      sampling frame, 51 sites will be randomly selected to participate in the study. Site
      randomization to condition will occur in waves. Selected sites will be invited to participate
      in the study and randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions (17 sites per
      condition) -- information control, HIV PC, and HIV/HCV PC. The control condition will be an
      HIV testing informational product consisting of the official NIDA/SAMHSA Blending Initiative
      product, &quot;HIV Rapid Testing in Substance Abuse Treatment Programs,&quot; ARTAS intervention
      information and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) information that will be provided to OTPs to
      educate and motivate them about the importance of offering on-site HIV testing and linkage to
      care. In the active PC conditions, change agents and key OTP staff will be provided training
      and support to facilitate the implementation of innovation and sustain resulting improvements
      in testing.

      De-identified aggregate client data on HIV and HCV testing will be collected from the sites
      for a period 6 months prior to intervention, the 6 months during the intervention, 6 months
      after the intervention, and 12 months after the intervention. Qualitative and quantitative
      site-level data will also be collected immediately preceding the intervention and again
      approximately 4 months after intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) where approximately 51 sites will be randomly selected to participate in the study.

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be a contrast of the proportion of OTP patients HIV tested at 6 months post intervention or control, controlling for HIV testing at baseline. The primary test will be whether the proportion of patients tested across the two PC interventions--HIV Testing PC Intervention Group and HIV/HCV Testing PC Intervention Group--differs from the proportion of patients tested in the Information Control Group.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of OTP patients HIV tested at 12 months post intervention or control</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post intervention or control condition (Testing between 12 and 18 months post site-randomization)</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measure will be the proportion of OTP patients HIV tested at 12 months post intervention or control, controlling for HIV testing at baseline. One test will be whether the proportion of patients tested across the two PC interventions--HIV Testing PC Intervention Group and HIV/HCV Testing PC Intervention Group--differs from the proportion of patients tested in the Information Control Group. A second test will be whether the proportion of OTP patients HIV tested in 12 months post-intervention in the HIV Testing PC Intervention Group differs from the proportion of patients tested in the HIV/HCV Testing PC Intervention Group.</description>

    <description>The ICER is a statistic used to summarize the cost-effectiveness of a health care intervention and is defined by the difference in cost between two possible interventions, divided by the difference in their effect. One ICER will be calculated for the difference between the Information Control Group and HIV Testing PC Intervention Group. A second ICER will be calculated for the difference between the HIV Testing PC Intervention Group and the HIV/HCV Testing PC Intervention Group.</description>

    <description>The practice coaches (PCs) will work with the program team a) to establish capabilities, reimbursement systems and/or partnerships necessary to support HIV and HCV testing and evidence--based linkage to care and b) to reduce barriers (e.g., staffing, training) to the implementation and sustained provision of HIV and HCV testing. Also, due to the expense of HCV treatment, and potentially more complicated mechanisms for linking HCV-positive patients to further evaluation and care which may take more time than anticipated, PCs will provide OTPs with basic education and motivation about the importance of HCV testing for reasons other than immediate curative treatment. Information on PrEP also will be provided. The intervention will occur over approximately 26 weeks.</description>
