      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of autologous PBSCT versus FDA approved
      standard of care (i.e. interferon, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod,
      or tecfidera) for inflammatory MS failing alternate approved therapy.

      Disease progression, defined as a 1-point increase in the Expanded Disability Status scale
      (EDSS) on consecutive evaluations at least 6 months apart and not due to a non-MS disease
      process. Patients will be followed for 5 years after randomization.

    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was proposed as a treatment for multiple
      sclerosis (MS) in 1995 based on results of HSCT for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
      (EAE), an animal model of MS. Since that time, more than two hundred patients with MS have
      undergone HSCT worldwide. The usual clinical course of MS is initially relapsing and
      subsequently progressive, although a combination of the two or progression from onset occurs
      in a minority of patients. Relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is punctuated by acute neural
      dysfunction that resolves completely or partially without baseline deterioration between
      acute attacks. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) manifests as steadily worsening neurologic
      baseline in patients with prior RRMS. Neural function in primary progressive MS (PPMS)
      deteriorates progressively from onset without identifiable acute relapses, whereas relapsing
      progressive MS (RPMS) has intermittent acute attacks in addition to slow progressive
      deterioration.

      The current therapies for MS consist of immune modulating agents such as interferons and
      glatiramer acetate, and anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive drugs such as
      glucocorticoids, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, cladribine, and cyclophosphamide. Autologous
      HSCT maximizes immune suppression to the point of transient immune ablation. In theory, the
      transplant conditioning regimen ablates the aberrant disease causing immune cells while
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) regenerate a new and antigen naive immune system.

      Study Design:

      All subjects will be examined at baseline and at 6 months and yearly thereafter with
      neuropsychological exams which shall include the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT)
      and where facilities exist a standardized, repeatable battery of tests consisting of the
      Selective Reminding Test (verbal learning), 7/24 Spatial Recall Test I (visuospatial
      learning), and Controlled Oral Word Association (verbal fluency and semantic retrieval).
      These cognitive functions, in addition to the PASAT, are most often disrupted in patients
      with MS. Administration of these tests and MS Functional Composite (which includes timed
      25-foot walk, and 9-hole peg test in addition to the PASAT) will be performed by a trained
      professional and should take 40 - 50 minutes. Self-administered quality of life exams (MSQOL
      and SF-36) will also be obtained pre-transplant, 6 and 12 months post-transplant, and then
      yearly until 5 years post-transplant.

      Patients may receive most FDA approved standard therapy (interferons, glatiramer acetate
      (Copaxone) mitoxantrone, natalizumab (Tysabri), fingolimod (Gilenya), Tecfidera ( BG-12) in
      the control arm, we recommend change from the therapy (s) which they failed to qualify for
      entry into the study. Patients in control arm may not receive teriflunomide (Aubagio). The
      decision of specific control arm therapy will be made by attending physicians based on
      clinical circumstances and discussion with the patient. If required for patient care, the
      dose of MS disease modifying therapies in the control arm may be adjusted by the treating
      physician.

      The major hazard of this protocol is transplant-related morbidity and mortality. The marrow
      ablative regimen of cyclophosphamide will destroy the patient's immune/hematopoietic system
      and leave the patient susceptible to a wide variety of infections and bleeding complications
      until the reinfused stem cells engraft. Aggressive supportive care as described above will be
      used to prevent all avoidable risk. However, a small percentage of patients may die as a
      direct result of transplant related complications. Transplant related mortality is directly
      related to a patient's age, general medical condition, and prior exposure to prolonged or
      aggressive chemotherapy regimens. Transplant related complications include infections,
      bleeding, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, and failure to en-graft. This protocol is
      designed to minimize these complications.

      Currently there exists insufficient data to determine progression rate on the HSCT arm. This
      is a randomized phase II study designed to determine progression rate post HSCT compared to
      an accepted intervention (mitoxantrone) to determine the feasibility and numbers of patients
      that would be required for a phase III study. A mitoxantrone study has shown a two year
      progression rate of 8% for the mitoxantrone arm and 25% for the control arm. Therefore, we
      expect the 5 year progression rate in the mitoxantrone arm to be between 20% (no change in
      progression rate) and 45% (progression rate similar to placebo immediately after mitoxantrone
      is stopped).

      If the investigators assume an approximate estimate of the 5-year progression rate for
      mitoxantrone is 45%, a sample size of 110 with 55 in each arm will provide at least 90% power
      to detect a difference when the 5-year progression rate in the mitoxantrone arm is 45%, and
      the corresponding rate in the transplant arm is 15% or less. The same numbers provide at
      least 80% power to detect a difference exists when the 5-year progression rate in the
      mitoxantrone arm is 45%, and the corresponding rate in the transplant arm is 20% or less. The
      investigators will therefore recruit 55 patients to each treatment arm.

    <description>Patients may receive FDA approved standard therapy (interferons, glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), mitoxantrone (Novantrone), natalizumab (Tysabri), fingolimod (Gilenya), Dimethyl fumorate (Tecfidera or BG-12) in the control arm. We recommend a change in therapy from that which they failed qualifying them for entry. Patients may not receive Teriflunomide (Aubagio) due to its long ½ life in the body (6 months to 2 years) which may complicate cross over to HSCT. The decision of specific control arm therapy will be made by attending physicians in consultation with the patient. There are three approved interferon beta preparations for MS: Avonex®, Betaseron®, and Rebif®. Glatiramer acetate is available as Copaxone®.</description>

    <description>Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) is the methyl ester of fumaric acid. It is an oral compound which has potent anti-inflammatory properties thought to be related to the induction of stress protein HO-1. There is also some evidence to suggest that Tecfidera include direct cytoprotective effects through upregulation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) and subsequent induction of an antioxidant response</description>

             neurologist).

        Minimum disease activity required for failure is defined as: a) two or more clinical
        relapses with documented neurologic changes and treated with steroids within the year prior
        to the study, or b) one steroid treated clinical relapse within the year prior to study and
        evidence on MRI of active inflammation (i.e., gadolinium enhancement) within the last 12
        months on an occasion separate from the clinical relapse.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Any illness that in the opinion of the investigators would jeopardize the ability
             of the patient to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy

             until appropriate for non-transplant treatment (if on control arm). Effective birth
             control is defined as 1) abstinence defined as refraining from all acts of vaginal
             intercourse; 2) consistent use of birth control pills; 3) injectable birth control
             methods (Depo-provera, Norplant); 4) tubal sterilization or male partner who has
             undergone vasectomy; 5) placement of an intrauterine device (IUD); or 6) use, with
