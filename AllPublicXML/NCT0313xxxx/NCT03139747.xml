    <description>Lenvatinib is an anti-cancer drug for the treatment of certain kinds of thyroid cancer, and potentially for other cancers as well. It was developed by Eisai Co. and acts as a multiple kinase inhibitor against the VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 kinases.</description>

    <description>It is currently used as an immunosuppressant to prevent rejection of organ transplants and in the treatment of renal cell cancer and other tumours. Much research has also been conducted on everolimus and other mTOR inhibitors as targeted therapy for use in a number of cancers.</description>

             symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy)
             or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to randomization. In the case of
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed
             by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing
             potential. Male patients whose sexual partner(s) are WOCBP who are not willing to use

             therapy. Patients with a known history of impaired fasting glucose or diabetes
             mellitus (DM) may be included, however blood glucose and antidiabetic treatment must
             be monitored closely throughout the trial and adjusted as necessary

          -  Patients with known intolerance or hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycin
             analogs (e.g. sirolimus, temsirolimus);

             performed on-study as long as the lymph nodes are not followed as part of RECIST
             criteria and all study medications are held from three days prior to the procedure to
             one week following or until deemed safe by the treating physician

          -  Patients with carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from the study. Patients with
             treated sites of leptomeningeal disease may be included at the discretion of the
             principal investigator.

          -  Radiotherapy for the treatment of a symptomatic (e.g. bone metastasis) as clinically
             indicated is allowed as long as it is not evidence of progressive disease and is not
             required to be measured as a target lesion per RECIST Biological response modifiers,
             such as G-CSF, within 3 week prior to study entry. (G-CSF and other hematopoietic
             growth factors may be used in the management of acute toxicity such as febrile
             neutropenia when clinically indicated or at the discretion of the investigator;
             however they may not be substituted for a required dose reduction).

          -  Patients taking chronic erythropoietin are permitted provided no dose adjustment is
             undertaken within 2 months prior to the study or during the study.

          -  Investigational drug therapy outside of this trial during or within 4 weeks prior the
             screening assessment.

          -  Use of ketoconazole, itraconazole, and ritonavir.
