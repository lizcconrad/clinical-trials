             27.0, wherein BMI (kg/m2) = Weight (kg) / [Height (m)]2

          -  Full understanding of all the information regarding this clinical trial after
             listening to a detailed explanation, deciding to participate in the clinical trial by
             one's own will, and signing a written consent to comply with the precautions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of herbal medicine including ginseng and red ginseng extracts within 2 weeks

             surgery (except for appendectomy or hernia surgery) that could affect the
             pharmacokinetic and safety assessment of the IP

          -  Clinical evidence of genetic disorders such as galactose intolerance, Lapp lactose
             deficiency, and/or glucose-galactose malabsorption

          -  History of hypersensitivity, including drug allergy (red ginseng extracts, aspirin,
             antibiotics, etc.), or history of clinically significant hypersensitivity

          -  Meeting the following criteria at the screening: Serum AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) &gt; 1.5
             times the upper normal limit

          -  History of drug abuse, or a positive reaction to an abusive drug in a urine drug
             screening

          -  Having taken any prescribed medicine or herbal supplement within two weeks before the
             first administration of the IP, or any non-prescribed medicine or vitamin supplement

             were satisfied, the subject could be deemed eligible for the trial at the discretion
             of the investigator.)

          -  Participation in and administration of the IP of another clinical trial within three
             months before the first administration of the IP

          -  Donation of a unit of blood within two months, or of blood components within one
             month, or receipt of a blood transfusion within one month before the first
             administration of the IP

          -  Consumption of more than 21 units of alcohol per week (one unit being 10 g of pure
             alcohol) or inability to abstain from drinking alcohol during the study period

             administration of the IP (Subjects who quit smoking for at least three months before
             the first administration of the IP can still be enrolled in the trial.) or subjects
             who are not able to quit smoking from 24 hours before hospitalization to discharge.
