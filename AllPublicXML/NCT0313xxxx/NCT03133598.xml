  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Un-ruptured intracranial aneurysm is a complex disease that seriously affects human life and
      health. At present, the treatment of intracranial aneurysm is divided into interventional
      treatment and craniotomy clipping, the two treatment methods are different in the
      intervention effect of aneurysm, for example, the complications of interventional therapy are
      lower than craniotomy clipping, but the long-term patency rate is lower than craniotomy
      clipping, and there is no standard of treatment in different parts of aneurysm in our
      country, the choice of intervention measures of un-ruptured aneurysm is different in
      different clinical centers; on the other hand, there are serious problems in the treatment of
      aneurysms, because without the relevant guidelines of diagnosis and treatment of intracranial
      aneurysms, different clinical centers will cause excessive treatment of un-ruptured
      aneurysms, not only bring unreasonable utilization of medical resources, but also cause the
      subject's life and property to be threatened.

      The patients with un-ruptured intracranial aneurysm(n=1500) were included in prospective
      cohort study, after clipping and intervention operation, setting fixed time for postoperative
      follow-up, the clinical data and image data were recorded, the safety, efficacy and economic
      benefits of interventional treatment and craniotomy clipping were compared, providing
      strategies for the standardized treatment of un-ruptured intracranial aneurysms.

      For this study,investigators consulted and hired professionals and experts about data
      collection, data and methodology,including Data Monitoring Committee, Data Management
      Committee, Progect Academic Committee, Executive Group, Project Manager, Project
      Statistician,Technical Support Center. investigators have a scientific regulations for this
      project. Project Manager and Executive Group: To ensure the successfully implementation of
      this project, including charging the daily operations of the study in 20 different research
      hospitals, organizing the monthly meeting to consider issures raised during the monthly
      progress of the study, liaising with the steering committee,the data management centre and
      statistical centre. Data management Committee: To be responsible for setting up and maintain
      the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System according to the papera Case Report Form(pCRF)
      designed by principal investigators. To collect and save the pCRF coming from sub-centers. To
      entry the data into EDC system and keep the same with CRF. To organize training for the
      investigators about the rules in filling the EDC and pCRF.To determine the frequency of the
      Data Management Report and to fed it back to the steering committee every three months. Data
      Mornitoring Committee: To determine the frequency of the data mornitoring including the
      source data(Medical records) accuracy, completeness and representativeness comparing the
      external data(EDC, pCRF) in 12 centers. To report the results after the mornitoring back to
      the steering committee about the missing data, non-reported and other problems about the
      study. To make a Standard Operation Procedure(SOP) from getting data to using data. Academic
      Committee: To supervise the academic issues including patient recruitment, protocol
      deviation, adverse events evalutating. To settle down the question and problem in the process
      of the study. Project Statistician: We cooperate with the statisticians of Medical Research &amp;
      Biometrics Center National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, China to get the perfessional
      statistical report. Technical Support Center:To provide technical support during the process
      of the study.
