  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims at deriving frailty (FI) and complexity (CI) indices from data collected
      with the Resident Instrument Assessment - Home Care adapted for Switzerland (RAI-HC). Data
      were collected in 2015 by trained nurses in clinical routine with the primary purposes of
      health state assessment and individual home care planning. The study consists in a
      retrospective secondary analysis of health data from the Minimal Data Set (MDS), used to
      derive frailty and complexity indices according to published definitions and guidelines for
      index derivation. The analysis further aims at estimating the predictive power of these
      indices on undesirable health outcomes (falls, hospitalizations and deaths). The goal is to
      provide home care institutions and nurses valid algorithms to compute useful clinical
      indicators without additional assessment that the one routinely done with the RAI-HC.
