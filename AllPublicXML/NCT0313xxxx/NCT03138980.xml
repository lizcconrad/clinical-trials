    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to conduct user testing of a mobile-based
      self-management support intervention for adolescents and young adults with Irritable Bowel
      Syndrome (IBS), a chronic digestive condition. The application (app; BodiMojo Buddy) uses a
      virtual coach that can serve to increase patient engagement through interactive
      skill-building, self-care, and mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral activities. If the
      BodiMojo Buddy mobile app is successful, it will have a significant public health impact by
      providing a mobile resource to the 10-15% of the US population who suffer from IBS and
      potentially improving health outcomes and reducing significant costs to the US healthcare
      system.

      Study participation involves participants downloading and using the app for 30 days. During
      the 30 days, participants will interact with the app by inputting their current mood,
      receiving supportive feedback from the app, reading messages, and doing brief activities
      (such as relaxation activities, etc.). Before and after the 30 days of user testing,
      participants will complete a few brief questionnaires about their behavior, how their
      symptoms affect their life, and how they receive support from others. These questions will
      take around 20 minutes to complete at each administration.

Responses will be given on a one to seven-point-scale ranging &quot;terrible&quot; to &quot;excellent.&quot; The intervention will be deemed acceptable if at least 80% of participants rate each question an average of at least &quot;5&quot; (&quot;good&quot;) on the 7-point scale.</description>
