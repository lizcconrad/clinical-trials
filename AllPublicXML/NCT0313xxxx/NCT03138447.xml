      The digital health tool is an application (&quot;app&quot;) available on iOS and Android enabled mobile
      phones. Health Care Providers (&quot;HCPs&quot;) configure algorithms which can be tailored to
      individual patient's needs and then prescribe the app to support optimal basal insulin
      titration and dosing. In this study, participants will be recruited from a medical practice
      in which an HCP has prescribed a once-daily basal insulin. Participants will be trained on
      the use of the app utilizing their own mobile phone. During training, a brief self-assessment
      survey will be administered. After 90 days of usage, a telephone survey will be conducted.
      The baseline A1C results and the end of study A1C results will be collected from the
      patients' routine clinical care records. Data from the retrospective control group will be
      collected from a chart review of the same practice.

    <intervention_model_description>The design of this protocol involves a prospective and retrospective cohort. The prospective cohort includes 30 participants. In the retrospective chart review, participants will be matched to the prospective group for age, gender, and baseline A1C. (For this study, the use of the word 'matched' means that the retrospective patient charts will be matched as close as possible from available patient data within the Bay West Endocrinology medical record database and may not always be an exact match to the prospective group for age, gender, and baseline A1c.) The chart review will thus be conducted after the last subject is enrolled in the prospective arm of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Healthcare Providers (&quot;HCP&quot;) and the principal investigator (&quot;PI&quot;) will use an HCP portal to initiate a basal insulin titration algorithm. HCPs can customize the titration algorithm for every participant. Once a participant is prescribed an algorithm, they can download a mobile app on their phone with their HCPs corresponding titration plan. The app will prompt participants to enter their fasting glucose daily. Based on their fasting glucose and their HCPs titration plan, the application will display the participants daily basal insulin dose.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Prospective cohort: The participants will be patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who
        are not at goal on their current dose of prescribed basal insulin (e.g. Lantus, Toujeo,
        Levemir, Tresiba, or Basaglar). Participants shall be age 21 or older, prescribed basal
        insulin within the past 18 months, own a compatible mobile phone, able to receive/make
        calls and read messages on their phone. There is no predefined gender or ethnic group.
        Participants should be generally healthy and not expected to be hospitalized for surgery or
        other medical care during the study period.

        - Retrospective cohort: This will be a chart review. Participants will be matched to the
        prospective cohort for age, gender and baseline A1C. Patients should have been prescribed
        one of the basal insulins above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Prospective cohort: Participants with stage 4 or 5 kidney disease, active malignancies,
        variable glucocorticoid doses during the study period, severe visual impairment, or
        dementia will be excluded. Also, participants prescribed rapid-acting or premixed insulins
        (any insulin not on the above list) will be excluded.

        - Retrospective cohort: Same as above.
