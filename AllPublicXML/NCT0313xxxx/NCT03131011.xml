  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase II prospective, randomized control trial assessing the impact of &quot;invisible ink&quot;
      ultra-violet (UV) tattoo ink versus conventional black tattoo ink for radiotherapy treatment
      localization on the quality of life of breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant
      radiotherapy. The effect of tattoo type on quality of life will be measured objectively using
      the externally validated body-image satisfaction (BIS) scale as the primary outcome of
      interest, with secondary endpoints including: accuracy/reproducibility of radiotherapy setup
      using the invisible ink tattoos, resource impact requirements, and clinical feasibility. A
      sample size of 60 patients is planned (30 per study arm) with an anticipated accrual period
      of 18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients ages 18-60 who are planned for adjuvant radiotherapy and who meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered voluntary participation in this trial.
      Recruitment will be open for approximately 18 months; it is anticipated that 1-2 patients
      will be recruited per week until the planned sample size is met. Participants will be
      stratified into three groups depending on their self-reported baseline Body-image
      satisfaction (BIS) score and will then be randomly allocated to receive conventional dark ink
      or UV fluorescent tattoos using permutated block randomization (4 patients per block) to
      ensure balance of BIS baseline average between study arms.

      The investigators focus is to improve the current tattooing technique for breast cancer
      patients by introducing an alternate method that takes the patient's psychological
      perceptions of tattooing into account while first and foremost, continuing to guarantee that
      the current standard of accuracy in treatment delivery is maintained or improved. The
      investigators goal of decreasing the psychological effect of permanent radiotherapy tattoos
      aligns with CancerCare Manitoba's mission to improve the outcomes and quality of life for
      Manitobans with cancer.
