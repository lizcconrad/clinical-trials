  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to investigate two potential interventions (i.e., cognitive dissonance
      and action planning) for inducing behavior change for behaviors important to college
      studentsâ€”studying and exercise. In addition, this study will investigate factors that may
      impact behavior change, such as psychological and neuropsychological variables, to better
      understand how to bridge the intention-behavior gap.

    <description>After reading the materials about their chosen behavior, participants will be asked write an essay about their behavior of choice (studying/exercising). For this essay they will be asked to imagine that they have reached their ideal level of academic achievement/fitness, describe what this would look and feel like, and reflect on how this would impact how they view themselves, their relationships, and their day to day life.</description>

    <description>After reading the materials about their chosen behavior, participants will be asked to make a detailed plan for the following two weeks based on the following items taken from a study by Sniehotta and colleagues (2004): 1) when to complete studying/exercise, 2) where to complete studying/exercise, 3) how to complete studying/exercise (e.g., what types of exercise- cardio, class, etc. or what types of studying activities- reading, taking notes, creating outlines, etc.), and 4) how often to complete studying/exercise. Participants will be given a calendar as an aid to planning their behavior.</description>
