      The goal in this Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of the anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody
      tocilizumab in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in subjects with metastatic HER2
      positive breast cancer is to determine the safety, tolerability and recommended Phase 2 dose
      of tocilizumab given with trastuzumab and pertuzumab every 3 weeks.

    <description>The primary objective is to determine the highest dose level of tocilizumab (up to 8 mg/kg every 3 weeks) that, when given in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab every three weeks in subjects with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, will result in less than 25% incidence of DLT. DLTs (Dose Limiting Toxicity) will be assessed within the first two cycles (up to 10 weeks) and defined as any toxicity of grade 3 or 4, unless specifically described in the protocol.</description>
