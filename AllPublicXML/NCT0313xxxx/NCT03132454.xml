      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn more about the safety and effects of
      palbociclib, when given alone and then in combination with different standard drugs to
      patients with leukemia that is relapsed (has come back) or refractory (has not responded to
      treatment). The standard drugs being used are sorafenib, decitabine, and dexamethasone.
      Different doses of the standard drugs will be tested.

      Researchers will also be performing research tests, such as biomarker, pharmacodynamic (PD),
      and cytogenetic testing. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your
      reaction to the study drug. The biomarker testing in this study will include genetic
      biomarker testing. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect
      the disease. Cytogenetic testing looks at how genetic changes to cells may affect how the
      disease may react to the study drug.

      This is an investigational study. Palbociclib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat a type of breast cancer when used in combination with other drugs. Sorafenib is FDA
      approved and commercially available to treat renal cell cancer or hepatocellular cancer.
      Decitabine is approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Dexamethasone is
      FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of numerous medical conditions
      including hematologic disorders such as thrombocytopenia and anemias. It is investigational
      to give palbociclib in combination with sorafenib, decitabine, or dexamethasone to patients
      with leukemia.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 54 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Arms:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      Arm based on what the study doctor thinks is in your best interest.

        -  If you are in Arm A, you will receive palbociclib alone in Cycle 1. Beginning in Cycle 2
           you will receive palbociclib and sorafenib.

        -  If you are in Arm B, you will receive palbociclib alone in Cycle 1. Beginning in Cycle 2
           you will receive palbociclib and decitabine.

        -  If you are in Arm C, you will receive palbociclib alone in Cycle 1. Beginning in Cycle 2
           you will receive palbociclib and dexamethasone.

      Up to 3 dose levels of sorafenib will be tested in Arm A. Up to 3 dose levels of decitabine
      will be tested in Arm B. Up to 3 dose levels of dexamethasone will be tested in Arm C. Up to
      6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will
      receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest
      tolerable doses of sorafenib, decitabine, and dexamethasone are found.

      All patients in all 3 arms will receive palbociclib at the same dose.

      Study Drug Administration:

      There are 28 days in each study cycle.

      If you are in Arm A, you will take palbociclib alone by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-28 of
      Cycle 1. Beginning in Cycle 2, you will continue to take palbociclib on Days 1-28 of each
      cycle, you will also take sorafenib by mouth on Days 1-28 of each cycle.

      If you are in Arm B, you will take palbociclib alone by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-28 of
      Cycle 1. In Cycle 2, you will take palbociclib on Days 1-7 and you will receive decitabine by
      vein over about 1 hour on Days 8-17. Beginning in Cycle 3, you will take palbociclib on Days
      1-7 of each cycle and you will receive decitabine by vein over about 1 hour on Days 8-12 of
      each cycle.

      If you are in Arm C, you will take palbociclib alone by mouth 1 time each day on Days 1-28 of
      Cycle 1. Beginning in Cycle 2, you will continue to take palbociclib on Days 1-28 of each
      cycle and you will take dexamethasone either by mouth or by vein over about 15-30 minutes on
      Days 1-4 and Days 15-18 of each cycle.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may continue receiving the study drug(s) for up to 8 cycles. You will no longer be able
      to take the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if
      you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after your last dose of study drug(s).

      Study Visits:

      Within 3 days before each cycle, you will have a physical exam.

      At the start of Cycle 1, you will have an EKG.

      At least 1 time each week, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. If the
      disease appears to be going away, this will be done every 2-4 weeks while you are receiving
      the study drug.

      On Day 28 (+/- 7 days) of Cycles 1 and 2, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or
      biopsy to check the status of the disease. You may need to have these more frequently if the
      study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Follow-Up:

      After you stop receiving the study drug(s), you may have follow-up visits. These will depend
      on what the study doctor thinks is in your best interest.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a diagnosis of histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory (R/R)
             acute myeloid leukemia or R/R acute lymphoblastic leukemia for which no available
             standard therapies are indicated or anticipated to result in a durable response.

          2. Only patients with R/R ALL will be eligible for cohort C

          3. Age &gt;/= 15 years.

          4. Patients must not have had leukemia therapy for 14 days prior to starting palbociclib.
             However, patients with rapidly proliferative disease may receive hydroxyurea as needed
             until 24 hours prior to starting therapy on this protocol and during the first cycle
             of study.

          5. Adequate organ function as defined below: liver function (bilirubin &lt;/=2mg/dL, AST
             and/or ALT &lt;/=3 x ULN -- or &lt;/=5 x ULN if related to leukemic involvement); kidney
             function (creatinine &lt;/=1.5 x ULN ); known cardiac ejection fraction of &gt; or = 45%
             within the past 3 months.

          6. ECOG performance status of &lt;/= 2

          7. A negative urine pregnancy test is required within 1 week for all women of
             childbearing potential prior to enrolling on this trial.

          8. Patient must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and signed
             informed consent. A signed informed consent by the patient or his legally authorized
             representative is required prior to their enrollment on the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the agent used in this study has

             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             the chemotherapy agents, breastfeeding should also be avoided.

          2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to active uncontrolled
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), unstable

             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          3. Patient with documented hypersensitivity to any of the components of the therapy
             program.

          4. Patients with active, uncontrolled CNS leukemia will not be eligible.

          6. Patients with known history of serous retinopathy will not be eligible.

          7. Prior treatment with palbociclib
