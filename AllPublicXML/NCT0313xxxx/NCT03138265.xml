  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to investigate whether high intensity interval training can result in
      rapid improvements in physical fitness amongst the frail elderly (over 70 years old).
      Participants will undergo a wide range of physical fitness measures followed by a four week
      exercise protocol. Determination of improvement will be by repeated testing of the physical
      measures taken for baseline. The primary outcome measure will be anaerobic threshold. There
      will also be a subgroup of participants who will undergo muscle biopsy and D2O ingestion to
      allow an insight into the mechanistic basis behind exercise training response in this age
      group.
