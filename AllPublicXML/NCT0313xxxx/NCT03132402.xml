  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elimination of P. falciparum (PF) malaria across a territory requires universal access to
      treatment of clinical cases for communities, and specific targeting of places or population
      groups where malaria transmission persists in spite of generalized access to treatment. In
      particular, a large prevalence of carriers of PF parasites is suspected to be one of the
      reasons for malaria persistence. The fact that these carriers are not developing symptoms
      allow them to harbour and transmit parasites over long periods of time. They are likely to
      contribute significantly the transmission in their community and even beyond it according to
      their movement patterns.

      Identifying these pockets of high asymptomatic carriage is a key component of the malaria
      elimination strategy, as it allows targeting specific interventions, such as targeted
      mass-treatment, to quickly drain the asymptomatic reservoir.

      Strategically to achieve this goal we need to be able to identify quickly and reliably the
      villages or groups of villages in which the asymptomatic reservoir is large and should be
      addressed by targeted mass drug administration (MDA).

      There are no point of care tests currently available to detect asymptomatic carriers
      accurately. The available Rapid Diagnostic Tests (normal RDT) are designed to diagnose
      clinically relevant malaria infections. However their sensitivity for asymptomatic malaria
      carriers is low, since most of these individuals harbor parasitaemias below RDT detection
      thresholds. Currently, we are relying on high volume blood surveys, in which a small sample
      of the village population provides a 2mL venous blood sample that can be analysed by
      ultra-sensitive qPCR. This technique allows detecting very low parasitaemias. However it is a
      high cost test and technical requirements to use qPCR limit the number of samples that can be
      tested. In addition as the analysis must be done in a laboratory, the time needed for
      shipment and analysis results in delays of 4 to 8 weeks between survey and result. Surveying
      remote, poorly resourced areas adds to the challenge as the samples must be shipped from the
      field to the laboratory, on cold chain, within 24 to 48h from blood draw.

      To ensure that asymptomatic individuals are diagnosed in a cost effect and feasible manner,
      it is vital that a more sensitive RDT is made available for use in the field. Depending on
      its performance, a sensitive RDT could be used for prevalence surveys to target MDA, or
      directly for interventions based on treatment of positive individuals (reactive case
      detection or mass screening and treatment).

      A new hypersensitive RDT (hsRDT) has now been developed but before it can be utilised for
      elimination surveys we need to validate both its technical properties (sensitivity and
      specificity) and its usefulness in the field to detect PfHRP2 presence compared to a gold
      standard control ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay) test. This will allow
      confirmation of false- and true- positive among samples.
