  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with chronic liver disease develop significant muscle wasting that remains
      post-liver transplant. The transplant surgery additionally challenges respiratory mechanics.
      Respiratory muscle strength has been measured to be impaired in individuals post liver
      transplant. This study proposes an 8 week intervention designed to increase respiratory
      muscle strength and pulmonary function that we hypothesize will correlate to improved
      functional performance and quality of life post-liver transplant.

      Pre-test post-test design, that will randomize subjects into an experimental group that will
      receive the inspiratory muscle strengthening exercise in addition to usual post-liver
      transplant care and a control group that will only receive the usual post-transplant care.

      Up to 50 subjects will be recruited from the Post-Liver Transplant Outpatient Clinic at the
      Miami Transplant Institute.

      The subjects will have repeated measurements of respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary
      function, functional mobility performance, and quality of life at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8
      weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a paper and pencil questionnaire consisting of 29 items in 6 domains: 1) Abdominal Symptoms 2) Activity: eating habits and movement of heavy objects 3) Emotional Function 4) Fatigue: perception of decreased energy and sleepiness 5) Systemic symptoms 6) Worry: concerns regarding disease progression and family. Summary scores for each domain range from 1(most impaired) to 7 (least impaired). All items refer to the previous 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate less impairment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Karnovsky Performance Status Score at 4 weeks and 8 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a paper pencil questionnaire measuring functional impairment. The questionnaire is divided into three groups for classifying patient's ability to work, to carry on normal activity, and to care for themselves. The groups are further divided into eleven categories covering all level so functioning from normal (100) to dead (0). The lower the Karnovsky score, the worse the functional ability and survival for most serious illness. The liver transplant team records this measure prior to transplant. We will obtained pre-transplant scores from medical record for use in correlational analysis. This measure will also performed at baseline and post-testing.</description>
