      This study will explore whether ivabradine lowers heart rate, and thus improves exercise
      capacity, in survivors of lymphoma who have an elevated resting heart rate as a side effect
      of prior radiation treatment.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Ivabradine

        -  Placebo

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study intervention for this particular problem.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying a drug called ivabradine. The
      investigators are exploring whether ivabradine can be used to reduce heart rate, increase
      exercise duration, and improve quality of life in survivors of lymphoma who received
      radiation to their chest as a part of their cancer treatment.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ivabradine for this specific
      disease, but it has approved the drug as an oral medication to lower heart rate in heart
      failure patients.

      Survivors of lymphoma who were treated with neck and/or chest radiation can have an elevated
      resting heart rate and an abnormal rate of decline in their heart rate after exercise, also
      known as cardiac autonomic dysfunction. These abnormalities can limit exercise duration and
      worsen quality of life in some radiation treated survivors of lymphoma

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Survivors of mediastinal lymphoma (either Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Hodgkin's
             Lymphoma) with no active malignancy

          -  Prior mediastinal or mantle radiation ≥ 5 years prior to enrollment in the study

          -  Age 18-80 years.

          -  Participants must have normal organ function as defined below:

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine clearance ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

          -  Normal sinus rhythm with resting heart rate ≥ 80 bpm on screening EKG

          -  Based on findings in animals, ivabradine may cause fetal harm when administered to a
             pregnant woman. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reaction to ivabradine.

          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers
             of cytochrome P450 3A4 are ineligible.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, symptomatic
             known coronary artery disease, severe valvular heart disease, active malignancy, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ivabradine is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             ivabradine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             ivabradine.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy.

          -  Patients with systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg.

          -  Patients with sick-sinus syndrome, sino-atrial block, third degree heart block, atrial
             fibrillation, and those with permanent pacemakers.

          -  Patients with other established indications for ivabradine: stable, symptomatic
             chronic HF with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35% and in sinus rhythm with a
             resting HR ≥ 70 bpm, who are taking maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers or have
             contraindications to beta-blocker use.

          -  Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction (Child Pugh Class C).

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.
