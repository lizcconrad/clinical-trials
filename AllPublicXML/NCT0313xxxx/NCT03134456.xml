  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, single arm study in patients with metastatic non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 after failure of platinum-based combination
      chemotherapy.

      Patients will be treated with Pembrolizumab according to the dosage and administration in
      Product Information of Keytruda in Korea (2mg/kg) until it is changed to 200mg flat dose.

      The patient should have their-own patient-derived xenograft (PDX) before enrollment of the
      study. The PDX will be used to set up their humanized CD34 PDX (Hu-CD34 PDX).

      Part A: Clinical trial (single arm study) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) expressing PD-L1 after failure of platinum-based combination chemotherapy.

      Part B: PDX experiment using Hu-CD34 PDX model in specific population selected from Part A
      (Clinical trial part) - responder and non-responder.

      In-vivo experiment using Hu-CD34 PDX will be done for about seven subjects, and thirty-two
      (32) Hu-CD34 PDX mice will be established from single patient to see in-vivo response. This
      research using PDX (Part B) will be conducted sequentially on clinical trial part in
      selected-population based on clinical response of Pembrolizumab.

             but not limited to gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, osimertinib). Patients with ALK
             fusion should have disease progression on at least one of ALK TKI (including but not
             limited to crizotinib or ceritinib).

             a. Previously treated with 3 or more systemic regimens given for recurrent and/or
             metastatic disease are excluded (TKIs are not included in the number of regimens)

          4. Have tumor which express PD-L1(TPS ≥ 1%) confirmed by immunohistochemistry.

          5. Have their-own patient-derived xenograft established.

          6. Over 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          7. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

          8. Have a performance status of 0 to 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          9. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should

         10. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of
             contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.2 - Contraception, for the course of the
             study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.

         12. Male subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of
