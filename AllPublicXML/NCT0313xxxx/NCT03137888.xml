  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of spectroscopic magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI)-guided radiation therapy and how well it works in treating patients with
      newly-diagnosed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma. Spectroscopic MRI can show doctors where the
      extent of tumor is in the brain beyond current clinical MRI scans by mapping areas of high
      tumor metabolism. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and shrink
      tumors. Spectroscopic MRI-guided radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of using spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) to guide dose-escalated
      radiation therapy (RT) for newly-diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM)s.

      II. To determine the safety of using sMRI to guide dose-escalated RT for newly-diagnosed
      GBMs.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the progression free survival at 1 year with sMRI-guided,
      dose-escalated RT is improved for newly-diagnosed GBMs.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether sMRI-guided, dose-escalated RT increases the overall survival of
      patients with newly diagnosed GBMs.

      II. To determine whether sMRI data obtained after initiation of therapy (at 2 weeks after
      RT/TMZ start and prior to cycle 1 and 5 of adjuvant temozolomide [TMZ]) will provide early
      evidence of GBM progression not seen on standard MRIs.

      III. To determine whether performance on neurocognitive and quality-of-life (QOL) assessments
      in newly-diagnosed GBM patients treated with sMRI-guided, dose-escalated RT differ from
      historical controls.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo sMRI-guided radiation therapy daily for the first 5 days of every week
      (Monday - Friday) over 6 weeks. Patients also receive standard of care temozolomide orally
      (PO) daily during radiation therapy for up to 42 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years and then periodically.

          -  Patients who are women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             documented ≤ 14 days prior to registration; this is not specific to dose escalation
             and is mandatory for standard care for patients being treated with radiation therapy;
             the cost of this test will be covered by standard of care

          -  Patients must be able to understand and provide written informed consent

          -  Members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial; subjects will be
             approximately representative of the demographics of the referral base for the
             participating institutions

             the patient's ability to tolerate this therapy are excluded

          -  Patients with a history of any other invasive cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer
             and excluding carcinoma in-situ), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy

             Oncology guide); patient may be excluded after the first sMRI scan if the GTV3 volume
             is greater than 65 cc (we anticipate that contrast-enhancing tumor volume [residual
             tumor volume following tumor resection] would be less than 20 cc)
