  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to reduce the amount of sugar in a particular food item and add spices to see
      if the food liking of that item rates as high or higher in a post meal survey. Through the
      weekly feeding and testing of the menu items we will determine an opinion of the
      participants. Results of these surveys will determine whether participants enjoy the reduced
      sugar options as much as their full sugar counterparts.

      The Investigators will determine the overall consumer acceptability of a breakfast meal (tea
      and oatmeal) and a dessert (apple crisp) using a randomized, three-period, within subjects,
      crossover design. The three test conditions will be (1) Full sugar (&quot;FS&quot;), (2) reduced sugar
      (and calorie) with no added spice (&quot;RS&quot;) and (3) reduced sugar (and calorie) plus spice
      (&quot;RSS&quot;). The two reduced sugar meals will be matched for calories. Subjects will taste each
      condition of the item on a separate day; tastings will be one week apart.

    <description>Each subject was randomly assigned to one of six possible sequences to taste three recipes of each test item. Oatmeal and tea were served together and tastings occurred over three weeks; tasting of apple crisp occurred over three different weeks. Tastings of the three recipes occurred one week apart. The three recipes were full sugar recipe (FS), reduced sugar recipe (RS) and reduced sugar plus spice recipe (RSS). Each subject was randomly assigned to one of the below sequence schedules for each taste test whereby A, B, and C refer to one of the three recipes (FS, RS, or RSS):
Sequence 1: A, B, C Sequence 2: A, C, B Sequence 3: B, A, C Sequence 4: B, C, A Sequence 5: C, A, B Sequence 6: C, B, A</description>
