    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the effect of the Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect (diagnostic
      assay) on uptake of HIV testing among HIV-exposed infants and young children, and health
      outcomes for HIV-infected infants and young children in Zambia. It will also assess the
      feasibility of field implementation of this novel diagnostic tool and its acceptability among
      HIV-infected mothers and frontline health workers.

      feasibility of field implementation of this novel diagnostic tool and its acceptability among
      HIV-infected mothers and frontline health workers. The knowledge generated from this study
      will enable the Zambia Ministry of Health (MOH) to make informed policy decisions about the
      implementation and scale up of point of care (POC) diagnostic tools for early infant
      diagnosis and pediatric HIV treatment programs in Zambia and the region.

    <description>These participants will be enrolled from and receive their care from same clinics where they receive their standard of care (SOC) HIV testing via DBS DNA PCR. Until the SOC test results are available and have been reported to the parent/guardian, HIV-exposed infants will commence on HIV prophylaxis per national guidelines. If the SOC test result is positive, the infant will be initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) per national guidelines. If the SOC test result is negative, the infant will continue the HIV prophylaxis until 6-weeks post-breastfeeding, per national guidelines. Follow-up care will also be conducted according to current national guidelines.</description>

    <description>These participants will be enrolled from and receive their care from same clinics where they receive their standard of care (SOC) HIV testing via DBS DNA PCR. However, in addition to undergoing HIV testing through SOC, they will also be tested for HIV through the point of care Alere™ q HIV 1/2 Detect platform (Alere Q). Treatment will be initiated based on the Alere Q test result. If the Alere Q test result is positive, the infant will be initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) per national guidelines. If the Alere Q test result is negative, the infant will continue the HIV prophylaxis until 6-weeks post-breastfeeding, per national guidelines. Follow-up care will also be conducted according to current national guidelines.</description>

    <description>HIV-exposed Infants/young children (IYC) (from 6 weeks of age) of randomized standard of care clinics will have heelprick-obtained blood tested for HIV with standard of care assay, DBS DNA PCR testing. Samples will be sent to centralized offsite lab for testing with Roche COBAS® Ampliprep/TaqMan HIV Quantitative Test v2.0 testing platform. DBS sample packaging and shipping will be arranged by health-facility based Ministry of Health staff. Parent/guardian will be asked to return to the clinic with infant in 4 wks for test results. IYC found to be HIV-infected will have second, confirmatory DBS DNA PCR sample drawn, initiate ART immediately and attend routine follow-up visits at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and 48 post ART-initiation. Study-specific data will be obtained on first 8 routine visits after ART initiation. HIV-uninfected IYC on first PCR testing will attend routine care per national guidelines, however, they no longer be followed in study.</description>

    <description>Infants of intervention clinics will have heelprick-obtained blood tested by standard of care method (SOC) and Alere™ q HIV-1/2 Detect Test Point of Care testing onsite. Point-of-care (POC) testing results will be available in 52 minutes. HIV-infected infants, based on the Alere Q test result, will start ART as soon as possible and start routine SOC visits at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and 48 post ART-initiation. Study data will be obtained on first 8 routine visits after ART initiation. Infants will return for results of DBS-based DNA PCR testing. Positive SOC infants remain on ART/study follow-up. Negative POC test/negative SOC infants will attend only routine care visits and continue on HIV prophylaxis per national guidelines. Discordant results require DNA PCR test, with positive results continuing ART, negative results being repeated for confirmation before discontinuation. Study specific data will be collected at first 8 routine visits.</description>

        Infants and Young children:

          -  With a severe acute illness or requiring inpatient hospitalization (e.g. severe acute
             pneumonia, severe acute malnutrition, severe malaria, etc), in whom the likelihood of

             high;

          -  Who have a major congenital anomaly or other medical condition that would require
             management at a referral facility or otherwise interfere with study procedures;
