      This research study is studying a drug called Abemaciclib as a possible treatment for have
      metastatic triple-negative type of breast cancer.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved abemaciclib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      Some triple-negative breast cancers show expression of the Rb protein and are referred to as
      &quot;Rb-positive.&quot; The Rb protein is important because it controls the way that cancer cells
      divide and grow. Drugs like abemaciclib work by changing the way that Rb functions. This can
      potentially stop cancer cells from dividing, and can also potentially lead to cancer cell
      death.

      In this research study, the investigators are are looking to see how safe abemaciclib is and
      how well it will work to help people with triple-negative breast cancer that is Rb-positive.

             be obtained up to 1 week (7 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1.
             Patients who undergo an attempted research biopsy procedure for the purpose of this
             protocol, and in whom inadequate tissue is obtained, are not required to undergo a
             repeat biopsy in order to continue on protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor.

          -  Undergone major surgery within 14 days of the initial dose of study drug

          -  Received another investigational agent (defined as any agent/device that has not
             received regulatory approval for any indication) within 14 days of the first dose of
             study drug for a nonmyelosupressive agent, or 21 days of the first dose of study drug
             for a myelosuppressive agent.

          -  Has any severe concurrent disease, infection, or comorbid condition that renders the
             patient inappropriate for enrollment in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Has an active bacterial, fungal, and/or known viral infection. Patients with known HIV
             infection are excluded given the potential for interactions between antiretroviral
             agents and abemaciclib, and the potential for increased risk of life-threatening
             infection with therapy that is myelosuppressive. Patients with known Hepatitis B or
             Hepatitis C infection are excluded only if there is evidence of active infection
             (detectable Hepatitis B surface antigen, detectable Hepatitis C RNA)

          -  Documented brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to
             control symptoms. Participants with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible
             if they have completed treatment at least one month prior to trial registration, are
             neurologically stable, and have recovered from effects of radiotherapy or surgery.

               -  Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued without
                  the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the first study drug.

               -  Treatment for brain metastases may have included whole brain radiotherapy,
                  radiosurgery, or a combination as was deemed appropriate by the treating
                  physician.

               -  Patients who meet the above criteria and are clinically stable on anti-convulsant
                  medication are eligible only if their anti-convulsant does not alter hepatic
                  cytochrome P450 activity in a way that might interfere with metabolism of
                  abemaciclib.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             effects.

          -  Lactating women are excluding from the study.

          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances: individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if they are diagnosed and have completed treatment within the
             past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Patients
             with other cancers diagnosed within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of
             recurrence should be discussed with the principle investigator to determine
             eligibility.

          -  Have received any live vaccination within 28 days of first dose of study drug.
