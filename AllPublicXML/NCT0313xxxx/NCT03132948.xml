      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of exercise on physical activity levels
      and quality of life in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving maintenance
      chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Health-related quality of life is an important outcome of cancer treatment which encompasses
      physical, psychological, social, and functional well-being. In addition, quality of life
      includes one's overall ability to become a productive member of society and achieve personal
      fulfillment. Treatment of pediatric cancer is a highly stressful experience which can be
      challenging and disruptive to the lives of children and their families. Pediatric oncology
      patients receiving chemotherapy often experience a decline in quality of life due to
      decreased activity, fatigue, and psychological distress such as depression or anxiety when
      compared to healthy individuals. Preliminary data suggests that there is an association
      between physical activity and quality of life. Exercise has been show to improve mood,
      increase energy levels, and reduce stress. Although more research and clinical resources have
      been given to the effects of exercise on quality of life among adult cancer patients, there
      is a lack of research in these areas among children with cancer. We know little about whether
      children with cancer would benefit from exercise.

      We have added a blood sample for biomarkers. Research in adult cancer patients have shown an
      association between different biomarkers and sleep quality which suggests that regulation of
      certain biomarkers may be affected through exercise in adults. Measures of biomarkers may
      provide insight into potential mediators between PA, sleep quality, or fatigue levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric oncology patients with ALL in the maintenance phase of chemotherapy during
             the time of study

          -  Ages 8-18 years of either gender (age limits due to reliability and validity of
             outcome assessment surveys)

          -  Have no documented or observable psychiatric or neurological disorders that would
             interfere with study participation

          -  Capable of speaking and reading English

          -  Having no contraindications to participate in moderate physical exercise as determined
             by the research staff and the patient's pediatric oncologist

          -  Currently living with their parents/legal guardians

          -  Consent obtained from legal guardians and assent obtained from patients to participate
             in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not a pediatric oncology patient with ALL in maintenance

          -  Not receiving chemotherapy during the time of study

          -  Age less than 8 years or greater than 18 years

          -  Not English-speaking Since not all outcome measures have been validated in Spanish and
