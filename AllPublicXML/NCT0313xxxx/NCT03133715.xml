  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized trial to compare outcomes of robot-assisted and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair
      surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventral hernia repair is a very common surgical operation. Both laparoscopic and
      robot-assisted operations are considered acceptable. However, there is no clear indication
      for a particular approach. No prospective trial has been conducted so far to establish
      superiority of one approach over the other. The Investigator believes each approach has
      unique characteristics and may offer advantages over the other in the right population group.
      The Investigator will randomly assign patients in two arms according to the surgical
      approach, whether laparoscopic or robot-assisted. The Investigator will collect preoperative
      characteristics, intraoperative variables, and postoperative outcomes. The Investigator will
      compare all variables to establish differences between the two groups.
