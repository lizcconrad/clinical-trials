  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of fluconazole (an
      inhibitor of cytochrome P450 [CYP] 2C9 and CYP3A) and itraconazole (an inhibitor of CYP3A4
      and P-glycoprotein [P-gp]) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 4-milligram (mg) oral dose of
      erdafitinib in healthy adult participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, and
             triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening

          -  Be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at screening. If the
             results of the serum chemistry panel, other specific tests, blood coagulation or
             hematology are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may be included
             only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not
             clinically significant. This determination must be recorded in the participant's
             source documents and initialed by the investigator. Healthy participants should be
             characterized by the following genotype regarding CYP2C9: *1/*1 (wild type), *1/*2 or
             *1/*3

             pregnancy test at screening and on Day 1

          -  If a woman, must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purposes of assisted
             reproduction during the study and for 3 months after the last study drug
             administration

          -  If a man who is sexually active, must agree to use a condom; and if a man who is
             sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and who has not had a
             vasectomy, must agree to use a condom in combination with an adequate contraception
             method as deemed appropriate by the investigator, example, partner using effective
             contraception (defined as hormonal contraception [pill, patch, injection],
             intrauterine device, surgical sterilization) during the study and not to donate sperm
             for 5 months after the last study drug administration

             respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal insufficiency, thyroid
             disease, neurologic or psychiatric disease, infection, or any other illness that the
             investigator considers should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  History or current evidence of ophthalmic disorder, such as central serous retinopathy
             (CSR) or retinal vein occlusion, active wet age related macular degeneration, diabetic
             retinopathy with macular edema, uncontrolled glaucoma, corneal pathology such as
             keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation, or
             ulceration

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology or clinical chemistry at
             screening as deemed appropriate by the investigator

          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs, or triplicate
             12-lead ECG at screening as deemed appropriate by the investigator

          -  Donated blood or blood products or had substantial loss of blood (more than 500
             [milliliter]mL) within 3 months before the first study drug administration or
             intention to donate blood or blood products during the study
