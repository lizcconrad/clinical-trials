  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our prior study on the therapeutic mechanism of UCB, changes in cytokine levels were
      observed but the results are inconclusive and further studies on animal models and changes of
      protein expression before and after UCB therapy in the clinical settings are required.

      The changes in protein expression will be assessed by multiplex RT-PCR mRNA assay. Clinical
      efficacy of UCB therapy will be evaluated with various functional assessment tools. Factors
      regarding UCB therapy (number of transplanted cells, HLA matching status, serum level of
      immunosuppressant, etc.) and patient factors (age, functional status, etc.) will be analyzed
      for correlation with protein expression after UCB therapy. Several target proteins for
      analysis are available. Pentraxin and toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 are receptors modulating
      intrinsic immune reaction and was shown to have a significant correlation with clinical
      efficacy of stem cell therapy. Ubiquitine is a regulatory protein that combines with the
      target protein and affects its degradation, interaction, localization and activation. The
      ubiquitine system controls total protein quantity for homeostasis and can be found in all
      tissues. Deubiquitination (DUB) enzyme down-regulates this ubiquitine and is known to
      modulate all cellular changes

Intravenous infusion will be conducted in stem cell center, CHA Bundang Medical Center and the therapy will be performed by the Principal Investigator or a physician delegated from the Principal Investigator. The physician conducting the infusion will not participate in the efficacy and result analysis of this study.

    <description>UCB with total nucleated cell count ≤ 7x108/kg will be used for this clinical trial. Suitable UCB (i.e., containing total nucleated cell count ≥2x107/kg with three or less mismatch among HLA-A, -B, and -DR) will be selected. This criterion was selected upon the rationale that even though minimal HLA mismatch is preferred, prior studies indicate significant effects of UCB therapy for patients with 3 HLA mismatches.</description>
