  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effect of probenecid on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of single-dose pexidartinib in healthy subjects.

      Secondary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of pexidartinib alone and in
      combination with probenecid.

      Participants will be confined to the clinic for approximately 32 days. Blood samples will be
      collected for PK analysis of pexidartinib and metabolites at predose and up to 312 hours (h)
      post dose.
