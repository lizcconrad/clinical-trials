  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory aortitis probably represents a heterogeneous group, and the clinical experience
      accumulated over the last ten years, shared by the experts of the subject, is that the
      initial clinical, biological or radiological characteristics should make it possible to
      differentiate them and dismember the Nosological field.

      This will be an essential first step before studying prognosis, risk factors, and therapeutic
      options.

      The search for diagnostic criteria on a large series, similar to the study of classification
      of vascularites of the ACR in 1990, should make it possible to homogenize the diagnoses for
      the different teams working on the subject, and to begin work Collaborations, which alone can
      improve patient care in the future.

        All patients with idiopathic inflammatory aortitis or retroperitoneal fibrosis.

        Three focus groups will be constituted:

        Group 1: it will include all cases of non-idiopathic inflammatory aortitis followed in the
        participating centers over the last 15 years, Group 2: it will include patients with
        non-inflammatory aortic conditions (aneurysm, atheroma, annulo-ectasitic aortic disease).

        Group 3: it will include patients without aortic pathology matched by age and sex, having a
        thoracoabdominal scanner or MRI in the participating centers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases :

               -  All cases of idiopathic aortitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis followed in
                  participating centers over the past 15 years will be collected.

          -  Witnesses :

               -  Group 1: non-idiopathic inflammatory aortitis: all cases of inflammatory aortitis
                  (apart from idiopathic aortites and isolated retroperitoneal fibrosis) followed
                  in the participating centers over the last 15 years will be collected.

               -  Group 2: subjects with noninflammatory aortic disease, atheromatous type or
                  annulo-ectasitic disease, matched by age and sex with cases. This group will be
                  used to define the differential characteristics between idiopathic aortitis and
                  noninflammatory aortic pathology.

               -  Group 3: This group will include control subjects aimed at defining radiological
                  normality criteria according to age and sex. As the images are machine-dependent,
                  group 3 controls will be randomly selected from the radiology departments that
                  have performed the scanner or MRI of the corresponding control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under 18 years of age
