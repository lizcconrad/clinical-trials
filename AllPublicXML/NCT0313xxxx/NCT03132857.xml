  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, the French population over 75 years of age was 9%; It will be 13% in 2030 and 19% in
      2050 according to estimates. The incidence of falls is high in the elderly population, with
      at least one fall per year for one-third of the over-65s and for half of the over-80s. These
      data are consistent with the international medical literature, particularly in Japan, the
      United States and France, with a high rate of recurrence from the first fall. Falling is a
      complex phenomenon that is of great importance in terms of morbidity and mortality since it
      can be followed by serious complications: failure to recover, recurrences, trauma (fractures,
      hematomas, wounds), complications of decubitus and ulcers, Immobilization, loss of autonomy,
      hospitalization, institutionalization, psychological complications (post-fall syndrome,
      depressive syndrome), death.

      Fall risk factors are well known and described and relayed by learned societies of geriatrics
      and medical literature. In addition, HAS reported on this issue in 2009.

      The French Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (SFGG) defines fragility as a clinical
      syndrome that reflects a decrease in reserve physiological capacities that alters the coping
      mechanisms of stress. Its clinical expression is modulated by comorbidities and
      psychological, social, economic and behavioral factors. Frailty syndrome is a risk marker for
      mortality and pejorative events, including disability, falls, hospitalization and
      institutionalization. The fall and its complications are closely related to the fragility
      syndrome. The very fragile patient must take an active part in his own care. He is the first
      advocate of fall prevention.

      On the other hand medical desertification and the low number of geriatricians makes this
      implication problematic even more so if the person is isolated or has cognitive impairment.
      Nevertheless, it is important to make the patient actor of his own prevention. This is the
      first study to describe the knowledge of older adults about their own risk of falling.
