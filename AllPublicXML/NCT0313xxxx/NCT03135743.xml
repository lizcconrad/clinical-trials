  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading cause of death in man and the second leading cause in women with 85,000
      and 63,000 deaths, respectively, in 2012. A working group led by Holly L. Howe, PhD, in 2002
      defined primary neoplasia Such as the occurrence and diagnosis of two or more independent
      neoplasms of different histology in the same patient. The occurrence of a new cancer has
      become more frequent in recent years: the prevalence of multiple primary neoplasia (NPM) is
      estimated between 0.73% and 11.7%. According to the French data, the risk of second cancer in
      people who have already had a first cancer is increased by 36% compared to the general
      population. Several studies have reported an increase in the risk of cancer after treatment
      of lymphoma but there are currently no studies on the occurrence of lymphoma and cancer of
      synchronous occurrence.

      In our department, 19 patients presented cancer and lymphoma synchronously, that is to say 6
      months between 2007 and 2012.

      The main objective is to show that there is an increase in the incidence of cancers in
      patients diagnosed for lymphoma synchronously. Secondary objectives are to describe the
      clinical and biological characteristics of the patients concerned and to formulate hypotheses
      on the physiopathological mechanisms involved: peri-tumoral B-cell lymphoproliferation,
      alteration of the immune system or rearrangement of the BCR.

      In a second step, the investigator could propose a multicenter epidemiological study using
      data from the different Cancer Registries. If results are confirmed in a larger cohort,
      recommendations could be made.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Being older than 18

          -  Have been diagnosed for Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from 1 January 2007 to 31
             December 2012

          -  Diagnostic confirmation either in anatomopathology or in cytology

          -  Delay of 6 months maximum between the two neoplasms (Synchronic / metachronous
             distinction)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hemopathy other than lymphoma (CLL and lymphocytic lymphoma excluded)

          -  Diagnosis of lymphoma outside the inclusion period Metastases and recurrences were not
             considered as secondary cancers, but as relapses of the first neoplasia

          -  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas were not considered secondary cancer because of the
             absence of available incidence data (FRANCIM network)
