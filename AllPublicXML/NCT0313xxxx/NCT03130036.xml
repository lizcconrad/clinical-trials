  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center imaging study that will recruit 30 participants who are enrolled in
      the Brain Energy And Memory study (BEAM) protocol. This cohort of patients, aged 50-85, will
      receive a maximum of 3 [11C]Acetoacetate (AcAc)/[18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans over
      18 weeks as part of this supplemental trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the brain biodistribution of [11C]AcAc/[18F]FDG, a proxy for
      acetoacetate (ketone body)/glucose metabolism, in asymptomatic individuals with increased
      risk of Alzheimer's disease, those without identifiable risk of Alzheimer's disease, and
      those with early Alzheimer's disease or MCI. Data collected in this study will help provide a
      more comprehensive understanding of brain energy metabolism (both glucose and ketone bodies)
      in several groups of participants including adults with and without signs of memory
      impairment.

    <description>The low-carbohydrate diet will consist of a meal plan of less than 20 grams of carbohydrates per day to be consumed over 6 weeks. Foods that provide high levels of healthy fats (preferably low in saturated fats) will be generously included in the diet plan. Various lean meats, fish, and nutrient rich foods that meet the requirement of less than 20 grams total carbohydrates per day will be included in the meal plans. Carbohydrates will be expected to make up less than 10% of total caloric intake. Participants in the low-carbohydrate diet group will receive a supply of extra virgin olive oil at study visits to incorporate into their individualized meal plans.</description>

    <description>The low-fat diet will consist of a low-fat, higher-carbohydrate meal plan to be consumed over 6 weeks. Participants will be encouraged to limit their amount of fat intake to less than 40 grams per day, while eating plentiful fruits, vegetables, and carbohydrates containing adequate fiber. Various lean meats and other sources of protein will be included in the diet plan. Carbohydrates will be expected to make up 50-60% of total caloric intake.</description>
