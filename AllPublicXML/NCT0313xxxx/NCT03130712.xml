  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, CART cells are targeted to GPC3 by intratumor injected that we hope by this
      means could improve the local CAR-T cell numbers, meanwhile reduce the potential side
      effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with leukapheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and then
      PBMC are purified. T cells are activated and then re-engineered to express chimeric antigen
      receptors (CARs) specific for GPC3. Cells are expanded in culture and returned to the
      participant by intratumor injection at the dose of(1-10)×106 CAR positive T cells. The cells
      perfusion process would only last for (1-2) min. GPC-CART cells are injected into each tumor
      focus only once.
