    <textblock>
      In this trial the investigators aim to verify the potential impacts of a multi-level
      intervention with standing desks on behavior and cognitive function in children
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster controlled trial conducted in a school setting. Two classes (intervention
      and control) of sixth grade will be selected from a large, centrally located school in
      Lisbon. The intervention will take place over a period of 16 weeks and will be composed of
      physical environmental (standing desks), social environment, and education/behavior
      components. Objective measurements of physical activity and sedentary behavior (ActiGraph
      GT3X+ accelerometer and activPAL inclinometer), school performance (students grades),
      attention (D2 test), memory (Rey complex figure), fluid intelligence (Raven's Progressive
      Matrices), visuo-spatial short term working memory (Corsi block-tapping test), processing
      speed and inhibitory function (Stoop test) will be assessed. Finally, anthropometry and
      stakeholders' perceptions will also be obtained at baseline and after the intervention.

    <measure>Sedentary behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sedentary behavior will be assessed trough the sitting time (min/day) given by ActivPALTM micro device (PAL Technologies Limited, Glasgow, UK). The device will be attached on anterior mid-line of the participants right thigh though 3MTM TegadermTM Transparent Film Roll (4 in x 11yd). Participants will wear the inclinometer continuously for seven days, including shower and sleep time, except in swimming activities. The ActivPAL3TM software v.7.2.32 will be used to data reduction. In addition to the baseline and follow-up measurements, the inclinometer will be used during the intervention just in school time to better clarify the sit-to-stand desks use.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured though Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL, USA). Participants will be instructed to wear the device on the right rip (near the iliac crest) during waking hours for seven days. The device will be attached via an elastic belt and must will removed only in water-based activities. Will be considered a valid evaluations which had four or more days (including one of weekend) of a minimum of 600 minutes of wear. The Choi et al. [16] criteria of wear time and Evenson et al. [17] cuttoffs to PA intensities will be applicable with 15s epochs (collected at 30Hz) by Actilife v.6.10.4. The participants shall register in daily record the time which the device is removed and the reason.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Academic achievement</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants grades will be obtained in both assessments points. Individual and sum of disciplines grades changes will be considered to comparisons purposes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants self-reported measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Information about self-perception of physical and mental health, academic performance, behaviors (exercise and sleep habits) and social relationship will be assessed by a specific questionnaire for the participants. In addition, the intervention group ones will report their expectations (before) and perceptions (after) of the standing desks use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stakeholders perceptions</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Parents/guardians (individual level) and teachers perceptions (cluster level) about discipline, social interaction, academic performance and health behaviors of the children will be collected by a questionnaire filled before and after the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Considering the costs of classroom environmental adaptations and their effects on primary and secondary outcomes, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will be calculated comparing with costs of a traditional classroom.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function - Coop Corsi block-tapping test</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual-spatial working memory capacity will be assessed through Coop Corsi block-tapping test. A 3 × 3 grid of 9 blocks indicates a spatial sequence by changing the colour of one block at a time, and participants were then asked to repeat that sequence by clicking on the blocks in the same order. During the 12 trials, sequence length increased by 1 block location each time the participant correctly repeated the sequence. Any error in repeating a sequence led to the next sequence being shortened by one location. The variable of interest was mean memory span, calculated as the average length of the three longest correctly repeated sequences.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function - Stroop color test</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity to interference and the ability to suppress an automated response will be assessed using the Stroop color test. The Stroop test consists in two levels. Both levels involve the test word being placed in the center of the screen, with the target and distractor presented randomly on the right or left of the test word. The target position was counterbalanced for the left and right side within each test level. The participant is asked to respond as quickly as possible, using the left and right arrow keys, to identify the position of the target word. The variable of interest is the proportion of correct responses made.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive function - d2 test</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained attention and visual scanning ability will be assessed using the d2 test. This paper-and-pencil task requires participants to detect &quot;d&quot; symbols with two dashes (that may be located either both above, both below, or one above and one below the &quot;d&quot;) among distractors (&quot;d's&quot; with one, three, or four marks or &quot;p's&quot; with one or two marks).
The concentration performance score was determined on the number of correct responses minus errors. Higher scores indicate a better and more stable performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological assessment - Raven's matrices test</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychological assessment will be assessed using the Raven's Progressive Matrices. The test provides a simplified 36-item paper format. Each item contains a pattern problem with one part removed and six pictured inserts of which one contains the correct pattern. Participants point to the pattern piece they select or to its number. The total score is the total number of matrices completed correctly, and the test is thus scored out of 36.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological assessment - Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychological assessment will be assessed using the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test. The Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (ROCF) is a neuropsychological assessment in which participants are asked to reproduce a complicated line drawing, first by copying it freehand (direct), and then drawing from memory (delayed copying). ROCF includes 18 units and the maximum score for each of the two tasks (direct and delayed copying) is 36. Two points are given when the element is correctly reproduced, 1 point when the reproduction is distorted, incomplete but placed properly, or complete but placed poorly; 0.5 point is credited when the element is distorted or incomplete and placed poorly. A zero score is given when the unit is absent or not recognizable.</description>
