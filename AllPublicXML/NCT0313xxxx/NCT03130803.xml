  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep and wakefulness disorders impact 50 to 70 million Americans and insufficient sleep is
      epidemic with over 50% of Americans reporting less than 7 hours of sleep per night. Health
      problems associated with insufficient sleep include inflammation, depression and anxiety,
      diabetes, stress, drug abuse, poor quality of life, obesity, and fatigue related accidents on
      the job/while driving. While the contribution of sleep to overall health, well-being, and
      public safety is recognized, no established clinical biomarkers of sleep deficiency exist.
      Such biomarkers would have utility as road-side biomarkers of sleepiness (e.g., drowsy
      driving), monitoring on the job fatigue/fitness for duty (e.g., transportation, military ops
      health care), monitoring sleep health, as well as for clinical diagnostics and measures of
      clinical treatment outcomes. Thus, investigators designed a controlled laboratory
      insufficient sleep protocol utilizing metabolomics to identify biomarkers of insufficient
      sleep. Investigators propose to identify changes in metabolites that consistently occur
      during insufficient sleep. As an exploratory outcome investigators will examine associated
      changes in metabolites and cognitive performance during insufficient sleep.

      Impaired sleep affects millions of people each year representing an important public health
      issue. This project will utilize metabolomics approaches to identify biomarkers in the blood
      that respond consistently to insufficient sleep. The overall goal of this project is to use a
      discovery and targeted approach to identify specific small molecules in plasma as candidate
      biomarkers of insufficient sleep. Investigators will conduct a controlled in-laboratory
      insufficient sleep protocol where participants receive 2 days of 5 hour sleep opportunities
      per night on 2 separate occasions. Plasma will be collected for metabolomics analyses every 2
      hours (across 24 hours) during scheduled wakefulness at baseline and during insufficient
      sleep. Participants will complete the insufficient sleep protocol twice, separated by 23 days
      of sufficient sleep, to identify which plasma metabolites consistently change during
      insufficient sleep. Investigators anticipate these findings will be the first step in
      establishing validated biomarkers of impaired sleep that will advance our understanding,
      assessment and management of health consequences and symptoms associated with insufficient
      sleep.
