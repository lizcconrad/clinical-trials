      This study evaluated whether physiotherapy is efficient in sputum induction and in evaluation
      of pulmonary inflammation in asthmatic children.

    <textblock>
      The hypertonic saline is a traditional technique to collect induced sputum, it´s safe and
      viable in asthmatic children, as well as the technique of sputum induction and processing has
      been standardized for schoolchildren.

      Sometimes researchers have difficulties to obtain induced sputum in stable patients and it´s
      possible to use physiotherapy maneuvers to induced sputum. The manouvers are safe for adult
      and children asthmatics stable.

      This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness to collect induced sputum by physiotherapy
      maneuvers.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients were randomized in first visits into crossover techniques: (i) hypertonic saline (3%) - HS technique; (ii) physiotherapy techniques (oscillatory positive expiratory pressure, forced expiration and acceleration of expiratory flow) - P technique; (iii) hypertonic saline + physiotherapy techniques - HSP technique. All children attended three visits and 90 samples were collected. All patients underwent induced sputum and pulmonary function before and after bronchodilator.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Sputum induction by physiotherapists maneuvers</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>children were seated in a position where the thorax was inclined forwards by 45°, they were instructed to perform calm and long exhalations by oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) during nonstop 5 minutes holding a Flutter® (Scandipharm, Birmingham, AL, EUA). After that, children were positioned in supine zero degree and underwent for more five minutes to a forced exhalation with the open mouth/glottis (huffing) associated to acceleration by forced expiratory technique (FET), performed by the therapist by positioning a hand on xiphoid process and the other in the manubrium sternum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sputum induction by hypertonic saline 3%</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>children received until four nebulizations with 3% hypertonic saline, the aerosol was generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer (Ultraneb 99; DeVilbiss, Somerset, PA) each challenge was monitored with PEF between nebulizations.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sputum induction by hypertonic saline 3% associated with physiotherapists maneuvers</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Firstly, children underwent sputum induction by hypertonic saline at 3% for seven minutes. Second, they underwent five minutes OPEP and then five minutes of huffing and FET, as described above.</description>
