  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular stimulation might be beneficial for sleep. Previous research demonstrated that
      lateral rocking movements can facilitate the transition from wake to sleep during an
      afternoon nap. However, the relationship between rocking movements and sleep is poorly
      understood to date. Furthermore, studies looking at the effects of rocking on sleep have not
      yet been performed in an elderly population. Due to age related changes in sleep, people
      often experience a decrease in sleep efficiency and sleep quality later in life. Therefore,
      it is particularly this population that could benefit from a possible enhancement in sleep
      efficiency and sleep quality. In order to assess the effect of vestibular stimulation on
      sleep and sleep-dependant memory, measurements of two nights with stimulation will be
      compared to two baseline nights. The primary outcomes are changes in sleep onset, sleep
      architecture and power density spectra of the EEG due to vestibular stimulation. Secondary
      endpoints are sleep dependent changes in memory, the proximal-distal temperature gradient,
      cardiorespiratory variables and dream content.

    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>The study has a two-by-two cross-over design. Participants spend two consecutive baseline nights (without stimulation) and two consecutive movement nights (with stimulation) in the laboratory. The order of baseline and movement nights is randomized.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Basic Science</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Blinding of the participants is impossible, as the stimulation is easy to perceive and cannot be confused with a baseline night. Therefore, participants are informed about the character of the night (max. 5 minutes) before the moment of lights off. For safety reasons the experimenter that is present is also aware of the condition.
However, data is stored in a coded way, so that during data analysis the experimenter is not aware of the condition.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Polysomnography</measure>
    <time_frame>4 nights of 7 hours each</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in sleep parameters between the second of two nights with intervention and the second of two nights without intervention, as recorded using polysomnography. The sleep stages will be scored visually on a 20-s epoch basis according to standard criteria [53]. This will allow us to compare sleep architecture of the participants in the two conditions, as well as a possible consecutive nights effect in the two movement nights. Parameters of specific interest are sleep onset latency, total sleep time, time spent in N1, N2 and N3 stages of NREM sleep and time spent in REM sleep.
Furthermore, the EEG power density spectra will be analysed. Power in specific frequency bands will be calculated based on spectral analysis, the amount and density of sleep spindles and slow waves will be determined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Recall moment in evening and morning (4 nights)</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in declarative memory performance between the second of two nights with intervention and the second of two nights without intervention. During each experimental night a word-pair recall task will be performed 1h before going to bed and half an hour after waking up. To assess declarative memory performance improvement, we will determine the difference between immediate and delayed recall. Word-pair recall tasks are suitable to determine declarative memory performance in the context of sleep, as they are sensitive to effects of sleep.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>4 nights of 7 hours each</time_frame>
    <description>The distal-proximal temperature gradient will be calculated, based on skin temperature measured using sensors placed on the chest and hands, to look for a relationship with sleep onset latency.</description>

    <description>Vestibular stimulation, in the form of gentle rocking movements, is provided using the Somnomat V4 rocking bed. Stimulation is provided for the entire 7 hours of the night from lights off to lights on. The stimulation frequency is in the range of 0.1-0.3 Hz, with an amplitude in the range of 0.05 to 0.1m</description>
