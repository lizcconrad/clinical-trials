    <textblock>
      Telemedically supported paramedic care of acute coronary syndromes was compared to a
      historical control period of solely conventional on-scene physician care. Quality outcomes
      based on current guidelines were researched als well as time requirements in both groups.

      Telemedically supported paramedic care of acute coronary syndromes was compared to a
      historical control period of solely conventional on-scene physician care. Quality outcomes
      based on current guidelines were researched als well as time requirements in both groups. All
      data was collected prospectively for quality management purposes and analyzed retrospectively
      after ethical approval by the local ethics committee.
