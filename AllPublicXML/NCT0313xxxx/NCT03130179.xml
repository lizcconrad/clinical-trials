  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to verify the same effectiveness and safety profile for the test
      product, Nicorette Strongmint lozenge, as for an already approved product, NiQuitin® Minimint
      lozenge (reference product), in a standardized mode. This verification is done in a so-called
      bioequivalence study, which means that the same amount of the same active substance
      (nicotine), in the same dosage form, for the same route of administration, and meeting the
      same or comparable standards is performed.

      During the study visits, blood samples will be drawn to measure the level of the substance in
      the blood to verify that the two products are comparable. Tolerability of the treatments will
      be evaluated based on reported and observed adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-dose, two-period crossover, randomized, fasting, open-label, bioequivalence
      study.

      244 male and female volunteers with a smoking history of minimum 3 months and aged between 18
      and 45 years, inclusive, and motivated to quit will be included. The treatment administration
      order will be randomized with an equal number of subjects in each treatment sequence.

      Single doses of 4 mg Nicorette Strongmint Lozenge (i.e. test product) and 4 mg NiQuitin®
      Minimint Lozenge (i.e. reference product) will be administered in a standardized mode, on two
      separate treatment visits. A washout period of minimum 48 hours will separate the treatment
      administrations.

      An abstinence period of 12 hours including an overnight stay at the clinic is required at
      both treatment occasions.

      Blood for pharmacokinetic analyses will be drawn pre-dose (i.e. within 5 minutes before drug
      administration) and at 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes, as well as 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,
      6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after start of drug administration. Thus, 17 samples will be collected
      per treatment visit.

      Subjects will be monitored to capture any adverse events that may occur.
