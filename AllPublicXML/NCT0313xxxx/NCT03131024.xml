  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doxorubicin and epirubicin are part of the class of chemotherapy agents called anthracyclines
      that are commonly used to treat breast cancer. Although these treatments work well against
      the tumor, they are known to cause damage to the heart muscle, resulting in diminished heart
      function that can be permanent, and may also damage the blood vessels and skeletal muscles.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether short-term application of these
      interventions with specific timing relative to the receipt of each treatment can prevent the
      negative effects of anthracycline treatment on the heart, aorta (largest artery leaving the
      heart), and skeletal muscle, improve quality of life and reduce tumor size. Fifty-six early
      stage breast cancer patients who will receive anthracycline treatment will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 3 groups who will: 1) perform a single 30-minute aerobic exercise session 24
      hours prior to each treatment; 2) eat a diet consisting of 35% less calories for 48 hours
      prior to each treatment; or 3) receive usual cancer care. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      will be used to precisely measure the function of the heart, aorta, and the lower leg
      skeletal muscle at rest, and again during exercise to allow detection of more subtle signs of
      damage. We will also measure exercise capacity (i.e. aerobic fitness), microscopic damage to
      the heart muscle cells, a marker released into the blood in response to anthracycline-related
      heart damage, tumor size in patients receiving chemotherapy before surgery, quality of life
      and fatigue. These measures will be performed before treatment, at the end of treatment and 1
      year later.

      Research Question: Is there a practical, widely available, non-pharmacological intervention
      that can be used to reduce the detrimental effects of anthracycline treatment to improve
      breast cancer patient cardiovascular health, well-being?

      Primary Hypothesis: short-term application of aerobic exercise or caloric restriction prior
      to anthracycline chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer will reduce the detrimental
      effects of anthracyclines on heart, vessels and skeletal muscle.

      Exploratory Hypothesis: these interventions will enhance the anticancer effects of
      anthracyclines and/or reduce the detrimental effects of anthracyclines on health-related
      quality of life.

      Primary Study Aims: to investigate the effect of a single aerobic exercise session performed
      24 hours prior to anthracycline treatment and the effect of 40% caloric restriction for 48
      hours prior to anthracycline treatment relative to usual care control. Specifically, we will
      measure the intervention effects on:

      I) Cardiac structure and function: 1) circulating NT-proBNP (interventions will mitigate
      unwanted increase in this prognostic marker of development of later cardiotoxicity); 2) left
      ventricular ejection fraction reserve (interventions will mitigate unwanted reduction in
      ability to augment heart function with exercise challenge) and 3) cardiac T1 mapping
      (interventions will mitigate unwanted increase in this marker of formation of myocardial
      fibrosis)

      II) Vascular Function: 1) Aortic distensibility (rest and reserve) (interventions will
      mitigate unwanted increase in vascular stiffness)

      III) Skeletal Muscle Function: 1) skeletal muscle oxygen consumption with exercise
      (interventions will mitigate unwanted loss of oxygen consumption at peak exercise and in
      recovery).

      Exploratory Study Aims: to investigate the effects of these interventions relative to the
      control group on: 1) tumor size at end of treatment in neoadjuvant patients (interventions
      will reduce tumor size) and 2) quality of life at end of treatment and one year after
      treatment (interventions will improve quality of life).

      Design and Recruitment:

      This study will be a three-arm randomized control trial of fifty-six early stage breast
      cancer patients receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant anthracycline-containing chemotherapy
      treatment. Following completion of the baseline assessment, participants will randomized to
      one of three groups who will: 1) complete a supervised vigorous intensity aerobic exercise
      session 24 hours prior to each anthracycline treatment; 2) restrict their caloric intake by
      40% for 48 hours prior to each treatment; or 3) control condition receiving oncological usual
      care only. Participants will be recruited via oncologist referral from the Cross Cancer
      Institute.

      Sample Size Determination:

      In our pilot study, the exercise session had a large effect size (Cohen's f=0.454) on the
      NT-proBNP response at 24 hours after the first treatment. Based on this and the sensitivity
      of using both MRI and exercise to elucidate subclinical dysfunction, we expect that our other
      outcomes will have at least a medium effect size (Cohen's f=0.25). Using G*Power Version
      3.0.10 for an F-test with repeated measures and a within-between factor design, a total
      sample size of n=45 total gives &gt;90% power to detect a medium effect size with a 3-group
      design and 3 repeated measures, at p=0.05. It is known that n=15 per group is required to
      detect a 3 percentage point change of resting ejection fraction with cardiac MRI. We will
      enrol n=56 total (n=18-19 per group) to allow for a 20% rate for dropout, death, and
      technical difficulties.

      Statistical Methods:

      Given the longitudinal study design with data collected at 3 time points for each subject, a
      linear mixed model analysis that includes both fixed and random effects, with an intention to
      treat approach will be used. The repeated measures on a single subject result in correlated
      outcome data, and the random effects allow this correlation to be explicitly modeled. An
      additional advantage is that it allows for missing data on a subject without deleting all the
      data for that subject. The model also allows for covariates to be tested and can include time
      varying covariates (e.g. treatments received post anthracyclines). One assumption of mixed
      models is that the residuals from the model are normally distributed. Pilot data indicates
      that this assumption will hold for this study. If that is not the case, a Generalized Linear
      Mixed Model analysis, which can fit other distributions, will be used. All analyses will be
      performed using SPSS 24.0.

      An interim analysis of resting ejection fraction only (standard parameter used to monitor
      cardiotoxicity within oncology practice) will be completed by a paid statistician not
      associated with the study. Resting ejection fraction will be compared between groups after
      completion of the end of treatment assessment for the first thirty participants. A second
      interim analysis will be performed upon suggestion by the statistician.
