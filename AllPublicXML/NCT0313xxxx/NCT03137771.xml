  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well giving maintenance chemotherapy with or
      without stereotactic body radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage IV
      non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in maintenance chemotherapy, such as docetaxel,
      pemetrexed disodium, and gemcitabine work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends
      x-rays directly to the tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage
      to normal tissue. Giving maintenance chemotherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy
      together may work better than maintenance chemotherapy alone in treating patients with stage
      IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Phase II

      To evaluate the impact of adding stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to maintenance
      systemic therapy versus maintenance systemic therapy alone on progression-free survival for
      patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no evidence of progression
      and limited metastatic sites after first-line systemic therapy.

      Phase III

      To evaluate the impact of adding SBRT to maintenance systemic therapy versus maintenance
      systemic therapy alone on overall survival for patients with metastatic NSCLC with no
      evidence of progression and limited metastatic sites after first-line systemic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of adding SBRT to maintenance systemic therapy versus maintenance
      systemic therapy alone on in-field local failure.

      II. To evaluate the impact of adding SBRT to maintenance systemic therapy versus maintenance
      systemic therapy alone on primary failure.

      III. To evaluate the impact of adding SBRT to maintenance systemic therapy versus maintenance
      systemic therapy alone on out-of-field disease progression.

      IV. To evaluate the impact of adding SBRT to maintenance systemic therapy versus maintenance
      systemic therapy alone on toxicity.

      V. To evaluate the impact of adding SBRT to maintenance systemic therapy versus maintenance
      systemic therapy alone on duration of maintenance systemic chemotherapy usage.

      VI. To evaluate the effect of adding SBRT to systemic therapy in limited stage IV NSCLC on
      Quality of Life (QOL)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM 1 (CHEMOTHERAPY ALONE): Patients may receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes
      on Day 1, or gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8. Patients with non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer may receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on Day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2 (SBRT AND CHEMOTHERAPY): Patients undergo SBRT to all sites of metastases (≤3 discrete
      sites) plus irradiation of the primary site (SBRT or hypofractionated RT) followed by
      chemotherapy as in Arm 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

             definitive doses of radiation, these patients would require re-irradiation in previous

          -  Patients with malignant pleural effusions that do not resolve after first-line
             systemic therapy; patients with pleural effusions that have become too small for

             (HAART) and have a CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/microliter within 30 days prior to
