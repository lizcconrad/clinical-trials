  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the predictive value of β2-microspheres for postoperative delirium (POD)
      in the elderly after orthopedic surgery. For this purpose, the levels of β2-microspheres in
      plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were compared between the POD and non-POD groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of the patients were collected to detect the
      levels of β2-microspheres before operation. Also, the patients were interviewed one day
      before the surgery and on postoperative days 1-3 by the Confusion Assessment Method and then
      divided them into POD and non-POD groups. The aim of the present study was to assess whether
      higher levels of β2-microspheres could predict the occurrence of POD.
