  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
      need long term treatments which can conflict with a desire of pregnancy in women.
      Uncontrolled IBD increases the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes [1]. Antitumor Necrosis Factor
      α (antiTNFα) are commonly used, off-label, in pregnancy but with the risk of
      treatment-related complications. Existing recommendations on the use of antiTNFα during
      pregnancy are conflicting and only rely on expert opinions. This study was aimed to assess
      appropriateness and risk to benefit ratio of antiTNFα treatment during pregnancy in women
      with IBD, for both the mother and the baby until the end of the first year.
