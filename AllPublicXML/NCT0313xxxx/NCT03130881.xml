  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I, first-in-human dose-escalation study was conducted to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs),
      pharmacokinetics (PK) profile, and preliminary antitumor activity of PLB1003.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label study of PB1003 administered orally to patients with
      ALK-positive (ALK+) advanced NSCLC. The study includes a Dose-escalation Part (part A) and a
      Dose Expansion Part (part B). The aim of the part A is to estimate the MTD and to identify
      the dose limited toxicity(DLT) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for PLB1003 single
      agent as well as to determine the PK/PD profile. Once response has been observed in certain
      dose level, then followed by the expansion part to further assess the clinical efficacy and
      safety of PLB1003 single agent. Aprox 40 patients will be enrolled in PART A, while 12-24
      patients for expansion cohort .

      PLB1003 is a potent selective ALK inhibitor. PLB1003 acts on cancer by blocking abnormal
      ALK-mediated signaling, leading to profound tumour growth inhibition in xenografts of
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumours.
