      A single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus S-1 (DS) as
      second-line treatment in patients with AGC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with advanced gastric cancer, combination chemotherapy has been shown to improve
      the quality of life and overall survival (OS) compared with best supportive care alone.
      Docetaxel is an active agent for treating patients with gastric cancer. S-1, an oral 5-FU
      prodrug, is active against AGC as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin in phase
      III trials. Therefore, a single-arm phase II study was conducted to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of biweekly docetaxel and S-1 (DS) combination therapy as second-line treatment in
      patients with previously treated advanced gastric cancer.
