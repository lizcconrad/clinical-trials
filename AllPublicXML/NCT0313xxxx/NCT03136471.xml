  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to use a natural experiment design to examine the impacts of the new
      CPT code (99490) for chronic care management on health outcomes. The Investigators will
      collaborate with partners in the Louisiana Clinical Data Research Network (LaCDRN) who serve
      more than 90,000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Louisiana to examine impacts of
      the CMS reimbursed care coordination. Now, LaCDRN is renamed as Research Action for Health
      Network (REACHnet). Patient and stakeholder engagement will be planned and implemented across
      all phases of this natural experiment. This project will examine outcome differences created
      by the policy change in a natural experiment framework. The analyses will utilize the RE-AIM
      framework to identify the critical elements of the programs that will enhance the reach,
      effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of these strategies in the diverse
      LaCDRN diabetes populations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first aim is to evaluate the barriers (e.g., racial and ethnic disparities) and
      facilitators for the RE-AIM dimensions as related to the new CMS chronic care management code
      overall and within each of the health systems. The qualitative study will be used. Focus
      group interview will be conducted among patients, healthcare professionals and stakeholders.
      A variety of qualitative techniques will be used to collect data using key informant
      interviews among organization leaders of LaCDRN partners to assess the organizational
      cultures, their social architecture, resources, capacity, and communication networks.
      Face-to-face semi-structured interviews will be used to explore these domains, assess
      barriers, and refine the data collection for the assessing the RE-AIM framework. Further,
      semi-structured interviews will provide data to inform the refinement of study outcomes and
      ensure organizational, cultural, and health-literacy appropriateness. Focus groups will be
      audiotaped with the written consent of each participant, and each tape will be transcribed
      verbatim and transcripts will be reviewed and edited by the facilitators for accuracy.
      Inter-coder reliability will be examined. Interview transcripts will be imported into NVivo
      10 software (QSR International, Burlington, MA). Codes and concepts identified in preliminary
      review will be refined, extended, and cross-referenced. Coded texts will be structured into
      taxonomies and transformed into a matrix format so that responses and concepts can be
      compared across respondent groups. Finally, taxonomies and matrices will be summarized by
      similarities and contrasts to form overarching themes and dimensions. We will use an
      iterative technique until theoretical saturation, the point at which no additional major
      themes emerge, is reached. Diabetes care coordination readiness assessment will be conducted
      with LaCDRN partner health system's medical directors (organizational).

      The second aim is the health and economic impacts of the CMS care coordination reimbursement
      to improve health outcomes: glycemic control, CVD risk reduction, medication adherence,
      patient-reported outcomes (PRO), and health care utilization. Data extraction from the
      Louisiana Clinical Data Research Network (LaCDRN). De-identified data from EMR includes birth
      year, gender, race, state of residency, medical history, lab results and prescriptions. All
      data comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

      This proposed research is significant because it is the first natural experiment to test an
      ongoing CMS reimbursement policy on diabetes care in Louisiana. The study questions and study
      outcomes will be patient-centered, and will generate urgently needed data on effective,
      practical, and sustainable population-targeted strategies aimed at reducing diabetes-related
      disease burden in Medicare-eligible populations. Further dissemination and scale-up efforts
      will create large return on multiple health systems and non-CMS populations.
