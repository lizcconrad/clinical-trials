  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual disorders associated with medical aid for procreation have already been demonstrated
      in several studies. However, few of them are interested in the problem of patients in charge
      of donating gametes, and if studied, it is often restricted to donating sperm to a small
      number of patients. For this reason, it would be interesting to study the impact of the
      intake and in charge and the treatments of the Medical Aid to the Procreation on this
      population of patients (including the patients treated in donation of sperm but also Those
      supported in oocyte donation)
