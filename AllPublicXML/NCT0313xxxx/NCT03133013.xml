  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the ability of a brainwave measurement device
      (SLEEPSCOPE) in identifying and assisting in the diagnosis of depression. The brainwave data
      from individuals with untreated depression and healthy participants will be collected and
      analyzed. The ability to obtain brainwave data from individuals in their homes while they're
      sleeping would represent a significant advance in depression research.

      The purpose of study is to collect and analyze human sleeping brainwave data, to better
      understand depression in humans.

      First visit:

        -  Informed consent procedures, including explanation of research background, purpose,
           details of implementation, and study benefits and risks

        -  Interview with questionnaires (MINI International Psychiatric Interview, Hamilton Rating
           Scale for Depression, Beck Depression Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire for
           Depression [PHQ-9]), physical examination.

        -  Urine drug sample for screening of controlled substances.

        -  Inform participants that those qualifying will be informed whether or not to proceed
           with second visit

      Second visit:

        -  Explanation of EEG measurement (placement of two electrodes, one on the forehead and one
           behind the ear)

        -  Sleep diary provided for participant to complete at home for each night until third
           visit

        -  Distribution of EEG devices for home use

        -  EEG measurement conducted at participant's residence for three nights of stable
           sleep-wake cycles

      Third visit:

      - Collect EEG devices and check completeness of downloaded data
