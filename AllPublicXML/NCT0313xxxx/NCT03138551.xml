  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility and preliminary effects of the Mealtime PREP
      (Promoting Routines of Exploration and Play) intervention package for young children with
      Sensory Food Aversions and their parents.

      This pilot study will collect rich data from twenty participants on the feasibility and
      effects of a novel intervention, the Mealtime PREP, which has a dyadic focus on both the
      young child and the parent participants. The investigators will collect video recorded child
      meals in the home during a baseline period (under normal circumstances), during
      parent-training (while parents are practicing skills learned), and following parent training
      (when therapist support is withdrawn). This in depth examination of child meals will provide
      valuable information to guide the optimization of this intervention approach for future
      trials.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Child must meet all criteria of the diagnosis of Sensory Food Aversions

               1. The child consistently refuses to eat specific foods with specific
                  tastes/textures and/or smells.

               2. Onset of food refusal occurs during the introduction of a novel type of food
                  (e.g., the child may drink one type of milk but refuse another, may eat carrots
                  but refuse green beans, may drink milk but refuse baby food).

               3. The child eats without difficulty when offered preferred foods.

               4. The food refusal causes specific nutritional deficiencies or delay of oral motor
                  development.

          -  Parent is able to read, write, speak and understand English.
