  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a frequent and severe complication of hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (HSC), and is responsible for significant early mortality despite
      prophylactic strategies developed in recent decades, Especially since it is resistant to
      first-line treatment.

      The present diagnosis is difficult, non-specific and is based on the combination of an
      evocative clinical context (CSH allograft, time to appearance before J100, characteristic
      clinical manifestations), suggestive anatomo-pathological analysis (predominantly
      inflammatory infiltrate Lymphocyte, mucosal edema and presence of apoptotic bodies), and the
      exclusion of any differential diagnosis (in particular serology / negative viral PCR).

      However, to date there is no molecular characterization of this manifestation, and therefore
      no specific treatment.

      The nCounter® nanostring technology allows the rapid and simple analysis of the simultaneous
      expression of a group of genes (up to 800 on the same sample), from a very small amount of
      RNA, and from samples with difficulty Such as fabrics already fixed to formaldehyde and
      included in paraffin. It allows the detection of a &quot;molecular signature&quot; of the tissue
      analyzed.

      No transcriptomic analysis has ever been performed on human tissues with GVHD.

          -  Patients who have received an HSC allograft since June 2012

          -  Having presented a suspicion of cutaneous or digestive GVHD before J100 post-allograft

          -  Of which the diagnosis was retained by the combination of clinical and histological
             criteria

          -  Or whose diagnosis has been reversed by histological analysis, for the reactive /
             inflammatory biopsies that serve as control

          -  The diagnosis of which was made between 01/01/2013 and 31/12/2015

          -  Survived at least 1 month to monitor clinical progress

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Whose biopsy specimens were also the sites of a viral reactivation (EBV, CMV, HHV)
             that could mimic a GVHD

          -  Having survived less than 1 month after the diagnosis of GVHD
