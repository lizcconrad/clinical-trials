      A multicenter,randomized,single-blind, placebo-controlled,phase 4 clinical trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of andrographolide sulfonate in patients with acute exacerbation of
      chronic bronchitis

    <textblock>
      The patient after passing the screening, with the ratio of 1:1, were randomly assigned to
      experimental group or control group. Experimental group: on the basis of Conventional
      Therapy,Xiyanping injection(andrographolide sulfonate) 10-20ml/d, With 0.9% normal saline
      100ml-250ml diluted intravenous drip (not with other drugs in the same container mixed use),
      control drip speed per minute of 30-40 drops. control group: on the basis of Conventional
      Therapy,Xiyanping injection simulation(0.9% normal saline) 10-20ml/d, The treatment method is
      the same as the experimental group.
