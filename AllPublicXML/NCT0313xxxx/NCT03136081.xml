  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is associated with acquired immunoparalysis which is associated with a high risk
      of nosocomial acquired infection. Nosocomial candidiasis is associated with a 50% rate of
      mortality but is difficult to diagnose. The use of colonization indexes and risk factors on
      the other hand expose to unnecessary use of antifungals. The aim of the present study is to
      evaluate whether the host response to infection associated with candida biomarkers would help
      to anticipate the candidiasis onset.

      Single center prospective observationnal study. Inclusion: all consecutive patients
      subsequently to a septic shock with no Candida infection.

      Measured parameters: host response (HLADR, CD64, inflammatory cytokines consecutive to LPS
      exposition) and Candida biomarkers (beta D Glucan, Mannan Ag and Ig), demographics, outcome
      (occurence of Candida nosocomial infection, morbidity and survival)

    <description>The realized analyses will be two types:
1/an immunological analysis that is the characterization of the capacities of defense against germs and 2/a search(research) of Candida by microscopic examination and culture on circles of growth but also the research for the genome of the mushroom by a state-of-the-art technique of the laboratory of mycology ( PCR). Usual takings of research for bacteria.</description>

      It will be simply about additional tubes taken during the taking of the day blood, usually
      realized on the catheter thus without pain nor risk of bruise. We also préleverons one sample
      of urine every 2 days for analysis of laboratory.
