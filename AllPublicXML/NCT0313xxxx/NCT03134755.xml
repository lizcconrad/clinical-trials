    <textblock>
      This study aims to first determine whether high child stress leads to reduced response to
      common treatmenIs for asthma (inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting bronchodilators), and
      then to identify DNA methylation differences leading to stress-induced treatment resistance
      among children with asthma.

    <textblock>
      Puerto Rican (PR) children share a disproportionate burden from asthma in the U.S. The
      investigators have demonstrated that in PR children, a variety of psychological stressors
      -including physical or sexual abuse, exposure to violence, and parental psychopathology- are
      associated with worse asthma outcomes. Puerto Rican children also have reduced response to
      bronchodilators (short-acting inhaled β2-agonists, the most commonly used medication for
      asthma worldwide). The investigators have recently shown that high child stress is associated
      with reduced response to short-acting inhaled β2-agonists (bronchodilator response or BDR) in
      PR children with asthma, and our preliminary results also implicate genetic and epigenetic
      (DNA methylation) variation in genes involved in stress responses (e.g., ADCYAP1R1) on asthma
      and BDR. Moreover, external in vitro experiments show that high stress leads to reduced
      expression of the genes for the β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) and the glucocorticoid
      receptor (NR3C1) in white blood cells of children with asthma. While it is known that stress
      reduces BDR, it is not known whether this can be prevented by treatment with inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS), or whether stress reduces response to ICS in vivo. Moreover, the
      research community has very limited knowledge of the genetic or epigenetic mechanisms
      underlying treatment resistance in stressed children. On the basis of novel preliminary
      results, the investigators hypothesize that chronic stress reduces response to inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) and BDR in PR children with asthma, and that these effects are mediated
      by altered methylation of genes regulating responses to stress, corticosteroids and BDR. To
      test this hypothesis, the investigators will first determine whether increased stress leads
      to reduced response to ICS or BDR (even after treatment with ICS) in 300 PR children with
      asthma (Aim 1). The investigators will then test for association between high child stress
      and genome-wide DNA methylation in respiratory (nasal) epithelium in 550 Puerto Rican
      children with asthma (Aim 2). Next, the investigators will examine whether methylation
      changes in the top 100 genes identified in Aim 2 are associated with response to ICS or BDR
      in 300 to 550 PR children with asthma (Aim 3a). Finally, the investigators will assess the
      effects of methylation changes identified in Aim 3a on gene expression (Aim 3b). This
      proposal should determine whether and how psychosocial stress leads to reduced response to
      common treatments for asthma control (ICS) and relief of asthma symptoms (short-acting
      inhaled β2-agonists) in a high-risk group (Puerto Rican children).
