      Evaluation of the impact of initiation of protease inhibitor/ritonavir on PCSK9 levels in
      HIV-infected antiretroviral-naïve patients from the ANRS C09 COPANA cohort.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: HIV-infected subjects are at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) partly in
      relation with atherogenic dyslipidemia including increased triglycerides (TG) and
      LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). Mechanisms of HIV-associated dyslipidemia are complex, involving HIV
      itself and some antiretrovirals (ARV), particularly protease inhibitors (PI/r). Elevated
      proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) level is associated with increased LDL-C in
      the general population. How PCSK9 level is regulated in HIV-infected treated patients has
      never been investigated.

      Objectives: We aimed to identify factors associated with circulating PCSK9 concentration in
      ART-naïve and treated patients and to evaluate the impact of 1st line ARV therapy (ART)
      comprising a PI/r, on PCSK9 level in HIV-infected patients.

      Methods: Fasting plasma concentrations of PCSK9 were measured using ELISA assay in
      HIV-infected individuals from the ANRS COPANA cohort, at ART initiation and after one year of
      PI/r-based therapy without any disruption. Subjects not virologically suppressed at
      follow-up, or taking any lipid lowering therapies at baseline or during follow-up were
      excluded. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to determine the association between
      PCSK9 levels and metabolic parameters at baseline and under PI/r.

      ELISA Cyclex.

      Plasma PCSK9 concentrations assayed in triplicates using a quantitative sandwich ELISA assay
      and following the manufacturer instructions (Circulex CY-8079, CycLex Co, Nagano, Japan).

      The ELISA kit relies on a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique with inter- and
      intraplate CVs of 2.9-7.3% and 1.5-2.6%, respectively.
