  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unintended and closely spaced pregnancies are a major public health problem that affects not
      only the individuals directly involved but also the society indirectly. It increases the
      risks of infants with adverse outcomes such as preterm, low birth weight and small for
      gestational age. Pregnancy occurring within six months of the last delivery holds a 7.5-fold
      increased risk for induced abortion, a 3.3-fold increase in miscarriage and a 1.6-fold
      increased risk of stillbirth. But, use of contraceptive methods has been shown to reduce
      unwanted pregnancy, high fertility and maternal mortality rates.
