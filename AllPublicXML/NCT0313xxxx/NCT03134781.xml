  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators utilized a novel hybrid HIIT (high intensity interval
      training) exercise training approach, the Fun and Functional Interval Training (FFIT) workout
      that combines interval training, resistance exercise training and functional training in
      order to test the hypothesis that FFIT will be able to: i) reduce body mass, ii) improve body
      composition and iii) alter energy balance, of previously inactive, overweight/obese women.

    <textblock>
      In a controlled randomized, two-group, repeated measures design, 65 healthy, sedentary,
      premenopausal overweight or obese women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (a) a
      control group (C, N=21) that participated only in measurements, (b) a training group (TR,
      N=14) that participated in a supervised 40-week FFIT workout exercise training program and
      (c) a training-detraining group (TRD, N=14). During the first 20 weeks, TR and TRD followed
      exactly the same training protocol. At the end of this period, TR continued training for 20
      more weeks whereas TRD terminated training for 20 weeks (detraining). Anthropometric,
      metabolic, daily nutritional intake, habitual physical activity and performance measurements
      were performed in all groups at baseline, at 20 weeks and 40 weeks.
