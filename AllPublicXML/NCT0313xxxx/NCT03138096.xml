  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the underlying study, a genetically modified P. berghei parasite is used. P. berghei is
      one of the four Plasmodium species that causes malaria in rodents. The hypothesis is that
      immunization of humans with P. berghei will induce a cross-species immune response without
      the risk of a breakthrough infection. To further increase the potential for protective
      efficacy, the P. falciparum circumsporozoite (CS)- protein gene has been integrated in the P.
      berghei parasite, generating a genetically modified P. berghei parasite, abbreviated as
      Pb(PfCS@UIS4).
