    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed consent form should be issued prior to conducting any research process;

          2. Men or women aged 18-75 years;

          3. Patients with advanced and / or metastatic colorectal cancer confirmed by histology or
             cytology;

          4. Patients who has not exposed to apatinib previously and had received oxaliplatin
             combined with fluorouracil chemotherapy;

          5. The estimated survival time is longer than 3 months;

          6. ECOG score was 0 or 1;

          7. According to the RECIST v1.1 guidance, at least 1 lesion(who had not received
             radiotherapy) showed that the longest diameter≥10mm(except for lymph node, the short
             axis of the lymph node must be≥15mm) through CT or MRI(intravenous contrast agent was
             preferred ) accurate measurement and the lesion should be suitable for repeatable and
             accurate measurement; the lesion located in the previously irradiated area can be used
             as a measurable lesion if the lesion was proved in progress;

          8. With sufficient organ and bone marrow function, defined as follows:

               -  Hb≥9 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.0 × 109 /L

               -  Platelet count≥75 × 109 /L

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN, which would not be appropriate for patients with
                  Gilbert syndrome (Persistent or recurrent hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated
                  bilirubin, with no evidence of hemolysis or abnormal liver pathology) which can
                  consult a doctor

               -  ALT&amp;AST ≤ 2.5 × ULN; for patients with liver metastases, ALT&amp;AST ≤ 5 × ULN
                  Calculate the creatinine clearance rate by Cockcroft-Gault formula

               -  Creatinine clearance rate measured( by actual body weight) or by measuring urine
                  collection for 24 hours&gt; 40 mL/min(the value of the measurement of the 24 - hour
                  urine collection will be used to determine eligibility if the two methods are
                  used)

          9. Women of childbearing age must have a pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 7 days
             before inclusion, the results should be negative and they are willing to use the
             appropriate methods of contraception during the trial and within 6 months of the last
             experimental drug administration. Men should agree to use appropriate methods of
             contraception during the trial and within 6 months of the last experimental drug
             administration;

         10. Patients volunteered to participate in the trial and signed informed consent form with
             good compliance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with hypertension and can not be reduced to the normal range with
             antihypertensive drugs(systolic pressure &gt;140 mmHg / diastolic pressure &gt; 90
             mmHg),patients with coronary heart disease more than grade II, arrhythmia (including
             QTc interval Prolongation men＞450 ms, women ＞470 ms) and cardiac insufficiency;

          2. With a variety of factors affecting oral drugs(such as unable to swallow, nausea and
             vomiting, chronic diarrhea and intestinal obstruction, etc.);

          3. Special note: patients with the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding can not be included,
             including the following: active peptic ulcer lesions and fecal occult blood (+ +);
             patients with melena and hematemesis in 3 months; for patients with fecal occult blood
             (+) and primary gastric tumor without surgery should be carried out gastroscopy,
             patients with ulcero carcinoma of stomach and believed to cause the lesion to bleed by
             the physician;

          4. Abnormal coagulation function(INR&gt;1.5×ULN、 APTT&gt;1.5×ULN) with bleeding tendency;

          5. With Symptomatic central nervous system metastasis;

          6. Pregnant or lactating women;

          7. Other patients unsuitable for inclusion considered by the physician.
