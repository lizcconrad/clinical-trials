  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of disease-targeted drugs for the treatment of pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH) has significantly improved within the last years. Combining drug products
      with different mechanisms of action such as Endothelin-Receptor-Antagonists (ERAs) and
      Phosphodiesterase-Type-5-inhibitors (PDE-5-Inhibitors) has become increasingly important for
      the treatment of PAH. Recently, the results of the AMBITION study reported that an upfront
      combination treatment of ambrisentan and tadalafil immediately after diagnosis leads to a
      delayed disease progression. On the other hand, the sequential combination of bosentan and
      sildenafil did not show a similar positive clinical effect and this was attributed to a
      negative clinically relevant pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction. Although, recent
      guidelines have extrapolated that initial upfront combination treatment follows a class
      effect in terms of efficacy and safety, there is an imperative need to support this notion
      with other combinations of ERAs and PDE-5-Inhibitors.

      The primary objective of BOTA study is to compare the change in clinical and hemodynamic
      measures of PAH after the initiation of first line combination therapy with bosentan and
      tadalafil in adult patients with PAH. The safety and tolerability of first line combination
      therapy will also be evaluated.

      In patients with PAH initial upfront combination treatment with bosentan and tadalafil

        1. Improves

             -  Exercise capacity as expressed by distance walked in six minute walk test and WHO
                functional class

             -  Hemodynamics in terms of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), mean pulmonary artery
                pressure (mPAP) reduction and cardiac index (CI) elevation

             -  Quality of life

             -  NTproBNP serum levels

             -  Echocardiographic prognostic parameters such as right atrial area and presence of
                pericardial effusion.

        2. Is safe as assessed by

             -  Liver function markers such as serum SGOT and SGPT levels

             -  Hemoglobin levels

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP) is a surrogate marker of heart failure. The geometric mean ratio will be calculated as the ratio between the month 6 value and the Baseline value and presented as percent change = 100 * (geometric mean ratio - 1). The Baseline value is the last value prior to administration of study drug; this may be prior to or on the day of study drug initiation.</description>
