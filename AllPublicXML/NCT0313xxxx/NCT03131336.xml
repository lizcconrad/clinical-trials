    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and safety of a new peptide-based
      coagulant, PeproStat. The study drug will be applied to patients undergoing liver/soft tissue
      surgery, vascular surgery or spine surgery. The speed of action of the new coagulant, that is
      applied with a gelatin sponge, will be compared to the same sponge but with saline (a
      commonly used standard of care).

  <detailed_description>

      PeproStat is a new class of topical haemostatic agent composed of recombinant human albumin
      (rHA) conjugated with fibrinogen-binding peptides. The conjugate polymerises fibrinogen into
      a fibrin-like clot without the need for thrombin.

      PeproStat is formulated in a liquid, and is soaked into a haemostatic gelatin sponge in the
      operating theatre, and applied directly to the site of bleeding. The gelatin sponge
      (Spongostan ) is an approved &quot;passive&quot; haemostat i.e., PeproStat is an adjunct to a passive
      haemostat.

      The study is designed in a 2:1 randomization (verum:placebo) to investigate the efficacy in
      terms of Time to hemostasis, mean (mTTH) at the primary target bleed site (TBS), measured in
      minutes (min) from the start of treatment application (TxStart) at the TBS to the achievement
      of hemostasis at that site or to the end of the 10-minute assessment period if hemostasis has
      not yet been achieved.

             Intraoperative:

          7. The subject presents an identified target bleeding site with mild or moderate
             bleeding, which conventional surgical techniques are insufficient to control or are
             inappropriate and would otherwise be a candidate for standard haemostats.

          8. The subject presents no intraoperative complications, other than bleeding, that may
             interfere with study assessments as judged by the Investigator.

          9. The subject presents no contaminated areas of the body, signs of infection or abscess
             development.

         10. Total target bleeding site surface area of ≤ 70 cm2, defined within one or two TBSs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is undergoing emergency surgical procedure.

          2. Use of study treatment and sponge in

               -  Closure of skin incisions as the sponge may interfere with the healing of skin
                  edges.

               -  Intravascular compartments because of the risk of embolization following sponge
                  application.

          3. Recipient of an organ transplant.

          4. Haematologic, biochemistry and coagulation panel thresholds at screening:

               -  Platelet count ≤100,000/mm3 (≤ 100 x 109/L).

               -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 2.0 or activated Partial Thromboplastin
                  Time (aPTT) ratio &gt; 2.0.

               -  Fibrinogen level &lt; 1.5 g/L.

               -  Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3 times the
                  upper limit normal range, except for subjects undergoing liver resection surgery
                  where there is no upper limit for these analytes due to the nature of their
                  disease.

          5. Severe renal failure.

          6. Any other disease or condition that may affect normal blood clotting, for example
             thrombocytopenia, as judged by the Investigator.

          7. A known history of anaphylaxis or allergic reaction to human albumin, PEGylated
             proteins, yeast or moulds, porcine products or other components in the study
             medication or sponge.

          8. Participation in another investigational drug or device research study within 30 days
             before and after enrolment in the current study.

          9. Current known or suspected alcohol and/or drug abuse or dependence at the time of
             screening.

         10. Any concurrent medical, surgical, or psychiatric condition that may, in the
             Investigator's opinion, affect the subject's willingness or ability to meet all study
             requirements during the study duration.

         11. Known HIV, Hepatitis B virus or Hepatitis C Virus infection.

         12. During the surgery, subject presents severe bleeding where use of a topical haemostat
             would be inappropriate.

         13. Anti-platelets/oral anticoagulants treatment:

               1. Soft tissue/liver and neurosurgery: Subject is taking anti-platelet agents or
                  oral anticoagulants within 7 days of surgery

               2. Vascular surgery: Subject is taking dual anti-platelet treatment or oral
                  anticoagulants within 7 days of surgery. One anti-platelet agent is allowed
                  perioperatively.

         14. Heparin treatment:

             c. Soft tissue/liver and neurosurgery only: Subject is receiving therapeutic doses of
             heparin perioperatively. Only prophylactic Low Molecular Weight Heparin is allowed.
