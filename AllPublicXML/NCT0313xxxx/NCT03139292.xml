  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparison of two different supraglottic airway devices i.e., the ProSeal Laryngeal Mask
      Airway (PLMA) and Ambu AuraGain, a third generation laryngeal mask Airway.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare the two devices with respect to:

      Time taken for insertion. Insertion attempts or failed attempt. Oropharyngeal leak pressure
      Air leak Time taken to pass an orogastric tube Attempts to pass an orogastric tube or failed
      attempt. Haemodynamic variation Incidence of adverse events like failed insertion,
      aspiration-regurgitation, hypoxia (SpO2&lt; 90%), bronchospasm, airway obstruction, gastric
      insufflation, coughing, gagging, retching, hiccup, coughing during removal, blood staining of
      the airway device and trauma to tongue, lip, teeth, or gums.

    <description>Intracuff and the oropharyngeal leak pressures after ensuring effective placement. These pressures will be determined by closing the expiratory valve of the circle system at a fresh gas flow of 3 l/min, note the airway pressure (maximum allowed: 40 cm H2O) at which equilibrium was reached.</description>
