  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to determine whether it is acceptable to patients with a diagnosis
      of multiple myeloma (a type of blood cancer that can cause bone weakness, pain and fatigue)
      to be offered and attend an exercise group before receiving an autologous stem cell
      transplantation (being given back one's own stem cells, following receipt of intensive
      chemotherapy, to enable bone marrow to start producing blood cells again). Exercise has been
      shown to be effective in reducing many of the side effects of myeloma and the treatment
      patients receive to manage the disease. Prehabilitation i.e. providing an intervention after
      diagnosis but before treatment begins has been effective in reducing the severity of side
      effects of treatment in cancer patients receiving surgery. No evidence exists for its use in
      patients with myeloma. Patients awaiting transplantation will be provided with information
      regarding the study and invited to join. Patients who agree to take part will attend the
      hospital for an assessment of their exercise capability and to complete one set of four
      questionnaires. They will receive an exercise booklet, advice and complete one attempt at
      their exercise programme under supervision of a physiotherapist. Patients will be requested
      to attend the gym for a minimum of six further weeks to complete their exercise programme.
      Patients will complete a repeat set of questionnaires and a repeat walking test six weeks
      after the first, on admission to hospital for their transplant and on the day they leave
      hospital. Some patients will be invited to discuss their opinions of the exercise programme
      and how useful they felt it was to them in preparing for their transplant. If the study shows
      that the exercise programme is acceptable to patients and we can recruit enough patients to
      test it in a larger trial, the investigators will apply for further funding.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients will have a diagnosis of multiple myeloma and assigned to the autologous
             transplantation waiting list for either a first or second transplant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of unstable angina or a heart attack in the previous month to allow safe
             completion of the six minute walk test.

          -  Medical stability is a pre-requisite for transplantation so no patients would be
             excluded on this basis.
