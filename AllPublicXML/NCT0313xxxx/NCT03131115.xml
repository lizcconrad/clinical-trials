  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral nasal wall insufficiency is a source of nasal obstruction which plagues many people
      as the sidewall of the nose collapses due to negative pressure and structural weaknesses of
      the nose. Bone anchored suture suspension is used by many surgeons to treat it, and involves
      anchoring the nasal sidewall to the bony rim below the eye. Lateral crura strut graft is
      another well described and universally used technique involves strengthening lateral crus of
      lower lateral cartilage of the nose with piece of cartilage. This study aims to compare the
      two well known and universally used treatments to each other. Based on expert opinions these
      procedures are both safe and efficient but given lack of randomized clinical trials comparing
      these 2 techniques, it is difficult to extrapolate which procedure is superior.

      Patients with lateral nasal wall collapse who are eligible for surgical repair will be
      presented with the opportunity to participate. Once consented, standard pre-operative
      evaluation will be performed including evaluation of degree of lateral nasal wall collapse.
      They will also be screened with validated quality of life screening tools for nasal
      congestion, which include the NOSE scale and a visual analog scale. They will then be
      randomized to treatment either with Lateral crura strut graft or bone anchored suture
      suspension, in combination with likely other areas of functional rhinoplasty such as
      septoplasty and turbinate reduction. All of our patients will be seen 1 week, 2-3 month and 1
      year after surgery
