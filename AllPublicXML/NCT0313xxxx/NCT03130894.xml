  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The association of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a microbiota dependent
      metabolite from dietary choline and carnitine, with type 2 diabetes was inconsistent.

      Objective: The investigators planned to investigate the association between plasma TMAO and
      newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes as well as whether the association could be modified by the
      TMAO-generating enzyme flavin monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) polymorphisms.

      Design: This is an age- and sex-matched case-control study of 2694 participants: 1346 newly
      diagnosed cases of type 2 diabetes and 1348 controls. The patients of newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetes were consecutively recruited from those attending for the first time the outpatient
      clinics of Department of Endocrinology, Tongji Medical College Hospital, Wuhan, China, from
      2012 January to December 2014. Concomitantly, the investigators recruited healthy individuals
      who were frequency-matched by age (±5 years) and sex to patients from an unselected
      population undergoing a routine health check-up in the same hospital. The inclusion criteria
      for controls and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were: age ≥ 30 years, body mass index (BMI)
      &lt; 40 kg/m2, no history of a diagnosis of diabetes and no history of receiving pharmacological
      treatment for hyperlipidaemia or hypertension. Patients with clinically significant
      neurological, endocrinological or other systemic diseases, as well as acute illness or
      chronic inflammatory or infective diseases, were excluded from the study. All the
      participants enrolled were of Chinese Han ethnicity. All the participants gave informed
      written consent to the study and did not take any medication known to affect glucose
      tolerance or insulin secretion before participation. The study was approved by the ethics
      committee of the Tongji Medical College. Concentrations of plasma TMAO were measured, and
      FMO3 E158K polymorphism (rs2266782) were genotyped.
