    <textblock>
      This study tested the effects of emotion regulation strategies (reappraisal, reassurance, and
      empathy) on pain responses in children with cancer. Children with cancer were randomly
      assigned to one emotion regulation strategy during an experimental pain task (the cold
      pressor task [CPT]). During the CPT, children rated their pain and provided saliva samples
      immediately before, after, and then 15 minutes after the CPT. This study examined the
      influence of emotion regulation on self-reported pain and physiological activity assessed
      through saliva samples.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 12,000 children are diagnosed with cancer in the United States each year and the
      majority of these children will experience pain throughout their illness. Children with
      cancer are required to undergo repeated invasive medical procedures, including bone marrow
      aspirations (BMA) and lumbar punctures (LP), which have been described by children as the
      most distressing and painful aspect of their illness. The experience and memory of procedural
      pain can have a lasting effect and impact distress in future procedures; children learn to
      anticipate pain and show increased distress and decreased cooperation at subsequent
      procedures. Moreover, childhood medical distress has also been linked to adults' reports of
      pain and fear around medical events and even avoidance of future health care. Early painful
      procedures have also been associated with behavioral changes to medical events later in life,
      a finding that is supported by recent physiological evidence indicating that activation of
      the pain processing system in the brain can change neuropathways, which leads to increased
      sensitivity to later stimulation of pain systems. Therefore, it is vital to develop
      strategies to minimize the pain and distress that children undergo through cancer treatment
      and understanding the impact of children's memory on pain is a crucial step in this process.

      To address this important need, this study involved identifying the strategies that children
      use to cope with distress that promote positive memories of medical events, examining how
      these strategies impact their immediate physiology (via salivary biomarkers) and
      self-reported pain, and understanding how these coping strategies change children's distress
      over time during future medical procedures. Specifically, certain coping strategies change
      the way that children interpret stressful medical procedures, which affects the emotional
      response to future procedures. These objectives were accomplished by the following specific
      aims:

      Aim 1: Identify emotion-regulation (i.e., coping) strategies that promote more positive
      memories of distressing medical procedures in children with cancer.

      Aim 2: Assess the impact of emotion-regulation strategies on children's distress response to
      painful procedures over time.

      This project will provide specific means for impacting children's pain and distress during
      medical procedures. Specifically, because the emotion regulation strategies described in this
      protocol are modifiable and teachable, they provide direct implications for clinical practice
      in pain management by identifying strategies that can decrease children's pain and anxiety
      throughout their course of cancer treatment.

    <description>Time of hand removal from the cold pressor task was recorded and used to operationally define pain tolerance with longer durations reflecting greater pain tolerance.

    <description>Children were asked to report their pain when they removed their hand from the water using a numeric rating scale (NRS). Children ages 6 through 11 were asked &quot;How much is it hurting right now?&quot; on a scale of &quot;Not hurting&quot; = 0 to &quot;Hurting a whole lot&quot; = 10. Children 12 to 18 were asked &quot;How much pain are you in right now?&quot; on a scale of &quot;No Pain at All&quot; = 0 to &quot;A Lot of Pain&quot; = 10.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children between the ages of 6-18 years who were currently undergoing outpatient
             treatment for cancer and who could speak, read, and write in English or Spanish were
             eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cognitive impairment, such as a developmental delay or mental retardation that would
             prevent children from participating in the experimental pain task.

          -  Children whose medical status require inpatient hospitalization or otherwise signify
             health complications that would prevent participation will not be recruited.
             Accordingly, all potential participants will be obtained via consultation with the
             Attending Oncology physician and/or nursing team.

          -  Following safety guidelines, participants will be excluded if they have a cut or sore
             on their non-dominant hand, have high blood pressure, or have a history of upper
             extremity vascular disease, cardiovascular disorder, fainting, seizures, frostbite, or
             chronic pain (pain lasting for more than 4 months).

          -  Because cortisol measures will be taken, participants will be asked to refrain from
             eating 1 hour before the experiment, as this can affect cortisol sample readings. In
             addition, because oral contraceptives can impact cortisol, participants taking hormone
             medications will be excluded from participation.
