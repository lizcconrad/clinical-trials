    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance and subject's preference
      out of three LRE (Limbal Ring Enhancing) lens types: enfilcon A (Johnson&amp;Johnson),
      methafilcon A (Interozzo), and methafilcon A (CooperVision).

      This will be a subject-masked, bilateral, randomized, crossover dispensing study to compare
      clinical performance and subjective preference out of three lens types. Sixty subjects will
      be assigned into three groups and each group will wear the test and control lenses as matched
      pairs for one week in random order. Lenses will be worn on a daily wear, daily disposable
      schedule.
