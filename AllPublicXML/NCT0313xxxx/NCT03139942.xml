    <textblock>
      Small growths detected in the colon (polyps) during a colonoscopy may or may not have the
      potential to develop into cancer. However, since visual inspection alone cannot separate all
      potentially harmful polyps from harmless ones, the standard approach is to remove them all
      for histological lab examination, exposing patients to risk of injury and putting a
      significant demand on hospital resources. An accurate method of determining polyp type during
      endoscopy would enable the clinician to only remove potentially harmful polyps. A new
      endoscopic optical imaging probe (OPTIC), which analyses how light interacts with tissue, is
      proposed to do this. The probe is contained within a normal endoscope and uses white light
      and blue/violet laser light to illuminate the tissue. The reflected and fluorescent light
      emitted, along with normal colour pictures of the polyp surface, are measured and recorded to
      quantify specific characteristics of each type. Optical measurements of polyps detected in
      endoscopy clinics at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust will be analysed to determine if
      the signal can be used to differentiate different polyp types.

    <textblock>
      Polyps detected during a colonoscopy may range from benign to precancerous and cancerous.
      While experienced endoscopists can reliably recognise cancer, the difference between small
      polyps that have the potential to develop into cancer (adenomas) and those that do not
      (hyperplastic), is often ambiguous. The standard approach is to simply remove all polyps and
      analyse them in the histology lab. This means that many patients with hyperplastic polyps
      (40% of those detected) are unnecessarily exposed to risk of injury (bowel perforation and
      bleeding) during removal. Furthermore the NHS faces the significant cost of diagnosing this
      harmless colon tissue. If clinicians were able to accurately determine polyp type during
      endoscopy, without removal, then hyperplastic tissue could be left alone while potentially
      harmful tissue is removed.

      A pilot study of a new endoscopic optical imaging probe (OPTIC), which analyses how different
      colours of light interact with tissue, is proposed. Previous research has indicated that
      these properties differ in hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps. The probe is contained within
      a normal endoscope and uses white light and blue/violet laser light to illuminate the tissue.
      The reflected and fluorescent light emitted, along with normal colour pictures of the polyp
      surface, are measured and recorded to quantify specific characteristics of each type.

      Patients attending endoscopy clinics at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust will be asked
      to allow the use of the OPTIC probe during their colonoscopy. If the clinician detects a
      polyp that he/she intends to remove then this will be analysed using OPTIC before removal.
      The histology results from the tissue sample will be recorded and correlated to the OPTIC
      probe measurements. The resulting library of optical data will be used to design software to
      automatically categorise unknown polyps based on the OPTIC signal. The accuracy of the
      technique will be compared to the clinicians' visual assessments. The patients' involvement
      in the study ceases after the colonoscopy.

    <description>When a suitable area of tissue is identified by the clinician during a patient's colonoscopy (e.g., a polyp), the imaging probe is inserted into the colonoscope so that it can view the tissue. Optical spectral reflectance and autofluorescence imaging is then performed to collect white light reflected by, and fluorescent light emitted from, the tissue. This is then analysed by hardware and software components in the external analysis unit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients attending for screening colonoscopy, urgent colonoscopy for altered bowel
             habit (on a two week wait) or those patients attending for polyp surveillance or
             therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis or those that have undergone
             previous surgery as these different pathologies may confound interpretation of the
             optical signals.

          -  At the discretion of the endoscopist patients with poor bowel preparation will be
             excluded if it is judged that the colonoscopy cannot be completed. Further quality
             measures will be determined for reliable data acquisition (see outcome measures).

          -  Patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding

          -  Patients with chronic liver disease

          -  Patients with abnormal coagulation or any other contra-indication to use of standard
             biopsy in routine diagnostic endoscopic procedures

          -  Patients who are unable or unwilling to give informed consent

          -  Patients under the age of 18 years
