  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the association of preoperative polypharmacy with outcomes and
      healthcare resource utilization in a population-based sample of older patients enrolled in a
      universal pharmacare program
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multilevel multivariable regression analysis will be used to investigate the adjusted
      association between preoperative polypharmacy and postoperative outcomes and healthcare
      resource utilization. Sensitivity analyses will be used to evaluate the robustness of the
      primary analysis.
