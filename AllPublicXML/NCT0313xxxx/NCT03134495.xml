  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacological treatment of physiologic Gastro-esophageal Reflux disease (GERD) is excessive
      in France, as 65%-85% of children below 11 years are being treated, frequently with Proton
      Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) PPI have been associated, in adults, with an increase of infection
      rate but data in pediatry are scarce, especially in community medecine. Recently a study
      conducted in England brought up controversial results suggesting that the use of PPIs can be
      associated with a reduced risk of community acquired pneumonia.

      Our study was aimed to assess, on a population-based database, the association between PPI
      prescription and community infections in children of 11 years or under.
