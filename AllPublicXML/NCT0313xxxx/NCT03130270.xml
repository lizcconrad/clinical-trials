      The study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib for later treatment of
      patients(after second-line treatment for locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma), including overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and
      locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS); the relationship between EBV DNA copy number and
      survival after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy; Quality of life score (QoL); evaluation of
      drug safety.

      In locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC), although fist-line therapy with
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy (Cisplatin/Docetaxel/5-Fu) and second-line therapy with
      chemotherapy has been given, patients still locally recurrence and distant metastasis. There
      is no standard treatment recommendation for locally recurrent or metastatic NPC who failed to
      second-line therapy. Apatinib has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced
      gastric cancer. Several phase III studies of liver cancer, non small cell lung cancer and
      other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxicities and better tolerance. However, the
      clinical application of apatinib in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is still lack of evidence-based
      medicine. And this trial is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib in
      locally recurrent or metastatic NPC.

    <description>Patients with locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after second-line treatment are assigned to receive apatinib mesylate tablet. A treatment cycle was defined as 28 days (4 weeks). The starting dose was 500 mg, orally, qd; tolerance assessment for a cycle, patients with poorly tolerance were treated with low dose (500 mg, qd), and patients with well tolerance were treated with high dose (750 mg, qd). All patients continuous treatment until progression disease or non-tolerated toxicity.
Note: good tolerance was defined that no grade 3/4 hematology or/and non hematologic side effects occurred within 4 weeks after initiation treatment; poor tolerance was defined that grade 3/4 hematology or/and non hematologic side effects appeared within 4 weeks after initiation treatment.</description>
