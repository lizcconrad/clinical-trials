    <textblock>
      This will be a 2 period one-day, double-masked, randomized, repeated measures,
      non-dispensing, cross-over study where the main purpose of this study is to compare the
      performance of a new daily disposable silicone hydrogel lens with that of an existing similar
      lens.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 hours of wear</time_frame>
    <description>Overall lens fit acceptability will be graded by the investigator on a 0-5 grading scale, where 5 indicates a perfect fit, and will be based on fitting characteristics such as centration and movement (not comfort or vision).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Power</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 hours of wear</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with similar (±0.00 D and ±0.25 D) lens power requirements for each lens type will be calculated. The lens requirements will be calculated from the lens power and spherical over-refraction by summing the lens power and the overrefraction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfort and Handling</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 hours of wear</time_frame>
    <description>Comfort and handling will be scored by the subject on an 11-point scale (0-10).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vision Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 hours of wear</time_frame>
    <description>Vision quality will be scored by the subject on a 0-100 scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 hours of wear</time_frame>
    <description>High contrast visual acuity will be recorded with contact lenses only using logMAR (Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution) charts.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. The subject must read and sign the Informed Consent form.

          2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          3. Healthy adult males or females aged 18-55 years.

          4. The subject's spherical contact lens requirement in the range +2.00 D to +4.00 D or
             -1.00 D to -6.00 D.

          5. The subject's refractive cylinder must be ≤1.00 D in each eye.

          6. The subject must have visual acuity best correctable to 6/9 (20/30) or better for each
             eye.

          7. The subject is a current soft contact lens wearer (defined as a minimum of 6 hours of
             DW per day, at least 5 days per week, for a minimum of 1 month prior to the study).

          8. The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from
        participating in the study:

          1. Currently pregnant or lactating

          2. Any systemic disease (e.g., Sjögren's Syndrome),allergies, infectious disease (e.g.,
             hepatitis,tuberculosis), contagious immunosuppressive diseases (e.g., HIV), autoimmune
             disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), or other diseases, by self-report, which are
             known to interfere with contact lens wear and/or participation in the study.

          3. Use of systemic medications (e.g., chronic steroid use) that are known to interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          4. Any ocular allergies, infections or other ocular abnormalities that are known to
             interfere with contact lens wear and/or participation in the study. This may include,
             but not be limited to entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes,
             glaucoma, history of recurrent corneal erosions, aphakia, or corneal distortion.

          5. Extended wear contact lens correction.

          6. Any current use of ocular medication.

          7. Any previous, or planned (during the course of the study) ocular surgery (e.g., radial
             keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, etc.)

          8. Any greater than Grade 2 slit lamp findings (e.g., oedema, corneal neovascularisation,
             corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection) on the FDA
             classification scale or any other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact
             lens wear.

          9. Any contact lens-related history or signs of a corneal inflammatory event, or any
             other ocular abnormality that would contraindicate contact lens wear.

         10. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14 days
             prior to study enrolment.

         11. Employee, relative or friends of employees of any ophthalmic company, or
             investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator, Technician).
