      The study will adopt a longitudinal research design with randomized quasi- experimental
      trial. The workers with overweight or obesity (BMI≧24) provided by the company will be
      randomly assigned to Group A (four lessons of dietary behavior and six lessons of MBI) or
      Group B (four lessons of dietary behavior and six lessons of mental health). There will be
      100 participants in each group. Data will be collected five times. The research questionnaire
      includes basic information (including BMI, waist circumference, etc), Perceived Stress Scale,
      The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Food Cravings Questionnaire, the scale of physical
