  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection of melanoma showed an impact on the thickness of the lesions at the time of
      diagnosis. One challenge is to improve the modalities.

      Decrease the rate of non-compliant patients among patients referred to the dermatologist for
      a suspicious lesion (patients who will never go to the consultation), and reduce the time
      interval between the first identification of the lesion and the excision allowing the
      diagnosis are major issues.

      Direct contact between the general practitioner (GP) and the dermatologist would probably
      make it possible to shorten the care pathway of patients with lesions justifying excision.

      The objective is to evaluate whether contacting the dermatologist directly by telephone and
      e-mailing the photograph of a suspicious melanoma lesion can significantly reduce the time
      required for access to the consultation for the following patients: (a) referred for a
      suspicious lesion of melanoma by the GP (b) and having a sufficiently suspicious lesion of
      melanoma so that the dermatologist conclude at the need for excision (true positives).

      Expected results: The procedure should shorten the care pathway for patients with melanoma
      and decrease the proportion of patients who do not consult the dermatologist when they were
      referred (&quot;non-observing patients&quot;).

      This should facilitate the identification of thinner lesions. The benefit for the patient is
      then direct with a survival at 5 years higher.

      In public health terms, it is expected a benefit as better optimization of resources. In a
      situation of shortage of professionals, access to the dermatologist should be optimized by
      optimizing emergency access for patients who require it.

    <description>General practitioners will be invited to screen for melanoma as part of their regular consultations.
The MG collects relevant clinical information
The MG takes 2 photographs of the lesion with his smartphone.
The MG sends to the dermatologist by e-mail the 2 photographs of the lesion accompanied by relevant clinical information
The MG calls the secretariat of the dermatologist to record the admissibility of the mail, to give the identity and the coordinates of the patient whose photos have just been sent and to obtain an appointment.
The dermatologist proposes an appointment to the patient.</description>
