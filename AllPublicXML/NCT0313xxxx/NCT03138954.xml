      The aim of the study will be to determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of
      elastosonography and the use of the contrast agent (Sonovue®) in the endoscopic ultrasound
      exploration of deep pelvic endometriosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To diagnose deep infiltrating endometriosis, a clinical examination may be performed by a
      gynecologist to look for typical signs of endometriosis, but in 25% of case there can be
      absent.

      According to that, medical imaging is indispensable in diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis.
      Trans vaginal ultrasonography, and pelvic MRI are major tools in the hands of specialists,
      but several studies have shown the importance of endoscopic rectal ultrasound, with a
      sensitivity close to 90% for de diagnosis of digestive impairment.

      In recent years the use of elastography and the injection of microbubbles of sulfur
      hexafluoride in addition to endoscopic ultrasound has made it possible to improve the
      diagnostic accuracy of the technique in tumoral pathologies, in particular bilio-pancreatic
      injuries.

      However, no study has yet evaluated the endoscopic rectal ultrasound with elastometry and
      injection of contrast agent to characterize the digestive lesions of deep pelvic
      endometriosis.

      The endoscopic rectal ultrasound has demonstrated its place in the evaluation of deep pelvic
      endometriosis disease but its latest complementary techniques of interest have not yet been
      studied prospectively. The aim of the study will be to determine the diagnostic and
      prognostic value of elastosonography and the use of the contrast agent (Sonovue®) in the
      endoscopic ultrasound exploration of deep pelvic endometriosis.
