  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the SPF of the test product according to the
      International Standards Organization (ISO) 24444:2010 methodology (In vivo determination of
      the SPF).

      A single-center, randomized, evaluator blind, intra-individual comparison, no treatment and
      positive controlled clinical study to determine the SPF of Physiogel Daily Defence Protective
      Day Cream Light as per ISO 24444:2010. The provisional minimal erythemal dose of unprotected
      skin (MEDu) for each subject will be determined before starting the test phase. Once the
      provisional MEDu for a subject has been determined, the three test sites will be demarcated.
      The test product and positive control (P3 reference sunscreen formulation) will be applied to
      two of the three test sites. The other test site will remain unprotected. All three test
      sites will be exposed to UV radiation at the expected MED and subsequently evaluated for
      erythema 16-24 hours after UV exposure.

    <masking_description>The trained grader responsible for assessing Minimal Erythemal Dose of unprotected skin (MEDu) and Minimal Erythemal Dose of product treated (MEDp) at Visit 5 will be blinded to the product allocation of subjects. The trained grader responsible for assessing the provisional MEDu at Visit 3 will, necessarily, not be blinded since only one test site will be exposed to Ultraviolet (UV) radiation.</masking_description>

    <description>Arithmetical mean of all valid SPFi values of each product on each subject will be calculated from the individual Minimal Erythemal Dose (MED) on product treated (MEDp) test sites in relation to unprotected (MEDu) test sites 16-24 hours after exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. SPFi = MEDp/MEDu.</description>
