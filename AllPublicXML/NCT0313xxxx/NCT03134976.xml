      This is a prospective observational study evaluating wound complications following head and
      neck surgery. Patients undergoing major head and neck surgery will be included in the study.
      Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be identified by members of the University of
      Michigan Head and Neck Oncology Division of the Department of Otolaryngology. The primary aim
      of this study is to identify risk factors for poor wound healing as well as biologic markers
      associated with wound related complications in head and neck surgery. Most specifically, this
      study evaluates the effects of thyroid hormone on wound healing. This study will also
      evaluate pre-operative labs and comorbidities as well as reconstructive factors,
      post-operative labs, and other variables associated with wound healing. All interventions
      regarding wound healing fall under current standards of care and standard practice. Data
      regarding post-operative wound complications will be collected in a prospective fashion on
      the variables under study using study-specific datasheets. Data sheet will be entered into a
      secure database for analysis.

    <description>Blood will be drawn and analyzed for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free T3, and free T4 levels at specified intervals. Subjects will be monitored for pharyngocutaneous fistula formation.</description>

    <description>The first group includes subjects with cancer of the voice box (laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma) that has already been treated by either chemotherapy or radiation. This group will be treated using the standard of care, which includes starting thyroid hormone replacement therapy (levothyroxine) after surgery.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Non-Salvage Larynx</arm_group_label>
    <description>The second group of subjects will consist of patients who have head and neck cancer of sites other than the voice box (larynx) without prior exposure to radiation or chemotherapy who are undergoing flap reconstruction surgery. This group will not be treated with levothyroxine so long as the subject has normal thyroid function. If a subject is hypothyroid, then thyroid hormone replacement will be given as a part of routine clinical care.</description>

    <description>Immediately post-operatively, all patients undergoing laryngectomy will be started on established weight-based dosing of levothyroxine administered intravenously due to the variable enteral absorption in post-operative patients including those on continuous tube feed regimens. Standard enteral dose is 1.6 mcg/kg/day. Eighty percent of this dose (1.3 mcg/kg/day) will be given IV to account for the increased bioavailability of IV levothyroxine compared to enteral levothyroxine. The maximum dose will be 200 mcg/day. Patients previously on levothyroxine at doses lower than the above dose will changed to the aforementioned standard dose. Patients on higher doses of levothyroxine pre-operatively will be maintained on on their current dosing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In both groups: subjects must be 18 years or older with biopsy confirmed cancer of the
             head and neck.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children and vulnerable populations are not eligible for participation. Patients
             undergoing functional (non cancer related) surgery, patients who have undergone more
             than 1 course of radiation to the head and neck, patients with a history of thyroid
             cancer, patients presenting initially with a malignant fistula, patients with previous
             intolerance or allergy to levothyroxine, and patients without a cancer diagnosis are
             not eligible. Patients may enroll if they are currently hypothyroid, but will be
             excluded from the study if thyroid function is not normalized by the time of surgery.
