      This is a double blind randomized control study to evaluate a daily disposable contact lens.
      It is planned to have 30 evaluable subjects at least divided evenly among 3 independent PIs
      from one hospital. Each PI will enroll 12 subjects at least. The ration of evaluable test
      subjects to control subjects will be 2 to 1. The study lens will be dispensed randomly to
      subjects who have normal ocular health and conform to a set of criteria. It is necessary to
      wear the lens 8 hours a day and 5 days a week at least and follow up for one month (30 days).
      Data will be collected at baseline, 1 week, 2 week and 4 week of daily disposable modality
      including Adverse Reactions, Slit-lamp findings and Symptoms, Problems, and Complaints,
      vision acuity, keratometry change and reason for discontinuation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects should have normal eyes and use no ocular medications. They may have worn
             contact lenses previously, provided their eyes are shown to be normal at the start of
             the investigation. A normal eye is defined as having the following characteristics:

               1. No anterior segment infection, inflammation or abnormality.

               2. No other active ocular or systemic disease that would contraindicate contact lens
                  wear; and

               3. No medications that would contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  VA correctable to 0.1 LogMAR or better, with spherical lenses ranging in power from

          -  1.00 to -10.00 D myopia, astigmatism less than 2.00 D

          -  Willing to comply with all study procedures and be available for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Provide signed and dated informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have history of allergies that would contraindicate &quot;normal&quot; contact lens wear.

          -  Have other active ocular or systemic disease such as, but not limited to: anterior
             uveitis (past or present), glaucoma, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, lupus erythematosus,
             sclerodermas, keratoconus or type II diabetes, slip lamp findings greater than grade I
             (such as cornea or interstitial edema).

          -  Have medications that would contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Have had any cornea surgery.

          -  Currently pregnant (to the best of the subject's knowledge), is lactating or is
             planning a pregnancy within the next 1 month.

          -  Any active participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to this study.

          -  The presence of clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) anterior segment abnormalities;
             inflammations such as iritis; or any infection of the eye, lids, or associated
             structures.

          -  A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity), corneal ulcer,
             corneal infiltrates or fungal infections.

          -  A history of papillary conjunctivitis that has interfered with contact lens wear.

          -  No monocular or monovision fits.

          -  Alcoholic or Drug Abused.
