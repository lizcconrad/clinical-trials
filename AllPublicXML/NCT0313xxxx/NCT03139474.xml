  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first In-Vitro Fertilization cycles were performed in natural unstimulated cycles. Today
      gonadotrophins are administered to induce multiple follicular development and controlled
      ovarian hyperstimulation. During ovarian stimulation gonadotrophin-releasing hormone
      analogues are co-administered in order to prevent premature luteinizing hormone surges.
      Premature luteinizing hormone surges are observed in about 20% of stimulated cycles without
      using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues .

      Avoiding the adverse effects of elevated luteinizing hormone levels, first
      gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist analogues were used to supplement the gonadotrophin
      stimulation. The continuous administration of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists causes
      gonadotrophin suppression through down-regulation and desensitization of the
      gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptors in the pituitary gland after an initial short
      period of gonadotrophin hypersecretion .

      Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (cetrorelix and ganirelix) cause immediate and
      rapid gonadotrophin suppression by competitive antagonism of the gonadotrophin-releasing
      hormone receptor in the pituitary without an initial period of gonadotrophin hypersecretion.
      Several advantageous effects of cetrorelix were established , and these effects seemed to be
      independent from the type of antagonist used for luteinizing hormone-suppression.The quality
      of oocytes and developing preembryos is one of the most relevant factors determining the
      success of an In-Vitro Fertilization treatment. As ovarian stimulation protocol is one of the
      eligible factors during an In-Vitro Fertilization treatment, its embryo quality influencing
      effects are necessary to know.
