  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Finland, there are no guidelines concerning post-operative pain medication of ambulatory
      surgery patients. There is a wide variety in drug prescription and medication practices of
      various doctors and clinics. To treat patients' pain safely, type of surgery, unique patient
      needs, risks, adverse effects and patient's capacity to follow instructions should be
      assessed during the few hour visit at the clinic. In many clinics, pain is treated after
      hospital discharge with strong opioid oxycodone, but the amount and dose of prescribed
      oxycodone varies. In Helsinki Universitys Hospital, Peijas Hospital, investigators have over
      2000 ambulatory surgery procedures annually. Investigators have strict policy in oxycodone
      use after patient discharge compared to some other Finnish ambulatory surgery clinics. The
      aim of this study is to evaluate, whether the prescribed pain medication is sufficient and
      whether patients' suffer from adverse effects after discharge from ambulatory surgery (letter
      interview). The study proceeds in three phases: 1) observation of current medication
      practice, 2) observation after optimization and standardization of hospitals drug
      prescription protocol, 3) evaluation of mobile phone app in pain medication follow up.

      After informed consent, all patients operated as ambulatory surgery patients during the study
      period are given a letter interview for pain, pain medication and symptom follow up. They are
      also given a return envelope (with paid postal fee) to return the interview.

      Based on the results of the first interview phase, our pain medication practice is
      reconsidered by anesthetists and surgeons to create a standard operating protocol for pain
      medication. The standard operating protocol is informed to personnel. Then, patient interview
      phase is repeated for another 3 months.

      Then, investigators continue with a pilot study on using a mobile phone app in evaluating
      patients pain, sufficient pain medication and adverse effects. All patient with informed
      consent, suitable mobile phone, and willing to use it for reporting pain for hospital
      personnel are contacted via the mobile app. Other patients operated during that study period
      are interviewed by either letter interview or phone interview. Investigators try to estimate
      whether mobile apps are suitable for pain and medication follow-up.
