  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will perform a targeted metabolic analysis in blood and urine samples from
      subjects attending the Baylor AT&amp;T Memory Center. The aim is to identify novel biomarkers
      that can distinguish normal aging subjects with no cognitive impairment from those with mild,
      moderate or severe cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects will
      also be screened for B-vitamin deficiencies that may correlate with other metabolic
      biomarkers and Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will be clinically assessed using standard measures of clinical care. Cognitive
      function will be assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Disease severity will
      be assessed by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR). Social function will be assessed by
      the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Based on clinical assessment, subjects will be
      classified into one of the following groups.

        1. Normal (Spouse or Caregiver)

        2. Mild cognitive impairment

        3. Alzheimer's disease A. Mild B. Moderate C. Severe

      The investigators plan to enroll 60 subjects in each group from 1 and 2; 40 subjects in each
      of the groups 3A and 3B and 20 subjects in group 3C.

      All samples will be analyzed using a targeted metabolomic platform by liquid chromatography
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Further analysis will include determining 28 metabolite ratios
      from this data that will indicate activity of specific pathways. In addition, the
      investigators will analyze plasma samples for levels of vitamin B9 (folate), vitamin B12,
      vitamin B6, and several other metabolites related to methylation (8 metabolites).

      DNA will be extracted from whole blood for genotyping of the following mutations using
      Taqman® SNP genotyping assays from Life Technologies. This analysis will include genotyping
      of ApoE4 and SNP's related to folate metabolism.
