  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study to test the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of
      ASN002 in people with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a dose escalation study to determine a safe and tolerable dose of ASN002 for
      people with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This study will also characterize the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASN002 through blood sampling and skin biopsies.
      Subjects will also be assessed for improvement in their atopic dermatitis. There will be a
      screening period (up to 30 days) and a treatment period for 4 weeks with a 14 day follow up
      with an end-of-study visit.
