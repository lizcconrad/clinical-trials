  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants who are HLA-DPB1*04:01 positive and whose tumors are MAGE-A3/A6 positive may be
      eligible for this study. If eligible, white blood cells are collected by apheresis and
      genetically modified to recognize cancer cells which express MAGE-A3/A6. Chemotherapy
      precedes infusion of the genetically modified cells. Participants may be hospitalized and/or
      return to the study doctor for check-ups and medical evaluations. The purpose of the study is
      to see if the treatment is safe and effective in treating advanced cancer.

      Participants found to be be HLA-DPB1*04:01 positive and whose tumors are MAGE-A3 and/or
      MAGE-A6 positive can participate if all eligibility criteria are met. Other tests required to
      determine eligibility include a physical exam, ECG and ECHO of the heart, CT or MRI scans,
      and blood draws. Eligible participants have white blood cells collected by leukapheresis.
      These cells are genetically modified to make the experimental treatment KITE-718. The desired
      outcome is that the genetically modified T cells will target tumor cells that express MAGE-A3
      and/or MAGE-A6, which are proteins that can be expressed by cancer cells. Participants
      receive chemotherapy prior to the KITE-718 infusion. After the KITE-718 infusion,
      participants will be followed for side effects and have scans performed to see any potential
      impact on their cancers. Study procedures may be performed while hospitalized and/or in the
      outpatient setting.
