  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondary schoolgirls have the most unhealthy profile regarding physical activity and
      sedentary behaviour of all age groups. Since both behaviours independently contribute to
      various health outcomes, an effective intervention to promote physical activity and to reduce
      sedentary behaviour needs to be developed.

      Many interventions fail to induce changes in health behaviour, as they often use a top-down
      approach with limited input from the end-users (i.e. the secondary schoolgirls) of the
      intervention programmes. This project uses a participatory health research approach by
      actively involving the girls in the entire research process. A co-creation group was set up
      per intervention school (n=3), including girls and a researcher which co-created a
      school-specific intervention, tailored to the needs and interests of those girls.

      The effect of participatory process were evaluated via a clustered randomized controlled
      trial using an intervention and control condition and a pre- and post-test design. Effects on
      physical activity and related determinants (e.g. self-efficacy, attitude, etcetera) were
      evaluated. The hypothesis was that girls from the intervention condition would improve their
      physical activity levels and related determinants compared to no changes among girls from the
      control schools. The process was evaluated as well using focus group research and the
      hypothesis was that girls who participate in the co-creation groups would be positive about
      the process and will feel empowered.

    <description>Overall physical activity (expressed in average minutes per day) is calculated by summing active transportation (i.e. minutes spent in active transportation to school and in leisure time per day) and sport participation (i.e. minutes spent in physical education, extra-curricular sports or physical activities at school and during leisure time per day), measured by the reliable and valid Flemish Physical Activity Questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increase in the mean value of determinants related to physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>one schoolyear</time_frame>
    <description>Three individual (i.e. self-efficacy, perceived benefits and perceived barriers) and six sociocultural determinants (i.e. peer and parental modelling, peer and parental co-participation and peer and parental encouragement) were assessed using questions from previous studies examining adolescents' health behaviour, of which the predictive validity and reliability have been demonstrated previously. Three school-related determinants (i.e. relationship with classmates, involvement in organising school activities and relationship with teachers) were assessed using items from the Flemish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children questionnaire.</description>
