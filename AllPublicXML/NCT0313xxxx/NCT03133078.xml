      The purpose of this study will be to determine the effects of a 2-minute single limb lateral
      step-down fatigue test versus a 30 second side hop test on single limb forward hop distance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current methods to induce fatigue often incorporate equipment not available in all clinical
      settings or include tasks that are difficult to standardize. One of the tests to fatigue the
      leg muscles is the leg extensor fatigue test using a unilateral weight machine. There are
      drawbacks to this testing including the clinician having access to the equipment, testing
      only fatigued a single muscle group, and it is less sport/task specific compared to jump
      testing. Our previous work has incorporated the use of a side hop task that is performed by
      hopping over two lines 40 cm apart for 30 seconds. While this does induce fatigue and
      decreases single leg forward hop performance the overall decrease was relatively small (&lt;10
      cm). It is likely necessary to induce a greater amount of fatigue; thus further limiting
      single leg forward hop performance.

    <description>The 2-minute single limb lateral-step down test will be used to induce lower extremity muscle fatigue. Participants will be instructed to perform a single limb lateral step-down test on a 31 cm box (12-inches), touching their heel to the floor each time as many times as possible in 2 minutes. The number of lateral step-downs will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The 30 second side hop test will be used to induce lower extremity muscle fatigue. Participants will be instructed to jump as many times as possible over two parallel strips of tape placed 40 cm apart, but must initiate approximately 30 degrees of knee flexion each jump. The number of successful jumps performed within 30 seconds will be recorded and used for data analysis. An unsuccessful jump will be defined as touching the tape or the area inside the tape. We will record the number of successful trials.</description>
