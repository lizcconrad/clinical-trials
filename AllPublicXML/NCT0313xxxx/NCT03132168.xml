    <textblock>
      In this study, post-operative delirium will be measured in patients undergoing surgery for
      bladder resection, and associated microRNA biomarkers will be evaluated in patients
      considered delirious and non-delirious after surgery.

    <textblock>
      With voluntary participation, this study requires participants to complete a
      self-administered cognitive evaluation (SAGE) before surgery to assess baseline cognitive
      impairment and early dementia; vital signs will be documented prior to surgery. During
      surgery, participants will receive a standardized general anesthesia regimen as described in
      the protocol. Several parameters will be measured during surgery, including bispectral
      monitoring to measure processed EEG. After surgery, fitness for cognitive evaluation will be
      determined by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scale, and then emergence delirium
      will be assessed using the CAM-ICU scale. Fitness for discharge from PACU will be determined
      by an Aldrete score of 9 or more. Postoperative pain will be assessed using the 11-point
      Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11). Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) level will also be
      documented. Postoperative Delirium (POD) assessment will be achieved by administering the
      memorial delirium assessment scale (MDAS) twice a day starting on day 1 through day 3
      postoperatively. Pain NRS-11 score and PONV levels will also be documented at each visit. For
      microRNA testing, blood probes will be collected in 5mL purple top tube at surgical
      preadmission and post-surgery days one, two and three. Risks associated with participating in
      this study include normal risk associated with having surgery and general anesthesia; no
      greater than minimal risk is associated with blood collection. For the participant, there are
      no immediate anticipated benefits for participating in this study. The importance of the
      knowledge that is expected to result includes lower post-operative complications as a result
      of post-operative delirium, faster recovery, and shorter hospital stay.
