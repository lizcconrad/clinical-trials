    <textblock>
      Individuals infected with HIV have a high risk of developing metabolic comorbidities not
      traditionally associated with the immune dysregulation and deficiency associated with HIV
      infection and AIDS. Many of these comorbidities in HIV uninfected individuals have been
      linked to a disordered circadian clock function. The study investigators will further
      evaluate the circadian clock in HIV infection as a mechanism underlying the metabolic
      dysregulation in this population.

    <description>To evaluate the linear relationships between every pairwise combination of variables in the integrated dataset, the R^2, or coefficient of determination, will be calculated for each pair using linear regression. A heat map of the proportion of variance in each variable (e.g. mobility, light exposure, systolic blood pressure) explained by each other variable will then be constructed to allow an integrative exploration of these data. This approach allows to integrate multiple measurements with different units of measure. The measurements include communication (number of phone calls and text messages), mobility (miles traveled), light exposure, blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, sleep/wake times, body core temperature, multiomics outputs (abundance of metabolites, proteins, microbiota) and markers of cellular and inflammatory function and disease state (HIV infection).</description>

          -  Cohort 2: Diagnosis of HIV infection with CD4+ counts &lt;300 cells/mm3 on ARV;

          -  Cohort 3: Volunteers must be in good health as based on medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, and laboratory tests as deemed by PI;

             birth control (such as oral contraceptives, intra-uterine device (IUD), or condom with
             spermicide) while you participate in the study.

          -  Subjects with any abnormal laboratory value or physical finding that according to the
             investigator may interfere with interpretation of the study results, be indicative of
             an underlying disease state, or compromise the safety of a potential subject.
