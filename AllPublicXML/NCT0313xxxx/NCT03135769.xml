  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational trophoblastic neoplasias (GTN) are characterized by the persistence of elevated
      hCG titers after complete uterine evacuation of a partial hydatidiform mole (PHM) or a
      complete hydatidiform mole. GTN patients are commonly treated with single agent treatment
      (methotrexate or actinomycine-D) or polychemotherapy (first line treatment EMA-CO) according
      to the predicted risk of resistance to single agent treatment by FIGO score. GTN patients
      with resistance to these treatments are treated with another single agent drug or
      polychemotherapy regimens.

      Chemotherapy standard regimens are old and toxic for these young lady patients, with
      potential long term effects detrimental for further maternity and quality of life. There is a
      need for modern targeted agents with better benefit/toxicity profiles.

      There is a strong rational for investigating the anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody avelumab in
      chemoresistant GTN patients. Several elements suggest that the normal pregnancy immune
      tolerance is &quot;hijacked&quot; by GTN cell for proliferating :

        -  Spontaneous regressions of metastasic GTN are regularly observed, thereby the role of
           immune system for rejecting GTN cells.

        -  Strong and constant overexpression of PDL1 and NK cells has been found in all subtypes
           and settings of GTN tumors from French reference gestational trophoblastic center.

        -  The case of complete and durable response to pembrolizumab was reported in a patient
           with multi chemo-resistant GTN.
