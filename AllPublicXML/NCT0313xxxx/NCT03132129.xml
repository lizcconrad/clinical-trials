    <textblock>
      Background: Heart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes mellitus,
      but its pathophysiology is poorly understood.

      Aim: To determine the prevalence and determinants of subclinical cardiovascular dysfunction
      in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

      Plan: 150 asymptomatic older adults (aged 50-75 years) with T2D will undergo comprehensive
      evaluation of cardiac structure and function using cardiac MRI (CMR) and spectroscopy,
      echocardiography, CT coronary calcium scoring, exercise tolerance testing and blood sampling.
      Fifty controls will undergo the same evaluation.

      Primary hypothesis: myocardial steatosis is an independent predictor of left ventricular
      global longitudinal strain. Secondary hypotheses: will assess whether CMR is more sensitive
      to detect early cardiac dysfunction than echocardiography and BNP, and whether cardiac
      dysfunction is related to peak oxygen consumption.

      Expected value of results: This study will reveal the prevalence and determinants of cardiac
      dysfunction in T2D, and could provide targets for novel therapies.

    <description>CMR scanning performed on a 3T MRI scanner. Standardised protocol incorporating cine functional assessment to determine LV mass, systolic function and left atrial volumes; global systolic strain and diastolic strain rates will be assessed by tagging and with tissue tracking analysis from cine images, adenosine rest and stress myocardial perfusion to assess reserve index and qualitative perfusion defects as previously described, aortic distensibility and pulse wave velocity to measure aortic stiffness, delayed contrast enhancement for assessment of LV fibrosis and evidence of previous myocardial infarction. Myocardial and liver triglyceride content will be assessed using the modified HepafatÂ® sequence or 1H MR spectroscopy at the inter ventricular septum.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study.

          -  Male or Female, aged â¥50 and â¤75 years.

          -  Diagnosed with Stable type 2 diabetes (determined by: i) formal diagnosis in GP case
             records, ii) a record of diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test OR glycated
             haemoglobin level â¥6.5%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Angina pectoris or limiting dyspnoea (&gt;NYHA II),

          -  Major atherosclerotic disease: Symptomatic CAD, history of myocardial infarction,
             previous revascularisation, stroke/transient ischaemic attack or symptomatic
             peripheral vascular disease.

          -  Atrial fibrillation or flutter.

          -  Moderate or severe valvular heart disease.

          -  History of heart failure or cardiomyopathy.

          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

          -  Low fasting C-peptide levels suggestive of adult-onset T1DM.

          -  Stage III-V renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate â¤30ml/min/1.73m2).

          -  Absolute contraindications to CMR.

        Importantly, patients with subclinical CAD, and other common comorbidities such as obesity
        and hypertension, will not be excluded from this study. This will enable us to evaluate the
        contribution of CAD to myocardial dysfunction in diabetes and ensures our study group is
        representative of the general population with diabetes. Similarly, as mild dyspnoea is
        extremely common and non-specific participants with mild dyspnoea will be included.
