  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study sought to determine whether daily irrigation with sterile saline solution during
      silicone hydrogel (SiH) contact lens continuous wear (CW) could improve ocular surface
      integrity and reduce the risk of adverse events.

      The purpose of this study was to determine whether daily irrigation with sterile saline
      solution during silicone hydrogel (SiH) contact lens 30-day continuous wear (CW) can mitigate
      increases in corneal epithelial permeability (Pdc) and reduce the risk of mechanical, contact
      lens-induced, inflammatory, and overall adverse events. 161 non-contact lens wearers were fit
      with SiH contact lenses and randomized to either a treatment (n = 81) or control (n = 80)
      group for 30-day CW. Subjects in the treatment group irrigated every morning and whenever
      dryness symptoms occurred; subjects in the control group did not.
