  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate hepatoprotective effect from ischemia-reperfusion injury
      of remote ischemic preconditioning of the liver against local ischemic preconditioning of the
      liver during human liver resections.

      In this randomized control study, a total of 60 patients were randomized into 3 groups:
      remote ischemic precondition group - RIPC (3 intervals of 5 minute right upper limb ischemia
      with 3 intervals of 5 minute reperfusion), local ischemic precondition group - LIPC (15
      minutes of inflow liver occlusion followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion before liver
      transection), control group - CG (group without ischemic preconditioning before liver
      transection). Patients were also stratified according to the extent of the hepatectomy.
      Hepatoprotective effect was evaluated by comparing serum transaminase levels, bilirubin
      levels, albumin, and protein levels, coagulograms and pathohistological exams. We also
      measured flow rate by Doppler ultrasound of hepatic artery and portal vein before and after
      preconditioning.

    <description>Liver paraffin-embedded, standard haematoxylin-eosin stained sections were analysed postoperatively to evaluate the ischemic reperfusion injury . According to Rodriguez et al. four elements of the liver histology were analysed: steatosis (micro vesicular and macro vesicular) in 4 grades, degree of sinusoidal congestion and dilatation in 3 grades, leukocyte infiltration in 3 grades and necrosis (focal, confluent, or zonal) in 3 grades.26 Each biopsy was evaluated by a single pathologist blinded to the treatment allocation.</description>

    <description>Local ischemic preconditioning (LIPC) is process during which a short period of ischemia is followed by a period of reperfusion prior to the prolonged ischemia which seems to render organs more tolerant to the IR(ischemic-reperfusion) injury.
Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) involves the protection of an organ from prolonged ischemia by brief periods of ischemia and reperfusion to a remote organ.</description>
