  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home HIV self-testing has been FDA approved and allows users to read their own HIV test
      results at home, while home sexually transmitted infection (STI) test self-collection allows
      men to use a swab at home and mail it in for testing. The purpose of this study is to learn
      how Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) use these new testing options, a set of online support
      tools, and the option to test with someone to support them (a testing &quot;buddy&quot;).

      We will also evaluate whether the online tools help these men to connect with HIV prevention
      services such as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) if they test HIV negative, and to HIV care
      services if they test HIV positive.

      Participants will be randomized 2:1 after enrollment to the intervention and control
      condition. Data obtained from this study will be used to inform the further tailoring and
      distribution of an intervention for young Black and Latino MSM to increase utilization of
      home HIV self-testing and linkage to HIV treatment and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP).
