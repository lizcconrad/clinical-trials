    <textblock>
      The present study is a randomized school-based trial of a sample of 5th and 6th grade
      students from 10 public schools in the municipality of Duque de Caxias, metropolitan area of
      Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The aim is to investigate whether adding nudging actions to the
      intervention group of PAAPPAS trial (PAAPAS Study, NCT02711488) increase fruits, vegetables
      and water consumption and daily energy expenditure, in a factorial design.

    <measure>Fruit consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Food intake will be assessed by a food frequency questionnaire validated for teenagers in Rio de Janeiro and one 24-hour recall (Rec24h). Netbooks containing a computer program developed for school use, based on a technique called &quot;Multiple Pass Method&quot; will be used.</description>

    <measure>Vegetable consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Vegetable consumption will be assessed by one 24-hour recall (Rec24h). The food items in the Rec24h will be transformed into daily consumption and grouped according to similary in nutritional containing</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Water consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Water consumption will be assessed by a question regarding the number of glasses of water consumed during a day. Glasses of water consumed during a day will be assessed by a question at baseline and at the end of the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity levels will be measured through a validated questionnaire including six questions about frequency and time of different physical activities domains.</description>
