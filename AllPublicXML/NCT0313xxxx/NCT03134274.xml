      The study is a home-based, usability study assessing the use of the Dip Home-Based Dipstick
      Analyzer (HBDA) in the context of prenatal care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      300 pregnant women receive home testing kit and smartphone application (Dip HBDA) during
      regular prenatal visit. They are instructed to conduct a urine test (regular 10 parameter
      dipstick included in kit) at home using the Dip HBDA. After conducting the urine test,
      participants are to fill out a short questionnaire regarding ease of use, preference of
      testing and any problems encountered.

      This study only assesses usability and questionnaire outcomes. The results of the test
      (indications on dipstick) are not subject to the study.
