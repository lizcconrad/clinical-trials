  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine whether meal-replacement therapy is able to enhance weight loss
      among teens with severe obesity. In addition, we are also interested in examining the degree
      of weight loss needed to improve important cardiometabolic risk factors among adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve 142 adolescents (ages 13-17 years old) participating in meal
      replacement therapy and will last one year (12 months), with a final follow-up visit 6 months
      after meal replacement therapy ends.

      Participants will be asked to strictly follow the individually-prescribed eating regimen,
      which will include shakes (breakfast and lunch) and pre-packaged frozen entrée meals for
      dinner, two servings of fruit, and three servings of vegetables per day. Daily caloric
      allotment will be tailored for each individual (number of shakes and frozen meals) by
      calculating the average daily caloric deficit necessary to achieve negative energy balance
      (using the metabolic rate/energy expenditure data). Resting metabolic rate will be measured
      and caloric allotment recalculated at each study visit (every 2 months throughout the study).
      Shakes/meals will be provided free of charge - fruits/vegetables will be purchased by the
      participants. Guidance will be provided regarding the use of the meal replacement shakes at
      school, and participants will be encouraged to engage in family meal sessions despite eating
      different foods.

      We will measure the changes in resting metabolic rate, traditional clinical risk markers (TG,
      HDL-c, LDL-c, TC, glucose, insulin), vascular function, weight-related quality of life, and
      physical activity.
