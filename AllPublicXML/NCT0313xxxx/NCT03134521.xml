  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daptomycin is validated as a treatment of bone and joint infections by the Infectious Disease
      Society of America. However, most of studies did not investigate daptomycin pharmacokinetics
      in this indication while it is known that efficacy and toxicity concentration studies show a
      close therapeutic margin.

      Evaluation of P-Glycoprotein (P-gp), a transmembrane transport protein, has demonstrated its
      influence on the concentration and intracellular activity of daptomycin. Recent work has
      linked the genetic polymorphism of P-gp to the pharmacokinetics of daptomycin, which may
      explain inter-individual variability but requires further explorations. Previous studies
      demonstrated existence of interindividual variabilities as sex, renal function and
      p-glycoprotein polymorphism couple with an intraindividual variabilities unexplained yet.

      A population approach will be used to determinate the pharmacokinetics factors, their intra
      and interindividual variabilities, the parameters associated to those variabilities (as the p
      glycoprotein).

      The investigator's goal is to evaluate different posology and to try to increase daptomycin
      efficacy and security in bone and joint infection.

    <description>the influence of demographic and biological covariates on pharmacokinetics will be assessed statistically by using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC, no unit). AIC = -2xLL + 2P, where LL is the log-likelihood computed by the population algorithm and P is the number of parameters in the model. A covariate will be considered as significant if it is associated with a decrease in the AIC value compared with the base model without covariate.</description>
