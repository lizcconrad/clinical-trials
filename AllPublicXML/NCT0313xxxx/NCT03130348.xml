  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib with or without bortezomib and dexamethasone
      works in treating patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis that has come back
      after a period of improvement or that does not respond to treatment. Ibrutinib and bortezomib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving ibrutinib with or without bortezomib and dexamethasone may work
      better in treating patients with relapsed or refractory immunoglobulin light chain
      amyloidosis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall hematologic response rate (stringent complete response [sCR] +
      amyloid complete response [ACR]+ very good partial response [VGPR] + partial response [PR])
      during the first 6 cycles for ibrutinib with bortezomib and dexamethasone added for lack of
      response in patients with amyloid light chain (AL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall hematologic response rate (sCR+ACR+VGPR+PR) of single agent ibrutinib
      in patients with AL.

      II. To evaluate overall hematologic response rate (sCR+ACR+VGPR+PR) to ibrutinib + bortezomib
      and dexamethasone (Vd) in subjects with progressive disease after initial response to single
      agent ibrutinib.

      III. To describe the toxicities associated with ibrutinib, alone and in combination with Vd,
      in patients with AL.

      IV. To determine the organ response in AL patients treated with ibrutinib alone and in
      combination with Vd.

      V. To determine 3 year progression free survival of AL patients on the study.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize health related quality of life of patients. II. To determine the caregiver
      and patient disease burden. III. To determine the correlation between cardiac biomarkers and
      hematologic response to therapy.

      IV. To evaluate the effect of ibrutinib on AL microenvironment. V. To characterize BTK
      expression in neoplastic plasma cells. VI. To evaluate the characterization of CD38
      expression on neoplastic plasma cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily (QD) on days 1-28. After 3 courses, patients who
      achieve partial response repeat treatment every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who do not achieve partial response
      after 3 courses continue receiving ibrutinib PO QD on days 1-28. Beginning at course 4,
      patients who do not achieve partial response also receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) and
      dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.

    <description>Will include a confirmed stringent complete response, amyloid complete response, very good partial response, and partial response. Confirmation will be defined as a response that is maintained on two consecutive evaluations at least 2 weeks apart. Progression will be defined as either hematologic or organ progression. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>
