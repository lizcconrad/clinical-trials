      A prospective trial conducted at Shock Trauma of patients between 18 years of age and older
      who have sustained a fracture with metal implanted. The investigators will be collecting
      between 1-3 routine blood draws for the purpose of laboratory analysis to assess biofilm
      growth. Patients may be infected or non-infected at the time of blood draw; they will be
      selected at random for purposes of this study. All patients will be followed as standard of
      care by their treating physician for all their follow up visits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infection in the orthopaedic surgery population is a significant public health
      issue. Wound infections result in both increased length of hospital stay and total cost of
      care.

      Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common preventable adverse outcome after a major
      operation. The economic costs to the US healthcare system are enormous estimated to be in
      excess of $1.8 billion per year. For patients who develop an SSI, the cost may be even higher
      with length of stay and risk of death doubled. Thus the benefits of any intervention
      decreasing the risk of SSI are very tangible.

      A biofilm is a layer of bacteria that adheres to a surface; in Orthopaedics, this often means
      adherence to implanted metal after fracture surgery. The test that has been designed by one
      of the investigators on the study has been shown in an animal model to detect the formation
      of a biofilm up to 1 month prior to clinical detection. Having a blood assay such as this
      would allow earlier antibiotics and potentially prevent the need for further surgeries to
      remove metal implants and clean out the biofilm.

    <masking_description>The intervention (blood draws) is not masked - every participant and care provider will know that the study uses blood draws to test for the biofilm associated with surgical site infections. But, the results of the blood tests will be masked - neither the patient or the care provider will be informed of the results.</masking_description>

    <description>One to three blood sample tests will be taken at convenient timepoints for the participant prior to the one-year post-operative clinical follow-up. Clinical cultures will also be monitored for the one-year post-operative period and compared to the blood sample test results to determine if the test is able to identify patients with positive staphylococcal infection cultures.</description>

    <description>One to three blood sample tests will be taken at convenient timepoints for the participant prior to the one-year post-operative clinical follow-up. All blood sample tests that are conveniently taken 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, or 3 months AFTER a clinical culture returns as staphylococcal-positive will be used to determine how long this test will remain positive after a patient's staphylococcal-positive culture.</description>

All blood sample tests that are conveniently taken 3 months, 2 months, 1 month, or 2 weeks BEFORE a clinical culture returns as staphylococcal-positive will be used to determine if this test can be used to predict staphylococcal infections in orthopaedic trauma patients.</description>
