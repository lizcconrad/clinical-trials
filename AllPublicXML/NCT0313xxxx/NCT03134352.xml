      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multi-center phase IIA study to
      evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Fugan ointment versus placebo applied to
      involved skin of subjects with mild to moderate subacute eczema.

      In this study, patients will be recruited and randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 into Fugan bid
      group (Fugan AM + Fugan PM), Fugan qd group (Fugan AM + Placebo PM), and placebo group
      (Placebo AM + Placebo PM). Randomization will be stratified by disease severity (mild IGA=2
      vs. moderate IGA=3).

      The patients will be given 3-week treatment and followed up for two weeks after the
      treatment.

      Screening period is set as 1 week. Subjects will be given 3-week treatment and followed up
      for two weeks after the treatment.

      Approximately 310 subjects will be randomized to achieve 250 evaluable subjects completing
      the study.
