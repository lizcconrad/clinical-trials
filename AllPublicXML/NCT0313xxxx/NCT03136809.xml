      Treatment extension study for ALS/MND patients who participated in phase 1 study
      CMD-2016-001, completed assessments following six 28-day cycles of treatment, and whom the
      Investigator considers would benefit from continued CuATSM treatment. The same safety
      assessments as in the CMD-2016-001 study will be conducted after each cycle of treatment and
      the same efficacy assessments as in the CMD-2016-001 study will be conducted after every 3
      cycles of treatment. Treatment will continue until the first to occur of (1) Investigator
      considers the patient is no longer deriving benefit from CuATSM treatment, (2) patient
      develops dependence on mechanical ventilation where dependence is defined as being unable to
      lie flat (supine) without it, unable to sleep without it, or daytime use, or (3) the patient
      withdraws consent.
