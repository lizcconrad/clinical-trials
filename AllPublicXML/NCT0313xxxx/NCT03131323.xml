      Reactive airway diseases is a common respiratory diseases affecting 1-18% of the population
      in different countries. It carries a significant burden to children, their families, the
      healthcare system and the overall community.The purpose of the study is to delineate the
      prevalence of abnormal nasal finding in wheezy children and evaluate the role of the
      endoscopic examination of the nose in evaluation and management of a wheezy child.Patients
      and methods:The study will be conducted as a prospective case series including all children
      having chest wheezes, aged from two years to eighteen years, attending emergency unit of

      Reactive airway diseases is a common respiratory diseases affecting 1-18% of the population
      in different countries. The worldwide increasing incidence of asthma continues to make it a
      global health problem . It is one of the major causes of hospitalization among children
      younger than 15 years of age . It carries a significant burden to children, their families,
      the healthcare system and the overall community. When combined with shortness of breath,
      chest tightness and/or cough, it is a bronchial asthma .

      Pediatric wheeze be triggered by upper respiratory tract infections . The adenoids are a
      prominent contributor to chronic rhinitis in the pediatric population. Clinical control of
      chronic rhinosinusitis may be important to optimize the control of difficult-to-treat asthma.
      However, the relationship between chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma in children remains
      largely descriptive .

    <intervention_name>• Flexible fiberopticnasopharyngoscope</intervention_name>
    <description>II- Equipments:
Flexible fiberopticnasopharyngoscope, 2.7 mm in diameter and fiberoptic light cable.
The camera: fitted with Three-CCD (Charged Couple Device) sensors.
A high resolution monitor.
A recording unit. III- Positioning:Infants and small children have to be held by a parent or an adult. Older children and adolescents usually tolerate office flexible nasopharyngoscopy once the procedure is explained. If office flexible nasopharyngoscopy failed because the child is not cooperative or if there is excessive secretions, general anesthesia may be required [8].
IV- Technique: Lubricant gel will be applied to the tip of the endoscope which will be now will be passed along the floor of the nose, between the inferior turbinate and the nasal septum, till it reaches the nasopharynx. Now the entire nose and the nasopharynx could be thoroughly examined and any abnormal findings could be detected and documented.</description>
