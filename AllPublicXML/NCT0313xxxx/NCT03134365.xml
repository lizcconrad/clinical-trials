  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: to determine the effect of palatability on the cognitive (satiation/fullness) and
      emotive (digestive well-being/mood) responses to meal ingestion. The postprandial responses
      to conventional (potato and cheese cream followed by vanilla cream) versus unconventional
      test meals (mixture of both creams) with identical composition (350 Kcal) and physical
      characteristics (colour, texture, consistency, temperature) but distinctively different
      palatability will be studied on a cross over-design. The responses to the meals will be
      tested on 2 different days.

      Participants (22 non-obese healthy men) will be instructed to eat a standard dinner the day
      before, to consume a standard breakfast at home after overnight fast, and to report to the
      laboratory, where the test meal will be administered 5 h after breakfast. Studies will be
      conducted in a quiet, isolated room with participants sitting on a chair. Perception will be
      measured at 5 min intervals 10 min before and 20 min after ingestion and at 10 min intervals
      up to 60 min after the probe meal.
