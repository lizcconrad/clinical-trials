    <textblock>
      Main aim of the COMBAT-CAD-Study is to clarify, if the combination of stress testing with
      biomarkers improves the diagnostic accuracy.

      Hypothesis of our study is that diagnosis of CAD can be improved by adding biomarkers to
      solely stress testing for the workup of patients with suspected CAD or progress of already
      known CAD.

      The COMBAT-CAD Study is an observational study with the aim to improve the diagnostic
      accuracy by a combination of stress testing with sensitive and specific biomarkers in
      detecting coronary artery disease or its progress. The main subjects are all patients with
      CAD or suspicion of CAD sent to the University Heart Center Hamburg. In these patients, ECG,
      laboratory examination, symptoms or transthoracic echocardiography in rest could not rule out
      CAD or progress of known CAD. The hypothesis of the study is that detection of CAD can be
      improved by adding biomarkers to stress testing for the diagnostic workup of patients with
      suspected CAD or progress of already known CAD.
