      The study aimed to present our experience in treating recurrent HCV genotype 4 infection post
      living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) since introduction of the second generation direct
      acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) in Egypt.

      This was a cohort study conducted in patients who had undergone LDLT for HCV related disease
      from 2014 to 2016 at in Ain Shams Center for Organ Transplantation (ASCOT) .The hypothesis
      early initiation of DAAs( after 12 weeks of the operation ) is effective and safe strategy in
      transplant recipients following LDLT. Patients who take the sofosbuvir and ribavirin after 6
      months after transplantation were compared with those who take early treatment after 3 months
      of transplantation with sofosbuvir and daclatsvir+/- ribavirin..Patients were on regular
      follow up visits monthly to assess the clinical condition, any side effects, laboratory tests
      including complete blood picture, liver functions , renal functions and trough level of
      immunosuppressant drugs.

    <description>A total number of 89 patients transplanted for HCV genotype 4 related end stage liver disease Were included in this study 53 PATIENTS were treated after 6 months of transplantation with sofosbuvir 400mg and weight based ribavirin for 24 weeks. 7 patients were treated with sofosbuvir 400mg + simeprevir 150 mg + weight based ribavirin for 12 weeks after 6 months post transplant. In September 2015, we started to adopt early treatment strategy for all recipients after the first 3months post- transplant. 26 recipients were treated with sofosbuvir 400mg+Daclatasvir 60mg Â± weight based ribavirin for 12 weeks or 24 weeks. 2 recipient are treated with sofosbuvir 400mg + ledipasvir 90mg for 24 weeks and one recipient is treated with fixed-dose combination of ombitasvir (12.5 mg), paritaprevir (75 mg) and ritonavir (50 mg) + weight based ribavirin due to having persistent renal impairment post transplantation.</description>
