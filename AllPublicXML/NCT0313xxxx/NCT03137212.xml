      Patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and thrombolysis indications,
      will be given the recombinant human prourokinase for thrombolysis treatment, and in
      accordance with the guidelines, will be treated with coronary angiography examination 3 to 24
      hours after thrombolysis. The study will explore the best time for interventional therapy
      combined with thrombolysis.

      The noninferiority multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study of urokinase of
      restructuring the original design evaluation (rhPro - UK) at different times after
      thrombolysis combined with percutaneous coronary intervention（PCI）therapy of acute ST segment
      elevation myocardial infarction.Patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial
      infarction and thrombolysis indications, will be given the recombinant human prourokinase for
      thrombolysis treatment, and in accordance with the guidelines, will be treated with coronary
      angiography examination 3 to 24 hours after thrombolysis. The study will explore the best
