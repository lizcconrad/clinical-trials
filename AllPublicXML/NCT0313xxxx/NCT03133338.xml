      The investigators aimed to evaluate the effect of early pelvic binder use in emergency
      management of suspected pelvic trauma, compared with the conventional stepwise approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no universal consensus on all aspects of management of pelvic injuries.

      Among patients with multiple injuries because of blunt trauma, 5%-16% sustain injuries to the
      pelvic ring, resulting in a mortality rate of 11%-54% primarily due to hemorrhagic shock. In
      theory, the reduction and stabilization of the pelvic ring can decrease bleeding from the
      fracture site, as reduction of pelvic volume has been shown to reduce the extent of
      hemorrhage from such injuries.The application of a pelvic binder has become part of the
      emergency care of all trauma patients with suspected pelvic fractures, in both the
      pre-hospital environment and emergency department (ED). The present study aimed to assess the
      effectiveness of the early use of pelvic binders to treat patients with a suspected high risk
      of pelvic bleeding from blunt force pelvic fractures.

        We enrolled trauma patients with initial stabilization using a pelvic binder for suspecting
        pelvic injury. Inclusion criteria were traumatic injury requiring a trauma team and at
        least one of the following: loss of consciousness or Glasgow coma score (GCS) &lt; 13;
        systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg; falling from ≥6 m; injury to multiple vital organs; and
        suspected pelvic injury. Various parameters, including gender, age, mechanism of injury,
        GCS, mortality, hospital stay, initial vital sign, revised trauma score, injury severity
        score, and outcome, were assessed and compared with historical controls.
