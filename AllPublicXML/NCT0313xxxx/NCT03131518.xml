  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need for a greater understanding of e-bikes and their role in the transportation
      network, and further effects on physical activity (PA) levels and health. Moreover, longtail
      bikes could meet certain practical needs not sufficiently fulfilled by e-bikes or traditional
      bikes, hence increased knowledge regarding their potential and feasibility should be
      obtained. No intervention study has investigated whether providing an e-bike or a longtail
      bike over an extended period in a sample of inactive parents of toddlers influence
      objectively assessed amount of cycling, total PA level, potential mode shifts, and effect on
      cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition and blood pressure.

      Objectives:

      To assess the effect of an intervention where participants have access to an e-bike
      (including a trailer), a longtail bike and a traditional bike (including a trailer) on the
      following parameters:

        1. Objectively assessed amount of biking, total levels of PA, and mode shifts from
           car/motorized modes to bicycle.

        2. Cardiorespiratory fitness, blood pressure, body composition, self-reported health and
           health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

        3. Experiences with bicycling (el/longtail/traditional) and intrinsic motivation for
           bicycling.

        4. How season and weather conditions influence the amount of bicycling
           (el/longtail/traditional).

        5. Potential spill-over effects on the participants' partners

      Study sample:

      A convenience sample consisting of 36 inactive parents of toddlers will be recruited among
      residents in Kristiansand municipality, Southern Norway.

      Measures:

      The following measures will be conducted at baseline and post all intervention arms, i.e. in
      total 4 times:

        1. A web-based questionnaire will assess socio-demographics (at baseline only),
           transportation habits, self-perceived health and HRQoL, and motivation for bicycling for
           transportation. Participants' partners will be requested to fill in the questionnaire at
           baseline and post-intervention to detect potential spill-over effects.

        2. Cycling time and distance will be assessed through usage of a cycle computer, and a
           smart-phone application throughout the entire project period, in total nine months.

           Time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) will be estimated with the monitor
           SenseWear Armband Mini (SWA) for seven consecutive days at study start and after 9
           months (post-intervention).

        3. Cardiorespiratory fitness will be measured performing treadmill walking/running, and
           dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be used for assessing body composition. In
           addition, blood pressure, body weight and height (height only at baseline) will be
           measured at baseline and post-intervention.

        4. Participants' experiences with and motivation for usage of the different bicycle types
           will be explored in semi-structured focus group interviews after 3 months, 6 months and
           9 months.

      Weather data (temperature, rainfall, snow, etc.) will also be collected.

      Scientific contribution:

      The present study will add knowledge to relevant and topical areas, i.e. issues related to
      public health and environmental sustainability, among parents of toddlers, representing an
      important target group.There is a call for research on the influence of e-bikes on travel
      behavior and level of MVPA, and whether voluntary cycling with e-bikes could improve health.
      Moreover, to our knowledge no scientific studies have assessed possible effects of using a
      longtail bike, on the selected parameters. If the current study reveals promising results, it
      should be replicated in a larger and more representative sample of parents of toddlers, as
      well as in other important target groups (e.g. older adults). If findings are positive,
      inclusion in national public health policies should be considered.
