  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability. The objectives of treatment are to
      reduce pain, improve function, and slow down further breakdown of the knee. Recently,
      research on nonsurgical treatment options for knee OA has increased significantly. One
      potential treatment of interest is the use of stem cell injections. Stem cells are one's own
      cells that have the ability to divide into other types of cells, and may cause regrowth of
      cartilage when injected into the knee. There have been few, but promising, studies that show
      improvements in pain and function with stem cell injections in those with knee OA. Therefore,
      more research is needed to identify patients who might benefit from this injection. This
      pilot study will look at changes in pain and function for 20 patients at 1, 3, 6, and 12
      months after a stem cell injection into the knee. Patients will also undergo magnetic
      resonance imaging at 6 months and 12 months following the injection.
