  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Violence in the workplace is becoming a serious phenomenon in the contemporary world of work.
      Hospital staff, like any employee working in contact with the public, is particularly exposed
      to this violence. In emergency departments, the number of patients treated and their
      heterogeneity, the problems of communicating with healthcare professionals, and waiting
      times, favor conflict situations. In the already tense context of the emergencies, the
      incivilities or violent acts have an impact on the well-being of professionals. In order to
      prevent these situations of violence, a solution could be to integrate a professional with
      specific skills into the teams to perform mediation functions between caregivers and
      patients.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of the presence of a mediator in emergency
      services on personal (verbal or physical) attacks on professionals (caregivers, doctors,
      administrative staff).
