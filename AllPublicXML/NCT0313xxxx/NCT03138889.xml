  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the safety and tolerability, define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to assess the preliminary clinical benefit of NKTR-214
      when combined with pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) or atezolizumab (Tecentriq®). Up to 30 patients
      will be enrolled concurrently in each combination arm. NKTR-214 in combination with
      pembrolizumab will be evaluated in select patients with metastatic melanoma, urothelial
      bladder cancer or non-small cell Lung cancer (NSCLC). NKTR-214 in combination with
      atezolizumab will be evaluated in select patients with urothelial bladder cancer or NSCLC.
      Both drugs target the immune system and may act synergistically to promote anticancer
      effects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NKTR-214 is a cytokine (investigational agent) that is designed to target CD122, a protein
      which is found on certain immune cells (known as CD8+ T Cells and Natural Killer Cells) to
      expand these cells to promote their anti-tumor effects. Pembrolizumab is a programmed death
      receptor -1 (PD-1) blocking antibody and atezolizumab is a fully humanized, engineered
      monoclonal antibody of IgG1 isotype against the protein programmed cell death-ligand 1
      (PD-L1) that promotes anti-tumor effects.

      The study will evaluate the clinical benefit, safety and tolerability of combining NKTR-214
      with pembrolizumab or atezolizumab and will enroll approximately 60 patients into two
      separate arms concurrently. The first arm will evaluate an every three-week dose regimen
      (q3w) of NKTR-214 in combination with pembrolizumab in up to 30 patients in approved
      treatment settings of pembrolizumab, including patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung
      cancer or bladder cancer. The second arm will evaluate a q3w dose regimen of NKTR-214 in
      combination with atezolizumab in up to 30 patients in approved treatment settings of
      atezolizumab, including patients with non-small cell lung cancer or bladder cancer. The first
      NKTR-214 dose to be studied will be 0.006 mg/kg q3w based on the safety observed in the
      monotherapy trial with NKTR-214 (Study 15-214-01, NCT02869295).
