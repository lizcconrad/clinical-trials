  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-confirmatory, randomized, subject and investigator blinded, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-design, multi-center bronchoprovocation study. Approximately 55 subjects with mild
      stable atopic asthma who exhibit an EAR and LAR to a common inhaled allergen will receive
      multiple once daily doses of inhaled CSJ117 or placebo over 12 weeks. Two sequential dose
      cohorts are planned for this study, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Cohort 2 will be split into two
      parts, Cohort 2a and 2b

    <description>An AE is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator drug or placebo that is given during any phase of the study. Adverse events starting on or after the time of the first inhalation of study drug are classified as a treatment emergent adverse event.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of stable mild atopic asthma, as defined by the American Thoracic Society/
             European Respiratory Society statement, who exhibit an early and late asthmatic
             response to a common inhaled allergen during the screening allergen inhalation
             challenge.

          -  Throughout the screening period and at baseline, only infrequent use of inhaled
             short-acting beta2-agonists (less than or equal to twice weekly) to treat asthma
             and/or prophylactic use prior to exercise. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist must be
             withheld for 8 hours before spirometry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalization or emergency room treatment for acute asthma in the 6 months prior to
             screening or during the screening period.

          -  Any worsening or exacerbation of asthma (e.g., an event requiring a change in
             treatment) in the six weeks before screening or during the screening period.

          -  A history of any clinically significant chronic pulmonary disease other than mild
             atopic asthma, including but not limited to COPD, interstitial lung disease or
             bronchiectasis

          -  Use of immunosuppressive medications or allergen-specific immunotherapy within 6
             months prior to screening.
