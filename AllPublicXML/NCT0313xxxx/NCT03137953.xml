  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In gingivobuccal complex tumors, the skin margin is assessed by palpation (skin pinch test).
      There is no objective method of assessment of skin margin. This study is to evaluate the role
      of computed tomography/MRI with contrast in assessing the deep surgical margin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients of buccal mucosa squamous cell carcinomas after histopathological confirmation
      are selected for the study. As a routine computed tomography imaging/MRI with contrast will
      be done preoperatively.

      The involvement of the skin is assessed by the palpation (skin pinch test). In imaging, the
      distance between the base of the tumour and the skin of the cheek is measured. If the
      distance between the base of the tumour and the skin is more than 5mm, then the skin is
      spared and the tumour is excised with 5 mm margin, if the distance is less than 5mm, then the
      skin is excised along with the tumour. The specimen will be sent for histopathological
      examination, and the depth of invasion of the tumour is measured and the clearance of the
      deep surgical margin is assessed.

      The difference between clinical examination and imaging and histopathological confirmation of
      the specimen in determining the number of cases where skin preservation is done is assessed.

    <intervention_model_description>Examination of the distance between the skin and the base of the tumour would be evaluated clinically (skin Pinch Test) and by CT/MRI with contrast. Post resection, histopathological examination of tumour margins would confirm if the base of the tumour is free or not. The proportion of cases where skin is preserved would be compared to the proportion of cases where skin would have been preserved based on clinical examination would be assessed.</intervention_model_description>
