      The aim of the multi-centre study is to evaluate correctly the impact of three dimensional
      visualization on operation strategy and complications for complex hepatic carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the complexity of complex hepatic carcinoma,the limitations of 2D images of CT/MRI
      and the uncertainty of surgeons'experience, it is difficult for the surgeons to diagnosis and
      assess the operation strategy accurately based on traditional 2D imaging(CT/MRI).The aim of
      the multi-centre study is to evaluate correctly the impact of three-dimensional visualization
      on operation strategy and complications for complex hepatic carcinoma.

    <measure>Impact on operation strategy of three dimensional visualization technique</measure>
    <time_frame>2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Firstly, the operation strategies based on original CT or MRI image data will be made by the team, Secondly, the operation strategies based on three dimensional reconstruction models will be made by the team, then, actually surgical strategies will be recorded. The change of operation strategy will be assessed by comparing the strategy of the 2D model and 3D model. The change rate of operation strategy will be recorded and presented as percentage.</description>
