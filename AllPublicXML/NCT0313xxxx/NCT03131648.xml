      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab compared with placebo in treating moderate to severe
      AD.

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab on severity and extent of AD, itch, and health
      related quality of life compared with placebo.

      Maintenance objective:

      To evaluate maintenance of effect with continued tralokinumab dosing up to 52 weeks compared
      to placebo for subjects achieving clinical response at Week 16.

    <masking_description>Neither the subject nor any of the investigator or LEO staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. The packaging and labelling of the IMPs will contain no evidence of their identity.
Since tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct and not matched for viscosity, IMP will be handled and administered by a qualified, unblinded HCP at the site who will not be involved in the management of trial subjects and who will not perform any of the assessments.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjects with Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject's global AD and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjects achieving at least 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI]</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and/or more extensive condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) from baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The SCORAD is a validated tool to evaluate the extent and severity of AD lesions, along with subjective symptoms. The maximum total score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus numeric rating scale (weekly average) of at least 4 from baseline to Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will assess their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours using an 11 point NRS ('Worst Daily Pruritus NRS') with 0 indicating 'no itch' and 10 indicating 'worst itch imaginable'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score from baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their quality of life (QoL) over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4 point Likert scale (0 = not at all ⁄not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 = very much). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor QoL.</description>
