  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunctional chronic diffuse pain syndrome, concerning 2% of the French population,
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is classified either as a psychological disease or as a somatic disease.
      This dichotomous reasoning does not lead to a better understanding and does not allow the use
      or development of new psychological tools of care.

      The issue of the proximity between FM and depression highlighted by some authors and the
      presence of anxious comorbidities may arise at a different level, that of the transdiagnostic
      approach. Rumination is one of these transdiagnostic processes that are the subject of recent
      studies and one of the dimensions of which (abstract analytical rumination) is at work in
      depression and a number of psychopathologies. The investigator therefore wishes to explore
      the process of rumination and its abstract analytical dimension in FM and to explore its link
      with the depressive and anxious manifestations frequently associated with this disorder.
