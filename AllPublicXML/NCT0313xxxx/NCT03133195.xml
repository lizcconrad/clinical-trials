  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase III, prospective, randomized, parallel, double blind, placebo-controlled study to
      determine whether Teriparatide can accelerate bone healing in unstable intertrochanteric
      fracture patients treated with Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) assessed by
      radiographic and clinical outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo screening assessment to determine the eligibility for study
      participation and will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive Teriparatide 20 μg or placebo
      subcutaneous once daily for 12 weeks.

      All patients will receive supplements of 1000 mg/day of elemental calcium and 20,000 IU/week
      of vitamin D2.

      Patients will be scheduled to clinic visit for radiographic and clinical assessment at 2,
      6,12 and 24 weeks postoperatively. Each participant will be in the study for 6 months in
      total.

         10. Current treatment with digoxin and necessary to continue use during the study

         11. Concurrent treatment with oral bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulator
             (SERMs), calcitonin, estrogen (oral, transdermal, or injection), progestin, estrogen
             analog, estrogen agonist, estrogen antagonist or tibolone, and active vitamin D3
             analogs. (Previous treatment is allowed but must be discontinued at screening)

         12. Previous treatment with strontium ranelate for any duration, intravenous
             bisphophonates within 12 months prior to the screening date, and/or denosumab within 6
             months prior to the screening.

         13. Previous treatment with teriparatide, PTH or other PTH analogs, or prior participation
             in any other clinical trial studying teriparatide, PTH or other PTH analogs
