  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is widely used in the clinics to reduce spasticity and
      improve upper limb function for post-stroke patients. However, there were no studies to
      compare the effect of rESWT and BoNT-A injection for treatment on spasticity.

      Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is widely used in the clinics to reduce spasticity and
      improve upper limb function for post-stroke patients. However, the treatments of BoNT-A
      injection are associated with high cost and invasive treatment. Recent studies have showed
      that radial extracorporeal shock wave (rESWT) is a novel, effective and safety treatment
      method for the spasticity. However, there were no studies to compare the effect of rESWT and
      BoNT-A injection for treatment on spasticity.

    <description>42 chronic stroke patients with upper limb spasticity were randomly assigned to receive either 1 session of ESWT per week for 3 consecutive weeks or BoNT-A injection. The biceps, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles were treated. Assessments were performed at baseline and at 1, 4, and 8 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) score for the elbow from the baseline to after 4 weeks of treatment.</description>
