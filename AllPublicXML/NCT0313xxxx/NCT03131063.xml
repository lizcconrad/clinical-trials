    <textblock>
      The PHARMECMO study is a pilot, prospective, pharmacokinetic study, conducted in a cardiac
      surgery intensive care unit of 18 beds. Optimization of antibiotic therapy for extracorporeal
      membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients remains a pharmacological challenge. Clinical studies
      suggest that individualized dosing strategies and therapeutic drug monitoring could
      facilitate the achievement of adequate antibiotic concentration. The objective of this pilot
      study was to observe the pharmacokinetic characteristics of commonly used antibiotics in
      intensive care for patients treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

    <description>Every adult patient admitted to ICU, under ECMO treatment, with known or suspected sepsis and receiving antibiotic therapy, was eligible for inclusion. The concentration of the studied antibiotics was determined by a combination of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry from blood samples. For intermittent administration of antibiotic, two successive samples were performed both at 50% (Cmax) and 100% (Cmin) of the dosing interval.</description>

        Patients were selected from patients hospitalized in cardiac surgical intensive care units
        with clinico-biological elements in favor of sepsis and for whom antibiotic therapy was
        instituted. An ECMO treatment before study enrollement was required.
