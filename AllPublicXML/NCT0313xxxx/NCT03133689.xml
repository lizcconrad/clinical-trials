  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine if long-term patterns of alcohol consumption are
      associated with time-to-onset for incident coronary heart disease (fatal and non-fatal),
      using data from multiple cohorts.

    <textblock>
      The relationship between alcohol consumption and coronary heart disease (CHD) remains an
      issue of debate. By capturing drinking trajectories over time, we may be equipped to obtain
      new insights into this relationship. Studies have shown that such trajectories have
      differential associations for intermediate traits (carotid intima-media thickness, pulse wave
      velocity and inflammatory markers), but no studies exist that link stability of drinking to
      actual CHD. The current study will employ a longitudinal cohort design to evaluate the
      association between long-term alcohol consumption trajectories and time-to-event for CHD.
      Data will be drawn from six cohorts (five British, one French). The combined participant pool
      comprises 64,926 individuals (58% male, individual cohort sizes ranging from 1,444 to 25,636
      participants); those with a baseline history of CHD will be excluded. Repeat alcohol intake
      measurements across a 10-year interval will be the exposure, with participants' intake
      trajectory defined according to their alcohol consumption volume and its consistency over
      time. To account for heterogeneity across cohorts, individual participant data meta-analysis
      methods will be employed in determining CHD diagnosis rates and hazard ratios for the
      different intake trajectories, with adjustment for relevant demographic and clinical
      characteristics. Results from the modelling work illustrating the form and magnitude of the
      association between the alcohol intake categories and CHD will be presented.

      This work will help further understanding of the role that alcohol intake and its stability
      over time play in subsequent CHD risk, and will have implications for our understanding of
      alcohol's relationship to cardiovascular health in the general population.

    <description>This cohort comprises 25,636 residents of a predefined English healthcare region (11,606 men and 14,030 women). Participants in this cohort study were originally recruited from 35 general practices in Norfolk, England as part of an investigation into diet and cancer, but the study's scope was subsequently widened to include additional outcomes including cardiovascular diseases.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>GAZEL</arm_group_label>
    <description>This cohort comprises 20,625 employees of French gas and electricity companies (15,011 men and 5,614 women). The cohort commenced data collection in 1989 and follow-up assessments were subsequently completed on an annual basis. The data have undergone linkage to national health administrative datasets.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>NSHD</arm_group_label>
    <description>This dataset comes from the 1946 National Birth Cohort study, which comprises all persons born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week in March 1946. The cohort comprises 5,362 individuals (2,815 men and 2,547 women). Data have been collected from participants on a regular basis throughout their life, including information on lifestyle and, in combination with administrative datasets, on health outcomes.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Twenty-07-1930s</arm_group_label>
    <description>This cohort comprises 1,551 Scottish participants (702 men and 849 women) born around 1932 who were recruited in 1986 as part of a study of health inequalities. The repeated nature of the data collection will enable identification of longitudinal alcohol intake patterns, while linkage to Scottish health system records will enable identification of coronary heart disease onset.</description>

    <description>This cohort comprises 1,444 Scottish participants (656 men and 788 women) born around 1952 who were recruited in 1986, alongside the T-07-1930s' cohort, as part of a study of health inequalities. Participant health was tracked through linkage with national health records.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Whitehall II</arm_group_label>
    <description>This cohort comprises 10,308 British civil servants (6,895 men and 3,413 women). The cohort study commenced data collection in 1985 and participants have since undergone questionnaire and clinical assessments across regular intervals. Additional tracking of health outcomes has been performed through linkage with administrative databases. Demographic, behavioural and clinical data will be sourced from this cohort for the purposes of the current study.</description>
