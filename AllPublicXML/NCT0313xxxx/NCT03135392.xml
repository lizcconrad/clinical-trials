  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissue Expander/Implant Reconstruction: The purpose of this study is to determine how and
      when nerve sensation to the breast skin returns after mastectomy.

      Autologous Tissue Reconstruction: The purpose of this study is to determine whether the
      tissue being used to reconstruct your breast can provide sensation by using your own nerves.
      Typically all sensation is lost immediately after this type of surgery and returns to varying
      degrees. We are hoping to demonstrate that by connecting the two nerves (one from abdomen and
      one from the chest wall) together, we can attain meaningful sensation in the transferred
      tissues thereby improving your quality of life following surgery.

      To determine the timing and distribution of sensation recovery of breast after mastectomy and
      breast reconstruction, both with autologous and implant-based reconstruction. Also, to
      determine the role of innervated free tissue transfer in breast reconstruction.

      Specific Aims

        1. Determine the timing and degree of return of breast in women who underwent mastectomy
           with autologous tissue or with implant based reconstruction.

        2. Determine sensation following neurotized free flap reconstruction

        3. Determine whether neurotization has an impact on quality of life measures post
           operatively

      Study Design Patients will be enrolled prospectively in this data collection study in which
      they will receive the standard of care for breast cancer resection and oncologically safe and
      accepted means of breast reconstruction with tissue expander and/or prosthetic implants.
      Patients will receive additional, non-invasive sensory testing, performed at standard follow
      up intervals in clinic by their reconstructive team. All patients participating in the study
      will be consented for enrollment at the pre-operative visit by either the surgeon or
      physician assistant. As this is a prospective study, all women fitting inclusion criteria
      over a 6-month minimal, but projected goal 12-month period will be included.

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants who are having implant reconstruction will act as controls for all other breast reconstructions. If the participant is having autologous tissue reconstruction, she will be randomly put into one of the study groups. Neither the study doctor nor the participant can choose the treatment. Assignment is done randomly, like the flip of a coin. If the participant is having only one breast reconstructed, she will be randomly assigned to either receive the nerve reconstruction or not.
If the participant is having both of her breasts reconstructed, one side will receive the nerve reconstruction and one will not. The participant will not know which group you have been assigned to until the completion of the study or if voluntarily withdraw from the study</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite measure of sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Differences of at least 20% comparing control to experimental breasts would be clinically meaningful. Composite measure will be calculated by combining the follow binomial factors: detection of temperature difference (feeling hot and cold), detection of sharp versus dull pressure, detection of vibration, discerning point pressure</description>

    <description>A total of 20 Likert scale questions will be given to participants in the pre- and post-Surgical Sensation Questionnaire to provide a change in quality of life and sensation before and after reconstruction</description>
