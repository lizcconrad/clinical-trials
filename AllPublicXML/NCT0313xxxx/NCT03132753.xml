  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to develop and assess the effectiveness of Substance Use Programming
      for Person-Oriented Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT), a community-driven recovery-oriented
      system of care for individuals recently released from prison. SUPPORT is modeled after
      Indiana Access to Recovery (ATR), a program that operated between October 2007 and December
      2014. ATR, a national initiative funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
      Administration (SAMHSA), provided comprehensive, flexible, recovery-oriented services for
      substance use disorder (SUD). The investigators' local evaluation of this program
      demonstrated significant improvement in a number of recovery-related outcomes (e.g.,
      substance use, employment, income, involvement in the criminal justice system, and emotional
      well-being) for clients between intake and discharge. Additionally, qualitative findings from
      this evaluation demonstrated ATR was well liked among clients and providers. While Indiana
      ATR did serve a wider range of clients, the investigators have focused SUPPORT on returning
      inmates because (a) this was the largest group served by the program and (b) there is
      significant need for evidence-based SUD interventions for this population.

      The investigators' primary long-term goal is to establish an effective and scalable
      recovery-oriented system of care for SUD within the reentry population. The investigators
      will conduct a pilot test comparing SUPPORT clients to clients receiving usual treatment. The
      investigators will collect quantitative data for both groups at multiple time points to
      understand the intervention's impact on recovery capital and outcomes and will collect
      qualitative data from SUPPORT clients to better understand their program and post-discharge
      experiences.

      The investigators will conduct the pilot at Public Advocates in Community Re-Entry (PACE), a
      nonprofit that provides services to individuals with felony convictions in Marion County
      Indiana. PACE has provided re-entry services in Marion County, IN for 55 years. PACE's
      services are divided into four distinct categories: transitional, employment, addiction, and
      pre-release services. It is the only former ATR agency in Marion County specializing in a
      re-entry population, and our evaluation of Indiana's program demonstrated they had
      significantly lower rates of recidivism than any other Marion County agency. In 2015, PACE
      served 1,703 new clients.

      The investigators will recruit 80 clients for participation in the pilot, half (40) will be
      assigned to SUPPORT and half (40) to treatment as usual. SUPPORT clients will be offered 12
      months of support service with a PACE recovery coach. The recovery coach will guide the
      SUPPORT client through their recovery, offering guidance and support, while coordinating
      their treatment services, including support services. The SUPPORT program will provide
      SUPPORT clients with $1,000 worth of vouchers to cover the cost of additional flexible
      support services over the 12 months of program enrollment, which will be personalized to fit
      the needs of the client. These cost vouchers will cover similar support services as the
      previous Access to Recovery (ATR) program, such as housing (permanent, transitional),
      employment services (training, placement, readiness), substance use treatment,
      transportation, childcare, educational or vocational services, or aftercare planning. The
      costs of each service is determined by the service provider. Clients will NOT be responsible
      for keeping track of their vouchers, but rather, his/her assigned recovery coach will track
      all voucher funding/spending. Further, the recovery coach will assist the client in choosing
      appropriate services and coordinating/monitoring service completion.

      Clients in the treatment as usual group will have significantly reduced choices in services
      compared to SUPPORT clients. These clients will not receive vouchers to access support
      services such as transportation and housing and will only receive standard case management,
      which is more prescriptive and less intensive than the recovery consultant services provided
      through SUPPORT.

      All PACE clients who are over the age of 18, have a SUD, are no longer incarcerated (in a
      prison, jail, or work release facility), and are unable to access the previously mentioned
      Recovery Works program, will be eligible for study participation. For both parolees and
      probationers the risk of recidivism is highest in the first year of release; therefore, the
      investigators will be connecting with clients during the initial months following releases.
      The investigators will also be excluding sex offenders from the pilot, as they face greater
      barriers to community integration and experience higher levels of supervision while on
      parole, which have the potential to confound results during a small-scale pilot. Once a
      potential client is released from incarceration and enrolled at PACE, if eligible, an intake
      worker will inform them of the opportunity to participate in the pilot study and describe the
      SUPPORT program services. If the client agrees to participate in the pilot, they will sign a
      consent form and be randomly assigned to either SUPPORT or a treatment as usual condition. If
      a participant in either the SUPPORT or treatment as usual group is re-incarcerated during the
      study period, the investigators will not engage them while under correctional supervision to
      collect data and the investigators will replace them with a new participant. However, if a
      participant is re-incarcerated but released back into the community during the study period,
      and reengages with PACE, they will continue to be a part of the study and the investigators
      will continue to collect data and offer them SUPPORT services. In short, for the purposes of
      this pilot, the investigators will not be collecting data from clients while incarcerated.

      Quantitative:

      PACE will hire and assign two recovery coaches to provide SUPPORT services for the pilot.
      Once hired, the recovery coaches will complete all required IRB training and receive training
      on data collection and the informed consent procedures. The names of these recovery coaches
      will be added to the IRB protocol through an IRB amendment, having completed all required
      training, before interacting with subjects.

      In addition to providing the support services, recovery coaches will 1) go over the statement
      of informed consent and Authorization form and have willing participants provide their
      signature, 2) conduct an initial interview with all clients after they have provided informed
      consent (to be included at the beginning of the electronic data collection) and have been
      assigned to the SUPPORT or comparison group, and 3) collect electronic data using REDCap
      system at the designated time points. Recovery consultants will collect data through a
      computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) (i.e., individual interviews assisted by computer
      technology.) Consultants will conduct interviews in a private room, away from other
      individuals so that others may not overhear what is discussed. Each consultant will have a
      tablet computer through which they will access the REDCap system. After the consultant has
      collected all necessary service or background data, the REDCap system will instruct them to
      hand the tablet over to the client to allow them to answer the remaining questions (regarding
      Self Determination, Treatment Motivation, Self Efficacy, Stages of Change, Substance Use, and
      Quality of Life) independently. The recovery coach will hand the tablet to the client and
      move so they cannot see their responses. Instructions will appear on the tablet telling the
      client to ask questions should they need assistance with either the tablet or answering a
      question. Should the client need assistance using the tablet or answering a question, the
      recovery coach will be available to help. During the screening process (i.e. client
      enrollment), client illiteracy will be picked up. Should a client be illiterate, they will
      still be invited to participate, but a recovery coach will read the questions rather than
      asking them to answer the questions independently.

      CAPI interviews will be conducted with all clients (SUPPORT and non-SUPPORT) at baseline and
      6 and 12 months to understand change in outcomes overtime. Consultants will also conduct a
      CAPI interview at 15 months with SUPPORT clients only to understand retention of treatment
      effects three months post discharge. Based on our previous experience conducting CAPI
      interviews, the investigators expect this process to take between 60 and 90 minutes.

      CAPI Data collection measures include: demographic and background information on all clients
      at baseline; including: date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, housing
      history, education, employment history, and past involvement in addiction recovery and
      treatment. The investigators will also collect a number of measures, including (1)
      agency/self-determination, (2) recovery capital (i.e. treatment motivation, social
      support/networks, and self-efficacy), and (3) recovery-related outcomes (frequency of
      substance use and abstinence, incremental progress towards recovery, quality of life,
      recidivism, and administrative data on housing status, education, employment, income,
      physical and mental health status, and attendance at self-report self-help groups.)

      Additionally, IU researchers will conduct structured social network interviews within one
      week of the client's entrance in the study and at 12 months. Social support is a proven
      influential factor on recovery. Having relationships and social networks that provide
      support, friendship, love, and hope through the process of recovery improves outcomes. The
      recovery coaches that work in the SUPPORT program will work with the clients to utilize their
      recovery support services to strengthen the individual's place in the community as a
      productive community member, family member, and worker, and, ideally, improve the quality of
      clients' interpersonal relationships and likelihood of positive recovery outcomes. This study
      will measure social support as a recovery-related outcome to see if the program is able to
      positively impact the social support in clients' lives over the course of 12 months. The
      total data collection time for these interviews will be between 30 and 60 minutes depending
      on the number of individuals in the client's network. At the time of the second network
      interview, the investigators will also collect qualitative data on SUPPORT client's overall
      program experience. During these interviews, the client will be asked for the first names and
      last initial of people who provide certain types of social support in his/her life.

      Qualitative:

      IU researchers will also collect qualitative data from both group through semi-structured
      interviews. The purpose of the interviews is to develop an understanding of client's
      treatment experience and how the SUPPORT program may have assisted them in overcoming
      barriers to recovery. These interviews are expected to take between 45 and 60 minutes.
      Guiding questions for the interview include: &quot;Describe what you liked/did not like about the
      SUPPORT program (probe: client-centeredness, self-determination).&quot;; &quot;How was your
      relationship with your recover consultant?&quot;; &quot;Overall, how has the program helped you in your
      recovery? (probe: motivation; social capital; quality of life; elimination of barriers)&quot;;
      &quot;Are there specific things the program helped you with that you would not have been able to
      do on your own?&quot;; &quot;How did the program help you not return to jail (for those who did not
      recidivate)/How could the program have assisted your better so you would not have returned to
      jail (for those who did recidivate)?&quot;; &quot;If you experienced a relapse in the program, how did
      the program help you through that?&quot;; &quot;If you could change anything about SUPPORT, what would
      it be? Why?&quot; (Attachment: Qualitative Interview Questions)

      Also, researchers will conduct focus groups with SUPPORT clients after their 15-month CAPI
      interview. The researchers will conduct between 5 and 8 focus groups with 5-10 participants
      each. The researchers will attempt to recruit all SUPPORT clients for focus groups. Focus
      groups will last between 60 and 90 minutes and will be audio recorded.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Social Support (measured using the Social Networks tool)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months for 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is an interviewer-administered questionnaire to assess whom respondents depend on for help in important general matters and specific health matters.
This measure captures each of the respondent's network members and a complete assessment of network structure to construct the respondent's social network and whom they rely on for help with health-related and other matters. Social networks are known to affect the decisions people make and have been shown to affect health outcomes related to mental and physical health (Pescosolido &amp; Wright, 2004; Stein et al., 1995).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Self Efficacy (measured using the General Self Efficacy Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months for 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of an individual's belief about whether problems or barriers can be confronted and addressed with a successful outcome.
The scale generated by this assessment can be used to determine how the respondent copes with daily hassles and adapts to stressful life events. Self-efficacy is indicative of subsequent behavior and can be used for clinical practice and psychological research.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the Frequency of Substance Use (measured using the Frequency of Drug Use scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months for 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measures self-reported drug use for the following drugs: alcohol, sedative, tranquilizers, painkillers, stimulants, marijuana, cocaine, crack, hallucinogens, inhalants, heroin, and prescription medications.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in readiness to change (measured using the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES))</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months for 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SOCRATES is a 19-item experimental instrument designed to assess readiness for change in alcohol abusers. The instrument yields three factorially-derived scale scores: Recognition (Re), Ambivalence (Am), and Taking Steps (Ts). The SOCRATES differs from URICA, also a stages of change measure, in that the SOCRATES poses questions specifically about alcohol or other drug use, whereas URICA asks about the client's &quot;problem&quot; and change in a more general manner. Version 8 is reduced nineteen item scale based on factor analyses with prior versions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Quality of Life (measured using the Current Quality of Life scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 months for 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of an individual's perceived general physical and mental health during the past 30 days.
Self-perception of current physical and mental health is indicative of a person's current health and future health outcomes. The general assessment of health, in itself, has been shown to be both a solid measure of self-reported health and a powerful predictor of mortality and morbidity.</description>
