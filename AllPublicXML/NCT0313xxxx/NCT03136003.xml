  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with mild hemophilia A (MHA) bleed infrequently but can in the setting of trauma
      which often is when participating in sports/exercise. Although both exercise and DDAVP
      (desmopressin) can raise Factor 8/Von Willebrand Factor (FVIII/VWF levels), it is not clear
      whether the pathophysiological mechanism is the same. Consequently it is not known if DDAVP
      and exercise would have additive effects in raising FVIII:C and VWF levels or if one would
      one negate the effect of the other. The aim of this 2 center (Sickkids and Columbus, Ohio),
      prospective, cross-over design study is to compare the impact of exercise vs. DDAVP on
      hemostasis in patients with MHA and also to investigate the impact of sequentially
      administering these interventions on their hemostatic indices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with mild hemophilia A (MHA) (defined as having a FVIII level of &gt;5% to ≈40%) bleed
      infrequently but can in the setting of trauma which can often is in the context of
      participating in sports/exercise. FVIII levels temporarily rise with stress, exercise and
      with DDAVP (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, desmopressin). In the case of DDAVP, the
      Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) Hemophilia Team and others have shown that FVIII and
      VWF levels rise by 2-4 fold with DDAVP. Consequently many persons with MHA in an attempt to
      reduce their risk of bleeding take intranasal (IN) DDAVP prior to sports activities/exercise.
      IN DDAVP is reasonably expensive ($300/bottle of Octostim® in Canada and $700/bottle of
      Stimate® in USA), requires fluid restriction, and may be associated with nausea, vomiting,
      seizures and tachyphylaxis.

      Recently, our group completed a pilot/feasibility study to evaluate the impact of a
      prescribed, moderate intensity aerobic exercise regimen on hemostatic indices in 30 children
      with hemophilia A [HA] or B [HB] (all severities) and documented a significant improvement in
      multiple coagulation parameters (platelet count, FVIII:C and von Willebrand factor [VWF])
      with exercise. This improvement was particularly pronounced in 13 post-adolescent males with
      mild-moderate HA. In this sub-cohort, we noted a mean 2.3 fold increase in FVIII:C
      immediately after exercise, which remained significantly elevated at 1.9 fold,1 hour after
      completion of exercise

      These changes in hemostatic variables associated with aerobic exercise may be protective
      against bleeding, and may negate the need to administer IN DDAVP immediately prior to sports
      participation.

      Although both exercise and DDAVP can raise FVIII/VWF levels, it is not clear whether the
      pathophysiological mechanism in which they do this is the same. Consequently it is not known
      if DDAVP and exercise would augment each other's effects in raising FVIII:C and VWF levels or
      if one would one negate the effect of the other. Herein, we propose a prospective,
      interventional study of exercise vs IN DDAVP in 40-50 post adolescent (13-21 yr) males with
      MHA to compare their impact on hemostasis and also to investigate the impact of sequentially
      administering these interventions on hemostatic indices.

    <description>The participant will exercise on a stationary cycle-ergometer using the previously-validated, progressively-incremental Godfrey protocol. Per the Godfrey protocol, the participant starts cycling on the calibrated cycle-ergometer with an initial exercise load dependent on their height. The workload is increased every minute in standard increments also based on the participant's height. All participants will exercise until they complete 3-minutes of cycling at 85% of their maximum predicted heart rate or exhaustion (whichever is first). Upon completion of planned exercise, work load is decreased to zero watts and participants will continue cycling at this cool-down rate for an additional 3-minutes, before getting off the ergometer.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients ≥13 years of age and ≤21 years of age with Mild Hemophilia A (MHA), with a
             historical baseline FVIII:C level of ≥5% to ≤40% followed at either the Hospital for
             Sick Children or St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto).

          -  Patients ≥13 years of age and ≤21 years of age with genetically confirmed Mild
             Hemophilia A (MHA), with FVIII:C level of ≥5% to ≤50% followed at either the Hospital
             for Sick Children or St. Michael's Hospital (Toronto).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A currently circulating or history of a previous inhibitor ( ≥0.5 BU) within the past
             5 years. As inhibitor development in MHA is rare, it is not expected that any patient
             will be excluded for this reason.

          -  Any FVIII infusion or DDAVP use in the preceding week. This is to avoid an residual
             FVIII still being present in a patient who has taken an extended half-life FVIII.

          -  Co-existence of a congenital bleeding disorder other than MHA (e.g. VWD).

          -  Prior history of coronary artery disease or pulmonary disease, severe arthropathy
             interfering with ability to exercise.

          -  Patients on beta-blockers, anti-platelet agents or regular non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. Celebrex).

          -  Patients with an active infectious or inflammatory condition. This includes HIV,
             active hepatitis B or C as reflected in elevated AST, ALT, RNA positivity for
             hepatitis B or C.

          -  Patients who are active (defined as smoking daily) smokers (cigarettes, marijuana).
             This exclusion is put into place as we do not know if daily smoking will impact on the
             hemostatic response to either exercise or DDAVP.

          -  Patients with limited exercise tolerance for any reason.

          -  Patients with a history of a recent bleed (in preceding 2 weeks) in any location, or a
             joint/muscle bleed in the lower limbs in the preceding 4 weeks.

          -  Patients who for medical reasons should not receive DDAVP [those with renal or CNS
             disease (e.g. brain tumor)] or have previously experienced adverse events with DDAVP
             (e.g. hypotensive event; seizure).

    <ipd_description>To ensure the safety of patients and to confirm the validity of our hypothesis, we plan to:
Meet after the first 10 patients have completed the study.
Analyze data from first 10 patients. This includes safety data as well as results of the blood tests including the standard hemostasis testing (FVIII;C, VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, VWF:CBA, VWF:pp), and platelet function (PFA).
Determine whether there are measurable outcomes justifying further enrollment and DSMB will be able to make recommendations regarding terminating the study or amending the protocol if they deem that there are safety issues.
If any of the first 10 subjects develops any unexpected medical complication we will suspend recruitment pending re-evaluation of the study by the DSMB.</ipd_description>
