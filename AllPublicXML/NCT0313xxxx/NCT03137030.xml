  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to compare concentrations of hydrocodone and
      acetaminophen in the blood after administration of different amounts of tablets of a new and
      a marketed tablet formulation in healthy adults.

      Part 1 is a randomized, single-site, open-label, 4-treatment, 4-period crossover, single oral
      dose Phase I trial in 32 healthy male and female subjects. Part will consist of an Enrollment
      Visit, 4 treatment periods (each lasting approximately 90 hours), and a Final Examination.
      The treatment periods will be separated by a washout period each lasting at least 7 days.

      Part 2 is optional and depending on pharmacokinetic data review after Part 1. It is a
      randomized, single-site, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover, single oral dose part
      in healthy male and female subjects. Part 2 will consist of an Enrollment Visit, 2 treatment
      periods (each lasting approximately 90 hours) and a Final Examination. The treatment periods
      will be separated by a washout period lasting at least 7 days.

      Participants must fast for approximately 10 hours prior to administration of Investigational
      medicinal product (IMP) and until approximately 4 hours after the administration of the IMP.

             safety laboratory parameters (hematology, clinical chemistry, clotting, and
             urinalysis).

          -  From the first administration of IMP until at least 4 weeks (for women)/90 days (for
             men) after the Final Examination, subjects must agree to use highly effective
             contraception with a low failure rate defined as &lt;1% per year.

          -  For female subjects of childbearing potential:

               -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception.

        women of childbearing potential from the first application of IMP until at least 90 days
        after the Final Examination. The male subject has to be willing to ensure that the female
        sexual partner uses at least 1 additional method of contraception with a low failure rate
        defined as &lt;1% per year until at least 90 days after the Final Examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  ratio.

               -  Exclusion range met for urinalysis or lactate dehydrogenase, potassium, total
                  protein, sodium, calcium, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, or
                  platelets.

               -  Out-of-reference range value for any other safety laboratory parameter that is
                  judged as clinically relevant by the investigator.
