  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to reduce the amount of sugar in a particular food item and add spices to see
      if the food liking of that item rates as high or higher in a post meal survey. Through taste
      testing of the menu items (using sequential monadic CLT methodology) the investigators will
      determine an opinion of the participants. Results of these surveys will determine whether
      participants enjoy the reduced sugar options as much as their full sugar counterparts.

      The investigators will compare the overall consumer acceptability of each of three test items
      (tea, oatmeal and apple crisp) across the three test conditions using central location test
      (CLT) and cross-over design. The three test conditions for each test item will be (1) Full
      sugar (&quot;FS&quot;), (2) reduced sugar (and calorie) with no added spice (&quot;RS&quot;) and (3) reduced
      sugar (and calorie) plus spice (&quot;RSS&quot;). The two reduced sugar items will be matched for
      calories. Subjects will be provided the test items using sequential monadic CLT methodology
      (Central Location Test methodology which involves product evaluation after a brief exposure
      (one sample-subject contact) under standardized conditions whereby subjects are given each of
      the 3 recipes of each test item (e.g., oatmeal with full sugar, oatmeal with reduced sugar,
      oatmeal with reduced plus spice) back to back (all within one sitting) in a random order. The
      investigators are interested in using the sequential monadic CLT methodology and having
      subjects taste all 3 recipes of each item in one sitting which is a commonly used test
      modality for sensory studies.
