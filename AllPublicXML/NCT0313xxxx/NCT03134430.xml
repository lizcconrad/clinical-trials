  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported local anesthetics could inhibit tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and
      invasion ability，but it is still lack of clinical evidence. Our study aims to explore the
      effects of regional nerve block on cancer recurrence and the mechanism.

      1. To study the effects of TAP block under ultrasound guide on the recurrence of gastric
           carcinoma, colon cancer, rectal carcinoma and liver cancer and the underlying
           mechanisms.

        2. To clarify the effects of Lateral thoracic nerve block under ultrasound guide on the
           recurrence of lung cancer and the underlying mechanisms.
