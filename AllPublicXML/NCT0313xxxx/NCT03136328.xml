  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 40 patients with histologically and/or clinically confirmed and/or suspected NET are
      anticipated to be enrolled during 3 years from initiating the study.

      Patients will be recruited at Montefiore Medical Park where there is a medical group
      specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of NETs. Each patient will undergo a screening
      visit within 14 days prior to receiving study medication.

      The primary goal of the analysis is to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-DOTATOC PETCT
      for detecting NET compared to conventional imaging techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Phase 2, single center study in a total of 40 subjects with
      Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs). Study participants will receive 68Ga-DOTATOC and undergo a
      PET/CT imaging study, to investigate its suitability as a PET imaging agent for NETs. The
      radiation (imaging) dose will be 111-185 MBq (3 - 5 mCi) ± 25%. All doses after labeling will
      be presented in buffered solution for intravenous injection. Imaging will start 90 ±30
      minutes after injection.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuroendocrine tumor detectability through PET/CT imaging of its somatostatin receptors.</measure>
    <time_frame>Sensitivity and specificity of this imaging technique will be compared with those of conventional imaging modality including CT, MRI and In-111 Octreoscan performed within 6-12 months before or after PET/CT</time_frame>
    <description>The ability of 68Ga-DOTATOC to localize more effectively to somatostatin receptors and the exquisite spatial resolution of PET/CT should make easier detection of primary and metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and allow better measurement of tumor burden.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical significance of intensity of Ga-68 DOTATOC activity</measure>
    <time_frame>To allow followup of cases, re-assessment of lesions will be performed by investigators in 12 months through repeat SSR imaging, CT or MRI.</time_frame>
    <description>Compare the intensity of Ga-68 DOTATOC activity in NET with that of the liver and spleen through SUV measurement and visual analysis and generate Krenning scores established for NET in order to determine if there is utility of such scoring system with this PET radiopharmaceutical at initial imaging.</description>
