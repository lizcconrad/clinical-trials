  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protein energy wasting is an independent factor associated with morbi-mortality in chronic
      kidney disease. Wasting is particularly common in chronic diseases of organs such as kidney
      disease with a major impact at the stage of dialysis. It covers 20 to 70% of patients
      diagnosed with chronic kidney disease according to the degree of evolution of the disease and
      the diagnostic method.

      Mechanisms of PEW are based mainly on anorexia and metabolic abnormalities caused by kidney
      disease. Nutritional treatment differs depending on the stage of the kidney disease acute or
      chronic treated whether or not by dialysis. Nutritional monitoring should be regular,
      individualized and collaborative to detect a risk of PEW or treat installed PEW. Refeeding
      techniques should allow all the nutritional needs. Their indications depend on the clinic,
      biochemical assessment and nutrient intake.
