  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a preliminary, double-blind clinical trail aimed to investigate whether the
      combination of fluoxetine with ATP or phosphocreatine has a rapid antidepressant effect. 42
      patients with major depressive disorder (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score &gt;= 20)
      will be recruited and divided into 3 groups randomly. This study involves two periods. In the
      first period, one group will be treated with fluoxetine and placebo, one with fluoxetine and
      ATP, and one with fluoxetine and phosphocreatine for 2 weeks. Placebo, ATP and
      phosphocreatine will be given intravenously, and fluoxetine orally. In the second period,
      each patient will be only given fluoxetine for 4 weeks.
