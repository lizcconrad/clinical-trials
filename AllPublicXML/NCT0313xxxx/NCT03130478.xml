      This is an observational, retrospective, non-interventional study that will include
      schizophrenic patients who were initiated on AOM treatment during an schizophrenia-related
      hospitalisation at least 6 months before data collection and in a real clinical practice
      setting.

      Data from each patient will be collected after informed consent is obtained (if possible),
      and will include retrospective information mainly from the index date (start of AOM
      treatment, baseline timepoint) until the last information available in the patient file at
      the time of data collection (minimum of 6 months after the index date). Data will be
      retrospectively collected from all visits occurring as per clinical practice (usually
      once-monthly).

        Eligible patients will include adult patients with schizophrenia who have been initiated
        with AOM as primary maintenance AP treatment during an inpatient stay due to an acute
        schizophrenia relapse in a real clinical practice setting at least 6 months before the
        inclusion in the study (regardless of the current treatment at inclusion). Since
        persistence is part of the primary objective of the study, patients who discontinued the
        maintenance treatment with AOM before the inclusion period of the study should also be
        included.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years at the time of AOM initiation).

          2. Diagnosis of schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of

             AOM as primary maintenance antipsychotic treatment, in accordance with the terms of

             inclusion and before November 1st 2016 (and up to January 2016 at the earliest).

          4. Provision of patient informed consent unless a) not required by local regulations, b)
             it would take a non-reasonable effort* or c) if the source patient is deceased or
             untraceable.

               -  A reasonable effort is defined as 3 contact attempts separated by 3 weeks. All
                  efforts to obtain the informed consent, reasonable or not, shall be registered in
                  the medical history of the patient to be used as documental source.

        If allowable by Ethics Committees, provision of oral (e.g., by phone) instead of written
        consent is also possible for patients with retrospective assessment only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a psychiatric disorder other than schizophrenia which is established
             as the primary diagnosis

          2. Chronically hospitalized patients at time of AOM initiation.

          3. Patients who receive, after AOM initiation, a concomitant oral antipsychotic treatment
             for more than 4 weeks (with the exception of low dose quetiapine)*

             * Low dose quetiapine is acceptable up to a maximum of 150 mg daily only for sedative
             purposes, but not for the induction of any psychopharmacological effect on mood and/or
             psychosis.

          4. Participation in an interventional clinical trial during the retrospective follow-up
             period.
