    <textblock>
      Despite advances in dialysis, only 50% of dialysis patients are alive 3 years after the onset
      of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although withdrawal of dialysis precedes 1 in 4 deaths of
      patients with ESRD, withdrawal from dialysis and aggressive treatment is rarely discussed by
      patients and their surrogates with sufficient time to consider alternatives such as hospice
      or dying at home. Over the last decade, the researchers have developed and iteratively tested
      a patient and family-centered advance care planning intervention based on the
      Representational Approach to Patient Education called &quot;Sharing Patient's Illness
      Representation to Increase Trust&quot; (SPIRIT). SPIRIT is a 6-step, 2-session, face-to-face
      intervention to promote cognitive and emotional preparation for end-of-life decision making
      for patients with ESRD and their surrogates. In these explanatory trials carried out in
      dialysis clinics, SPIRIT was delivered by trained research nurses. The researchers have
      established feasibility, patient-surrogate acceptability, and efficacy. Patients and
      surrogates participating in SPIRIT showed significant improvement in preparedness for
      end-of-life decision making, and surrogates in SPIRIT reported significantly improved
      post-bereavement psychological outcomes after the patient's death compared to a no treatment
      comparison condition. The logical, critical next step is to ask: Will SPIRIT be effective as
      part of routine care in real-world settings with less control? To address this very issue,
      The researchers will conduct a real-world effectiveness-implementation study. This study is a
      multicenter, clinic-level cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of SPIRIT
      delivered by dialysis care providers as part of routine care in free-standing outpatient
      dialysis clinics compared to usual care plus delayed SPIRIT implementation. This study will
      evaluate the implementation of SPIRIT, including sustainability.

      The researchers will recruit 400 dyads of patients at high risk of death in the next year and
      their surrogates from 30 dialysis clinics in 4 states. Patients and surrogates will complete
      questionnaires at baseline and after the intervention; all participants will be followed for
      up to 9 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) currently affects nearly 662,000 people in the U.S. While
      dialysis is the treatment of choice for over 90% of patients with ESRD and is universally
      covered by Medicare regardless of patient age or means, the likelihood that dialysis can
      restore health or prolong life is limited; only 50% of dialysis patients are alive 3 years
      after the onset of ESRD. Thus many dialysis patients and their family members or surrogate
      decision-makers have to face difficult end-of-life decisions. Although advance care planning
      (ACP), in which patients and surrogate decision-makers discuss future health states and
      treatment options, is a central tenet of dialysis care, the vast majority of dialysis
      patients (&gt;90%) report never engaging in ACP discussions with their care providers. The lack
      of effective ACP to prepare patients and their surrogates for end-of-life decision making
      with sufficient time before death has deleterious consequences at all levels of society.
      Consequences have been well documented: prolonged use of futile treatment at the end of life,
      which misuses the healthcare system, high levels of surrogate distress during decision
      making, which emanates from not having a clear understanding of the patient's wishes, and
      surrogates experiencing later sequelae of psychosocial morbidities, such as depression and
      family discord.

      &quot;Sharing Patient's Illness Representation to Increase Trust&quot; (SPIRIT), a patient and
      family-centered ACP intervention based on the Representational Approach to Patient Education,
      was designed by our team to establish a testable model of how end-of-life care discussions
      could occur between a dialysis patient and his/her chosen surrogate (usually a spouse or
      adult child). The discussions, which are facilitated by a trained care provider, are framed
      around addressing each individual's representations of (beliefs about) the illness and views
      of life-sustaining measures at the end of life. SPIRIT follows a six-step learning objective
      over two-sessions, which together take about 60 minutes. The care provider, who is
      value-neutral, guides the patient in examining his/her values related to end-of-life care,
      helps the surrogate understand the patient's illness progression, and prepares the surrogate
      for his/her role as a surrogate in a highly emotionally charged medical setting. Over the
      last decade, SPIRIT has been tested to establish feasibility, patient-surrogate
      acceptability, and efficacy. In these explanatory trials carried out in dialysis clinics,
      SPIRIT was delivered by trained research nurses. Patients and surrogates in SPIRIT showed
      significant improvement in preparedness for end-of-life decision making, including the extent
      to which: a) the patient and surrogate agreed on end-of-life care goals, b) the patient had
      reduced conflict about the benefits and burdens of life-sustaining treatments, and c) the
      surrogate had increased confidence about the role of surrogate. Key to establishing the
      utility of this approach for broader generalizability, surrogates who received SPIRIT
      reported significantly improved post-bereavement psychological outcomes after the patient's
      death compared to those who did not. The logical, critical next step is to ask: Will SPIRIT
      be effective as part of routine care in real-world clinical settings with less control? To
      address this very issue, the researchers will conduct a real-world
      effectiveness-implementation study, an essential step prior to widespread implementation of
      SPIRIT.

      This study is a multicenter, clinic-level cluster randomized trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of SPIRIT delivered by dialysis care providers as part of routine care in
      free-standing outpatient dialysis clinics compared to usual care plus delayed SPIRIT
      implementation. Simultaneously, the researchers will evaluate the implementation of SPIRIT,
      including sustainability. This study will use a Type I effectiveness-implementation hybrid
      approach that combines testing intervention effectiveness and gathering information about
      implementation of an efficacious intervention in a real world setting. The short-term goal is
      to generate sufficient evidence to accelerate the integration of SPIRIT into dialysis
      practice and policy. This study will recruit 400 dyads of patients at high risk of death in
      the next year and their surrogates (a total of 800 individuals) from 30 dialysis clinics in 4
      states. The dialysis clinics will be randomized to implement SPIRIT immediately or to
      maintain usual care to serve as a control to the intervention. Participants will be recruited
      for 15 months. The control sites will implement SPIRIT after the 15 month intervention and 9
      month follow up period is complete. Individual patient participation will end at 9 months or
      death, whichever occurs first; surrogate participation will end at 9 months or at the
      completion of 3-month post-death follow-up.

    <measure>Change in dyad congruence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Dyad congruence will be assessed using the Goals-of-Care Tool which includes two scenarios describing medical conditions commonly occurring in ESRD patients. Possible responses to the scenarios are: &quot;The goals of care should focus on delaying my death, and thus I want to continue life-sustaining treatment&quot;, &quot;The goals of care should focus on my comfort and peace, and thus I do not want life-sustaining treatment, including dialysis&quot;, and &quot;I am not sure&quot;. Patients and surrogates complete this tool independently and their responses are then compared to determine dyad congruence.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient's Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Patient decisional conflict will be measured using the 13-item Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a validated measure in the context of end-of-life decision making. Participants indicate their level of agreement with statements about their plans for their future medical care by selecting (1) Strongly Agree, (2) Agree, (3) Neither Agree nor Disagree, (4) Disagree, or (5) Strongly Disagree. The total score ranges from 13 - 65 with higher scores indicating greater difficulty in weighing benefits and burdens of life-sustaining treatments and decision making.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Surrogate's Decision Making Confidence (DMC) scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Surrogate decision-making confidence will be measured using the 5-item Decision Making Confidence (DMC) scale. Surrogates indicate how confident they are about making medical decisions if the patient becomes unable to make their own decisions by their level of agreement with statements along a scale of (0) &quot;Not confident at all&quot; to (5) &quot;Very confident&quot;. Total scores range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater confidence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in Surrogate's Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3 months after patient death</time_frame>
    <description>Surrogate post-bereavement anxiety and depressive symptoms will be measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Surrogates indicate their level of agreement with statements by selecting responses rated from 0 (the problem in the statement is not an issue) to 3 (the problem in the statement is a very big issue). The separate anxiety and depression subscale scores range from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. A score of 0-7 indicates &quot;normal&quot;, 8-10 indicates &quot;borderline abnormal&quot;, and 11-21 indicates &quot;abnormal&quot; levels of anxiety or depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Surrogate's Post-Traumatic Symptoms Scale-10 (PTSS-10) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 3 months after patient death</time_frame>
    <description>Surrogate post-bereavement traumatic distress will be measured with the Post-Traumatic Symptoms Scale-10 (PTSS-10). Surrogates indicate how often they have experienced symptoms of post-traumatic stress by responding to 10 symptoms on a scale of 0-7 where 0=&quot;never&quot; and 7=Always). Total scale scores range from 10-70 and higher scores indicate more intense symptoms.</description>

    <description>Patients at clinics that have been randomized to the SPIRIT arm will be given the option to participate in the intervention. SPIRIT is a two-session, 60-minute, structured psychoeducational intervention, targeting both patient and surrogate. Using a provider manual, the care provider follows six steps: 1) assessing illness presentation, 2) identifying gaps and concerns, 3) creating conditions for conceptual change, 4) introducing replacement information, 5) summarizing, and 6) setting goals and planning.</description>

    <description>SPIRIT is a two-session, structured psychoeducational intervention assisting patients clarify their end-of-life preferences and helping surrogates understand the patient's wishes and prepare for the surrogate role.
During the first session (about 45 minutes) individualized information is provided about the effectiveness of life-sustaining treatment for people with end-organ failure, and the care provider will assist the patient to examine his/her values about life-sustaining treatment. The surrogate will receive help preparing for end-of-life decision-making and the emotional burden of decision-making. A Goals-of-Care document will be completed to indicate the patient's preferences.
Two weeks later, the second session (about 15 minutes) addresses remaining or new concerns. The patient's Goals-of-Care document will be reviewed. The patient's end-of-life preferences and surrogate's name and relationship to the patient will be documented in the medical record.</description>
