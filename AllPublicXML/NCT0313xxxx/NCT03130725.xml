  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries, is one of the major public health problem in Pakistan. Dental sealants are
      known cost effective preventive measure of dental caries as compared to other preventive
      measures. Resin based sealants, is a proven treatment of pits and fissure sealants but
      retention is still problem. This trial will assess the use of amalgam sealants as an
      effective and retentive preventive measure in preventing dental caries in children as
      compared to the standard resin-based sealants. The findings of this randomized controlled
      trial will be used to raise awareness among the health care professionals, help them to
      choose amalgam sealants as an effective caries prevention method thereby reducing the burden
      of cost as amalgam is cheaper material compared to resin-based sealants.

      The research question Is there any difference in the six months retention of bonded amalgam
      sealants compared to resin-based sealants among 12 to 16 years old children in Karachi

      Objective:

      To compare the six month retention of bonded amalgam sealants with that of resin-based
      sealants among 12 to 16 year old children in Karachi

      Methods:

      The study design will be parallel group, equivalence randomized controlled trial. Aim is to
      determine the equality of the Amalgam sealants retention compared to resin based sealants
      retention.

      Outcome:

      The primary outcome will be Retention, divided into Complete Retention, Partial Retention and
      Dislodgement of the sealant material.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children of aged 12 to 16 years (male and female) who will visit to the study site and
             fulfilled the eligibility criteria

          -  Teeth should be caries free at the time of sealants placement. As Dental sealant is a
             preventive treatment it is placed in a caries free surface. Incipient carious lesions
             will also be included.

          -  Teeth should be completely erupted, as incomplete eruption of teeth is highly
             correlates to the partial retention of sealants.

          -  Children who will give assent to participate in a study and their parents will give
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Special needs children (because they need special attention of parents)

          -  Children who have blood disorder like (leukemia, lymphoma, and thalassemia)

          -  Persons with impaired vision, speech and hearing (because either they may not be able
             to respond to questionnaire or conducting baseline dental training will be difficult).
