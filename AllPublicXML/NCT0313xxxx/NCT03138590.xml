      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether it is possible to accelerate learning and
      improve associative memory performance in healthy subjects, by applying transcranial Direct
      Current Stimulation (tDCS) targeting the trigeminal nerve during a verbal paired-associate
      learning task

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Associative memory refers to remembering the association between two items, such as a face
      and a name or a word in English and the same word in another language. It is not only
      important for learning, but it is also one of the first aspects of memory performance that is
      impacted by aging and by Alzheimer×³s disease. For decades, neuroscientists have investigated
      associative learning and memory and ways to accelerate and enhance associative learning and
      memory.

      Transcranial Direct Current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive and painless electrical
      stimulation technique that has demonstrated to accelerate learning and improve memory in some
      studies. To investigate whether it is possible to accelerate learning and improve associative
      memory using tDCS, the performance in a Verbal Paired-Associate memory task of 2 groups will
      be compared. The first group will get active tDCS during the verbal paired-associate learning
      task. The second group will get sham tDCS during the verbal paired-associate learning task.
