    <textblock>
      The ALF-X (Advanced Laparoscopy through Force reflection) Robotic Surgery System is a medical
      device that is available for distribution in the EU (European Union) under CE Mark for use in
      general surgery, thoracic surgery, gynecological surgery and urological surgery. The main
      research question is to assess, from a retrospective poit of view, the safety and feasibility
      of this new robotic platform in the colorectal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to investigate the perioperative and the short term
      perioperative outcomes of this new robotic Platform in minimally invasive colorectal surgery.
      Tha ALF-X utilizes fully reusable along with haptic feedback and an innovative vision control
      system.
