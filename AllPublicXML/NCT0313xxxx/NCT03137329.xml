  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims are

        1. to demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting and enrolling 10 subjects aged 55-75
           planning to undergo sleeve gastrectomy and enrolling 10-20 (1-2 per surgical patient)
           matched subjects to the described intensive lifestyle intervention.

        2. to collect preliminary data on the comparative effectiveness of the two interventions on
           physical function, weight loss, body composition, bone density and QOL.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a 1-year pilot feasibility study to examine the comparative
      effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy compared to an intensive lifestyle intervention of a high
      protein low carbohydrate, hypocaloric weight loss diet combined with exercise training among
      older adults aged 60-75. For pragmatic and ethical reasons, the investigators are employing a
      nonrandomized design. The investigators will recruit 10 older patients undergoing sleeve
      gastrectomy and match, recruit, and enroll 1-2 subjects to the lifestyle intervention for
      each surgical subject. The investigators will assess physical function, weight loss, body
      composition, bone density, QOL and adverse events/health utilization at baseline and 6 and 12
      months.

    <description>Subjects enrolled in the WLS arm will undergo WLS as part of the routine care provided by the respective WLS centers. During routine care patients typically meet with their dietician at least twice prior to WLS and are placed on a higher protein meal replacement supplement and calorie controlled diet. For weeks 1-52, the investigators will ensure that patients are receiving 1500mg of elemental calcium and 3000 IU of vitamin D based on recent best practice guidelines. In addition, participants will complete an individualized pragmatic exercise program for the first 52 weeks after surgery. Patients will begin the program after receiving clearance from their surgeon. Patients will meet with a physical therapist at BIDMC for individual sessions.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Lifestyle Arm</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects enrolled in the lifestyle group will be prescribed a balanced high protein diet (1g high quality protein/kg body weight/day) that provides an energy deficit of 500 to 750 kcal /day from their daily energy requirements[58] and prescribed a weight loss goal of 10% over the course of 6 months. Participants will meet with a trained dietician/nutritionist at the BIDMC General Clinical Research Unit. The investigators will incorporate the HMR (Health Management Resources) high protein meal replacement supplements into participants' diet regimen for the first 24 weeks. In addition, participants will complete a comparable 52-week exercise program consisting of an individualized pragmatic exercise program.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be aged 55-75 at the time of recruitment,

          -  speak English,

          -  meet medical eligibility criteria for WLS (i.e. BMI of &gt;40 or &gt;35 with a major obesity
             comorbidity),

          -  and be willing and able to participate in study procedures including the physical
             activity intervention and complete follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The investigators will exclude participants for whom

          -  intentional weight loss might be inappropriate (e.g. patients with serious
             life-limiting illness)

          -  or who might be psychologically unstable (e.g. moderate to severe depression on the
             PHQ-9)

          -  or who have contraindications to a high protein diet or the physical activity
             intervention (e.g. recent MI/CVA in last 6 months, uncontrolled congestive heart
             failure, serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl/on dialysis, h/o celiac disease/crohn's
             disease/ulcerative colitis.)

          -  or patients whose weight exceeds 450 lbs (weight limit of DXA).

          -  The investigators will withdraw bariatric subjects who do not undergo weight loss
             surgery and his or her matched lifestyle subject. The investigators will withdraw
             subjects in the lifestyle group who do not attend at least attend two of the first
             three nutrition and physical therapy visits. The investigators will recruit additional
             subjects to replace lifestyle subjects who are withdrawn from the study for this
             reason.
