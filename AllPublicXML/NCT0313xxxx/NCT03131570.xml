  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild psoriasis not only progresses to moderate-to-severe psoriasis but also precedes systemic
      inflammation that leads to psoriatic arthritis and cardiovascular comorbidities. By curing
      mild psoriasis with a short-term anti- interleukin (IL)-17A treatment, investigators may
      reduce the costs of treating psoriasis and associated medical conditions, including psoriatic
      arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease of the skin that, even in mild disease, increases the
      risk of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic derangements. Mild
      psoriasis tends to be treated with topical drugs, while moderate-to-severe disease is
      optimally treated with systemic immune modulators. However, the treatment of &quot;mild&quot; psoriasis
      needs to be re-thought because recent studies have revealed that mild psoriasis is
      characterized by stronger expression of pathogenic molecules, such as interleukin (IL)-17A,
      and higher numbers of T cells in the skin, compared to severe psoriasis. A key distinction
      between mild and severe psoriasis is now discovered to be the higher expression of negative
      immune regulatory genes in mild lesions. Therefore, targeted immune therapy with anti-IL-17A,
      which is highly effective in severe psoriasis, might be equally (or even more) effective in
      mild disease. Also, restoration of immune tolerance might be more easily achieved in mild
      disease. Thus, short-term anti-IL-17A treatment of mild psoriasis might prevent the
      recurrence and eventually cure the disease. The aim of study is to test this hypothesis by
      exploring whether 3 months or 6 months of anti-IL17A treatment will prevent relapses after
      medication has been discontinued in mild psoriasis patients.
