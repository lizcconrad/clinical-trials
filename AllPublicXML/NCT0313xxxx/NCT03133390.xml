  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II study assessing the activity of bevacizumab combined with
      atezolizumab compared to atezolizumab alone in metastatic urothelial carcinoma subjects who
      are ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive
      treatment with either (Arm A) atezolizumab 1200 mg (flat dose) IV plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg
      IV every 21 days versus (Arm B) atezolizumab 1200 mg (flat dose) IV monotherapy every 21
      days. Cross-sectional imaging will be performed every 9 weeks on therapy for the first 12
      months and then every 12 weeks thereafter to assess for response.

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival will be defined as the time from randomization until death by any cause, and will be analyzed using the Kaplan Meier method. At the time of analysis, if a subject has not died, the subject will be censored on the date of last follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the period measured from the time that measurement criteria are met for complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. DoR will be reported as an estimate of the median with range for each treatment arm and unstratified survival analysis will be applied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (ORR + SD)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The disease control rate is the proportion of all subjects with stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) according to RECIST 1.1, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment).</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-Free survival will be defined as the time from the date of randomization until the criteria for disease progression is met as defined by RECIST 1.1 or death occurs.
