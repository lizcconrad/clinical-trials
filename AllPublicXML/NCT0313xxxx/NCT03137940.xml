  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the safety and the feasibility of transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) session in children and young adults with Unilateral Cerebral Palsy (UCP).
      Secondarily it aims to test the effects of tDCS (real vs sham) in improving, in very short
      term, Upper Limb (UL) functions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral Cerebral Palsy (UCP) represents the most frequent form of CP; the upper limb (UL)
      is generally more affected than the lower limb with an impact in &quot;activity&quot; and
      &quot;participation&quot; areas. The non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (NIBS), such as
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), appear able to modulate neuronal plasticity
      processes even more late in age attracting great interest for their potential fallout in the
      field of rehabilitation. The effects of tDCS in recovery of motor function has more
      investigated in adults, while in the pediatric population studies on safety and efficacy are
      still few and not conclusive. This study aims to evaluate the safety and the feasibility of
      tDCS session in children and young adults with UCP both in short term and in follow up (up to
      24 hrs after the tDCS session). Secondarily it aims to test the effects of tDCS (real vs
      sham) in improving, in short term, UL functions. For the study 6 children (aged 10-17 years)
      and 6 young adults (aged 18-28 years) with UCP will be recruited. Each subject receives,
      randomly, a real session and a sham session of tDCS with BrainStim Stimulator. Before (T0),
      immediately after (T1) and after 1 hour and half (T2) to each tDCS session (real or sham)
      heart rate, blood pressure and UL functions will be measured. Moreover the subject fills in
      an ad hoc questionnaire on safety at T1 and T2 and, on call, at 24 hours after the sessions
      (T3).

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]</measure>
    <time_frame>The questionnaire will be filled in immediately after the tDCS session (T1), at 1 hour and half from T1 (T2) and, on call, at 24 hours from the tDCS session (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>An adapted and child-friendly safety and tolerability questionnaire will be used for children and adolescent, while for young adults a questionnaire already used for this evaluation will be proposed. To explore the long-term safety the questionnaire is enriched with questions about quality of sleep, mood and activities to be answered after 24 hours of tDCS session</description>

    <description>The BBT measures unilateral gross-manual dexterity; subjects have to move, one by one, the maximum number of blocks from one compartment of a box to another within 60 seconds. The test will be performed firstly with the dominant hand and after with the contralateral. The patient is allowed a 15-second trial period prior to testing. ICF Domain: Activity</description>
