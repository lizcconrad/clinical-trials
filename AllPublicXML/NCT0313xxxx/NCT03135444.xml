  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team created a tool to help identify patients who may benefit from shared decision
      making in the primary care setting. This tool is a guide to aid in decision making for
      prostate cancer screening. The team proposes the topics to be discussed in the screening
      conversation include the risk for developing prostate cancer based upon age, race/ethnicity,
      family history of prostate cancer, history of previous digital rectal exam, and history of
      previous prostate specific antigen (PSA) as well as self-reported health status and
      preferences for treatment. The team now proposes 1) testing this tool first for ease of use
      in primary care clinics 2) revising this tool based upon feedback from patients and
      providers, then 3) testing this tool for effectiveness in improving patient knowledge that
      they have an option to be screened for prostate cancer and of specific factors to be
      considered in the screening decision.

      Objectives:

        1. To pilot test a decision making tool, the PSA TOOL, for prostate cancer screening for
           usefulness and ease of use in primary care practices.

        2. To revise the PSA TOOL based upon provider and patient feedback.

        3. To assess patient knowledge about the option to be screened for prostate cancer and
           factors to consider in the prostate cancer screening decision before and after use of
           the tool.

      Study Design:

      This protocol is for field testing of a brief tool to improve prostate cancer screening
      discussions that occur at previously scheduled primary care outpatient visits.

    <description>15 providers will be given an initial version of the PSA TOOL, over a 4 week period, they will be able to provide feedback on the tool. This will be used to revise the screening decision aid. Informal interviews with providers will also be conducted by a member of the study team to obtain feedback about ease of use and usefulness of the tool.</description>

    <description>150 patients will be asked to use the revised PSA TOOL. Pre- and Post-tests will be given to see if the tool changed the knowledge that patients have an option to be screened for prostate cancer and of specific factors to be considered in the screening decision. Informal interviews with patients who are exposed to the tool will also be conducted by a member of the study team to obtain feedback on issues addressed by the survey questions.</description>
