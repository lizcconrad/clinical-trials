  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic upper GI endoscopy can be uncomfortable and stressful for many patients. Various
      methods are available for sedation during this procedure. Because of some side effects
      related to intravenous administration of sedatives, oral administration of these drugs is
      under attention. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine which is used mainly in treatment of anxiety.
      Intravenous midazolam is being used by some centers for sedation during endoscopy, but the
      oral form can also be used with probably same efficacy. Hence, investigators compare the
      efficacy/safety of oral midazolam and sublingual alprazolam as for sedation during this
      procedure. Investigators hypothesize that sublingual alprazolam is as effective as oral
      midazolam in reducing anxiety and pain/discomfort related to the procedure.
