      The purpose of this study is to evaluate vedolizumab pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and
      tolerability in pediatric participants with moderately to severely active UC or CD.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to
      treat pediatric participants who have moderately to severely active UC or CD. This study will
      look at the PK, efficacy, immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability in participants who take
      vedolizumab.

      The study will enroll approximately 80 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two dose regimens (high or low) per weight
      group &gt;=30 kg and 10 kg to &lt;30 kg in ratio 1:1â€”which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Vedolizumab high dose group - Vedolizumab 300 mg or 200 mg

        -  Vedolizumab low dose group - Vedolizumab 150 mg or 100 mg

      All participants will be administered vedolizumab via IV infusion. Participants assigned to
      the low dose group who do not achieve clinical response (based on pediatric UC/CDAI) at Week
      14 will receive the high dose (that is, 300 mg for participants &gt;=30 kg baseline weight and
      200 mg for participants 10 kg to &lt;30 kg baseline weight) of vedolizumab IV at Week 14.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 36 weeks. After completing the Week 22 Visit procedures, eligible participants
      may enter an extension study. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and those
      who do not enter extension study will have a final visit 18 weeks after last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment. Participants who do not enter the extension study will also
      participate in a long-term safety follow-up, by telephone, 6 months after the last dose of
      study drug.

    <measure>Percentage of UC Participants who Achieve Clinical Response Based on Complete Mayo Score at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as a reduction in complete Mayo score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3-points and &gt;=30 percent (%) from Baseline with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of &gt;=1-point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of less than or equal to (&lt;=) 1-point. Mayo score is used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. It consists of 4 subscales: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy and physician's global assessment. Each subscale is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0= normal condition and 3 = severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of CD Participants who Achieve Clinical Response Based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as &gt;=70-point decrease from Baseline in CDAI score at Week 14. The CDAI evaluates severity of signs and symptoms of CD. Information will be collected on number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general well-being, presence of comorbid conditions, use of medications for diarrhea, physical examination, and laboratory, yielding 8 items that are combined with data from a 7-day diary to obtain total CDAI score. Index values of 150 and below are associated with quiescent disease; values above that indicate active disease, values &gt;=220 indicates moderate to severe disease, and values above 450 are seen with extremely severe disease.</description>
