    <description>Lose It! is a commercial weight loss smart phone app designed for easy caloric tracking. It provides a free mobile and web interface for users to construct an individualized weight loss plan by entering their goal weight and desired weekly weight loss. Using the user's height, current weight, gender and age, the app generates a daily caloric budget designed for the user to reach their goal. Users can then log their caloric intake, exercise, and weight to track progress toward their goal.</description>
