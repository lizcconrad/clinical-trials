      Increasing the number of Turkish version of the questionnaire evaluating hand use, adding the
      scales that evaluate the selective movements of the upper limb to the evaluations will
      increase the variety of evaluation methods.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Turkish version
      of the Caregiver Functional Use Survey (CFUS)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CFUS was designed to assess caregivers' perceptions of how much and how well their child used
      the involved upper extremity.

      Children's upper extremity functions will be assessed with a Jebsen Taylor Hand Function
      Test. Their family will be asked to fill the CFUS.

      Compare the relationship between Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test and Turkish Version CFUS.
      Investigate the internal consistency of Turkish-version of CFUS by using Cronbach's alpha
      coefficient.
