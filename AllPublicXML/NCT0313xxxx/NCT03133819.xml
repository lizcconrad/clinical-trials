  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is just assessed by determination of Vibration sensation, pressure
      sensation, superficial pain or temperature. The most commonly used technique for diagnosis of
      peripheral neuropathy is nervous conduction (NC) and electromyography (EMG). But EMG/NC is
      bothersome and techniques using electric currents to measure NC and needles to study muscle
      innervations are uncomfortable.

      Quantitative NeuroSensory Testing (QST) is essential in the evaluation of small-caliber
      A-delta and C-fibers, the primary transmitters of thermal and pain sensation. QST can
      demonstrate neurosensory abnormalities when it is non-invasive test, selective to small
      fibers despite negative EMG/NCV finding.

      The investigators predict QST can be used for the early diagnosis and follow-up of
      small-fiber neuropathy in diabetes patients. The investigators also predict the early
      evaluation of diabetes neuropathy with QST can reduce the diabetes patient progress to
      advance stage of DM foot or limb amputation.

      Patients will be divide into 4 groups (groups 1 to 4 will be divided by Q-Sense QST (TSA II)
      . The patient groups will be defined as the followings:

        1. Group 1: 100 diabetes patients without neuropathy, Q-Sense normal.

        2. Group 2: 100 diabetes patients with neuropathy, Q-Sense abnormal but no evidence of
           PAOD.

        3. Group 3: 100 diabetes patients with neuropathy, Q-Sense abnormal , PAOD (＋), but no foot
           ulceration

        4. Group 4: 100 diabetes patients with neuropathy, PAOD(＋) , and foot ulceration QST will
           perform using the Medoc device (TSA2001/VSA3001) following previous published
           procedures.
