        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults, 19 ~ 39 years of age

          2. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 19 to 25kg/㎡ (19kg/㎡ ≤ BMI &lt; 25kg/㎡) and weight at least
             50kg on the day of screening

          3. Medically healthy with no clinically significant findings on vital signs during the
             screening period

          4. Medically healthy with no clinically significant findings on physical examinations
             during the screening period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with clinically significant medical or surgical history described below
             Clinically significant observations considered as unsuitable based on medical
             judgement by investigators

               -  Skin disorder (psoriasis or contact dermatitis) which may affect absorption of
                  the investigational product, or scar, skin abnormality, history of surgery
                  (excluding simple appendectomy or herniorrhaphy) which can interrupt intradermal
                  injections

          2. History of clinically significant allergy, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, skin,
             mucocutaneous, ocular, respiratory, musculoskeletal or any other conditions which can
             be problems for pharmacokinetic evaluation

          3. Donated blood or blood components or had been transfused plasma within 60 days prior
             to the day of screening

          4. Tobacco use within 30 days prior to the day of screening

    <gender_description>The clinical trial is comparative phase I study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of Investigational products, not to evaluate the efficacy of treatment. Therefore, other treatments or types are not considered and because this clinical trial has experimental aspects that are not verified, this clinical trial is conducted for healthy male volunteers.</gender_description>
