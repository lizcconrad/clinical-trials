      The investigators aim to establish a research project to test the impact of gaming by
      carrying out a video gaming interventions, monitoring its cognitive and clinical outcomes,
      while concurrently performing a multimodal brain imaging experiment.

  <detailed_description>

      The effectiveness of the gaming intervention will be assessed using a controlled,
      single-blind clinical trial with a pragmatic, three-arm parallel-group design.

      Interventions: Three groups will be used; two intervention groups (N=48, each) and one active
      control group (N=48). Both games that will be used in intervention groups are likely to yield
      improvement in a wide spectrum of cognitive abilities, such as memory, visual-spatial
      ability, attention, tracking, decision making, and strategic skills, and activate reward
      systems of the brain that drive brain plasticity. The data collection, subject recruitment
      and training will be carried out in an outpatient psychiatric unit at Castle Peak Hospital.
      The study is aimed for patients' diagnoses of schizophrenia.

      Recruitment: The health service's medical records at the study site will be screened by the
      authority of the chief medical doctor of the organisation. Patients will be screened to
      determine their eligibility for study participation. Eligible participants will be asked
      about their interest to participate in the study. If an eligible participant demonstrates
      interest in participating in the study, after signing two informed consent forms, baseline
      data with background information, intelligence quotient (IQ), medication dosage
      (chlorpromazine equivalence) will be collected. Recruitment will continue until the required
      sample size has been obtained.

      Randomisation: Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three parallel groups in
      blocks of six consecutive patients and a 1:1:1 ratio. After baseline data collection, the
      trial manager will be informed about the potential participants (by email, text message, or
      telephone call), and the trial manager will then allocate the patient to one of the three
      arms of the trial.

      Power analysis and sample size: First, the sample size calculation is based both on a prior
      cognitive-efficacy meta-analysis for patients with schizophrenia showing an overall effect
      size (ES, Cohen's d) of 0.58 on verbal working memory. The statistical analysis for the
      primary endpoint will be performed with repeated measures using ANOVA (three intervention
      groups with pre- and post-intervention measurements) where the investigators hypothesis will
      be specifically tested by the within-between interaction. With a statistical power of 0.8 and
      Î±= 0.05, the investigators require at least 144 subjects (48 per group, calculated using
      G*Power 3.1.9.2). Based on a meta-analysis, the mean sample size is 50. Assuming a
      participation rate of 80% and completion rate of 72%, a total of 252 subjects (~84 per group)
      will be approached.

      Second, for neuroimaging assessment, the total size of the study group will be 75 (25/a
      group), which is about 50% of our total sample (N=144). Patients for neuroimaging study will
      be randomized at baseline from the total sample. Randomization will be done based on a list
      of computer generated random numbers (done by a statistician out of the study group). The
      patients will participate in neuroimaging assessment prior to the intervention (pre-training,
      25/a group) and after the intervention period (post-training, 25/a group). The investigators
      will assume 20% drop-out between baseline and follow-up assessment, which leave us with 20
      patients/a group (N=60).

      To verify whether the gaming interventions has been delivered as designed (intervention
      fidelity), patients' gaming logs will be analysed (gaming frequency [number of gaming
      sessions per week], the length of each session [minutes], a number of drop-outs). Further,
      patients gaming diaries including qualitative data will be analysed and linked with fidelity
      information and focus-group interviews (10 in each intervention group), to describe the
      strengths and possible limitations of the gaming interventions.

    <description>Entertainment game not specifically designed to improve cognitive abilities of patients. Released for windows, XBox One and Playstation 4, it is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter game. Players play in teams of six players and battle against other teams. The game play of Overwatch is fast-paced and requires quick decision-making, teamwork, staying very focused and tracking quickly appearing and disappearing objects. Each player can choose their character from four characters classes that emphasize &quot;Offense&quot;, &quot;Defence&quot;, &quot;Tank&quot; and &quot;Support&quot; type of playing.</description>

    <description>Multi-player game, specifically designed to improve ecologically valid working memory functioning. Combines the task-oriented immersion of first-person action games with the targetable high-level cognitive demands intrinsic to real-time strategy games, near the top rating level graphical quality. Unlike other products used or developed in the cognitive training field, Project:Neural (like Overwatch) is a multiplayer game. Playing with others in positive settings yields social interactions, engagement, teamwork. A multi-faceted reward system offeres a broad-spectrum of mental and social activation, empowerment and positivity, targeted and adaptive training of specific cognitive domains in attentional and executive control. Predecessor has been used in a clinical intervention trial.</description>

A minimum of 50 gaming hours are acquired to ensure observable neuroplasticity. Patients have scheduled gaming sessions at out-patient clinics where researchers/nursing staff can motivate and support gaming. A manual gaming diary is completed daily by the participants together with the help of the researchers/nursing staff at the study setting. Beside automatic gaming logs, the information is used to record and analyse intervention fidelity. The involvement of researchers/ nursing staff is crucial to ensure that the diaries are accurately and fully completed to measure the participants' gaming motivation and thoughts related to gaming.</description>
