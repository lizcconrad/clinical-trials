    <textblock>
      This is a research study examining the effectiveness of a Developmental Reciprocity Treatment
      Program (DRT-P) in treating social deficits in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).
      Developmental Reciprocity Treatment is an early intervention that applies
      developmentally-informed teaching methods in naturalistic settings in order to target social
      and communication deficits.

      Researchers have begun to develop strategies to investigate the effectiveness of combining a
      parent training program teaching parents how to implement DRP with in-home,
      therapist-implemented treatment. To determine the effectiveness of the DRT-P, it will be
      compared to a delayed treatment group (DTG) by conducting a randomized controlled 24-week
      trial. This research will allow us to help in the development of therapeutic approaches that
      can meet the increasing service demands for families. We hope that investigating
      interventions that aim to improve core deficits will aid in providing better care for
      children with autism.
