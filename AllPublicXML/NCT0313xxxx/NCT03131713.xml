  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's goal is to assess impact of preoperative acetaminophen and oral carbohydrate
      drinks on pain and functional status experienced by patients undergoing Mohs micrographic
      surgery for non-melanoma skin cancers. Patients are randomly assigned to receive standard of
      care or preoperative acetaminophen 1000 mg and Gatorade sports drinks 2 packets before
      surgery. Patients are then asked to rate their level of pain, anxiety, thirst, hunger,
      fatigue on a scale of 0-100 on day of surgery before surgery has started, after clearance of
      skin cancer, and at the end of the visit. Patients are contacted by phone 48 hours after
      their surgery to assess their maximum level of post-operative pain (rated from 0-100), usage
      of over the counter or prescribed pain medications, and presence of complications e.g.
      bleeding, infection, dehiscence. Differences in perioperative functional status and pain
      medication usage are compared between patients in control and intervention groups.
