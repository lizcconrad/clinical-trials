  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) often affects distal lung, and the evaluation of drug
      distribution to the relevant lung compartments is essential for development of new treatment
      options. This single center study will utilize samples obtained by transbronchial cryobiopsy
      (TBCB) procedure to assess the distribution of inhaled drugs in the lungs of the subjects
      with fibrotic lung disease using mass spectrometry techniques. The study will have a single
      visit and will include approximately 20 adult subjects with suspected fibrotic ILD and
      requiring TBCB as part of their diagnostic assessment. This will provide TBCB samples from up
      to 20 subjects, up to 5 of whom may also provide endobronchial forceps biopsy samples. The
      study will have 3 phases including screening to check the eligibility, biopsy phase in which
      all subjects will receive nebulized ipratropium bromide 500 microgram (mcg) for 10 minutes
      immediately before undergoing bronchoscopy and follow up phase from 7 to 14 days after the
      procedure. Drug distribution in the lung will be assessed by analyzing biopsy samples
      collected using mass spectrometry and imaging techniques.

    <description>Eligible subjects will receive nebulized ipratropium bromide 500 mcg for 10 minutes. The subjects will be sedated for bronchoscopic procedure as per routine practice for subjects having bronchoscopy. Cryobiopsy samples for this study will be taken after samples required for diagnosis has been taken and it is safe to do so. One to three endobronchial forceps biopsy samples will be taken from up to 5 subjects to allow comparison of proximal and distal drug distribution.</description>

      Lung biopsy samples collected from fibrotic regions of the lung using transbrochial
      cryobiopsy technique will be collected for this study. Endobronchial biopsy samples will also
      be taken. The samples will be embedded to a suitable polymer and frozen at -80 degree Celsius
      ready for analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 and above years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

             range for the population being studied, may be included only if the investigator in
             consultation with the Medical Monitor agree and document that the finding is unlikely
             to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

             bromide.

          -  As a result of the medical history, physical examination or screening investigations,
             the physician responsible considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  The subject is unable or unwilling to perform study assessments and procedures
             correctly.

          -  Subjects with a recognized co-existing respiratory disorder (other than ILD) that in
             the opinion of the investigator would confound the study outcomes.

          -  Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) predicted &lt;65 percent.
