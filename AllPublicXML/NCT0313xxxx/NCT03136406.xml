    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metronomic combination
      therapy in subjects with pancreatic cancer who have progressed on or after previous Standard
      of Care first line therapy and chemotherapy.

      Treatment will be administered in two phases. Subjects will continue treatment until they
      experience progressive disease (PD) or experience unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with
      dose reduction), withdraw consent, or the investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's
      best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) will enter phase
      2 of the study. Subjects may remain on phase 2 of the study for up to 1 year. Treatment will
      continue throughout phase 2 until the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity,
      withdraws consent, or the investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest
      to continue treatment.

          -  Must be willing to provide blood samples for exploratory analyses.

          -  Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required

          -  Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects with child-bearing
             potential and non-sterile males.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             resulting from previous therapy.

          -  History of other active malignancies or brain metastasis except: controlled basal cell
             carcinoma; prior history of in situ cancer (eg, breast, melanoma, cervical); prior

             bulky (≥ 1.5 cm) disease with metastasis in the central hilar area of the chest and
             involving the pulmonary vasculature. Subjects with a history of another malignancy
             must have &gt; 5 years without evidence of disease.

          -  Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for
             treatment-related complications.

          -  Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison's
             disease, autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).

          -  History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.

               -  Total bilirubin greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN; unless the subject
                  has documented Gilbert's syndrome).

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT])
                  &gt; 2.5 × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases).

             continuous oxygen therapy.

          -  Positive results of screening test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV).
