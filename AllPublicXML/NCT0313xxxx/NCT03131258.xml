    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant is the most effective choice of treatment for patients with end-stage
      kidney failure in terms of quality of life and longevity. Today, 20-25% of kidney
      transplantations are implemented with living donors.

      Donor nephrectomy is an operations which has the end goal of a living donor donating one of
      his kidneys to a patient with end-stage kidney failure (1).

      Pre-operative anxiety is a condition which is characterized by a random illness, being
      hospitalised, anesthesia, surgery, or uneasiness or anxiety stemming from not knowing what is
      to be experienced. Educating and informing in the pre-operative period is the first step in
      mentally preparing the patient for the operation. In some studies, it has been pointed out
      that patients who were thoroughly informed in the pre-operative period have lower anxiety
      levels both in the pre-operative and post-operative periods with also less levels of pain and
      increased recovery rates in the latter (2).

      Anesthetic recovery starts at the end of the surgical process and ends with the anesthetized
      patient completely regaining a wide-awake, responsive state, defensive reflex, and muscle
      strength.

      Post-operative pain is acute pain which starts with surgical trauma and ends with tissue
      healing (3). Providing optimal post-operative analgesia plays an important role in the
      prevention of post-operative complications (1,4,5).

      There are studies which examine the link between pre-operative anxiety and post-operative
      pain (59,74,74,77,78). Patients who will undergo a donor nephrectomy constitute a specific
      group of patients both because they are not operated due to a health problem that they have
      and because the operation results with them losing an organ. There are no prospective studies
      about the effects of pre-operative anxiety on anesthetic recovery and post-operative pain in
      individuals who have undergone donor nephrectomy in literature. Because of this, we have
      aimed to research prospectively the effects of pre-operative anxiety on anesthetic recovery
      and post-operative pain in patients that were to undergo donor nephrectomy surgery.
