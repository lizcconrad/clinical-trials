  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epistaxis or post-pharyngeal bleeding is the most common complication after nasotracheal
      intubation (NTI). Prior thermal softening of the endotracheal tube (ET) has been recommended
      as one of the methods to prevent nasal trauma from nasotracheal intubation. However, thermal
      softening of tubes tends to adversely affect the nasotracheal navigation of the ET.

      During NTI under conventional direct laryngoscopy, the tip of the Macintosh laryngoscope is
      advanced into the vallecula, indirectly elevating the epiglottis by applying pressure on the
      hyoepiglottic ligament. Although this maneuver allows optimal visualization of the glottis,
      it lifts the larynx away from the tip of the advancing nasotracheal tube (NTT), which
      generally lies along the posterior pharyngeal wall. Most clinicians use Magill forceps to
      direct the tip of the NTT anteriorly to enter the glottis. Magill forceps may cause damage to
      the cuff of an ET or may injure oropharyngeal mucosa.

      The use of a video laryngoscope and a cuff inflation technique has been proposed as a method
      for reducing the malalignment of tubes. Indirect laryngoscopy using a Video laryngoscopy can
      reduce malalignment by minimizing lifting the glottis during laryngoscopy. The cuff inflation
      technique (wherein the cuff of ET tube is inflated with 15 mL of air) has been used while
      performing &quot;blind&quot; NTI to guide such malaligned polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ET tubes into the
      laryngeal inlet. Recently, one study reported that the cuff inflation technique consistently
      improved the oropharyngeal insertion of the different ET tubes of varying stiffness during
      direct laryngoscope-guided NTI.

      There has never been study about effect of cuff inflation technique on navigability when
      performing NTI under video laryngoscopy guidance with ET tubes of varying
      stiffness.Investigators assessed and compared the incidence of nasal injury and nasotracheal
      navigability with two technique during cuff inflation-supplemented NTI guided by video-
      laryngoscopy

    <description>The severity of epistaxis was evaluated under VL using a 4-point scale:no epistaxis; mild epistaxis (blood on the tracheal tube only); moderate epistaxis (blood pooling in the pharynx); or severe epistaxis (blood in the pharynx sufficient to impede intubation)</description>

    <measure>the navigation of ET tube from nose to oropharynx</measure>
    <time_frame>during navigation from nose to oropharynx</time_frame>
    <description>The navigability (ease of insertion) was scored as grade 1 if the tube advanced smoothly from the nose into oropharynx, grade 2 if there was resistance in the passage that could be managed by side-to-side rotation of the tube, and grade 3 if the tube impinged unduly and the other nostril had to be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>time</measure>
    <time_frame>The passage of each ET tube from nasal cavity to trachea was divided into 3 phases (phase 1: from the nose into oropharynx, phase 2: from oropharynx into the laryngeal inlet , phase 3: from the laryngeal inlet into the trachea)</time_frame>

    <measure>the navigation of ET tube from oropharynx to laryngeal inlet</measure>
    <time_frame>during navigation from oropharynx to the laryngeal inlet</time_frame>
    <description>The tube was then advanced further from oropharynx into the laryngeal inlet under video laryngoscopic vision, and a smooth passage was scored as grade 1. In case the tube failed to align with the laryngeal inlet, the tube tip was withdrawn into the laryngopharynx and the cuff of the tube was sequentially inflated with air in 4 mL aliquots up to a maximal volume of 40 mL by an assistant on request until it aligned with the laryngeal inlet (cuff inflation technique) and got engaged in it thereafter (grade 2). If this technique was unsuccessful, the cuff was deflated and Magill forceps were used to engage the tube tip into the laryngeal inlet (grade 3).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the navigation of ET tube from laryngeal inlet to trachea</measure>
    <time_frame>during navigation from laryngeal inlet to trachea</time_frame>
    <description>A smooth passage was considered grade 1. If the ET tube tip got stuck in the laryngeal vestibule, optimal external laryngeal manipulation (OELM) applied (grade2); If the ET tube tip got stuck in the laryngeal vestibule, it was rotated clockwise while maintaining a gentle forward pressure on it until it got disengaged from its impingement and then slipped into the trachea (grade 3). In case this maneuver was unsuccessful, Magill forceps were used to complete the intubation process (grade 4).</description>
