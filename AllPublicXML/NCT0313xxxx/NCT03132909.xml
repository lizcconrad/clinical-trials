  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sick doctor is a patient apart. His right of prescription and his knowledge of semiology
      easily lead him to self-medication. Several factors linked to his profession may also lead to
      a delay in care: overworking with schedules that are not compatible to organize follow-up,
      poor access to prevention or occupational medicine for liberal doctors but also modesty And
      ashamed of being sick (and especially unfit to heal). Specialized centers and specific
      training courses concerning burnout, addictions and psychiatric pathologies of doctors are
      currently emerging.

      To look after a colleague also seems to imply certain specificities like the sharing of
      knowledge or the medical vocabulary. The physician-patient relationship may seem easier, but
      it can also lead to confusion of roles and create ambiguity. In this case, the doctor may
      feel too close to the doctor-patient to maintain his objectivity and to treat him properly.
      In the same way, the relationship of trust can be altered by sharing medical knowledge,
      communication techniques or confidence building which can thus lose their effectiveness.

      This physician-caregiver relationship has already been the subject of some qualitative
      research demonstrating the difficulty from the point of view of the treated. The feelings and
      attitudes of the doctor caring for his colleague remains a field very little studied. The
      research hypothesis is that there are specificities to this relationship.
