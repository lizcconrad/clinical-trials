  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During ultra endurance events, athletes experience extreme physical and mental demands,
      sometimes at the limits of the adaptive response to human physiology. This is particularly
      true for the renal function, and some evidence for acute renal failure has already been
      shown, sometimes leading to dialysis. However, the precise mechanisms involved in acute renal
      failure in such ultra endurance races are not clearly elucidated.

      The aim of our study is to estimate glomerular filtration rate from serum and urinary
      creatinine and cystitin C at the beginning and at the end of a 110 km ultra endurance race.
      Our hypothesis is that during the ultra endurance race, renal function may be injured, with a
      risk for the athlete.
