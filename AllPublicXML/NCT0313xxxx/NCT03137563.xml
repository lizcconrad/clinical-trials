  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aimed at evaluating the acceptability of HPV self-sampling among french women
      eligible for cervical cancer screening (25 - 65 years old) in the region of Occitanie, in the
      south of France. Acceptability will be evaluated using an anonymous questionnaire and the
      main outcome of the study will be the response acceptability &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; for HPV
      self-sampling. Secondary outcome will be analysis of socioeconomic determinants for the
      acceptability of HPV self-sampling.

      These data will help to propose new strategies for cervical cancer screening in France,
      particularly to taget non-attenting populations

      Women will be recruted in 8 centers located in 2 departments , Aude and Herault (in the
      Region of Occitanie in the south of France).The questionnaire will be proposed to the women
      attending one of these eight centers by an investigator, who will verify the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. The same person will collect the filled questionnaire.

      The questionnaire is anonymous and is composed of 15 questions evaluating the acceptability
      of HPV self-sampling and socio-economic determinants.

      These questionnaires will be collected and statistical analysis will be performed using
      appropriate tools.

      This study will bring informations on the acceptibility of HPV self sampling among french
      women eligible for cervical cancer screening in 2 Departements of the South of France.
      Self-sampling acceptability will be linked to socio-economic determinants.

      These data will be important to propose and evaluate new strategies to improve screening
      coverage, particularly of the context of the organized cervical cancer screening that will
      take place in France in 2018.
