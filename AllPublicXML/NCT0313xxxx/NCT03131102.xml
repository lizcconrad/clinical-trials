    <textblock>
      In surgical patients early risk prediction of postoperative complications and organ
      dysfunctions is still an important clinical challenge whereas appropriate risk predictors are
      still missing. In this regard, fatigue is a complex phenomenon, is affected by many factors
      and has been shown to be associated with delayed return to normal activity after surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that early tiredness (acute fatigue) assessed shortly after surgery
      is associated to postoperative complications and organ dysfunctions and might be used for
      risk stratification. Therefore, in this prospective, observational study the investigators
      introduce and evaluate a newly developed score to assess early fatigue during the
      perioperative period (&quot;Acute Fatigue Score&quot;, AFS).

      The AFS and the Identity-Consequence Fatigue Scala will be used to assess early fatigue and
      perioperative time courses and inter-rater-variability will be evaluated. The rating of these
      two fatigue scores will be evaluated regarding the association with hemodynamic, immunologic,
      endothelial, metabolic, gastrointestinal measures as well as organ dysfunction and
      complications after surgery.

      Furthermore, hemodynamic, immunologic, endothelial, metabolic and gastrointestinal measures
      are investigated with respect to the intraoperative course and postoperative organ
      dysfunction and complications. In a subgroup of patients, patients will undergo specialized
      metabolic measures to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction during the perioperative period.
