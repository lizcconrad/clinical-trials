    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of different anesthetic techniques on QT, QTc, and Pwd in
      cesarean section. Half of participants received general anesthesia, while the other half
      received spinal anesthesia Electrocardiography (ECG) recordings were performed at
      preoperative, 5, 15, 30 min after initiation anesthesia and 30 min post-operatively.
      Hemodynamic state were also recorded at the same time intervals. QT, corrected QT (QTc), QT
      dispersion (QTd), QTc dispersion (QTcd), P-wave dispersion (Pwd), corrected JT interval, T
      wave (Tp-e), transmular dispersion of repolarization durations were measured from ECG records
      at predetermined time intervals of spinal or general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anesthetic drugs used according general or regional anesthesia techniques can display
      proarrhythmic and antiarrhythmic effects by inducing cardiac electrical signals with
      different pathways.In addition, comorbid disease, hormonal changes, surgery procedures, and
      drug therapy can all cause arrhythmia in the intraoperative period. Likewise, pregnancy
      causes many changes hormonal and physiological in women. Hemodynamic and hormonal changes
      during pregnancy can cause effects proarrhythmogenic that cause premature atrial and
      ventricular beats to develop.
