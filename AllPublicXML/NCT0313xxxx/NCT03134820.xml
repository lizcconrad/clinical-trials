  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the most important acquired risk factor of thromboembolisms. More than 20% of all
      episodes of venous thromboembolism (VT) or pulmonary thromboembolisms (PT) are cancer
      related. Cancer patients with VT or PT are treated with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH)
      during at least 3 months, but nowadays the duration of treatment is not accurately
      determined.

      The D-Dimer determination has been used like recurrence predictors after LMWH treatment
      suspension, but in cancer patients the useful is limited. Phospholipid-dependent
      microparticles could been used like recurrence predictors in cancer patients and tailored the
      duration of LMWH treatment for each patient.

      We are carrying out a study in Cancer-associated-thromboembolism patients in order to decide
      the suitable anticoagulation time. A set of exclusion criteria is being used to determine in
      which patients LMWH will be withdrawn. Patients are being followed after LMWH withdrawal
      until 6 months. Blood samples are being taken at baseline (LMWH withdrawal), 3 weeks and 3
      months after. We will look for association between several biomarkers and venous
      thromboembolism recurrences.
