      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Gingiva Mesenchymal Stem Cell Therapy
      for Chronic Adult Periodontitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis featured by the progressive destruction loss of support tissues around the
      teeth has become a prevalent disease affecting the life quality of the adults. Although
      conventional periodontal treatment including open flap debridement and drug support therapy
      display reduced pocket depth and inflammation, the functional regeneration of the lost tissue
      and the repair of alveolar bone are insufficient. Gingiva mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) are
      multipotent cells possess the capacity of multilineage differentiation and have become an
      attractive optional treatment method for the regeneration of periodontal tissues and
      function. Therefore, GMSCs will be selected as seed cells to treat periodontitis. This study
      will recruit 30 patients which will be divided into three groups. 10 patients in group A will
      receive GMSCs seeded into collagen scaffolds at the local periodontal defects immediately
      after open flap debridement. 10 patients in group B will only receive collagen scaffolds
      devoid of GMSCs after open flap debridement. 10 patients in group C will only undergo an open
      flap debridement. This study will test the safety and efficacy of GMSCs implantation in
      chronic adult periodontitis through alveolous bone reproduction and other clinical
      parameters.
