      Aim: To investigate the effect of pre-operative exercise on hemodynamics in the fistula
      artery and vein, pre and post AV fistula formation as well as the suitability of cannulation
      of AV fistula at 8weeks post sugery

      Methodology: This is a randomised control study with 20 patients each in the exercise arm and
      the control arm. The subjects will be randomised 1:1 into one of the two groups. Chronic
      Kidney failure patients with eGFR less than 20mls/min and have chosen Haemodialysis as their
      modality of renal replacement therapy will be included the study. All the subjects will have
      an ultrasound doppler vein mapping done prior to entering the study.

      The exercise protocol for the intervention group will be to squeeze a soft ball 10 times for
      set and perform 3 sets of 10 squeezes each at an 1 minute interval. Three sets of exercises
      to be performed twice in the morning and twice in the evening, for a total of six weeks.

      All patients will have a follow up ultrasound doppler of the AV fistula at 8 weeks and 16
      weeks post-surgery, looking at the AV fistula vein diameter, arterial diameter and blood flow
      rate. All the subjects will also be seen by a single vascular surgeon following the scan, to
      assess the suitability for AVF cannulation.

      Significance of the proposed study and benefits: A well functioning arterio-venous fistula is
      the gold standard vascular access for Hemodialysis patients due to its low rates of
      complications. The primary failure rate of the AVFs remain high at around 20 -25%,
      contributed by several factors including the diameter of the vessels. If pre-operative
      exercise improves the hemodynamics of the AV fistula and aids the maturation rate in our
      study, it can be incorporated into clinical guidelines to reduce the primary failure rate of
      AV fistulas.
