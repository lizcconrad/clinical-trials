  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the administration of pembrolizumab combined to metronomic
      cyclophosphamide may be an interesting therapeutic option for female patients breast cancer
      with lymphopenia.

      Include only patients with breast cancer with lymphopenia is based on the particularly poor
      prognosis of these patients. The approach suggested here is to deplete and active the immune
      response of these immunosuppressed patients. The combination of pembrolizumab and
      cyclophosphamide would provide a higher gain in anti-tumor response in these patients than in
      those without lymphopenia and in chemotherapy alone.

      The investigators proposal is to conduct a multicentric, non-comparative, single arm,
      two-stage, Phase II trial in lymphopenic patients with metastatic breast cancer.

      The study is divided in 2 parts:

        -  a safety run-in Phase aiming to evaluate the safety of the combination therapy
           pembrolizumab + metronomic cyclophosphamide based on the occurrence of severe
           toxicities.

        -  a two-stage Phase II aiming to evaluate the clinical activity of the combination therapy
           pembrolizumab + metronomic cyclophosphamide.

      In both parts of the study, patients will receive cyclophosphamide (50 mg/day, daily, per os)
      and pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks, intravenously [IV]). The adverse events of the two
      drugs are well known.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initiation of different stage of the study depend on the occurrences of severe toxicities
      in safety run-in phase and Clinical Benefit rate after 24 weeks in the two-stage Phase II of
      the study.

      Both study drugs will continue to be administered as long as patient experience clinical
      benefit in the opinion of the investigator or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease
      progression as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic
      data and clinical status or withdrawal of consent.
