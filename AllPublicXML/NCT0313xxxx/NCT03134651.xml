  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effects of preoperative anxiety and dosage of anesthesia on IVF
      success. Half of participants according to the recorded Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI) score:
      a low-anxiety group, while the other half high-anxiety group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is common among women hospitalized for oocyte retrieval. Infertility is usually
      accompanied by psychological and behavioral changes and can result in preoperative anxiety.
      Sometimes, preoperative anxiety can be serious. Furthermore, in the absence of premedication
      for oocyte retrieval, severe degrees of anxiety may occur. Anxiety effects the total
      consumption of analgesic and anesthetic drugs intraoperatively and has a negative impact on
      recovery from anesthesia. In addition, the negative effect of anesthetic agents used on
      fertilization and embryo quality during in vitro fertilization (IVF) has been discussed.
      However, the impact of any of them on fertilization and embryo quality has not been clearly
      determined to date. Studies have reported different results regarding the negative effects of
      anesthetic agents on embryo development and fertilization.

    <description>Anxiety has determined a cutoff score of 17. Patients were divided into two groups according to the recorded BAI score: a low-anxiety group and a high-anxiety group.The monitoring brain function values were recorded at baseline, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and after anesthesia. Propofol was performed by ventilation with face mask. Monitoring brain function was keep value between 40 and 60.</description>
