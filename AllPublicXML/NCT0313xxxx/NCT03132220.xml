    <textblock>
      Developed over 10 years ago, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) synergistically
      combines mindfulness training and cognitive behavioral therapy and can increase resiliency.
      In this study, the investigators proposed two aims: Aim #1: To adapt and optimize a MBCT
      resiliency program specifically for ICU nurses. For this aim, the investigators will engage
      multiple stakeholder groups to assist the protocol adaptation. Aim # 2: To conduct a pilot
      clinical trial to determine acceptability of the MBCT resiliency program and the control
      intervention. In this aim, the investigators will also identify the most feasible
      randomization level to minimize contamination between the control and intervention groups.
      Collectively, this proposal will pave the way for a properly designed large multi-center
      trial of a MBCT resiliency program (MBCT-ICU) to determine its ability to decrease BOS
      symptoms; and allow nurses to more effectively care for patients in the challenging ICU
      environment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a stressful environment for all critical care healthcare
      providers. In the United States, there are more than 500,000 critical care (ICU) nurses that
      treat the most seriously ill patients. These ICU nurses have especially challenging and
      sometimes overwhelming jobs due to high patient mortality and morbidity, and frequent
      encounters with ethical dilemmas. The repetitive exposure to these extreme stressors and the
      inability to adjust to their difficult work environment may cause significant psychological
      stress. The investigator's multidisciplinary research team was one of the first to identify
      that ICU nurses have significantly high rates of psychological distress including: symptoms
      of anxiety and depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and burnout syndrome (BOS).

      Work-induced distress initiates a negative cycle that contributes to the unacceptably high
      ICU nursing turnover rate. Nationally, nursing turnover rates range between 17-20% per year.
      In the ICU, the growing nursing shortage is particularly concerning. Presently, there are no
      interventions to reduce BOS in ICU nurses. Many stresses on ICU nurses are inherent to the
      critical care environment such as performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the death of a
      patient. Therefore, the investigators multidisciplinary research group has focused on
      enhancing the ability of ICU nurses to adapt to their work environment.

      Resiliency enables one to thrive in the face of adversity. Humans respond to stress and
      trauma in a variety of ways. Some people are resilient; defined as the ability to succeed, to
      live, and to develop in a positive way despite the stress or adversity that would normally
      involve the real possibility of a negative outcome. In practice, resilient individuals
      believe that what they do can have a positive impact on a situation, that some components of
      the 'system' can be controlled or influenced by one's own actions, that persistent effort is
      worthwhile, and that setbacks or potentially threatening events are inevitable and
      surmountable. A variety of qualities are associated with resiliency including the ability to
      engage the support of others, the belief that stress can be strengthening, and overall
      optimism. Though some individuals are inherently resilient; resiliency can be learned.
      Developing resiliency may be one strategy to prevent and treat symptoms of BOS. The
      investigators have demonstrated that resilient ICU nurses were less likely to have symptoms
      of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and BOS. The investigators also identified methods used by ICU
      nurses to promote resiliency and emotional wellness. The investigators ICU nursing pilot
      program also increased resiliency and decreased symptoms of BOS.

      From the investigators prior studies, MBSR and CBT are two modalities currently used by
      resilient ICU nurses. In the investigators most recent national survey, ICU nurses were eager
      to learn MBSR and CBT techniques to help reduce symptoms of BOS. Mindfulness Based Cognitive
      Therapy (MBCT) combines the best of MBSR and CBT, and may build resiliency and reduce BOS
      symptoms. MBCT was developed by integrating the framework and practices of MBSR and CBT.
      Classically incorporated into an 8 week course, MBCT uses mindfulness skills to help
      individuals become aware of negative thoughts and feelings that are activated by stress. MBCT
      also incorporates CBT techniques to develop a different relationship to those thoughts and
      feelings, and interrupt the negative thought patterns.

    <measure>Pre-post changes in the Connor Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RISC) scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Once before the study intervention; one time immediately following the study intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the pre-post changes in the CD-RISC scores in intervention and control subjects. The CD-RISC scale assesses resiliency in individuals. There are 25 items in the survey, each item is scored from 0-4, and the total ranges from 0-100. Higher scores indicate increased resiliency. Any individuals who score above 81 points on this survey will not qualify for this study as they are too inherently resilient. The study intervention will typically last 4 sessions, one session per week at a total of 4 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Once before the study intervention, weekly during the 4 session/week intervention, and once immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured with the eight-item self-report Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8). This is survey has 8 items, and the total ranges from 1-32. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction. The CSQ-8 will be administered before the intervention, weekly throughout the sessions and after the final treatment and control sessions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly during the 4 session/ week study intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured for each component of the intervention, and an overall adherence score will be calculated. We will keep track of attendance, REDCap diary cards (honest broker system), and weekly participation in activities. Adherence will be calculated by adding each of the above components and dividing by the number of components.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Maslach's Burnout Inventory (MBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once before the study intervention and once immediately after the 4 session intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will also complete pre and post-intervention MBI surveys to assess changes in burnout symptoms. This survey is composed of 22 items. Each item is scored from 0-6. There are three questions domains: emotional exhaustion (9 items), depersonalization (5 items), and decreased person accomplishment (8 items). The items fall into one of these three categories and there are three domain scores. Higher values in each domain indicate increased burnout in that respective category.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative Interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>Once immediately after the 4 session study intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will administer interviews to assess participant satisfaction with the intervention and control program. They will be administered to each group at the end of the intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Post traumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Once before the study intervention and once immediately after the 4 session study intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will also complete pre and post-intervention PDS-5 surveys to assess post traumatic symptoms. This survey includes a pre-screen and 24 items. Each item is placed into the respective PTSD symptom category (as defined by the Diagnostic Statistical Manual-5) and scored. Higher scores in each symptom domain indicate increased chance of PTSD diagnosis. The domains are: intrusion (5 items), avoidance (2 items), changes in mood/cognition (7 items), and arousal/ hyperactivity (6 items). 2 items address &quot;distress and interference&quot; and 2 items address &quot;symptom onset and duration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Once before the study intervention and once immediately after the 4 session study intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will also complete pre and post-intervention HADS surveys to assess changes in anxiety and depression symptoms. This survey has 14 items that fall into either the anxiety domain (7 items) or the depression domain (7 items). Items are scored 0-4 and scores 11+ in each domain indicate abnormal cases.</description>
