  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to determine the relationship between postpartum changes in the shock
      index and the severity of blood loss and other PPH results. Blood loss, heart rate and blood
      pressure will be systematically measured in the postpartum period in all participating women
      to explore new clinical indicators to identify those requiring clinical intervention for
      excessive bleeding.
