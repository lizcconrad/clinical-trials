  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve or III) palsy is a relatively frequent cause of
      consultation in ophthalmology.

      It may reveal a life-threatening pathology such as aneurysm rupture, pituitary apoplexy, and
      therefore need imaging in emergency. Apart from few extreme emergency situations, MRI of the
      oculomotor tract is the first-line examination required. In the usual clinical practice, the
      investigators noticed in several patients unusual areas of high-intensity signal within the
      oculomotor nerve on T2 sequence, observed in various locations along the nerve path
      (cavernous and/ or intra-orbital segment). This abnormal signal, at the best knowledge of the
      investigators, has never been reported in the literature and could confirm the nerve
      impairment.

      In patients with ophthalmoplegia involving probably the third cranial nerve, disclosing this
      new MRI sign could help (i) to confirm the involvement of the oculomotor nerve and eliminate
      differential diagnoses such as myasthenia (ii) to orientate the etiological diagnosis
      (inflammatory or ischemic origin). A T2 sequence focused on the III could thus be
      systematically included in the usual MRI protocol.

    <description>High-intensity signal within the oculomotor nerve on T2 sequence, observed in various locations along the nerve path (cavernous and/ or intra-orbital segment).
High-intensity signal on T2 MRI sequence is defined as a signal area which is more intense than the contralateral nerve or more intense than the white matter signal.
A double separate reading of the imaging will be carried out by an experienced radiologist and a junior radiologist on anonymized MRIs, with no access to clinical elements and interpretation of the other radiologist. In case of discrepancy between the radiologists, the final decision will be made by a third experienced radiologist under the same conditions (no access to clinical data, no access to the other evaluations).</description>
