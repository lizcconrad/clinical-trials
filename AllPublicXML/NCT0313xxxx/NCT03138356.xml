    <textblock>
      In this integrated, Phase I study, the safety, tolerability, food effect, and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) properties of Fixed-Dose Combination Tablets of Saxagliptin / Dapagliflozin / Metformin
      XR and Dapagliflozin / Metformin XR Relative to Individual Components in Healthy Subjects
      will be investigated.

      This study will be an open-label, randomized, 3-period, 3-treatment, single-dose crossover
      study in healthy subjects (males and females), performed at a single study center, conducted
      in 3 cohorts. A total of 126 healthy male or female subjects (3 cohorts of 42 subjects each
      [each cohort consisting of 3 treatments]) will be randomized in this study to ensure that at
      least 108 subjects (36 in each cohort) are evaluable. Each subject will receive 3 single-dose
      treatments, and each treatment will be administered within 1 of the 3 successive treatment
      periods. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences with 7
      subjects prescribing the ordered sequence of 3 administered treatments in each treatment
      sequence, and will receive the IMPs in either a fasted or fed-state according to the assigned
      treatment. For fed-state cohorts, all doses of study drug will be administered to subjects
      after consuming a standard meal (light fat, low calorie) in the morning. Subjects will start
      consuming the meal 30 minutes prior to the dose and will finish the meal within 25 minutes.
      Dosing will then start after 30 minutes after the start of the meal. Subjects in the fasted
      state cohort will be fasted overnight (at least 10 hours) before dosing

      The study will comprise:

        -  A Screening period of maximum 28 days;

        -  Three treatment periods during which subjects will be resident in the Unit from the day
           before dosing with the IMP (Day -1) until at least 72 hours after dosing; discharged on
           the morning of Day 4; and

        -  A final Follow-up Visit within 5 to 7 days after the last administration of the IMP.

      There will be a minimum washout period of 7 to 14 days between each dose administration

          -  For inclusion in the study subjects should fulfill the following criteria:

               1. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study
                  specific procedures.

               2. Healthy male and/or female subjects aged 18 to 55 years with suitable veins for
                  cannulation or repeated venipuncture.

               3. Female subject must either:

        3.1. Be of non-childbearing potential:

          -  Must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent
             units of human chorionic gonadotropin) at Screening and negative urine pregnancy test
             within 24 hours prior to first IMP administration.

          -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy but not tubal ligation. 3.2. Or, if of
             childbearing potential:

          -  Must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent
