  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of two parts. Part 1 is a dose-escalation/safety evaluation to
      provisionally identify a dose and regimen of SY-1365 for further evaluation in Part 2.
      Approximately 35 patients with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled into Part 1 of the
      study.

      Following the identification of a recommended dose and regimen from Part 1, the study will
      enter Part 2 to further evaluate safety and the antitumor activity of SY-1365 in patients
      with select solid tumors, and to confirm target engagement and downstream pathway impact in
      patients with any solid tumor histology. Part 2 will consist of two cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: approximately 25 patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), triple negative
           breast cancer (TNBC), or ovarian cancer (OC)

        -  Cohort 2: approximately 10 patients with biopsy-accessible, advanced solid tumors of any
           histology

      This study will consist of two parts. Part 1 is a dose-escalation/safety evaluation to
      identify a dose and regimen for further evaluation in Part 2. SY-1365 will be administered
      intravenously twice a week for 3 weeks each 4 week cycle. Dose escalation will proceed until
      the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended dose and regimen for
      evaluation in Part 2 of the study.

      Approximately 35 patients may be enrolled into Part 1, with the ultimate number based on the
      safety (DLTs).

      Once a dose and regimen of SY-1365 is identified from Part 1, the study will enter Part 2 to
      evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of SY-1365 in patients with select solid tumor
      malignancies. Part 2 will employ two cohorts, the first (Cohort 1) to consist of
      approximately 25 patients with SCLC, TNBC, and ovarian cancer enrolled into a single,
      open-label cohort. A second Part 2 cohort (Cohort 2) will enroll patients with readily
      accessible tumors of any histology to allow for evaluation of PD endpoints in tumor biopsy or
      cytology specimens.

      Overall, the study may enroll approximately 70 patients across dose escalation (Part 1) and
      expansion cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2).
