  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Danirixin is a selective chemokine receptor antagonist being developed as a potential
      anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) in
      healthy Japanese subjects over the age of 65 years (inclusive). The study will be conducted
      in two parts: Part 1 will be a double blind, placebo-controlled, 3-period crossover,
      ascending single oral dose administration of GSK1325756H (Hydrobromide Salt Tablet
      Formulations of Danirixin) 10, 50 and 100 milligram (mg) in the fed condition. Part 2 will be
      an open label, 2-period crossover, single oral dose of GSK1325756H 50 mg in fed and fasted
      state. This study will provide an understanding of PK of hydrobromide salt of GSK1325756 in
      population of healthy elderly subjects and also contribute to the selection of appropriate
      dosing for Phase IIa study in Japan.
