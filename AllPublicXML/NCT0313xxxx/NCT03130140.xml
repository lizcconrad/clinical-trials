  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The technique of macroscopic on-site evaluation (MOSE) has recently been advocated for
      estimating the adequacy of a core specimen for histological diagnosis during EUS-FNA using a
      19-gauge needle. How it compares to the conventional technique of tissue acquisition during
      EUS-FNA is uncertain.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the quantity and quality of tissue, and the
      diagnostic ability of MOSE when compared with the conventional combined histologic-cytologic
      analysis.

    <description>EUS-FNA perform with a 19-gauge needle with macroscopic on-site evaluation. The lesion is punctured and the needle is moved to and fro at least 3 - 5 times within the lesion under 10cc of suction. After each pass, the needle is removed and the stylet would be introduced into the needle to extrude any aspirated material on a glass slide for inspection of the presence of a macroscopic visible core (MVC). MVC is defined as whitish or yellowish pieces of tissue with an apparent bulk. The total length of the MVC is measured with a ruler before placement into a formalin bottle. When a MVC of ≥ 4mm is obtained, EUS-FNA is completed. If the obtained MVC is &lt; 4mm, then another pass of the lesion with the 19-gauge needle repeated. The procedure is repeated until a MVC of ≥ 4mm is obtained.</description>

    <description>EUS-FNA perform with a 19-gauge needle with conventional techniques. At least 3, and not more than 5, passes of the lesion would be performed with the needle. With each pass, the needle is moved to and fro at least 3 - 5 times within the lesion under 10cc of suction. After FNA, the needle is removed and the stylet would be introduced into the needle to extrude any aspirated material to a specimen bottle. Any solid material would be separated and sent in formalin bottle for histology; liquid material will be fixed in alcohol and sent for cytological analysis.</description>
