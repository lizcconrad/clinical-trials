      Background: Removal of femoral arterial catheter causes pain, and current interventions used
      for reducing this pain are not sufficiently effective.

      Aims: The aim of this study is to determine the pain reduction effectiveness of ice bag
      applications to the femoral region in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial with repeated measures and two-group design.

      Setting: This study was conducted at the Yilmaz-Mehmet Oztaskın Heart and Vascular Hospital
      located in Kayseri, Turkey.

      Participants: The study was completed with a total of 104 patients who met the inclusion
      criteria: 52 each in the experimental group and the control group.

      Methods: The data were collected by the researcher using Patient Identification Form,
      Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and Vital Signs Monitoring Form. An ice bag was applied to
      patients in the experimental group for 20 minutes before removal of the catheter. The nurse
      performing the application was also responsible for the catheter removal, immediately after
      the ice bag was removed. Standard procedures of the clinic were applied to the control group.
      According to the relevant standard procedures, the catheter was removed by the nurse without
      making any other application to femoral region, and pressure was applied on catheter site.
      The pain experienced by the patients was evaluated before, and during removal and again while
      the nurse applied pressure on the catheter site after removal. The NRS scores were identified
      as NRS1, NRS2 and NRS3 for the three assessment, respectively.

    <textblock>
      Although several arterial access routes may be employed during percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI), the femoral arterial site has been the most commonly used (1). However,
      during femoral artery interventions, many patients experience pain and discomfort during the
      removal of catheters previously inserted into the femoral region (2,3). Previous literature
      also provides evidence that both vasovagal responses and local vascular complications may
      develop when the pain induced by catheter removal is not effectively controlled (3-5);
      therefore, it is important to reduce the pain experienced by patients undergoing this
      procedure (6).

      Pain caused by the removal of a femoral catheter may be controlled by using pharmacological
      methods such as treatment with morphine sulfate or lidocaine infiltration (2,3). However, it
      is also been observed that such approaches may cause complications such as increased
      bleeding, laceration of catheters, infection and temporary nerve injury (7-9). Pain may be
      also be controlled using non-pharmacological methods, which are patient-specific and aim to
      establish empathic communication with healthcare staff (10-13). Non-pharmacological methods
      used for pain control provided positive effects such as reduced anxiety and psychological
      support; notably, patients have expressed satisfaction with such non-pharmacological methods
      (14).

      Cold application is a non-pharmacological method of pain control (6). Being one of the oldest
      and easiest forms of treatment, cold-application increases the threshold of pain and reduces
      the conduction velocity of nerve fibres transmitting pain stimuli from the peripheral to the
      central nervous system (15). Demir et al. (10) investigated the effect of cold application
      upon pain caused by the removal of a chest tube and revealed that cold application reduced
      pain intensity and delayed patient requests for a second analgesic. In a further study by
      Ertug et al. (11), cold application was highly effective in reducing the pain caused by chest
      tube removal. Cold application also confers other advantages, such as ease of application,
      the lack of serious side effects and low cost (16).

      Aim and Hypothesis of the Study This study aimed to determine the effect of cold application
      to the femoral region upon pain levels of patients receiving PCI. Our hypothesis was that
      cold application would reduce (1) the pain score associated with removal of a femoral
      catheter after PCI, (2) the behavioural responses of discomfort associated with removal of a
      femoral catheter after PCI and (3) the incidence of adverse reactions associated with removal
      of a femoral catheter after PCI.

    <description>In the experimental group, the researcher provided a cold application for 20 minutes by placing an ice bag to the site of the femoral catheter. Immediately after its removal, the responsible nurse removed the catheter. A neutral instruction set was used on each patient prior to application of the ice pack. Patients in the experimental group were told that they may or may not experience pain during the catheter removal. The patients were also told that the aim of the study was to measure the effect of ice bag application upon pain during catheter removal, and that ice pack application may or may not be effective in terms of their own pain.</description>

    <description>The control group received the standard clinic procedure in that the catheter was removed by the assigned nurse without any cold application to the femoral region. Each control patient was informed that some patients may experience pain during catheter removal, and that they may or may not experience pain. Patients were also told that their pain levels would be measured during catheter removal.</description>
