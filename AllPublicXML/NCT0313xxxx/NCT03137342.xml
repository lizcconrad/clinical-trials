  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pepped on PrEP is an innovative pilot RCT designed by an interdisciplinary team to develop a
      counseling and problem-solving PrEP adherence intervention with a Behavioral Activation (BA)
      approach that aims to re-engage participants in safe but pleasurable activities in life and
      addresses stimulant-abuse as well as associated factors including depression, as barriers to
      optimal PrEP adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants will receive a referral to the Miriam Hospital for standard of care
      PrEP treatment. Once prescribed PrEP through the Miriam Hospital, the study participants will
      be randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions. In the intervention condition,
      participants will receive a two-stepped intervention which could include up to 10 free BA and
      risk reduction (RR) counseling sessions. Participants assigned to the comparison condition
      will receive the standard of care for PrEP treatment at the Miriam Hospital, which includes
      information about PrEP and how to obtain it, assistance from medical staff in obtaining
      health insurance for study participants, and information regarding local community resources.
