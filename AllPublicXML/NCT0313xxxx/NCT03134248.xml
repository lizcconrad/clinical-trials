        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is at least 17 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer;

          2. Has had a self-reported oculo-visual examination in the last two years.

          3. Has read and signed an information consent letter;

          4. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;

          5. Is an adapted soft contact lens wearer;

          6. Is willing to wear contact lens in both eyes for the duration of the study;

          7. Has a minimum spectacle astigmatism of - 0.75;

          8. Can be fit with the three study contact lens types in the powers available;

          9. Has a visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye with habitual correction, or 20/20
             best corrected vision (for binocular distance acuity);

         10. Can achieve a distance visual acuity of 20/30 (0.18 logMar) or better in each eye with
             the study contact lenses.

         11. Has clear corneas and no active* ocular disease;

               -  For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or
                  inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered
                  clinically relevant) lid abnormalities (blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction,
                  papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered
                  active ocular disease. Neovascularization and corneal scars are the result of
                  previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and are therefore not active.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical trial;

          2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection;

          3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study
             outcome variable;

          4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator
             may affect a study outcome variable;

          5. Has known sensitivity to fluorescein dye or products to be used in the study;

          6. Appears to have any active* ocular pathology, ocular anomaly or severe insufficiency
             of lacrimal secretion (severe dry eye) that would affect the wearing of contact
             lenses;

          7. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment (by verbal
             confirmation at the screening visit);

          8. Is aphakic;

          9. Has undergone refractive error surgery.
