    <textblock>
      Issue: The prevalence and severity of sleep-disordered breathing increases during pregnancy
      due to weight gain, physiological and hormonal changes. These sleep breathing disorders have
      a negative impact on perinatal health for both the mother and the child.The optimal treatment
      of obstructive sleep apnea in pregnancy is unknown. Although CPAP therapy is often the
      treatment of choice, the mandibular advancement appliance would be an interesting alternative
      to solve the matter.

      Objectives: The main objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of
      mandibular advancement device to treat sleep apnea during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of
      pregnancy. Secondary objectives will be tools to plan a future randomized controlled trial to
      determine the efficacy of this treatment.

      Study design : Intervention Pilot Study uncontrolled experimental cohort

      Population: 32 pregnant women with sleep apnea with an apnea - hypopnea index ( AHI ) ≥ 10
      events / hr .

      Methodology: The mandibular advancement appliance will be used with the chip DentiTracs to
      measure adhesion. Participation in this project requires five visits to the research team,
      including 3 visits at home. Participants will be recruited and granted in obstetrics MUHC.
      The questionnaires will be filled (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality and
      functional (FOSQ)). A sleep recording (PSG type II) will be done at home to confirm the
      diagnosis. The recording equipment will be returned to the research team by mail. During the
      second visit (clinical orthodontics), dental impressions in alginate will be made. At the 3rd
      visit (clinical orthodontics), the mandibular advancement appliance will be adjusted and
      instructions will be given. A weekly phone call follow-up will be ensured during this period
      of adjustment of the appliance. The fourth visit (at home) will consist of a sleep recording
      to evaluate the effect of treatment. A questionnaire comfort / secondary effects will be
      administered. For patients who have started their participation during their second
      trimester, a sleep recording at home (4a visit) will be realized in Q3 to assess whether it
      is necessary to change the titration of the appliance. The 5th visit (orthodontic clinic)
      will be 3-6 months after delivery. Participants will fulfill all the mentioned questionnaires
      and make a sleep recording at home without the appliance. Replace the appliance in place if
      AHI&gt; 10. During the 4th and 5th visits, anthropometric data (ie, weight), and objective
      adhesion will be taken

    <description>SomnoDent is a custom-made oral appliance for the treatment of mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. SomnoDent is worn during sleep to provide Continuous Open Airway Therapy by moving the lower jaw slightly forward. This movement tightens the soft tissue and muscles of the upper airway, which prevents obstructive apneas while sleeping.</description>
