  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial, designed to evaluate the effect of structured
      physical exercise sessions on the spontaneous physical activity energy expenditure and
      caloric intake in overweight adults. The design employs a parallel three-group experimental
      arms: (1) a moderate exercise group (MEG); (2) a vigorous exercise group (VEG); and a control
      group (CG) without physical exercise sessions.

    <masking_description>Participants and physical trainer blinding will not be feasible due to the characteristics of prescribed exercise sessions. However, the evaluators will be blinded to the following endpoints: weight, body composition, appetite, energy intake and laboratorial biomarkers.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>spontaneous physical activity energy expenditure</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity energy expenditure will be assessed by a triaxial accelerometers (ActiGraph GT3x-BT, Pensacola, FL, USA). The device will be positioned at the anterior axillary line of the non-dominant hip, for 15 consecutive days</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>appetite sensations</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective hunger and satiety sensations will be measured through the visual analog scale (VAS) proposed by Flint et al. (2000).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>energy intake</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>Food and beverages consumption will be assessed by 24-h food recalls (REC24h). Nutritionists will conduct a face-to-face interview in four different moments during the intervention period: at the 2nd and 5th days (Tuesday and Friday) in the first week; and at the 11th and 15th days (Thursday and Monday) in the second week, including weekdays and weekend.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>laboratorial biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate the physiological mechanisms involved in energy expenditure and food consumption regulation, blood and salivary samples will be collected to biochemical and hormonal analyses at the 1st (baseline) and the 15th days of the intervention period, in the morning, after at least 10 hours of fasting.</description>
