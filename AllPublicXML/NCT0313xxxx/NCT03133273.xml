  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, chemotherapies are empirically administered to patients treated for colorectal
      cancer (CRC). Selection is based on the efficacy of a protocol previously determined on the
      largest number (consensus treatment), the decision-making process being weighted by patient's
      intrinsic criteria. However, each patient is unique, due to the inter- and intratumoral
      heterogeneity inherent in any cancer, partly explaining the unsatisfactory response rates
      observed for available chemotherapies. Functional sensitivity tests offer the possibility to
      adapt the treatment to each patient: they are based on an ex vivo study of the responses of
      the tumor cells (survival / death) to the different molecules / therapeutic combinations
      (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) likely to be administered to the patient. This response,
      translated into a tumor-specific sensitivity profile, can be used by the clinicians to
      determine the most appropriate therapeutic protocol. By increasing the therapeutic efficacy
      from the first line and reducing the deleterious side effects associated with multiple drug
      cycles, the sensitivity test transforms the consensus approach into personalized medicine,
      providing patients with improved progression free survival (PFS) associated with an
      improvement in the quality of life. Oncomedics has developed Oncogramme®, a CE-labeled in
      vitro diagnostic medical device that has already demonstrated the ability to predict
      chemosensitivity in a recent pilot study of metastatic CRC (prediction with 84% chance of
      success of tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy, vs. 50% maximum for chemotherapy administered
      according to the consensus method). The hypothesis that patients treated with a metastatic
      CRC for which systemic chemotherapy is adapted using Oncogramme® have better response rates,
      PFS and quality of life than patients treated according to usual practice, with optimization
      of the costs of care. To our knowledge, this is the only fully standardized test available,
      where each step and reagents of the procedure are mastered. The reliability of the procedure
      makes it possible to render a personalized result for each patient in 97% of the cases. In
      addition, the analysis is specifically centered on tumor cells using a method using fully
      defined, developed and validated media and reagents for each cancer, including CRC. The
      method of revealing the effect of the therapies identifies the proportion of dead cells in
      each condition, whatever their physiological state (proliferation / quiescence), by
      determining the percentage of living and killed cells, thus ensuring high sensitivity

    <intervention_model_description>Patients corresponding to the inclusion criteria and having a histologically proven metastatic CRC on biopsies or primary tumor excision and / or one or more metastatic sites will be recruited prospectively and randomized into two groups.
Usual care group: no Oncogramme will be made.
Oncogramme group: Taking of tumor fragments on the histological piece by an anatomopathological physician at the time of the histological examination and placing samples in the transport medium. The Oncogramme will be performed by Oncomedics on all specimens. Results will be returned to clinicians within 15 days.
For both groups, the adjuvant treatment will be decided in the multidisciplinary consultation meeting (MCM), according to the recommendations in force and adapted to the general medical condition of the patient. For patients in the Oncogramme group, chemotherapy will be adapted to Oncogramme.</intervention_model_description>
