      This is a prospective observational study to follow a cohort of patients with Cystic Fibrosis
      and healthy controls for a period of two years. This study will include monitoring the
      subjects lung clearance index (by performing a breathing test called the multiple breath
      washout), as well as spirometry and their respiratory symptoms every three months as well as
      during a pulmonary exacerbation and after their recovery.

      This is a prospective observational cohort study. During the 3 year study period, each
      participant will be followed for a period of 2 years. The study will include quarterly
      measurements of the lung clearance index (LCI), as well as spirometry, for CF patients at
      their routine clinic visits. Parents of patients with CF will be asked to call the study
      nurse or clinical nurse if they experience a worsening of pulmonary symptoms and to come to
      the clinic for assessment of lung function. CF patients will then be assessed by a CF
      physician to assess whether they require antibiotic treatment based on a clinicians decisions
      to treat with antibiotics. The treatment decision will be left to the discretion of the
      patient's responsible physician, who will be blinded to the MBW results. All patients who
      meet the symptom based definition of a pulmonary exacerbation, regardless of treatment
      decision, will have MBW measured after 4 weeks. Following these visits at the time of an
      exacerbation, patients will have their MBW measured at their next clinic visit (usually
      within 3 months), and every 3 months thereafter until the end of the 2 year observation
      period, or the repeat onset of symptoms.This study will capture a maximum of two
      exacerbations per patient over the 2 year study period.

        There were 139 subjects recruited in the original preschool longitudinal study, and all
        participants from this original study will be invited to participate in this follow up
        study. We would like to recruit an additional 40 CF patients at the Hospital for Sick
        Children to increase our cohort size.
