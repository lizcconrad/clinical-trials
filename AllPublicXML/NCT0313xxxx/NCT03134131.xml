      The objective of this expanded access program is to provide ONC201 on a single patient
      compassionate use basis to eligible adult subjects with recurrent glioma that exhibits a
      missense histone H3 mutation .

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed evidence of glioma with disease progression from immediately prior therapy
             or refractory to the immediately prior treatment.

          2. Evidence of the H3 K27M mutation detected in the tumor by a CLIA assay, either by IHC
             or DNA sequencing.

          3. Male or Female age ≥18 years.

          4. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 50%

          5. ECOG performance status ≤ 2.

          6. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mm3 without growth factor use ≤ 7 days prior to
                  treatment.

               2. Hemoglobin &gt;8.0 mg/dL without red blood cell transfusion ≤ 3 days prior to
                  treatment.

               3. Total serum bilirubin &lt;1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)

               4. AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2 X ULN; ≤ 5 X ULN if there is liver involvement secondary
                  to tumor.

               5. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN (OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2)

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          8. Ability to swallow capsules

          9. Female patients must be surgically sterile or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use
             effective contraception during the period of the trial and for at least 90 days after
             completion of treatment. Male patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use
             effective contraception during the period of the trial and for at least 90 days after
             completion of treatment. The decision of effective contraception will be based on the
             judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known active bacterial, fungal or viral infection including hepatitis B (HBV),
             hepatitis C (HCV).

          2. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
             (AIDS)-related illness.

          3. Any of the following in the previous 6 months: myocardial infarction, severe/unstable
             angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack or symptomatic pulmonary embolism.

          4. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, or in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             the study.
