  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the neural networks underlying the sleep-related motor
      consolidation process following motor imagery practice. While beneficial effects of sleep are
      expected for sequential movement but not for adaptation motor tasks, the corresponding
      neuroanatomical correlates have not yet been investigated when participants acquired the
      motor tasks through mental practice. Data should substantially promote how designing motor
      imagery interventions targeting (re)learning and/or motor recovery in patients suffering from
      motor disorders.

    <description>Participants of the Day group perform two motor tasks (a finger sequential motor task and an adaptation motor task using a trackball) in the MEG, during a pre-test (Day 1 - 9h).
Task 1: Participants perform an 8-digit motor sequential task where each finger (except the thumb) is used twice. Performance is assessed by using a 4-keys keyboard. Participants are required to keep their fingers on the keys to minimize amplitude are instructed to tap the sequence as few errors as possible Task 2: Participants perform a motor adaptation task requiring scrolling a trackball to superimpose a geometric shape on another one, strictly similar but presented from another angle, as fast as possible.</description>
