  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
      Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and, if indicated, invasively measured
      fractional flow reserve (FFR) is currently used for ruling out significant coronary artery
      disease. FFRCT is a novel non-invasive technique in which FFR is derived from CT images,
      however this method is currently, just like CCTA, lacking specificity. Spectral Detector CT
      (SDCT) is a novel technique whereby a spectrum of monoenergetic images at different
      kiloelectron Volt (keV) values (40 to 200 keV) can be reconstructed. By using these
      monoenergetic images, a decrease in blooming and beam-hardening artifacts could be achieved.
      In addition, SDCT offers the opportunity to assess myocardial iodine distribution and
      quantification. When combining these factors, we hypothesize more accurate information will
      be available about the coronary anatomy, degree of stenosis and FFRCT and thereby contribute
      to a more accurate way for the detection of hemodynamic significant stenosis. Therefore, the
      aim of this study is to assess the accuracy of SDCT as a non-invasive way for the detection
      of hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis.

      Objective: The overall objective of this project is to assess the accuracy of SDCT for the
      detection of flow limiting stenosis in the coronary arteries using invasive FFR as the
      standard of reference. Whereby different subaims (e.g. improvement of FFRCT) are made to
      answer the overall objective. The secondary objective is to determine the decrease of calcium
      blooming of calcifications and beam-hardening artifacts and the improvement of myocardial
      blood volume quantification on SDCT in comparison with conventional CT.
