  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research is to study the cognitive and cerebral mechanisms of the
      integration of central and peripheral visual information during normal and pathological aging
      (ophthalmological patients with AMD and glaucoma) through fMRI studies. To assess the effect
      of normal aging, research will be conducted on a group of young participants with normal
      vision and a group of elderly participants with normal vision. Each participant will be
      assessed once during an MRI (during which the brain activity and behavioral performance will
      be measured). In order to evaluate the effect of pathological aging, research will be
      conducted on AMD patients, glaucomatous patients, and age-matched controls (normal vision),
      evaluated only once during an MRI examination.

      Healthy / control participants with normal vision will be volunteers, selected after
      interview (inclusion assessment). Their recruitment will be carried out on the basis of
      advertisements displayed at Grenoble Alpes University. Patients will be volunteers, selected
      on the basis of their ophthalmological clinical record. Their recruitment will be done at the
      Ophthalmology Clinic of the University Hospital of Grenoble (through Professor Florent
      Aptel). For all the participants, a medical examination before MRI examination will be
      carried out in the MRU unit of the CHU of Grenoble in order to verify the eligibility
      criteria for contraindications to MRI and MRI scanning. The results of these examinations
      will be communicated to the subjects prior to the expression of their consent directly or
      through the doctor of their choice.
