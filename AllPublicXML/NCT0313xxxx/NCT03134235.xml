      This study evaluates the effects of a prescribed 4-week raw, plant-based dietary intervention
      in the treatment of excess body weight, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension in the
      clinical setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plant-based diets have emerged in the literature as effective therapeutic strategies in the
      reduction of body weight, serum lipids and blood pressure. In addition, raw fruit and
      vegetable consumption has also been associated with the reduction of these clinical
      indicators.

      Participants were instructed to follow a prescribed, raw, plant-based dietary intervention
      for four weeks. All animal products, including eggs and dairy, were excluded. Cooked foods,
      free oils, soda, alcohol and coffee were also to be excluded. All meals and snacks were
      provided to the participants for the full duration of the intervention. Emphasized were raw
      fruits and vegetables, while seeds, avocado, raw oats, raw buckwheat, and dehydrated foods
      were prepared as condiments. Vitamin, herbal, and mineral supplements were to be discontinued
      unless otherwise clinically indicated. Participants were not advised to alter their exercise
      habits.

      Participants came to a total of 4 follow-up visits. A laboratory panel was obtained at
      baseline and at 4-weeks. A 24-hour recall was also conducted at baseline and at 4-weeks.
      Anthropometrics, hemodynamics, and medication needs were assessed on a weekly basis.
