      Patients were interviewed the day before surgery, and taught about the use of PCA pump and
      VAS. Pressure pain threshold(PPT) and pressure pain tolerance(PTO) were collected before
      surgery.

      Dexmedetomidine1μg/Kg，sufentanil 0.5μg/Kg， propofol 2mg/Kg and rocuronium 0.6mg/Kg were given
      intravenously for induction. Anesthesia was maintained with inhalation of 1% sevoflurane and
      infusion of remifentanil (0.2-0.4ug/kg/min) and propofol (6-10mg/kg/h). Aterial blood
      pressure(ABP)，central venous pressure(CVP)，SPO2， HR，ETCO2，T and Narcotrend were monitored.
      Before incision, parecoxib 40mg was given intravenously, and PCA with sufentanil 1ug/ml was
      started immediately after surgery, suing a controlled infusion pump. The pump was programmed
      to use a loading dose of 2ml, background infusion at 2m/h, PCA dose of 1ml, lockout time of
      10min, and maximal dose of 12ml with 1 h period.

      VAS(static), VAS(dynamic), Ramssay, HR, NBP, SpO2, PCA pressing frequency, PCA comsumption
      were recorded 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h after surgery. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting,
      respiratory depression; pruritus; abdominal distention; urinary retention and dizziness were
      also recorded, and corresponding treatment were given.

      EDTA anti-coagulated blood was collected from a central venous catheter during the operation.
      Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood samples, and characteristics and degree of DNA
      methylation of the gene OPRM1 were analysed.
