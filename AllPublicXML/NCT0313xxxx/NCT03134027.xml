  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to obtain human blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor
      cells (HSPCs) to reconstitute a match human immune system in our PDX model. The hypothesis is
      that by using matched leukocytes and PDX from the same patient, rejection of the PDX by the
      host immune system will not be observed and therefore a preclinical model to study
      immunotherapy can be developed to study, understand and improve upon our current therapies.
      HSPCs will be collected from bone marrow aspirate obtained from a bone marrow biopsy.
