  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will come in for three separate visits in which they will be
      interviewed, perform a variety of tasks, and undergo a non-invasive MRI scan. The
      investigators anticipate that (1) participants with anxiety and depression will likely
      perform differently than the healthy controls on cognitive tasks, (2) participants with
      anxiety and depression will likely show differences in brain functionality compared to the
      healthy controls, and (3) depression and anxiety likely share some underlying mechanisms.

      In order to determine eligibility, a brief phone screen lasting approximately 15 minutes will
      be conducted. If participants are eligible, they will be asked to come in for three separate
      visits. During the first visit, participants will complete questionnaires as well as a
      structured interview with one of the study's staff members at Palo Alto University in Los
      Altos. During the second visit, participants would come to Palo Alto University in Los Altos
      and complete questionnaires as well as a testing session involving various tasks. During the
      third visit, participants would undergo a non-invasive brain scan in which participants would
      complete a task as well as various questionnaires at Stanford University in Stanford.

      The investigators have flexible hours and can work around participants' schedules! To inquire
      more about participation, participants can either email the investigators at
      paloalto.study@gmail.com or call the investigators at (650) 417-2000 ext. 3642
