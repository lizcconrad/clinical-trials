    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to assess sonographic changes of the median nerve after
      steroid injection for carpal tunnel syndrome.

      Patients with CTS were recruited. The Boston Questionnaire (BQ) was administered and
      ultrasonographic and electrophysiological examinations were performed before and at two, six,
      and 12 weeks after steroid injection. Cross sectional area (CSA) was measured at 2 levels: at
      the tunnel inlet and in the mid-carpal tunnel. Flattening ratio (FR) was measured only in the
      mid-carpal tunnel. Correlation analyses between baseline ultrasonography, BQ, and
      electrophysiological measures were performed.

    <description>The CSA of the median nerve was measured at 2 levels: at the carpal tunnel inlet (CSA-I; immediately prior to the proximal margin of the flexor retinaculum) and in the mid-carpal tunnel (CSA-M; at the level of the pisiform bone and scaphoid tubercle)</description>

    <measure>flattening ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The flattening ratio was measured only at the mid-tunnel (FR-M). FR was calculated by dividing the horizontal diameter of the nerve by the vertical diameter.</description>

    <measure>Median nerve distal motor latency</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the CMAPs were obtained via surface electrodes placed on the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The active recording electrode was placed on the muscle belly, and the reference electrode was placed on the tendon insertion. The median nerve was stimulated 8 cm proximal to the active recording electrode. Distal motor latencies were measured from the onset of stimulus artifact to the onset of the CMAP</description>

    <measure>sensory nerve conduction velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SNAPs were obtained using an antidromic method and recorded by surface electrodes placed at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the index finger for the median nerve and the same joints of the little finger for the ulnar nerve. The median nerves were stimulated at the wrist at a distance of 14 cm from the wrist to the active electrode. Distal sensory latencies were measured from the onset of the stimulus artifact to the onset of the SNAP. SNCV was calculated dividing the distance of 14 cm by the distal sensory latency.</description>
