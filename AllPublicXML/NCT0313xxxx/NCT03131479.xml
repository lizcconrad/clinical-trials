  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether the study drug, LIK066, causes glucose
      excretion in urine in patients with varying degrees of decreased kidney function and in
      subjects with normal kidney function. Blood samples will also be collected to measure the
      concentrations of LIK066 and to study the pharmacokinetics of LIK066. Pharmacokinetics is to
      study how LIK066 is absorbed, distributed and eliminated, in other words what the body does
      to the drug. The results of this study may be used to help determine whether LIK066 can be
      used to treat people with reduced kidney function and the proper dosing regimen.
