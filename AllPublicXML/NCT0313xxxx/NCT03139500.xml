  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      JNJ61803534 in healthy participants after administration of single ascending oral doses of
      JNJ-61803534 (Part 1) and multiple ascending oral doses of JNJ-61803534, administered for 14
      consecutive days (Part 2) as well as the potential of JNJ-61803534 to interact with other
      drugs (Part 3).

             invasive candidiasis) or diagnosed latent infection

          -  Participant has received an investigational treatment (including investigational
             vaccines) within 2 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) or used an invasive
             investigational medical device within 3 months before the planned first dose of study
             treatment or is currently enrolled in an investigational study

          -  Participant had major surgery, (example, requiring general anesthesia) within 12 weeks
             before screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has major surgery
             planned during the time the participant is expected to participate in the study or
             within 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment administration
