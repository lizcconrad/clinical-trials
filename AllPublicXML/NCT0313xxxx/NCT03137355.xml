  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a database containing clinical and laboratory
      information for patients with Leigh syndrome. The goal is to provide a greater understanding
      of Leigh syndrome allowing further characterization of this disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leigh syndrome, also known as juvenile sub-acute necrotizing encephalopathy, is a progressive
      neurodegenerative disorder associated with dysfunction of mitochondrial oxidative
      phosphorylation (OXPHOS). First described in 1951 by British neuropsychiatrist Archibald
      Denis Leigh, the condition has evolved from a post mortem diagnosis to a clinical entity with
      characteristic radiologic and laboratory findings.

      Leigh syndrome is a rare and heterogeneous disease, finding a substantial number of patients
      to study is difficult. The lack of natural history data in Leigh syndrome and the small
      number of patients included in clinical reports thus far has limited the ability to fully
      comprehend the progression of this disease and assess prognostic factors. A Leigh syndrome
      database will help improve our understanding of this rare disease leading to an improved
      ability to predict outcomes and/or improve treatment paradigms. Collecting natural history
      data on Leigh syndrome and integrating this information into a database will be useful in
      understanding the course of the disease and identifying trends.
