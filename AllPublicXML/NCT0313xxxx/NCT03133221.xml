  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to learn how safe and how effective the study drug Zydelig works, after
      autologous stem cell transplant as a maintenance therapy in patients with indolent or
      transformed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (iNHL or tiNHL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is focused on maintenance Zydelig for patients with indolent or transformed
      indolent B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (iNHL or tiNHL) after autologous stem cell
      transplantation. Oral Zydelig at 150 mg (or adjusted dose) twice daily continuously on 28-day
      cycles. Patients will continue on Zydelig up to one year or to progression/relapse/death or
      unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically documented (by HPI or pathology report) iNHL as defined by follicular
             lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom
             disease (LPL/WM) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) or tiNHL as defined by large B
             cell transformation of any of the above entities including chronic lymphocytic
             leukemia (CLL)

          2. Patients must be eligible to undergo high dose chemotherapy (HDT) followed by ASCT as
             a form of remission consolidation

          3. Patients without evidence of documented disease progression clinically or
             radiographically after ASCT (stable disease (SD), partial remission (PR) or complete
             remission (CR)) who have had count recovery (ANC &gt; 500, non-transfused platelet count
             &gt; 20,000) and are at least 30 days post ASCT but no more than 120 days post ASCT

          4. Patients may have received any prior therapy deemed necessary for them to be eligible
             to HDT/ASCT except for patients whom have progressed while on Zydelig. Patients who
             have responded to Zydelig previously are eligible for enrollment on the protocol.

          5. Age &gt;18

          6. ECOG performance status &lt;4

          7. Life expectancy of greater than four months.

          8. Patients must have normal organ function as defined below (after the HDT/ASCT):

               -  total bilirubin less than 2x institutional upper limit of normal

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5x institutional upper limit of normal OR creatinine clearance &gt;60
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5x upper limit of normal.

          9. Because the effects of Zydelig on the developing human fetus are unknown, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Participants must agree to use contraception for at least 30
             days after the last dose of Zydelig. Women of childbearing potential is defined as

             removal of fallopian tubes, ovaries or uterus.

         10. Ability to understand English and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

             disease.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Zydelig.

          6. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

          7. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection (defined as requiring systemic antibiotic treatment and fever within 48
             hours of screening), symptomatic congestive heart failure (patients with NYHA score of
             III and above are excluded), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          8. Women who are pregnant or nursing or plan to become pregnant or nurse during the
             course of the study.

             according to Lexicomp. Please see appendix C of the protocol for more information.
