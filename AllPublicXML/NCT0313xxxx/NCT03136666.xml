  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics as well as safety and
      tolerability of a concomitant administration of nifedipine GITS and candesartan tablets under
      fasting conditions in healthy male subjects.

      -  Treatment period 1: Single oral dose of 30 mg nifedipine GITS and 8 mg candesartan as
           loose combination (Treatment A)

        -  Treatment period 2: Single oral dose of 60 mg nifedipine GITS and 16 mg candesartan as
           loose combination (Treatment B)

        -  Treatment period 3: single oral dose of 60 mg nifedipine GITS and 32 mg candesartan as
           loose combination (Treatment C) Before any study drug administration in each treatment
           period, subjects were fasted from food for at least 10 hours. Subjects continued fasting
           until at least 4 hours after study drug administration. The wash-out phase between
           treatments was 5 days.

      The blood collection period for pharmacokinetics after administration was 48 h. Afterwards,
      subjects were discharged from the ward. A safety follow-up visit was performed approximately
      7 days after the last administration.
