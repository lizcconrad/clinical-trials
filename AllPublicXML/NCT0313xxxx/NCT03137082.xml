  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Guanfacine may preferentially reduce craving and improve cognitive control in women with
      Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), compared to men. As these behaviors are related to relapse, the
      objectives of this study are to conduct a 10-week out-patient clinical trial to examine the
      effects of Guanfacine Extended Release (XR; 3mgs) versus placebo on drinking measures in
      women with AUD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gender-specific variation in sympathetic sensitivity (Fox et al., 2014; Fox and Sinha, 2009;
      Cahill, 2003; Heinsbroek et al., 1991) may mean that guanfacine is particularly efficacious
      in attenuating drinking in women, rather than men with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Thus, the
      investigators propose a double blind, placebo-controlled, 10-week randomized clinical trial
      to examine the effects of Guanfacine XR (3mgs/daily) versus placebo in 60 women with AUD.
      This will include twice weekly appointments comprising medical management and contingency
      management protocols, collection of urine, breathalyzer screens, and vitals. Measures of
      craving and mood will also be assessed. Parallel laboratory challenge studies will also be
      conducted both on admission to out-patient treatment and again following 4 weeks of
      treatment, in order to better elucidate the potentially therapeutic mechanisms of guanfacine.
      Participants will be exposed to a personal stress versus relaxing imagery condition, 1
      condition per day, in a randomized order. Craving, anxiety, mood, cognitive control, heart
      rate and blood pressure (HRBP), and biological stress system markers will be assessed at
      baseline, following imagery and at various recovery timepoints.

    <description>The Alcohol Urges Questionnaire (AUQ) will be administered 2 times per week to assess changes in craving. The scale comprises 8 craving-related statements ranging from 1(Strongly Disagree) to 7(Strongly Agree), yielding a total ranging from 7 to 56. The higher the score, the higher the reported craving.</description>

    <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS) will be administered 2 times per week to assess changes in mood. The scale comprises 72 adjectives that describe different feelings, and participants are required to rate the extent to which they are experiencing each feeling at the moment, from 0= not at all; 1= a little; 2= moderately; 3= quite a bit; 4= extremely. Subscales include: Tension; Depression; Anxiety; Fatigue; Confusion; Vigor</description>
