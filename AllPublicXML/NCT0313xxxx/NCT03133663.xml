  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether using electrocardiograms (ECGs) during
      resuscitation of preterm infants (less than 31 weeks gestation) will decrease the amount of
      time it takes from birth for heart rate (HR) to be above 100 beats per minute and oxygen
      saturations to be in the goal range, in other words to stabilize the infant. A few studies
      have been conducted which showed that ECGs are faster at detecting HR than pulse oximetry
      (PO). Sample sizes, however, have been small and only few extremely low birthweight infants
      have been included. It is unclear if use of ECG in these tiny preterm infants in addition to
      traditional techniques to determine HR will be beneficial and impact resuscitation and
      outcomes. The investigators propose a study where infants will be randomized to either using
      ECG in addition to PO ± auscultation versus PO ± auscultation only to assess HR during
      neonatal resuscitation. The investigators hypothesize that the group of infants randomized to
      ECG will be able to stabilize faster, i.e. achieve HR &gt; 100 beats per minute and oxygen
      saturation in goal range faster.
