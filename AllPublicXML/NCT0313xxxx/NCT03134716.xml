      Our aim is to evaluate whether translocator binding protein (TSPO)-imaging correlates to
      Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and other disease progression-related clinical and
      paraclinical parameters in a homogenous cohort of 40-50-year old MS-patients, who are at risk
      of progression. The A2A-AR expression in this cohort will also be studied using the adenosine
      A2A-receptor (A2A-AR)-binding radioligand 11C-TMSX. The study cohort will also form the basis
      for a later follow-up study, which will be performed to evaluate the prognostic value of
      baseline TSPO-imaging in terms of disease progression. TSPO-imaging could thus be used as an
      imaging biomarker to help identifying patients to therapeutically prevent progression of MS.

      CLINICAL STUDY

      Protocol title:

      Does TSPO-radioligand-binding correlate to clinical parameters related to disease progression
      in an at-risk relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) cohort? Study design:
      Cross-sectional exploratory study Rationale of the study: The investigators have demonstrated
      earlier a statistically significant correlation between TSPO-binding and EDSS in a
      heterogeneous MS-population comprising both early RRMS and late secondary progressive
      multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients. Now the investigators aim to evaluate whether
      TSPO-imaging correlates to EDSS and other disease progression-related clinical and
      paraclinical parameters in a homogenous cohort of 40-50-year old MS-patients, who are at risk
      of progression. The A2A-AR expression in this cohort will also be studied using the
      A2A-AR-binding radioligand 11C-TMSX. The study cohort will also form the basis for a later
      follow-up study, which will be performed to evaluate the prognostic value of baseline
      TSPO-imaging in terms of disease progression. TSPO-imaging could thus be used as an imaging
      biomarker to help identifying patients to therapeutically prevent progression of MS.

      Study population: The study population will consist of a clinically homogenous group of 25
      RRMS patients with MS-diagnosis for at least 5 years, age 40-50 years, who may be using any
      first-line MS therapy. The patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the
      Division of Clinical Neurosciences of the University Hospital of Turku, Finland. In addition
      the investigators will image a group of 25 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects to
      allow for comparison in 11C-TMSX-binding. The investigators already have a control group for
      TSPO-imaging.

      Study Objectives Primary: To evaluate how TSPO-ligand binding in the normal appearing white
      matter (NAWM) correlates to EDSS.

      Secondary: 1) To evaluate how TSPO-ligand binding in the NAWM at baseline correlates to other
      standard clinical and paraclinical parameters typically associated with disease progression
      2) To evaluate how 11C-TMSX-binding (to A2A-AR) correlates to the clinical and paraclinical
      parameters, and to TSPO-binding.

      Inclusion criteria: RRMS, age 40-50 years, MS-diagnosis for a minimum of five years.
      Exclusion criteria: Previous or present treatment with immunosuppressive medication or
      biologicals. Steroid treatment within 30 days of evaluation Evaluation of patients: Baseline
      brain MRI and PET using 11C-PK11195 and 11C-TMSX with a protocol used in our previous
      studies. MS functional composite (MSFC), brain atrophy, quantitative diffusion tensor
      magnetic resonance imaging (DTI-MRI) measures, and neuropsychological status.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging methods: 1) Detection of microglial activation.
      The investigators shall use the TSPO-ligand 11C-PK11195 to evaluate the level of microglial
      activation in the NAWM, in normal appearing gray matter (NAGM) and in the periplaque areas.
      The 11C-PK11195 imaging. 2) A2A-AR detection. The investigators shall investigate the
      distribution of the A2A-ARs using PET and (11C-TMSX). This will be performed to correlate
      A2A-AR expression with microglial activation in the CNS of RRMS patients at risk of
      converting to SPMS. The 11C-TMSX imaging.

      Based on earlier experience with PET ligands it is estimated that 15 subjects per group is
      enough to reveal 15% difference in 11C-PK11195 and 11C-TMSX uptake between the study groups
      with 90% power at p-level &lt;0.05. The correlation analyses between the variables will be
      performed with Spearman's non-parametric test for non-linear, and Pearson's test for linear
      association.

      Facilities: Turku PET Centre (TPC) is the national PET Centre in Finland. It has six state-of
      the-art PET scanners and a long history of performing PET scanning in neurological disorders,
      and in animal models thereof (www.turkupetcentre.fi). Radiochemical synthesis of 11C-PK11195
      has been established in TPC and study projects on MS patients have been completed and
      published by our research group previously. The A2A-AR ligand 11C-TMSX is already in use in
      the TPC.

      People involved: Dr. Laura Airas, MD, PhD. Consultant in neurology, and assistant professor
      in neurology. Professor Juha Rinne, MD, Consultant in Neurology. Turku PET Centre. Professor
      Riitta Parkkola, MD, Neuroradiologist. Dr. Eero Rissanen MD, PhD. Dr. Marcus Sucksdorff, MD,
      PhD student. Neuropsychologist, NN. Ms. Riina Ketola, study nurse.

      Future objectives: The proposed study is a cross-sectional exploratory pilot study to be
      followed by a larger application to Finnish and international funding agencies for a
      longitudinal extension. Our aim is to continue the evaluation of the patient cohort studied,
      and to study whether TSPO-ligand-binding at baseline can be used as a predictive biomarker in
      terms of disease progression. The investigators plan to evaluate whether TSPO-ligand-binding
      in the NAWM at baseline is predictive of clinical conversion to SPMS at the end of a
      five-year follow-up period. The investigators also plan to evaluate how TSPO-ligand binding
      at baseline correlates to a change in the clinical and paraclinical parameters evaluated.

    <description>Our primary outcome is the detection of microglial activation. We will use the TSPO-ligand 11C-PK11195 to evaluate the level of microglial activation in the NAWM, in NAGM and in the periplaque areas. Our hypothesis is that microglial activation in the central nervous system (CNS) is increased among those RRMS patients whose disease converts to SPMS during the 5 year follow up time. We shall correlate the distribution volume ratio (DVR) of the radioligand binding to EDSS and other progression-related parameters including MS functional composite (MSFC), brain atrophy, quantitative DTI-MRI measures, and neuropsychological status.</description>
