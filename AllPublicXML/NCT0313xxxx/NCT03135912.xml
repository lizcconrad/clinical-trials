  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of an experimental
      treatment in the treatment of tinea pedis (athlete's foot). The experimental treatment will
      be tested against a vehicle control to determine efficacy and safety, and against an active
      comparator to evaluate the success of the treatment relative to an existing gold-standard
      treatment. Patients will be treated for four weeks, with their condition being assessed at
      the end of treatment and two weeks after the end of treatment. The primary endpoint for this
      study is effective treatment rate at the week 6 evaluation, defined as a mycological cure and
      minimal clinical signs &amp; symptoms. Secondary endpoints include safety and patient evaluation
      of treatment.

    <measure>Effective Treatment (Mycological Cure and Minimal Symptoms)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Binary outcome measure defined as mycological cure AND a total clinical assessment score less than or equal to 2 (out of a possible 18). Mycological cure is defined as negative potassium hydroxide microscopy, while the clinical assessment is based on a sum of 6 symptoms (desquamation, vesiculation, erythema, fissuring, maceration, and pruritus) scored 0-3 by a physician.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To examine treatment safety, we will calculate the rate of adverse events and serious adverse and compare them between the study's three arms using Chi-square tests to evaluate whether a statistically significant difference is present.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effective Treatment (Mycological Cure and Minimal Symptoms)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Effective treatment as defined above, but measured at the end of treatment (4 weeks after the beginning of participation).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the conclusion of treatment, patients complete a brief survey on their impressions of the treatment's tolerability, effectiveness, and convenience on a five-point scale, where 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 = very good, 5 = excellent, or they may answer with &quot;No answer/prefer not to say&quot;. Scores will be compared for each of the three characteristics and as a sum of the three scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Reported Patient Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>On the same experience questionnaire, patients are asked to estimate how many doses of treatment they missed or forgot to take. Possible answers are None, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, or 9 or more. This indicates whether there is a significant difference in patients' likelihood to adhere to a treatment regimen.</description>
