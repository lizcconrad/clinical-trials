      Determine the effectiveness of peppermint oil aromatherapy in relieving post-operative nausea
      in the bariatric surgery patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy weight management and use of essential oils and aromatherapy as natural interventions
      to manage health-related issues are significantly growing interests. One frequent
      intervention for healthy weight management is bariatric surgery. In the post-operative period
      following bariatric surgery, nausea is a common consequence. Peppermint oil aromatherapy is
      an effective intervention for relieving nausea and other gastrointestinal symptoms in the
      bariatric and surgical population. This study has multiple aims. One is to determine
      effectiveness of peppermint oil aromatherapy in relieving post-operative nausea in the
      bariatric surgery patient population. A second aim is to establish relative
      cost-effectiveness of peppermint oil aromatherapy versus traditional anti-emetic drug
      therapies. A third is to determine whether peppermint oil aromatherapy increases patient
      satisfaction versus anti-emetic drug therapies. This is a randomized study with control and
      experimental groups. The control group will receive no peppermint oil aromatherapy and only
      traditional anti-emetics as needed. The experimental group will receive peppermint oil
      aromatherapy and traditional anti-emetics as needed.

    <description>Patients in the control group will not receive peppermint oil aromatherapy as a primary intervention for postoperative nausea and vomiting. Primary therapy for postoperative nausea and vomiting would entail standard antiemetic drug therapies. Patient monitoring and documentation would include the following: Patients in the control group will be assessed every 4 hours and as needed for nausea. All aspects of care from physician, nursing and all disciplines will be consistent with current practices in care of postoperative bariatric surgical patients.</description>

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will receive peppermint oil aromatherapy as primary treatment for postoperative nausea. Pharmacological therapy with anti-nausea drug therapies will be available as needed. All other aspects of medical, surgical and nursing care will be standard practice for pre and post-operative care related to the bariatric surgical patient. Patients in the intervention group will be assessed every 4 hours and as needed for nausea. Post-intervention, the patient will be re-assessed for level of nausea after one hour. In the event the patient refuses peppermint oil aromatherapy and requests anti-emetic drug therapies, they are able to do so.</description>
