  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized cirrhotic patients are at high risk of complications and adverse outcomes. This
      study aims to determine the current practice and outcomes in these following areas:

        1. Community-acquired infections

        2. Nosocomial infections

        3. Development of second infections

        4. Factors predicting ICU care, organ failure, death, and disability

        5. Patterns and adequacy of albumin use in infected and non-infected patients

        6. Per and post-liver transplant outcomes

        7. Quality-assurance and adequacy of management of complications of cirrhosis such as
           hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, hyponatremia, and hypernatremia

        8. Regional variations in outcomes and therapeutic strategies
