  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will estimate the effect of food and the proton pump inhibitor, esomeprazole on
      the pharmacokinetics of crizotinib in a coated microsphere formulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 5-treatment, 6-sequence study in adult
      healthy volunteers. Subjects will receive up to four separate single oral 300 mg doses of a
      coated microsphere (cMS) formulation of crizotinib. Period 1 through Period 3 will evaluate
      the effect of food, and, the effect of multiple doses of a gastrointestinal acid reducing
      agent, esomeprazole, in fasted state, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of crizotinib cMS. Period
      4 will evaluate whether apple sauce or orange juice may reduce the effect of multiple doses
      of esomeprazole on the PK of crizotinib cMS, if there is an effect.

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

         17. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with study participation or crizotinib cMS and/or
             esomeprazole administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for
