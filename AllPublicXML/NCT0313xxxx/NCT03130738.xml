  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of active treatment
      (miconazole oil) for 7 versus 14 days, and to compare 14 days of active treatment (miconazole
      oil) to inactive treatment (placebo) over a 14-day treatment duration, in subjects with
      fungal infection (otomycosis) of the external ear.
