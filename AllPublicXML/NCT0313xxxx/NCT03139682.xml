  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability around the world. The
      social and economic burden of TBI is tremendous and the cost of TBI is estimated at $1
      billion per year in Canada- $650 million in care and $580 million in lost productivity. Novel
      interventions aimed at TBI-linked molecular targets have been successful in limiting injury
      and improving neurologic recovery in animal models, thus providing compelling evidence that
      effective intervention is possible after injury. This study proposes to investigate traumatic
      microvascular injury (TMI) and specifically blood-brain barrier dysfunction (BBBD) as a
      candidate biomarker and therapeutic target in TBI.

        We will recruit mild (n=40), moderate (n=40) and severe (n=40) TBI patients with a
        TBI-linked abnormality (e.g. epidural &amp; subdural hematomas, subarachnoid hemorrhage,
        contusions). TBI will be classified by severity using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS); mild
        TBI (GCS13-15), moderate TBI (GCS 9-12), and severe TBI (GCS &lt;8).
