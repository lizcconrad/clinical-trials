  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Center for Autonomic Medicine in Pediatrics (CAMP) has collaborated with doctors from
      around the world to build the first International ROHHAD (Rapid-onset Obesity with
      Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation) REDCap (Research
      Electronic Data Capture) Registry. This registry is an international collaboration with
      ROHHAD patients and their physicians recruited from around the world.

      The purpose of this IRB-approved research study is to gain a better understanding of the
      various health problems ROHHAD patients face with advancing age, and how these relate to each
      patient's specific medical course. With a better understanding of specific ROHHAD and
      associated clinical manifestations, we will be able to better anticipate healthcare needs and
      to provide more accurate guidelines to healthcare providers world-wide in caring for patients
      with ROHHAD.

      The study aims to obtain detailed phenotypic information (information about health and
      well-being) on patients with ROHHAD. Participation would require filling out a confidential
      survey that asks questions regarding health and past medical history. Involvement in the
      project is completely voluntary and there is no compensation for taking part. However, this
      project will help us learn more about this devastating disease, with the goal of advancing
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ROHHAD is a rare, devastating disorder in which affected children demonstrate abnormalities
      of respiratory control, hypothalamic/endocrine function, and autonomic nervous system (ANS)
      dysregulation (ANSD). Affected children are seemingly normal until development of dramatic
      and rapid weight gain which occurs over a 6-month period between 1.5 and 10 years of age -
      heralding disease onset. The ROHHAD phenotype appears to evolve with advancing age and with
      variable timing of successive features. This study aims to develop a patient registry for
      ROHHAD, which will provide crucial insight into disease development, improving outcome in
      these children through improving early recognition of the disorder, understanding the
      phenotypic spectrum, and evolution of clinical course. Data will be stored in REDCap
      (Research Electronic Data Capture) system a secure web application designed exclusively to
      support data capture for research studies in a secure manner. The REDCap server is hosted
      securely at Northwestern University, behind a firewall, with virus protection, and using
      Secure Socket Layer (SSL) authentication to encrypt communication between a user and the
      server. Protected Health Information (PHI) will be labeled as such in the database and access
      to it will be restricted to the Principal Investigator (PI) and key personnel participating
      in the consent process and follow up contact of participants.

      Participants in the International ROHHAD REDCap Registry will be identified and recruited
      from CAMP's registry of new, current, and past ROHHAD referrals, including ROHHAD patients
      referred for testing and/or consultation. Additionally, patients may also be recruited via
      the internet using emails, Facebook pages, and mailing lists for family groups. Anyone
      interested will be offered inclusion into the International ROHHAD Registry. Participants
      will be able to participate remotely, from their homes or locations where they have internet,
      phone, and computer access.

      De-identified data collected through the REDCap registry will be de-identified and analyzed.
      Patients enrolled in this study will be offered participation in the NIH GRDR. This is an
      optional part of the study, and is not required for inclusion. The Global Rare Disease
      Registry (GRDR) is established by the NIH Office of Rare Disease Research. The goal of the
      GRDR is to establish a data repository of de-identified patient data, aggregated in a
      standardized manner, using Common Data Elements (CDEs) and standardized terminology.
      De-identification of patient's data will utilize the Global Unique Identifiers (GUID) system.
      Lurie Children's Hospital will retain ownership of all data shared with the GRDR. The
      de-identified data in the GRDR will be available to all investigators to enable analyses
      across many rare diseases and to facilitate various biomedical studies, including clinical
      trials, in pursuit of developing drugs and therapeutics to improve the healthcare and the
      quality of life for the many millions of people who are diagnosed with rare diseases.

      Any patient agreeing to be part of the GRDR will have their data de-identified and this
      de-identified data exported and shared with the GRDR. These participants are also given the
      option to be contacted for participation in clinical trials. If this option is chosen, any
      researcher accessing de-identified information through the GRDR and planning to conduct a
      clinical trial will be allowed to contact the CAMP project coordinator to ask that patients
      fitting the profile of needed participants be contacted and offered inclusion. No
      de-identified information will be shared with researchers outside of CAMP, rather the CAMP
      project coordinator will contact identified patients fitting participation criteria to share
      contact information and details for the clinical trial. Interested patients will then be
      given to the option to contact researchers conducting clinical trials at their discretion.
