    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of pembrolizumab-based therapy in previously treated extrapulmonary
      poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two parts of the study. In Part A, subjects are treated with pembrolizumab alone,
      and in Part B with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (physician's choice, paclitaxel or
      irinotecan). Adaptive Simon's two-stage design is used. The overall plan hinges on the
      activity of single agent pembrolizumab in the first stage of Part A. If there is sufficient
      activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will expand to the second stage of Part A
      and forgo Part B. If there is insufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study
      will proceed to the first stage of Part B (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy).

                  or acinar cell NEC are allowed if the high grade (small or large cell) NEC
                  component comprises &gt;50% of the original sample or subsequent biopsy

          4. Have progressed during or after completion of first line systemic therapy

             a. No limit to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens

          5. Have at least one measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1

          6. Patients must agree to have a biopsy of metastatic tissue at baseline, and there must

             investigator).

               1. Patients with unsuccessful baseline biopsies may undergo an additional biopsy
                  attempt (at the same or a different site, determined by the investigator).

               2. For patients with an intact primary and no metastatic site that can be safely
                  biopsied, biopsy of the primary is acceptable, but must be approved by the
                  principal investigator.

               3. Baseline tumor biopsy may be omitted if the tumor is inaccessible and/or a biopsy
                  is not thought to post exceptionally high procedural risk due to location or
                  other factors

             days of treatment initiation.

         10. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course

             Section 5.7.2). Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been
             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         12. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

        for the subject.

             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

         12. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using

             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         19. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
