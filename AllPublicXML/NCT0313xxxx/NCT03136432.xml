  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of permanent disorders of movement and posture, generally
      accompanied by secondary musculoskeletal problems. Studies in literature showed taht children
      with CP supports a link between the levels of impairment and walking ability. The 6 Minute
      walk test is a standardized, self-placed walking test commonly used to access functional
      ability in children with cerebral palsy. While decreased exercise capacity has been
      identified in children with cerebral palsy, the clinical determinants of the 6MWT in this
      population have not been investigated yet. Thus the aim of this study is to investigate the
      relationship between 6 Minute walk test, quality of life, respiratory muscle
      strength,activities of daily living using with Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory
      and trunk control.

      A convenience of children with hemiparetic and diplegia CP, 7-14 years, is going to recruited
      from Gazi University, Faculty of Health Science, Department of Physiotherapy and
      Rehabilitation. Every each of patients respiratory muscle strength will be evaluated using
      with electronic mouth pressure device, trunk control with using trunk control measurement
      scale, activities of daily living using with Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory
      (PEDI), functional exercise capacity usin with six minute walk test (6MWT) and quality of
      life using with Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire (CPQOL).
