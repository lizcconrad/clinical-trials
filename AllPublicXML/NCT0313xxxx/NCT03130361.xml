  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess the impact of a wearable Noninvasive Positive Pressure
      Ventilation, on physical activity and quality of life in patients with severe COPD,
      complaining of dyspnea.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to avoid the occurrence of uncomfortable dyspnea, patients with Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are locked in a vicious circle of inactivity and social isolation
      which profoundly affects their quality of life and prognosis. A new wearable non invasive
      positive pressure ventilation device has been recently proposed; it can be used by
      intermittence during or after physical activities for reducing dyspnea or for shortening
      dyspnea- recovery time. The investigators hypothesize that this system, in reducing the
      inconvenience caused by dyspnea, would stimulate a more active lifestyle and improve quality
      of life. Their objective is to assess the impact of this device on physical activity and
      quality of life in patients with severe COPD, complaining of dyspnea.

      In this open study with no control group, participants will use the device at their
      convenience, according to their needs in daily life and for 4 weeks.

    <measure>Change of Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and post use of the Vitabreath device at 4th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI represents importance and impact of dyspnea in daily life of COPD patients. The BDI is one of dyspnea parameters (questionnaire). Three dimension questions include; 1.effect of daily function on dyspnea, 2. effect of magnitude of task on dyspnea and 3. effect of magnitude off effort on dyspnea.</description>

    <measure>Change of Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and post use of the Vitabreath device at 4th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TDI assesses change of dyspnea perception from the BDI in each dimensions. Patient will rate score from -6 to +6 (positive score reflect improve of dyspnea and negative score reflect worse dyspnea).</description>

    <measure>Subjective appréciation of the device</measure>
    <time_frame>post use of the Vitabreath device at 4th weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will rate their appreciation of the device using 3 scale relatives to ease of use, helps recovery shortness of breath, helps to be more active in daily life</description>
