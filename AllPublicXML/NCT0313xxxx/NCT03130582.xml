  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      patients with refractory /relapsed lymphoma received high-dose etoposide for hematopoietic
      stem cell (HSC) mobilization.All patients received high-dose etoposide 20-25 mg/kg/d
      intravenously for two consecutive days followed by rhG-CSF10ug/kg/day subcutaneously at 48
      hours after chemotherapy; rhG-CSF was continued until the end of harvesting for HSCs/HPCs.
      Peripheral blood counts were performed daily for all patients following the initiating of
      rhG-CSF. Leukapheresis was performed when peripheral blood white blood count exceeded 4Ã—109/L
      with blood cell The harvested cells reached at least 2*108/kg for mononuclear cells and/or
      2*106/kg for CD34+ cells with once to twice leukapheresis. The final product was kept frozen
      in liquid nitrogen.Auto-PBSCT
