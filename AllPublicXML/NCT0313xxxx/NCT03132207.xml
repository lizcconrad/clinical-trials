  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies have suggested that maternal periodontitis affects the
      fetal-placental unit, with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. Indeed, it has
      been suggested that the direct or indirect action of parodontopathogenic bacteria induces an
      inflammatory cascade that leads to spontaneous premature labor. Also, non-treatment of caries
      and periodontal disease can lead to acute pain and stress. This may promote self-medication
      and the inappropriate use of analgesic medications, potentially harmful to the health of the
      fetus. As part of the prevention of complications of pregnancy associated with oral diseases,
      the National Agency for Accreditation and Evaluation in Health (ANAES) has set up a system
      that allows any pregnant woman to consult between the 4th and 7th month of pregnancy, an oral
      health professional to carry out a complete assessment and free care. This study aims at
      evaluating this device among pregnant women and healthcare professionals 4 years after its
      implementation. On the other hand, it will make it possible to look for a possible link
      between the realization of an oral prenatal follow-up and the outcome of the pregnancy.
