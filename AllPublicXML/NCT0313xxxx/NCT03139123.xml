  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Per-dialytic hypotension is common in Intensive Care Unit patients under continuous renal
      replacement therapy, and occurs in nearly 50% of the patients. To date, there is a lack of
      study having characterized the underlying mechanism of hypotension in this setting. New
      diagnostic methods are now available with high reliability to identify hypovolemia as the
      underlying cause of hypotension, among which change in cardiac index during passive leg
      raising may be the less affected by restrictive validity criteria. A change in cardiac index
      greater than 10% during this test is highly predictive of preload dependence, i.e the
      probability than cardiac index will increase if cardiac preload increases.

      The aim of this study is then to identify, among hypotensive episodes occurring during renal
      replacement therapy in Intensive Care Unit patients, the percentage of episodes related to
      preload dependence as identified by passive leg raising.

        This study concerns patients hospitalized in intensive care unit at the Croix-Rousse
        hospital in Lyon with acute renal insufficiency (stage 3 of the Kidney Disease: Improving
        Global Outcomes classification) for which treatment with continuous hemofiltration was
        initiated less than 24 hours ago and for whom a hemodynamic monitoring device (PiCCO®
        device) has been implanted due to acute circulatory failure and is functional.
