  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphatic filariasis is a neglected tropical disease earmarked for elimination as a public
      health problem by the year 2020. Since the year 2000, the Global Program for the Elimination
      of LF has together with endemic countries undertaken preventive chemotherapy in endemic
      districts to entire at risk populations. In Ghana, treatment of LF is based on the drugs
      Ivermectin and Albendazole. Remarkable achievements have been made towards the control and
      elimination of LF in Ghana. However, there remain programmatic and implementation challenges
      that need to be addressed in order to ensure that the gains made over the last 15 years are
      sustained. Among these challenges is the persistent transmission of LF in some districts
      despite more than 10 years of MDA.

      Furthermore, LF cases have been identified in communities from eight districts, previously
      considered as non-endemic. The extent of endemicity in these new districts is unknown. In
      order to achieve the 2020 elimination targets, it is crucial to determine the distribution
      and infection prevalence of LF in these districts. Evaluating these districts for LF
      endemicity will help the implementation of appropriate strategies towards achieving the 2020
      target.

      This protocol describes the surveys to be undertaken in Ghana in 3 of these districts. The
      current standard mapping methodologies of LF have the potential to miss LF endemic villages,
      due to the focal nature of LF. As such, in order to enhance the chances to detect endemic
      communities, this survey will use a combination of the WHO EPI cluster survey and current LF
      mapping protocols. 15 communities will be selected in each district, with 100 survey
      participants per community. Survey participants will be screened for LF infection using
      immunological and parasitological methods. Study participants will also be tested for
      onchocerciasis infection using immunological and parasitological methods in districts where
      LF and oncho are co-endemic. The information from this survey will be combined with the data
      on the LF vectors and their infection status in the survey areas and relevant data available
      at the Ghana Health Service to:

        1. determine whether LF intervention strategies are indicated in these three districts,

        2. design, as indicated, appropriate intervention strategies to achieve LF elimination in
           these three districts by 2020

        3. inform, if indicated, co-implementation of control, monitoring and evaluation for LF and
           onchocerciasis in the two onchocerciasis endemic districts

        4. extract lessons learnt for the design and implementation of surveys in the other
           districts currently considered non-endemic but where LF cases have been reported.

      New rapid diagnostic tests have been developed to assess infection Lf and onchocerciasis
      infection prevalence at the time of the decision to stop MDA and for surveillance for new
      infections once MDA has been stopped. These include Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) for
      antibodies against the W. bancrofti antigen WB123 and the O. volvulus antigen Ov16. These
      tests still require large scale field validation. Provided additional funding becomes
      available, this survey will be used to obtain field validation data.

        The study will be conducted in districts considered non-endemic for LF based on the Ghana
        wide LF mapping conducted in 2000, but where LF cases have been identified. These districts
        fall within the Eastern and Volta Regions. At least one district has been selected in each
        of these regions. The selected study districts are East Akim, Hohoe and Adaklu. East Akim
        and Hohoe districts are also endemic for onchocerciasis.
