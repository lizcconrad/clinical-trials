    <textblock>
      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 4 clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of andrographolide sulfonate in patients with acute
      bronchitis
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient after passing the screening, with the ratio of 1:1, were randomly assigned to
      experimental group or control group. Experimental group: Xiyanping injection(andrographolide
      sulfonate) 10-20ml/d, with 0.9% normal saline 100ml-250ml diluted intravenous drip (not with
      other drugs in the same container mixed use), control drip speed per minute of 30-40 drops.
      Control group: Xiyanping injection simulation(0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection) 10-20ml/d, The
      treatment method is the same as the experimental group. Treatment cycle: less than 7 days
      (the longest period of treatment is 7 days, if the clinical symptoms were relieved in the
      treatment, patients were stoped treatment).
