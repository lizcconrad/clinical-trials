    <textblock>
      A two-arm parallel randomised controlled trial comparing pedometer-based intervention with
      and without email counselling in a primary care setting. Physically inactive patients from
      four general practices will be randomised to the pedometer-plus-email group or to the
      pedometer-alone group. All patients will be instructed to gradually increase the daily number
      of steps to at least 10,000. Patients in the pedometer-plus-email group will receive 8
      counselling emails based on behavioural techniques. The primary outcome will be change in
      average daily steps measured during 7-day period at baseline and at 12 weeks.

    <description>After randomisation, participants will receive a pedometer and will be instructed to wear the pedometer daily for the next four months, check the step count every evening and gradually increase their daily number of steps to at least 10,000. They will also be required to upload data to a website at least once a week. During the intervention period, patients will receive 8 counselling emails based on behavioural techniques.</description>
