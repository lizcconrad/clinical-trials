    <textblock>
      The investigators compared the perioperative, oncological, functional and immunological
      outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection against laparoscopic assisted gastrectomy for
      treatment of early gastric cancer. With virtually no abdominal incisions and minimal pain
      induced, endoscopic submucosal dissection is expected to be less invasive when compared to
      laparoscopic assisted gastrectomy for treatment of early gastric cancer. This study will show
      that endoscopic submucosal dissection is associated with a significantly better perioperative
      recovery and less immunological disturbance. Moreover, it will also induce a better long term
      outcomes as the stomach can be preserved, hence the digestive function is maintained to
      prevent long term functional morbidities of the gastrointestinal tract.

      This study will be the unique first study in the literature to show that intramucosal early
      gastric cancer can be adequately treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection with better
      perioperative, functional and quality of life outcomes when compared to laparoscopic assisted
      gastrectomy.
