      The Pilot of Zinc Acetate to Improve Chronic Cough (ZICO) is a study of 36 patients with
      chronic refractory cough that will be used to (1) assess if zinc acetate (150 mg/day) will
      improve patient reported measures of cough, (2) to establish if treatment with zinc acetate
      is well tolerated, and (3) to determine if the trial logistics are feasible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic refractory cough in adults is defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks that does
      not resolve with treatment for asthma/eosinophilic airway disease, gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD), or rhinosinusitis/post-nasal drip; and is not caused by smoking,
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or parenchymal lung disease. This is one of
      the most common conditions leading to specialty referral accounting for about 20% of new
      pulmonary consultations. Chronic refractory cough leads to severe impairment of quality of
      life and social isolation as well as sleep deprivation and chronic fatigue. The few available
      treatments have limited benefit and substantial side effects or abuse potential. While there
      are validated tools to measure the health-impact of chronic cough which can provide feasible
      clinical trial outcome measures, there have been no academic multi-center trials of chronic
      cough, and guidelines for treatment continue to rely largely on opinion rather than evidence.
      ZICO is a small scale randomized proof-of-concept clinical trial to establish the safety and
      tolerability of zinc in this population. The primary outcome measure will be the Cough
      Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ). Participants will be 18 years or older, with
      chronic cough lasting at least 3 months, which has been unresponsive to treatments for
      asthma, GERD or other upper airway disease. Individuals that are current smokers, use an ACE
      inhibitor, currently take zinc supplements (or multivitamins with zinc), or whose medical
      history includes primary parenchymal lung disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney
      disease, or another medical condition that could interfere with the study or are pregnant or
      breast-feeding will be excluded. Participants will be randomized to receive 6 weeks of
      treatment with either zinc acetate or placebo. Follow-up assessments will occur at 1, 3, 6
      and 8 weeks after randomization; the final assessment is after a two week washout to
      establish the duration of treatment effect. In addition to completing a daily cough diary,
      participants will complete cough specific and general quality of life measures, complete
      spirometry testing and have serum zinc and copper levels measured.

    <measure>Change in Cough Quality of Life Questionnaire (CQLQ) Score by Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Unadjusted comparison of change in CQLQ score between zinc acetate and placebo treatment groups. CQLQ scores range from 28 to 112, with lower scores indicating fewer adverse events. A minimum clinically importance difference of 5 has been proposed for this questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) Score by Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Unadjusted comparison of change in LCQ scores between zinc acetate and placebo treatment groups. LCQ scores range from 3 to 21, with lower scores indicating a greater impact of cough upon one's life. The minimum clinically importance difference for the LCQ for people with chronic cough is 1.3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cough Visual Assessment Scale (C-VAS) Scores by Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Unadjusted comparison of change in C-VAS between zinc acetate and placebo treatment groups. C-VAS scores cover four domains - severity of cough in daytime, nighttime, and overall, and severity of urge to cough. Scores range from 0 to 100 for each domain with lower scores indicating less severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Global Assessment of Change in Cough (GACC) Score by Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Unadjusted comparison of change in GACC scores between zinc acetate and placebo treatment groups. GACC scores measure change in quality of life related to cough in four domains - activity limitation, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life. GACC scores range from -3 (very much worse) to 3 (very much better).</description>
