  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest dose combination of
      tremelimumab and durvalumab [also called MEDI4736]) that can be given before standard of care
      pre-surgery chemotherapy to patients with HR+, HER2- breast cancer. Researchers also want to
      learn more about how certain immune cells may change in the body when they are given the drug
      combination. Researchers also want to find out how patients with HR+, HER2- breast cancer
      respond to the study drugs before they receive standard chemotherapy treatment.

      This is an investigational study. Tremelimumab is FDA approved to treat mesothelioma.
      Durvalumab is FDA approved to treat a certain type of bladder cancer. It is investigational
      to give these 2 drugs in combination to patients with HR+, HER2- breast cancer. The study
      doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 15 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive both study drugs
      in 2 study cycles that are each 4 weeks long. On Day 1 of each cycle, you will first receive
      tremelimumab by vein over about 1 hour. You will then be monitored for side effects for about
      1 hour. You will then receive durvalumab by vein over about 1 hour, followed by another hour
      of monitoring for side effects.

      Length of Study:

      You will receive up to 2 cycles of the study drugs. You will no longer be able to take the
      study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable
      to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Procedures:

      Before you receive the study drugs for the first time, the following tests and procedures
      will be performed:

        -  You will have a core breast tumor biopsy before you begin treatment to collect tissue to
           test for immune cells and other biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and
           may be related to your reaction to the study drug. To perform a core biopsy, the area is
           numbed and a sample of tissue is removed using a hollow core needle that has a cutting
           edge.

        -  If your screening blood test was performed more than 3 days before you begin receiving
           the study drugs, blood (about 14 teaspoons) will be drawn for the same testing performed
           during the screening.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function (Cycle 1 only).

      At the end of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check for immune
           cells and other biomarkers.

        -  You will have a second ultrasound of your breast.

        -  You will have a second core breast tumor biopsy to compare to the tissue taken before
           you started treatment.

      After this visit, you will then begin receiving the standard of care treatment for the
      disease (pre-surgery chemotherapy followed by surgery). During your surgery, blood and tumor
      samples will be collected to compare to the samples taken during the study. However, no
      additional tissue or blood will be collected beyond what is already collected for the
      standard purposes of the surgery.
