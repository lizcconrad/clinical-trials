  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antepartum hemorrhage is defined as bleeding from or within the female genital tract,
      occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and till delivery of the fetus. Antepartum hemorrhage
      occurs in 3-5% of pregnancies and is an important cause of perinatal and maternal morbidity
      and mortality worldwide.

      Placenta previa is a placenta inserted wholly or in part into the lower segment of the
      uterus. It is classified by ultrasound to Placenta previa major degree when the lower edge of
      the placenta lies within 2 cm from the internal cervical os and Placenta previa minor degree
      if the lower edge of the placenta at lower uterine segment but more than 2 cm from internal
      os. Placenta previa is responsible for 0.03% of maternal mortality and 8.1% of perinatal
      mortality of 8.1% in the developed world and much more in developing countries.

      Many studies in literature proved the positive correlation between the Placenta previa and
      preterm uterine contractility and also reported that large proportion of women who have
      Placenta previa associated with vaginal bleeding will have subclinical uterine contractions
      before the onset of evident vaginal bleeding.

      There are many tocolytic agents may have a role in conservative management of Placenta previa
      such as magnesium sulfate and β-sympathomimetics .Progesterone is essential for continuation
      of pregnancy and helps in maintenance of pregnancy . Delaying delivery may reduce the fetal
      morbidity by helping maturity of vital organs. In 2003 Meis et al. in a large randomized
      placebo-controlled trial found a significant reduction in recurrent preterm birth before 37
      weeks for women who received 17αHP-C versus a control group receiving placebo (36.3% versus
      54.9%).
