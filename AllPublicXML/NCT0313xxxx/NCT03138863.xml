  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects to be enrolled in this study are pregnant women whose unborn baby has been diagnosed
      with severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). CDH is a birth defect occurring early in
      pregnancy. It is characterized by the development of a hole in the diaphragm, the breathing
      muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen. As a result, the intestines and other
      organs in the baby's abdomen can move into the chest and press on the developing lungs. CDH
      is a serious condition which prevents the fetal lungs from developing normally.

      The purpose of this study is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of a new
      procedure called Fetoscopic Endoluminal Tracheal Occlusion (FETO). FETO involves two surgical
      procedures while the mother is still pregnant. During the early third trimester of pregnancy,
      a special tiny balloon is placed in the baby's trachea. After the balloon has been in place
      for several weeks, the balloon will be removed during a second procedure, generally done when
      the baby has reached about 34 weeks gestation.

      The intent of the FETO procedure is to improve development of the lungs in fetuses diagnosed
      with severe CDH. If better lung development can be promoted, it is expected that overall
      survival of babies with severe CDH after birth will also be improved.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Singleton pregnancy

          -  Normal fetal karyotype with confirmation by culture results. Results by fluorescence
             in situ hybridization (FISH) will be acceptable if the patient is &gt; 26 weeks.

          -  Isolated Left CDH with liver up

          -  Gestation age at enrollment prior to 29 wks plus 6 days

          -  SEVERE pulmonary hypoplasia with US O/E lung area to head circumference ratio (LHR) &lt;
             25% (measured at 180 to 296 weeks) at the time of surgery; O/E LHR 25% to &lt;30%
             (measured at 300 to 316 weeks) at time of surgery.

          -  Gestational age at FETO procedure with O/E LHR &lt;25% at 27 weeks 0 days to 29 weeks 6
             days; with O/E LHR 25% to &lt;30% at 30 weeks 0 days to 31 weeks 6 days as determined by
             clinical information (LMP) and evaluation of first ultrasound

          -  Patient meets psychosocial criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multi-fetal pregnancy

          -  History of natural rubber latex allergy

          -  Preterm labor, cervix shortened (&lt;15 mm at enrollment or within 24 hours of FETO
             balloon insertion procedure) or uterine anomaly strongly predisposing to preterm
             labor, placenta previa

          -  Psychosocial ineligibility, precluding consent:

               -  Inability to reside within 30 minute drive of Mayo Clinic, and inability to
                  comply with the travel for the follow-up requirements of the trial

               -  Patient does not have a support person (e.g. spouse, partner, mother) available
                  to stay with the patient for the duration of the pregnancy at Mayo Clinic.

             180 to 295 weeks) as determined by ultrasound

             echocardiogram at the fetal treatment center. No cases will be removed post hoc if
