  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an ongoing and worsening problem with obesity in the developed, and much of the
      developing world. Although it has long been realized that Western diets that are rich in
      sugar and fat play an important role in this, it has only recently been realized that
      exposure to these diets, particularly in childhood, can damage the part of the brain that
      determines how much fat there is in the body. The result of this damage is that the so-called
      &quot;set-point&quot; for fat in this part of the brain is pushed upwards. There is a lot of evidence
      from animals that activating the brain's balance (vestibular) system pushes this set-point
      for fat downwards to cause fat loss, probably because this tricks the brain into thinking
      that the animal is more physically active. The aim of this study is to see whether the same
      effect can be triggered in humans by non-invasively stimulating the vestibular system with a
      small electrical current through the skin behind their ears.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing realization that obesity can, in many ways, be viewed as a neurological
      disease triggered by lifestyle factors. There is clear evidence that the arcuate nucleus in
      the hypothalamus regulates a &quot;set-point&quot; for how much fat the body should have. It does so by
      altering appetite and metabolic rate so that deviations too far in either direction are
      strongly resisted. This set-point is determined by genetic, epigenetic and lifestyle factors.
      Thus, excessive exposure to dietary monosaccharides, such as glucose, and saturated fats,
      especially in childhood and adolescence, can damage the neurons of the arcuate nucleus and
      push the set-point up. This then can condemn sufferers to a lifetime of obesity.

      Establishing a method of tuning down the set-point for body fat thus has to be a goal if we
      are to successfully combat the current obesity pandemic. A significant amount of animal work
      suggests that stimulating the vestibular system in the inner ear, by means of chronic
      centrifugation, actually does just that and causes a reduction in body fat. This is likely
      because the chronic vestibular activation is taken by the brain to represent a state of
      increased physical activity, and in order to optimize homeostasis it would be appropriate for
      the body to have a leaner physique, by reducing unnecessary energy expenditure from carrying
      excess fat.

      It is possible to stimulate the vestibular nerve in humans by applying a small electrical
      current to the skin behind the ears. This is an established technology that is believed to be
      safe, but only previously used for research purposes. We found in a pilot study that
      recurrent stimulation of this kind for two or three hours a week over four months led to a
      statistically significant reduction in truncal fat in the active group as opposed to the
      control group who underwent sham stimulation.

      Given the current, and increasing levels of global obesity, it is important to determine
      whether non-invasive electrical vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS), otherwise known as
      galvanic vestibular stimulation, is a viable treatment option. Changes in body fat will be
      measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans.

          2. Males or Females. Note females of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test at screen and also just before each DXA scan. (As DXA involves a small
             dose of ionizing radiation). They should agree to follow a physician-approved
             contraceptive regimen for the duration of the study period (other than DMPA injections
             as this causes weight gain).

          3. 22-80 years of age inclusive on starting the study.

          4. Ability and willingness to complete all study visits and procedures.

          5. Owner of a smart phone (iOS or Android) in order to access the diet monitoring and
             advice app (GB Healthwatch 360), activity monitoring app called Moves, and the app
             that reports on the status of the stimulation devices used in the study.

          6. Agreement not to use of prescription drug therapy or the use of over-the-counter
             weight loss preparations for the duration of the trial.

          2. History of bariatric surgery, fundoplication, gastric resection or major
             upper-abdominal surgery (acceptable surgeries include cholecystectomy, hysterectomy).

          3. History of skin breakdown, eczema or other dermatological condition (e.g. psoriasis)
             affecting the skin behind the ears, or of the head and neck.

          4. History of weight loss device implantation (e.g. VBloc Maestro or Abiliti), or use of
             a non-invasive device.

          5. Untreated thyroid disorder (stable treatment for 3 months is acceptable).

          6. Other endocrinological causes of weight gain (e.g. Cushing's disease, Cushing's
             syndrome or acromegaly)

          7. Previous diagnosis of HIV infection or AIDS (HIV is known to cause a vestibular
             neuropathy which would prevent VeNS from working).

         13. Body weight change of more than 10% in either direction within the previous year.

         14. Physician-prescribed diet, and/ or current, active member of an organized weight loss
             program (e.g., Weight Watchers). (Note: study subjects may continue any personal
             eating plan they were on prior to study enrollment)

             vestibular stimulation).

         25. Presence of permanently implanted battery powered medical device or stimulator (e.g.,
             pacemaker, implanted defibrillator, deep brain stimulator, vagal nerve stimulator
             etc.).

         26. Psychiatric disorders (including untreated severe depression, schizophrenia, substance
             abuse, bulimia nervosa etc.)
