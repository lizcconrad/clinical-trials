  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for subjects undergoing right upper extremity surgery. The aim of the
      study is to investigate the dose-response relationship between local anesthetic volume and
      ipsilateral hemidiaphragmatic paresis (HDP) in patients getting ultrasound-guided
      supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks in a blinded, prospective trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With traditional landmark-based or nerve-stimulator techniques, the incidence of HDP
      following supraclavicular blocks is approximately 50-67%. Ultrasound-guided techniques are
      thought to enhance precision while reducing the volume of anesthetic used, but even then HDP
      incidence is nearly 60%. To date, no trials have studied the dose-response relationship
      between local anesthetic volume and degree of HDP.

      Patient Selection

      30 eligible patients undergoing right upper extremity surgery and eligible for
      supraclavicular blocks will be recruited at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical
      Center.

      Evaluation of HDP

      Baseline M-mode recordings of diaphragm function will be made by an anesthesiologist.
      Patients will perform &quot;voluntary sniff&quot; (VS) tests, or forceful nasal inhales, immediately
      preceding the brachial plexus blockade, and again at 15 minutes and 30 minutes after the
      block.

      Diaphragmatic excursion from baseline will be measured in centimeters; three measurements
      will be made and averaged. Significant hemidiaphragmatic paresis will be defined as no
      movement, greater than 75% reduction in diaphragmatic excursion, or paradoxical movement in
      the VS test. Partial paresis refers to a 25-75% reduction.

      Evaluation of Pulmonary Function

      A bedside spirometer will be used to record Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory
      Volume in 1 second (FEV1), and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) prior to the block and again at 15
      and 30 minutes after the block.

      Evaluation of Supraclavicular Block

      At the 15- and 30-minute marks, the investigators will assess sensory blockade and motor
      block in the musculocutaneous, radial, median, and ulnar distributions. Both will be judged
      on 3-point scales. The investigators will also apply a 0-10 point verbal rating scale to
      assess dyspnea at 30 minutes. Oxygen saturation will be measured off of supplemental oxygen
      30 minutes after the block.

      Following the assessments, patients will have surgery using brachial plexus blockade as the
      primary anesthetic.

    <intervention_model_description>The Continual Reassessment Method (CRM), developed by O'Quigley et al., is a study design for dose-finding/Phase I studies. It is different from traditional dose-escalation studies in that it &quot;learns&quot; from information gained at earlier time points in order to limit patient exposure to non-efficacious and potentially toxic doses. The estimated dose-response curve (DRC) is updated after each subject's outcome is observed, so that the next patient's dose is based on the information about how the previous patient tolerated the intervention. As the number of subjects grows, the DRC comes to reflect observed data instead of the a-priori assumptions. In this study, the investigators are attempting to define the DRC for the degree of hemidiaphragmatic paresis (HDP) caused by various doses of local anesthetic administered in a supraclavicular block.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>All participants will receive the following interventions: ultrasound imaging, bedside spirometry, and supraclavicular block. The investigators will start with an anesthetic dose of 35 mL, and after each three-subject cohort the dose-response curve (DRC) will be revised, indicating a greater or lesser anesthetic volume for the next group of three.</description>

    <description>The patient will be positioned supine with the head turned to the contralateral side. The ultrasound will be placed in the supraclavicular fossa, and the skin and subcutaneous tissues will be infiltrated lateral to the probe with 2% lidocaine. The anesthesiologist can redirect the needle and perform additional injections for complete coverage of the brachial plexus. The local anesthetic will be a 2:1 mix of 1.5% mepivacaine and 0.5% bupivacaine.</description>
