  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taking part in recommended levels of physical activity in youth with MS may have an important
      and positive impact on disease symptoms, long-term disability and health outcomes.
      Unfortunately, youth with MS are highly inactive. In order to address this issue, the
      investigators have developed an MS-specific mobile application for teens called Active Teens
      with Multiple Sclerosis (ATOMIC). In this research the investigators will evaluate the
      feasibility of using the ATOMIC program in youth with MS. The results of this pilot study
      will provide the data necessary to ensure the ATOMIC program aligns with the needs of youth
      with MS.

    <measure>Utility of the ATOMIC program</measure>
    <time_frame>Entire study - Interviews [30 minutes] at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Utility will be addressed through semi-structured interviews that includes both open and closed ended questions. The interviews will be used to elicit the perceptions and preferences of the participants surrounding the use and method of delivery of the PA coaching and program content (e.g. phone, text messaging, posts to app); the usefulness, relevance, and applicability of the ATOMIC program content; as well as facilitators and barriers to use of the program. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted at baseline, six weeks, and post-intervention (twelve weeks). To supplement the interview data, utility will also be captured by counting the number of log-ins to the app and the number of completed coaching sessions and modules.</description>

    <description>The effect of our PA intervention on MVPA level and the mediators and moderators of SCT (e.g. self efficacy) will be determined by calculating the change in time spent in MVPA and mediators and moderators of SCT at the completion of the intervention.</description>

    <description>The proposed ATOMIC intervention consists of four primary components: (a) one-on-one chats with a PA coach, (b) informational posts, (c) PA self-monitoring through an activity tracker and (d) educational modules regarding different aspects of becoming PA delivered through our MS specific PA app.</description>

    <description>(a) PA Coach, One-on-one Chats. Coaches will conduct three one-on-one phone or video conferencing sessions and will also conduct a text messaging session once per week to reinforce and follow-up on the one-on-one phone sessions during the course of the intervention. (b) PA-Self Monitoring. An activity tracker (Fitbit Charge 2) will be used to allow participants to monitor their activity behaviors (e.g. step counts). (c) PA Information. In addition the coach will send weekly tailored PA informational posts/messages aligned with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) to all participants. (d) Educational Modules. MS specific web-based interactive PA modules will be provided to patients.</description>
