      This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, single dose study to assess the
      pharmacokinetics, mass balance recovery, and metabolite profiling and identification
      following administration of iv or oral 14C-BC-3781 to healthy male subjects It is planned to
      enrol 2 cohorts of 5 subjects or 10 subjects in total. The active substance being
      investigated in this study is radiolabeled lefamulin ([14C] BC 3781), present in the
      investigational medicinal products (IMPs) as the acetate salt ([14C]-BC-3781.Ac).

      Subjects assigned to Cohort A will receive a single IV administration of 14C-BC-3781
      containing 150 mg BC-3781 and not more than (NMT) 4.3 MBq (117 µCi) 14C, administered as an
      infusion over 60 min after a light breakfast.

      Subjects assigned to Cohort B will receive a single oral administration of 14C-BC-3781
      containing 600 mg BC-3781 and NMT 4.1 MBq (112 µCi) 14C, in the fasted state
