  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, open label, controlled pilot clinical study comprised hospitalized post operative
      patients receiving oral analgesics. The study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy and
      usability of a novel pill dispensing system - PCoA™ Acute and compare it to the conventional
      procedure of nurse providing analgesics.
