  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility and early efficacy of cardiac
      rehabilitation to improve frailty and symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure (NYHA
      class III-IV), who are being considered for LVAD therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Frailty in patients with advanced heart failure is not thoroughly described, but in those
      studies that assessed frailty, it was a common phenomenon. Furthermore, some data suggest an
      association between pre-LVAD implant frailty and post-implant complications and survival.
      Interventions for frailty have been utilized in various populations, including the elderly
      frail and the frail from cardiovascular causes. These interventions target physical
      strengthening and endurance and have been shown on occasion to improve functional outcomes.
      The current study, a pilot study, seeks to assess frailty in a prospective cohort of patients
      being evaluated in Heart Failure Clinic for consideration of LVAD implantation due to NYHA
      class III-IV dyspnea and enroll these patients in a six-week focused cardiac rehabilitation
      protocol aimed at improving frailty and functional independence. The primary endpoint of the
      study is improvement in frailty markers at the end (gait speed, handgrip strength), and
      secondary endpoints include improvement in the indices of quality of life and symptomatology
      via validated questionnaires.
