    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to compare between the results of conventional lumbar discectomy and the
      newly used technique in our department; endoscopic lumbar discectomy in neurosurgery
      department Assiut university hospitals, so that we can offer our patients the best service in
      an updated and minimally invasive way.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar discectomy is one of the most common operation performed worldwide for lumbar-related
      symptoms. Lumbar disc herniation accounts for only 5% of all low back pain problems but is
      the most common cause of radiating nerve root pain, sciatica.

      Mixter and Barr described the first surgical procedure to remove the herniated lumbar disc in
      1934 through a laminectomy and durotomy, with later enhancement by Semmes, who described
      approaching the herniated disc through hemilaminectomy and retraction of the dural sac. This
      became popularized as the &quot;classical discectomy technique.

      During the latter half of the 19th century, more techniques were developed to remove the
      herniated disc with minimal invasiveness. The first herniated disc excision using a
      microscope (microdiscectomy) was performed by Yasargil in 1977, which was the standard
      surgical procedure at the time In 1993, Mayer and Brock and then in 1997, Smith and Foley
      described endoscopic discectomy techniques. With these minimally invasive techniques, authors
      demonstrated decreased soft tissue manipulation, operative time, blood loss, and hospital
      stay, allowing early recovery.

      In this study we try to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of percutaneous
      endoscopic translaminar discectomy at our hospital.
