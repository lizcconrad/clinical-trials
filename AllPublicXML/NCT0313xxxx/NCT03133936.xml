    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response in recipients of the vaccine.
      After participants receive the vaccine, samples of blood will be obtained at several
      intervals afterwards. These blood samples will be used to measure the immune response to the
      vaccine. Everyone in this study will receive a single dose of flu vaccine, and have blood
      samples drawn to measure the immune response over the next 90 days. The investigators will
      also ask participants to report any flu like illnesses during the flu season, and if
      participants develop a fever or cough, to come in to be tested for flu. This will allow the
      investigators to compare the vaccine response between people who got the flu and those who
      did not.

    <description>Sera will be tested by microtiter technique for neutralization of the vaccine viruses in MDCK cells. Viral growth will be determined by ELISA of the cells following fixation with methanol using a combination of M- and NP-specific monoclonal antibodies. The titer of antibody will be defined as the highest titer resulting in 50% inhibition of antigen signal compared to un-neutralized control wells. Sera will be treated with RDE and heat inactivated prior to testing at an initial starting dilution of 1:10. Sera with no neutralizing titer will be assigned a value of 1:5 for calculation purposes.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline to day 90</time_frame>
    <description>Sera will be evaluated for avidity by SPR, SPR measures the off rate (rate at which antibodies dissociate from the antigen) of antibody-antigen binding. The off rates provide a measure of how well the antibodies bind, indicating their quality. In an ideal immune response to vaccine, the off rates should go down, indicating an improved recognition of antigen. For these studies, the SPR array of antigens will be the recombinant influenza hemagglutinins that match that year's vaccine formulation, as well as HA head only and HA stalk only recombinant proteins.</description>
