  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial that tests a
      patient decision aid for obstructive sleep apnea in older adults with newly-diagnosed
      obstructive sleep apnea treated in an outpatient sleep clinic. Half of the participants will
      use a patient decision aid, while the other half will receive general information about
      sleep.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient decision aids are one strategy for helping older adults make informed decisions about
      treatments. Patient decision aids improve patients' knowledge about therapies and encourage
      them to actively weigh the risks and benefits of each therapy.
