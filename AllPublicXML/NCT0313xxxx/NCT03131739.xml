    <textblock>
      The goal of the Alaska Native Resilience Research Study (ANRRS) is to identify
      community-level protective factors that can most effectively reduce co-occurring youth
      suicide and alcohol risk. The following specific aims will help us achieve this overarching
      goal. The research team will: (1): Assess the association of a set of modifiable cultural,
      community and institutional factors (protective community factors) with suicide, suicidal
      behaviors (ideation, attempt), and associated adverse outcomes (accidental death,
      alcohol-misuse requiring healthcare) in 64 rural and remote Alaska Native villages to
      identify community-level factors that are most predictive of youth health outcomes; (2): In a
      stratified random sample of six communities, use quantitative methods to test a multi-level
      model of individual-level youth protective factors as predictors of individual-level youth
      resilience from suicide risk outcomes; and (3): Develop and disseminate a method—Alaska
      Community Resilience Mapping (AK-CRM)—for communities to measure and strategically strengthen
      their protective capabilities to increase youth health and reduce the risk for suicide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ANCHRR builds on our established tribal partnerships in the three regions of Alaska with
      the highest need for effective, culturally congruent and community-based suicide prevention.
      Drs. Rasmus and Allen have been working collaboratively with Yup'ik communities in the Yukon
      Kuskokwim region and Dr. Wexler has been doing community-based participatory research in
      Northwest Alaska (NWA) for 20 years. Both research teams have spent this time partnering with
      tribal communities and developing evidence-based and self-determined suicide prevention
      initiatives that reflect local, AN understandings and values, strengthen community systems of
      support, and build local capacity for strategic prevention practice. The collaborative hub
      will extend this successful partnership model to include all of the tribal health regions
      across the state. With relevance for all of rural Alaska, the Alaska Native Resilience Study
      will provide important insights into the community level factors—institutions, traditions,
      resources and leaders—and mechanisms—the community perceptions, practices and norms—that
      increase resilience from suicide and reduce risk. The resulting Alaska Community Resilience
      Mapping (AK-CRM) Tool will provide a user-friendly, visual representation of the
      community-level protective factors and processes, and will engage Alaska community members in
      identifying the community-level protective factors in their community and will offer
      scientifically-based recommendations for action. In this way, ANCHRR's proposed activities
      translate results from the research study into practical suggestions for tribal leaders,
      local practitioners and policy makers, to maximize its public health impact.

        Sixty-five Alaska Native communities (villages) will be drawn from a regional sample and
        individual study participants will be drawn from a community sample consisting of six
        Alaska Native villages across three regions.

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To identify persons able to assess diverse community protective factors, we will
             identify at least 5 village members from each community who are: (a) local school
             board members or school workers, (b) community health aids, (c) village-based
             counselors, (d) tribal council members or tribal administrators, (e) city managers,
             (f) village public safety officers or village public officers, (g) postmasters, (h)
             Elder council members, and/or (i) religious leaders. This initial village list will
             also include other people who are informal leaders in the village.

        Exclusion: From this list, participants will be screened to ensure: (1) village residence
        or service provision in the community for at least 5 years cumulatively and (2)
        endorsements from members of the Research Steering Committee, who are knowledgeable about
        specific community dynamics.

          -  The sample of 64 communities will be stratified into higher, medium and lower
             protection community groups using their protective community factor score from Aim 1,
             then 6 communities will be randomly selected, 2 from each stratification group.

          -  Children in each of 6 selected communities

          -  All adults 18-29 in 6 selected communities.

          -  Approximately 15 individual adults will be recruited in each of the six villages
             (n=60) through sampling the following sectors of community: government, church, social
             service, store/business, school, health care, parent, elder. We will contact
             individuals nominated in each sector by the local tribal council or their designate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Communities with fewer than 150 people will be excluded since the protective community
             dynamics and adverse outcomes are more stable in larger villages. This reduces the
             number of participating communities from 71 total number of villages to 65.

          -  We will exclude children under the age of 15, because we seek information regarding
             late adolescence and beginning adulthood. We will exclude children who do not have the
             capacity to assent or to participate in the computerized survey.

          -  We will exclude adults who do not have the capacity to consent or to participate in
             the computerized survey.

          -  We will exclude adults who have lived in their respective village for less than 5
             years, because we will be asking for information about community factors that require
             perspectives over time. We will exclude adults who do not have the capacity to consent
             or to participate in the computerized survey.

    <ipd_description>The Tribal Health Organizations and the research team jointly own all data, consistent with the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR). De-identified data and results will be shared at every meeting of the AN External Advisory Council, Collaborative Hub and Research Steering Committee. Datasets are shared by request and approval by the Tribal Health Organizations and Project PIs as they become available. The research team propose to development Tribal Data Sharing and Ownership Agreements (DSOA) with the three participating Tribal Health Organizations in Year 1 of the ANCHRR project.</ipd_description>
