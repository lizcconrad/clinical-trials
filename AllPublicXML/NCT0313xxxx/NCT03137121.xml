  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of olanzapine for the treatment of cancer
      patients with chronic nausea and/or vomiting unrelated to chemotherapy or radiation in a
      randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced cancer experience a variety of physical and psychosocial symptoms that
      significantly affect the patients' quality of life. Chronic nausea is a particularly
      distressing symptom present in &gt;60% of patients with advanced cancer. A number of palliative
      care studies have evaluated treatments of nausea with limited success. Olanzapine with its
      unique formulation and decreased drug interactions compared to many other drugs appears to be
      a reasonable candidate for further evaluation. Olanzapine has significant potential for use
      in the prevention and treatment of nausea in a palliative care setting with a once-daily
      dosing.

    <measure>Effect of olanzapine</measure>
    <time_frame>Nausea score from the Visula Analogue Scale will be recorded each day daily for 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Daily nausea scores (the primary objective) on day 1 to 7 of treatment for each patient from Groups 1 and 2 will be measured using the Visual Analogue Scale rankings from 0-10 where 0 is no nausea and 10 is the maximum nausea experienced by a patient. Patients will be asked to record the average nausea score for each day in a diary and a study nurse will call the patient at the same time each day to remind the patient to record the nausea score and to inquire about any toxicities. The difference in the nausea scores for the patients in each group (Group 1 and Group 2) will be compared.</description>

    <time_frame>Number of emetic episodes for each patient on each day of the seven day treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of emetic episodes (a secondary outcome) by each patient in each Group (1 and 2) on each day of treatment will be recorded by each patient on each day of treatment in a diary. A study nurse will contact each patient at the same time of each day of the study to ask the patient to record the number of emetic episodes and report any toxicities.The number of emetic episodes for the patients in each Group for each day of the treatment will be compared.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0&quot;.</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily assessment for 7 days for each patient in Groups 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be measured by patient-reported outcomes questionnaires and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A study nurse will contact each patient each day of the seven days of treatment to inquire about any toxicities, specifically sedation and appetite. Sedation and appetite will be reported by the patient in each Group on a Visual Analogue Scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being no sedation or no appetite to 10 indicating maximum sedation or maximum appetite.</description>
