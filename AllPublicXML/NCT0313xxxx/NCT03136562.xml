  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of adrenal insufficiency in
      a population of patients with kidney transplants receiving low dose prednisone treatment.

      Development of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is a serious adverse effect to
      glucocorticoid treatment. The study includes a control group of patients with kidney failure
      currently treated in dialysis, who are not in glucocorticoid treatment.

      Individual genotyping is performed to determine the haplotype of glucocorticoid receptor
      polymorphisms: N363 S, BclI, ER23/23EK and 9β in all the patients with the purpose of
      investigating this as a risk factor for the development of adrenal insufficiency. The
      hypothesis is that subjects with one or another of the polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid
      receptor gene will either have increased or diminished glucocorticoid sensitivity.

      Using validated questionnaires assessing the quality of life and functional level of the
      patients enrolled in the study we aim to establish a link between functional level and
      biochemically proven adrenal insufficiency.

      Other secondary outcomes in the study includes bloodpressure, body composition, bone density,
      metabolic syndrome, inflammation and salivary cortisol profiles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adrenal function is assessed in 30 prednisolon treated kidney transplanted patients and
      compared with 30 patients in dialysis, who are not treated with glucocorticoids. Adrenal
      function is evaluated using a 250µg Synacthen® test, performed fasting, in the morning, 48 h
      after the last prednisolone dose.

      Cut-off for normal adrenal function is locally validated assay specific cut-off of 30 min
      P-cortisol &gt;420 nmol/l. The primary outcome measure of this study is P-cortisol
      concentrations 30 minutes after Synacthen® injection in prednisolone treated patients
      compared with comtrols. Secondary, 30 minutes P-cortisol is examined in relation to
      glucocorticoid receptor haplotypes.

      The genotyping is determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

      The questionnaires used in this study includes EQ-5D, SF-36, Patient Life Situation Form,
      CushingQol and ADDOQol.
