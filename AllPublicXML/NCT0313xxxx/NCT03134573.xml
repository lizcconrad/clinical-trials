  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned study will be a prospective, non-interventional, observational cohort study using
      the structure of a registry. Medication usage behavior will be observed for 6 months, while
      documentation behavior on the wellness tracker in the myBETAapp will be observed for 3
      months.

    <measure>Persistence of therapy (yes, no)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Persistence will be evaluated from the day of the first injection recorded in the BETACONNECT until the day of the last recorded injection or the end of observation (whichever comes first)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to therapy (yes, no)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be defined as being adherent to therapy if they fulfill the following criteria:
They have been at least 80% compliant, i.e. applied ≥80% of the expected Betaferon injections and
They have not dropped out of the study prior to the time of evaluation (i.e. they did not (1) stop using the myBETAapp or (2) withdraw their consent to participate in the study)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients consenting to participate in this study among those using the myBETAapp</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>All patients registering their myBETAapp will be asked to participate in the study. Patients consenting to participate in the study will be flagged in the database. The proportion of patients consenting will then be calculated by dividing the number of patients giving consent by all patients asked.</description>
