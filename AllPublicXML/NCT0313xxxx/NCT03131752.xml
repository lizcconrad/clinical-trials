  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic and progressive
      airflow limitations and subjects with COPD also experience exacerbations characterized by the
      worsening of respiratory symptoms. It's necessary medical intervention, changes in regular
      medication, and the use of antibiotics and/or corticosteroids followed or not by
      hospitalization. The exacerbations contribute to worsening of the disease with systemic
      impairment and muscle weakness is a very relevant event. The physical inactivity, especially
      related to bed rest, comprises one of the factors contributing to muscle atrophy and loss of
      muscle strength. Thus, the intervention performed during hospitalization is necessary to
      minimize the consequences which causes impairment in health status subjects. The aim of the
      study is assess the effect of the intervention with elastic bands, in muscle strength,level
      of the physical activity, functional capacity, dyspnea on activities of daily living (ADL)
      and quality of life in COPD exacerbation subjects. Moreover,verify the intervention benefits
      over 01 and 03 months post exacerbation episode. It will be a prospective, randomized,
      longitudinal and interventional study. The investigators will be asses both gender patients
      with exacerbation of COPD in 4 situations: First time (at least 24 and at most 48 hours after
      the beginning of medical therapy); seven days post the first assessment; one and three months
      post exacerbation episode. It will be assess the muscle strength, physical activity level,
      functional capacity, dyspnea on ADL and quality of life. The patients will be randomized in 2
      groups: intervention and control group. The intervention will be performed with elastic bands
      once a day during seven days. The investigators expected that patients of the intervention
      group will present better muscle strength, physical activity level and functional capacity
      than the control group. Furthermore, an improvement in dyspnea and quality of life is
      expected in intervention group when compared as with control group patients. It is
      hypothesized that the benefits of intervention will be maintained over one month.

    <description>The intervention protocol will performed during 7 days for all patients and this will begin 24 -48 hours after the start of medication for exacerbation. Those who are hospitalized and discharged before this period will continue their treatment at the Laboratory of Spirometry and Respiratory Physiotherapy (LEFIR) of the Federal University of S達o Carlos. The intervention will also perform for at least 5 continuous days. The ideal elastic band for the training will be chosen through the test of 10 maximum repetitions. The test and the training will be performed in an ergonomic chair allowing the lower limbs to remain pending. After 24 hours of the test, patients will perform knee extension exercise with the appropriate elastic band. Three sets of 10 repetitions will be done in each exercise, with a minimum rest interval of 1 minute between sets or until heart rate values return to baseline. Patients will be re-evaluated 1 and 3 months after the first contact.</description>
