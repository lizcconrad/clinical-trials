  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many types of human tumors, PD-L1 is highly expressed. Such high expression has often been
      associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. SHR-1316 is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal
      antibody that binds specifically to human PD-L1.

      This is a two-part, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose escalation, Phase I study
      of repeated doses of SHR-1316 (1, 3, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg [with the option for 30 and 40
      mg/kg]) in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have failed current standard
      anti-tumor therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria

        To be eligible to participate in this study, each subject must meet all of the following
        criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥18 years of age;

          2. Diagnosed (histologically or cytologically) with solid tumors and documented as
             advanced or metastatic disease for which there is no known effective anti-tumor
             treatment (refractory to or relapsed from standard therapies). Subjects must have
             confirmation of this diagnosis through study-site analysis of fresh or archived
             tissue;

          3. Failed no more than 1 prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and that more than 4 weeks has elapsed.

          4. No prior cancer therapy within last 4 weeks;

          5. ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1 at both the screening and baseline visits;

          6. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks;

          7. Adequate laboratory parameters during screening as evidenced by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5×109/L (1500/mm3)

               -  Platelets ≥100×109/L (100,000/mm3)

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥9.0 g/dL (90 g/L)

               -  Albumin levels ≥2.8 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 times the upper limit of normal (× ULN)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5× ULN;
                  for subjects with liver metastases, ALT and AST ≤5× ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5×ULN or creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min (using
                  Cockcroft-Gault equation)

          8. Female subjects agree not to be pregnant or lactating from beginning of the study
             screening to 3 months after receiving the last treatment:

               -  Both men and women of reproductive potential are willing and able to employ a
                  highly effective method of birth control/contraception to prevent pregnancy

               -  A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a
                  low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year, when used consistently and
                  correctly

          9. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures;

         10. Provide signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who fulfill any of the following criteria at screening will be ineligible to
        participate in this study:

          1. Known history of hypersensitivity to any components of the SHR-1316 product;

          2. Any investigational or concurrent cancer therapy (including surgery, radiotherapy,
             immunotherapy, hormone therapy, or target therapy), administered within 4 weeks or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer, before the first dose of SHR-1316; or within 6 weeks
             in the case of certain therapies (e.g., extensive radiotherapy, major surgery,
             mitomycin C and nitrosoureas). Any such, prior systemic therapy needs to be outside of
             five half-lives, unless discussed and explained with the sponsor. Any AEs from prior
             therapy must have returned to ≤ Grade 1 CTCAE level;

          3. Subjects with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,
             type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only
             requiring hormone replacement, euthyroid patients with a history of Grave's disease
             (subjects with suspected autoimmune thyroid disorders must be negative for
             thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin
             prior to first dose of study drug), psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted
             to enroll.

          4. Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases, as indicated by clinical symptoms,
             cerebral edema, steroid requirement, or progressive disease. Prior treated brain or
             meningeal metastases must be clinically stable (MRI) for at least 8 weeks and off
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic steroids (&lt;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) for
             at least 4 weeks before study drug administration;

          5. Clinically significant cardiovascular condition, including: (1) history of congestive
             heart failure (NYHA Class &gt;2), (2) history of unstable angina, (3) myocardial
             infarction within the past 12 months, or (4) history of supraventricular arrhythmia or
             ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment or intervention;

          6. History or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is
             clinically meaningful:

             • For example, a screening QTcF interval that is prolonged (&gt;450 milliseconds [msec]
             in males; &gt;470 msec in females).

          7. Active infection or an unexplained fever &gt;38.5°C during screening visits or on the
             first scheduled day of dosing (at the discretion of the investigator, subjects with
             tumor fever may be enrolled);

          8. History of immunodeficiency including seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV), or other acquired or congenital immune-deficient disease, or any active
             systemic viral infection requiring therapy (e.g., hepatitis B or C);

          9. Any other medical (e.g., pulmonary, metabolic, congenital, endocrinal or CNS disease,
             etc.), psychiatric, or social condition deemed by the investigator to be likely to
             interfere with a subject's rights, safety, welfare or ability to sign informed
             consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation
             of the results.
