      Autonomic and endothelial imbalance in post menopause women raise the need to manage
      cardiovascular risk. Yoga poses and breathing control present controversial results on
      prevention and treatment of hypertension.. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of
      12 week intervention based on yoga poses and their muscle contractions known as bandhas
      (pelvic floor, core and throat/neck) and ujjayi pranayama (victorious breath) on autonomic
      modulation, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, aerobic capacity and cognitive function
      of hypertensive post-menopausal women.

      Abstract: Increased hypertension prevalence in post-menopausal women, along with
      cardiovascular damages such as autonomic and endothelial imbalance raise the need to include
      non-pharmacological interventions, such as yoga in the management of cardiovascular risk.
      Yoga practices are composed by several variations of techniques including physical postures
      (yoga poses and specific muscles contractions), breathing control (pranayamas), relaxation
      and meditation, beside others.The effects of each of these compounds has not been elucidated
      up to date and can be considered confounding effects for commonly named &quot;yoga programs&quot;.
      Existing yoga based data are controversial about its effect on prevention and treatment of
      hypertension and point to poor methodological standards of most studies. Considering the
      effects of comparable interventions such as slow breathing on improving autonomic modulation,
      resistive and isometric exercise on endothelial function, and associations of flexibility
      with arterial stiffness, itÂ´s licit to search for specific effects of yoga compounds. Thus,
      the aim of this study is to compare the effect of 12 week intervention based on yoga poses
      including their muscle contractions known as bandhas (pelvic floor, core and throat/neck),
      ujjayi pranayama (victorious breath) and stretching/ flexibility on autonomic modulation,
      endothelial function, arterial stiffness, aerobic capacity and cognitive function of
      hypertensive post-menopausal women.

    <description>Ujjayi pranayama (Victorious breath) Inhalation and exhalation are both done through the nose. The &quot;ocean sound&quot; is created by moving the glottis as air passes in and out. As the throat passage is narrowed so, too, is the airway, the passage of air through which creates a &quot;rushing&quot; sound. The length and speed of the breath is controlled by the diaphragm, the Strengthening of which is, in part, the purpose of ujjayi. The inhalations and exhalations are equal in duration.</description>
