    <time_frame>Initial estimated completion date for the Primary Endpoint of this study is 36 months after the study opens to accrual.Primary Endpoint Completion Date is at the time the last patient registered has been followed for at least 12months.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS time is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest date of documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. If a patient dies without a documentation of disease progression the patient will be censored on the last date the disease was evaluated. In the case of a patient starting treatment and then never returning for any evaluations, the patient will be censored for progression on day 1 post-randomization. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form, have begun treatment, and have not been declared a major treatment violation will be evaluable.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer

          -  Forced Expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)&gt;1.0 L

          -  Unresectable stage 2-3 Non-small cell lung cancer (based on CT/positron emission
             tomography (PET), MRI or CT of brain, and Physical exam).

             • Eligible if recurrence after surgery and now has the equivalent stage 2-3 NSCLC OR
             had sub totally resected stage 2-3 NSCLC.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0-1

          -  Negative pregnancy test done ≤7 days prior to registration, for women of childbearing
             potential only.

          -  The following laboratory values in specified ranges:

               -  White blood cell count (WBC) ≥3.0 x 109/L,

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L,

               -  Hgb ≥9g/dl

          -  Provide informed written consent.

          -  Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up for a minimum of 1 year.

          -  Ability to undergo potentially curative chemotherapy plus radiotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any of the following because this study involves an agent that has known genotoxic,

             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens.

          -  Weight loss of &gt;10% in the past 6 months

          -  Distant metastases (M1 disease)

             (UIP), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Receiving any investigational agent, that would be considered as a treatment for the
             primary neoplasm.

          -  Other active malignancy ≤3 years prior to registration. EXCEPTIONS: treated
             non-melanotic skin cancer, carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix, treated Stage 1-2, Gleason
             7 or less, prostate cancer with a stable or undetectable prostate specific antigen
             (PSA) level, treated stage 1 breast cancer which is controlled and for which the
             patient received no thoracic radiotherapy (RT).

          -  History of myocardial infarction ≤6 months, or congestive heart failure requiring use
             of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.

          -  Received chemotherapy for lung cancer within 6 months of registration.

          -  Previous chest radiotherapy.
