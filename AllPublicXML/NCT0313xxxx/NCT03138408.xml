  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, first-in-human study of SC-004 in participants with advanced solid
      cancers. This is a two-part study consisting of Part A (dose regimen finding) followed by
      Part B (dose expansion). Part A will involve dose escalation to define the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule. Part B will enroll additional
      participants who will be treated with a study drug dose at or below the MTD determined in
      Part A.

    <description>PFS time is defined as the time from the subject's first dose of study drug (Day 1) to either the subject's disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Under the situation that neither event occurs, the PFS time will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment. Subjects lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose of study treatment will have their event time censored at Day 1.</description>

    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the subject's initial objective response (CR or PR) to study drug therapy to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. If the dates of disease progression or death are not available, the DOR will be censored at the date of last valid tumor assessment.</description>
