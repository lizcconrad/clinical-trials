      METHODOLOGY:

      The present study is a multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, phase II study in patients
      who are suffering from recurrent and/or metastatic Salivary Glands Carcinoma, who have
      progressed during the 6 months period before entering the study and who are eligible for
      nivolumab monotherapy.

      All eligible patients will receive nivolumab treatment for a maximum of 12 cycles of
      treatment. 92 eligible patients will be dosed with nivolumab intravenously over 60 minutes (±
      5 minutes) at 3 mg/kg every two weeks.

      Each 28-day dosing period will constitute a cycle.

             according to RECIST 1.1 criteria with MRI or CT-scan

          -  Patients with confirmed disease progression at study entry. The &quot;baseline&quot;
             radiological evaluation (either MRI or CT scan) should demonstrate disease progression

             period prior to screening.

          -  Previous anti-cancer therapies must be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to
             administration of study drug. Concomitant, palliative (limited-field) radiation
             therapy is permitted during the study, if all of the following criteria are met: (1)
             repeated imaging demonstrates no new sites of bone metastases ; (2) The lesion being
             considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion.

             metastases, Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who
             can have total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL)

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use appropriate method(s) of
             contraception. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30
             days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives) after the last
             dose of investigational drug

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the

             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31
             weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as
             azoospermic men do not require contraception).

             study drug.

          -  Known or underlying medical condition (e.g., a condition associated with diarrhea or
             acute diverticulitis) that, in the investigator's opinion, would make the
             administration of study drug hazardous to the patient or obscure the interpretation of
             toxicity determination or adverse events.

          -  History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric
             disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant, precluding
             informed consent, or interfering with compliance of oral drug intake (if applicable).
