  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safety and tolerability of three different concentrations (0.1%, 03%, 0.6%) of the
      investigational SHP639 eye drops will be evaluated in subjects with high eye pressure or
      primary open-angle glaucoma. There will be up to 12 cohorts in total, 1 cohort for each dose
      level and different dosing regimen. Each cohort will consist of 7 subjects for a total of 84
      subjects in the study. Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated in a 5:2 ratio to receive
      either SHP 639 or placebo eye drops, respectively. A sufficient number of subjects will be
      screened and enrolled to ensure that at least 6 of 7 subjects complete each treatment in
      their assigned cohort. The study will be blinded, i.e. masked by procedures that prevent
      study subjects, caregivers, investigators and outcome assessors from knowing which
      intervention was received. The study will be conducted in the several centers in the US.

    <description>Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs, vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory assays, antidrug antibodies, drop comfort assessment, and ophthalmologic examinations. Ophthalmologic AEs include both changes in ophthalmologic examinations and positive drop comfort assessment reported as AEs. Ophthalmologic examinations include manifest refraction, best-corrected visual acuity, slit lamp biomicroscopy, anterior segment graded assessments, IOP, posterior segment examination, gonioscopy, noncontact specular microscopy, corneal pachymetry, and drop comfort assessment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must provide written, signed and dated informed consent to participate in the
             study in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Good
             Clinical Practice (GCP) Guideline E6(R1) and applicable regulations, before completing
             any study-related procedures.

          2. Subjects must be aged from 18 through 90 at the time of consent. This inclusion
             criterion will only be assessed at the screening visit.

          3. Subjects must have ocular hypertension (OHT) or stable early primary open-angle
             glaucoma (POAG) in both eyes with acceptable Humphrey visual fields (HVF). Early POAG
             for this protocol is defined as healthy appearing anterior chamber angles (Shaffer
             classification system grade 3 or 4) and focal and/or generalized thinning of the optic
             disc rim characteristic of glaucomatous disease. An acceptable HVF must have been
             performed within approximately one year of screening, have a false-positive rate of
             25% maximum, false-negative rate of 25% maximum, and fixation loss rate of 33%

             single-dose treatment period (SDTP).
