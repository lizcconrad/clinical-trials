  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the combination of
      oral pazopanib, intravenous or oral irinotecan, and oral temozolomide in pediatric and young
      adult patients with relapsed or refractory sarcomas. This study will use a 3 + 3 design for
      dose escalation (Part 1), followed by an expansion cohort (Part 2) at the recommended phase 2
      dose level.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide is well-tolerated and provides an active
      therapy option for heavily pre-treated patients with sarcoma. The toxicity profile and
      activity level suggest that this combination will provide a useful platform onto which novel
      compounds may be added. Pazopanib has been shown to demonstrate single-agent activity in
      sarcomas in the preclinical and clinical settings. Pazopanib has also been shown to have
      additive or synergistic effects in preclinical models of sarcomas when combined with
      cytotoxic chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic studies of pazopanib and irinotecan as well as
      pharmacodynamic studies of pazopanib to assess anti-angiogenesis will be performed.
      Exploratory studies to assess non-invasive methods of monitoring tumor response (circulating
      tumor DNA and functional imaging by PET/MRI) will be performed.
