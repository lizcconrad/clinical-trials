  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of Gene Mediated Cytotoxic Immunotherapy (GMCI) in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary clinical end-point of the study is to
      evaluate the safety of GMCI when combined with standard surgery for NSCLC. The primary
      scientific objective is to determine the immunologic changes induced by GMCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, dose escalation clinical trial is to investigate the safety
      of GMCI prior to surgery in patients with NSCLC. GMCI involves the use of aglatimagene
      besadenovec (AdV-tk) injected into the tumor followed by oral valacyclovir prodrug to kill
      tumor cells and stimulate a cancer vaccine effect. Killing tumor cells in an immune
      stimulatory environment induces the body's immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells.
      GMCI has been well tolerated in previous trials in multiple tumor types with clinical,
      pathologic and immune responses.

      AdV-tk will be injected intratumorally on day 0 during a standard of care staging procedure.
      The prodrug, valacyclovir, will be administered orally at a fixed dose for 14 days following
      the AdV-tk injection. Then standard of care surgical resection will be performed about 3
      weeks after the AdV-tk injection. Chemotherapy and/or radiation may begin 6-8 weeks after
      resection surgery. Choice of chemotherapy depends on the treating oncologist.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically documented non-small cell carcinoma (cytology or histology) that is
             accessible via standard-of-care staging procedures: (1) EBUS or (2) surgical
             approaches (eg mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy or VATS).

          -  Resectable with negative lymph nodes based on imaging with histologic confirmation at
             time of the staging procedure prior to AdV-tk injection

          -  The tumor must be 4cm or greater in diameter based on imaging

          -  ECOG Performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Granulocyte count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3

          -  Peripheral lymphocyte count ≥ 500/mm3

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  SGOT (AST) ≤ 3x upper limit of normal

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2mg/dl

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30ml/min

          -  Patients must give study specific informed consent prior to enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiotherapy and/or treatment with chemotherapeutic, cytotoxic, or immunologic agents
             within 4 weeks prior to infusion of the vector.

          -  Known immunodeficiency such as HIV infection

          -  Active liver disease, including known cirrhosis or active hepatitis

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg prednisone per day or equivalent) or other
             systemic immunosuppressive drugs

          -  Patient is pregnant or breast-feeding. Female patients of childbearing age must have
