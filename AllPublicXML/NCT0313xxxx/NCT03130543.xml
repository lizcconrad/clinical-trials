  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants often present to the hospital with episodes of coughing, choking, gagging, change in
      muscle tone, and/or change in skin color, known as brief resolved unexplained event. Many
      studies have tried to address why infants have these symptoms and if there is a way to
      prevent them from happening again. Currently, there is no clear agreement on the most common
      cause of these symptoms or how to prevent them. Some studies have suggested that
      gastroesophageal reflux can cause these symptoms. The investigators are conducting a study of
      infants who are admitted to Boston Children's Hospital with episodes of coughing, choking,
      gagging, change in muscle tone, and/or change in skin color, symptoms that could be reflux.
      The investigators want to determine if these symptoms can be prevented by changing the way
      infants are fed, either by giving them a formula to treat reflux or by thickening their feeds
      to treat reflux. The goal of the study is to determine if different types of feeding
      interventions prevent infants from coming back to the hospital.
