  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the current World Health Organization (WHO) recommended management package for acute
      diarrhoea (ORS, zinc and feeding advice) has contributed to significant reductions in
      diarrhoea associated mortality, over half a million children continue to die annually as a
      result of acute diarrhoeal episodes. In addition, rates of mortality in young children in the
      90 days following an episode of acute diarrhoea appear at least as high as mortality that
      occurs during the acute episode. The long-term benefits of antibiotic administration may
      result from direct antimicrobial effects on pathogens or from other incompletely understood
      mechanisms including improved nutrition, alterations in immune tolerance or improved enteric
      function. Optimizing antibiotic treatment of acute diarrhoea episodes in very young children
      with severe disease may offer the opportunity to significantly reduce diarrhoea associated
      deaths in the 90 days following presentation for acute diarrhoea and may also improve growth.

      The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of an antibiotic (azithromycin) delivered
      in a specific, targeted fashion to young children (&lt; 2 years of age) at high risk of
      diarrhoea associated mortality in a multi-site randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial. The study will evaluate the ability of the intervention to reduce mortality within 90
      days of the acute diarrhoeal episode, and improve nutritional status over the same period.
