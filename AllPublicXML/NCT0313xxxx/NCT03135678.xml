    <textblock>
      The purpose of the OBSERVE PILOT is to verify the feasibility of collecting individual health
      data which is obtained through blood samples, continuous monitoring devices, medical imaging,
      a questionnaire, and a blood pressure monitor.

      Feasibility of collecting individual health data within the OBSERVE PILOT is described as the
      ease of gathering a broad variety of data by assessing: (1) the willingness of the subjects
      to participate in the study, (2) the logistics corresponding with the variety, and (3) the
      regulatory aspects of gathering a broad variety of data.
