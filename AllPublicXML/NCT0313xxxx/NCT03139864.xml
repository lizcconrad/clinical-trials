  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The type 1 diabetes is a common chronic disease characterised by the stop of production of
      insulin by the pancreas. A lot of factors modify blood glucose. The objective is to study the
      effect of type 1 diabetes on the use of energy substrates (fats and carbohydrates) during
      exercise of increasing intensity by a comparison with non-diabetic controls children.
