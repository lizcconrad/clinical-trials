  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research is to find an effective treatment for patellar tendinopathy
      (PT). To achieve this, we will conduct a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to
      investigate if platelet-rich plasma is effective for treatment. Clinical (pain and function
      scores) and bio-mechanical (knee strength) measures will be correlated with disease
      modification changes assessed using conventional and novel quantitative magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-six patients with PT will be randomized to one of three study arms. Subjects in Group 1
      (PRP) will receive a single US-guided injection of 5 milliliters of autologous PRP into the
      patellar tendon, subjects in Group 2 (DN) will undergo ultrasound guided dry needling of the
      patellar tendon, and subjects in Group 3 (SH) will undergo a sham control ultrasound guided
      dry needling in the subcutaneous tissue only (not intratendon) at the level of the patellar
      tendon. The efficacy of the different treatment options will be assessed by pain- and
      function-dependent, PT-specific Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment Patella (VISA-P)
      quality of life scores, activity level scores, knee strength measurements, and conventional
      and novel MRI and US imaging at baseline, 16, 32, and 52 weeks post-treatment.
