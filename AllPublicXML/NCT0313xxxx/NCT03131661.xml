    <measure>Prevalence of Axial Versus Peripheral Manifestations According to Assessment of Spondyloarthritis Classification (ASAS) Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to visit 5 (Approximately 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The ASAS criteria distinguish axial from peripheral SpA. ASAS criteria for axial SpA: chronic back pain (&gt;=3 months) with onset at age &lt;45 years, and include imaging and clinical arm. Imaging criteria: must have sacroiliitis visible on either pelvic radiograph (representing the Ankylosing Spondylitis subgroup) or active inflammation detected by Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) of the sacroiliac joints, and at least one other feature of SpA. Clinical criteria: should be Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) B27 positive and have at least two other SpA associated features. ASAS criteria for peripheral manifestations: must have arthritis, dactylitis or enthesitis in combination with either at least one of psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis, preceding genitourinary or gastro intestinal infection, HLA B27 positivity or sacroiliitis, or with two or more of arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, inflammatory back pain (at any time in the participant's history) or a family history of SpA.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness for cDMARDs, tDMARDs, bDMARDs: Assessed by ASDAS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to visit 5 (Approximately 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The ASDAS is composite score based on the calculation of 5 disease activities: 4 are participant's reported outcomes (back pain, duration of morning stiffness, participant global and peripheral pain/swelling) and one serologic inflammation marker (C-reactive protein [CRP]). The score is the sum of the 5 items with different specified weights, with a minimum of 0 and no upper limit. Thus this index can reflect both long term disease activity and acute phase status. There are 2 cut-offs in score to show: a) the 4 states of disease activity: inactive disease (less than [&lt;] 1.3), moderate disease activity (1.3-2.1), high disease activity (2.1-3.5) and very high disease activity (greater than [&gt;] 3.5). b) effectiveness of the treatment, two validated cut-offs were developed: a change of 1.1-2.0 (clinically important improvement) and a change &gt;2.0 (major improvement).</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness for cDMARDs, tDMARDs, bDMARDs: Assessed by BASMI Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to visit 5 (Approximately 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) is an index for measuring the mobility of the axial skeleton in participant affected by ankylosing spondylitis (AS). This index consists of 5 clinical measurements, including lumber side flexion, tragus to wall distance, lumbar flexion, intermalleoar distance and cervical rotation. Individual scores are averaged to give a final score between 0 and 10. A higher BASMI10 score reflects more severe spinal mobility limitation.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness for cDMARDs, tDMARDs, bDMARDs: Assessed by DAS28 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to visit 5 (Approximately 24 month)</time_frame>
    <description>The Disease Activity and functional status assessment (DAS) 28 score is a measure of the participant's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], participant's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0 = no disease activity to 100 = maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement. European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Good response: DAS28 less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 or a change from Baseline less than (&lt;) -1.2. EULAR Moderate response: DAS28 greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to &lt;= 5.1 or a change from Baseline &lt; -0.6 to greater than or equal to (&gt;=) -1.2.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to visit 5 (Approximately 24 month)</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is used to assess the physical functioning of the participant.The participant is required to indicate the degree of difficulty they have experienced, in each 8 items of the questionnaire, in the past week, in a 4 point scale. The responses in each functional area are: 0 = able to do with no difficulty; 1 = able to do with some difficulty; 2 = able to do with much difficulty; and 3 = unable to do. The 10 individual subscale scores are averaged to give a summary score. The range of the final calculates summary score is 0-3 where lower scores are indicative of better functioning and higher score reflects worse function. HAQ-DI scores of 0 to 1 generally represent mild to moderate functional difficulty, 1 to 2 represent moderate to severe functional difficulty, and 2 to 3 indicate severe to very severe limitations of physical function or disability.</description>
