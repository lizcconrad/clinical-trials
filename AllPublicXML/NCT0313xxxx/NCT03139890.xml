  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular function decreases following the intake of a mixed meal in some, but not all
      studies. Differences in the relative amounts of dietary fat, carbohydrates and protein
      present in the mixed-meal challenges may have contributed to these apparently inconsistent
      results. Well-designed trials - comparing under rigorously standardized conditions - on the
      effects of macronutrients on postprandial vascular function are missing. The primary
      objective of the current study is thus to evaluate in overweight and slightly obese men the
      effects of the three macronutrients (fat, carbohydrates, and protein) on postprandial
      vascular function, as assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). Secondary
      objectives are to examine postprandial effects on other markers reflecting vascular function,
      plasma markers for low-grade systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, blood
      pressure, and serum lipid and plasma glucose metabolism.
