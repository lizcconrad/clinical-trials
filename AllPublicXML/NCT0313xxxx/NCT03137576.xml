    <textblock>
      A randomized prospective trial to test the non-inferiority of Erector Spinae Plane Block
      (ESPB) in comparison with paravertebral block during non-intubated thoracoscopic lung
      resection
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized trial which aims to evaluate a new technique of peripheral nerve
      block for pain management, the Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) in patients undergoing
      minimally invasive lung resection in spontaneous breathing, with intravenous sedation
      (&quot;non-intubated thoracic surgery&quot;). ESPB will be compared with a largely employed procedure
      for loco regional pain management: the Paravertebral block (PB). Both procedures are
      performed under ultrasonographic guidance to allow proper visualization of the target site.
      Surgery is carried out by means of a minimally invasive approach (Video Assisted thoracic
      Surgery) with two keyhole incisions on the affected side.

Paravertebral block Erector Spinae Plane Block Allocation to one treatment group or another will be randomized with the aim of create two unbiased groups formed out of the same group of patients. Randomization will be provided by a software.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Care Provider)</masking>
    <masking_description>Partecipant masking:
Both blocks are performed on the area between the scapula and the vertebral column, employing the same materials, so that the patient is masked about which block is going to be performed.
Care providers: once the block has been performed, a different anesthesiologist will take care of the patient during the procedure, eventually providing dose escalation in systemic analgesic drugs (primary end point). Surgeons performing the procedure are unaware of the type of block. Staff nurses managing post operative pain in terms of both recording (Numeric Rating Scale) and soothing (rescue analgesia distribution) are unaware of the type of block (secondary end points).</masking_description>

Sedation
Continuous monitoring of sedation with bispectral index. Sedation is achieved with propofol 1% (target bispectral index: 50-70), plus on-demand remifentanyl (50 mcg/ml in TCI, dose target Cet 2-8 ng/ml).
Paravertebral Block
Post operative pain management
Continuous infusion of Tramadol 200 mg or Ketorolac 60 mg
Rescue analgesia with Morphine (0.1 mg/kg) a single time every 24 hours, and/or Tramadol 100 mg up to three times every 24 hours and/ or Ketorolac 30 mg up to three times every 24 hours</description>

    <description>PVB consists in the injection of low concentration Ropivacaine (30 ml, 0.3%) in the paravertebral space (defined by the anterior aspect of the ribs, the vertebral body and the parietal pleura. The space is identified under ultrasonographic guidance by a dedicated Anesthesiologist.</description>

    <description>ESPB consists in the injection of low concentration Ropivacaine (30 ml, 0.3%), in the anatomical plane between the Erector Spinae muscles and deeper surface of Rhomboid muscle. The space is identified under ecographic guidance, laterally to the spinous process of T5. The diffusion of the anesthetic solution along the space can be echographically appreciated.</description>
