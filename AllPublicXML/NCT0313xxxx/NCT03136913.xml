  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare the outcomes of two separate surgical techniques
      used in tooth extraction and ridge preservation. Ridge preservation is done to potentially
      minimize the amount of bone loss that occurs between the tooth extraction and implant or
      bridge placement, as compared to leaving the extraction site empty. There are two techniques
      that are commonly used for these procedures, either to close the surgical site of the
      extracted tooth with sutures (closed flap technique) or to leave the extraction site open to
      heal naturally (open flap technique). In the open flap technique there will be sutures used
      to secure and hold down the material used to cover the wound, called a non-resorbable
      membrane. The flaps will remain in their natural position, the site will fill up naturally
      with new tissue from the bottom up and then close itself in from the sides. The investigators
      want to see which technique offers better healing and reduces bone loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study design will be a single center, randomized controlled trial, split mouth designed
      study, to compare the bone dimensional changes following extraction and ridge preservation in
      surgical techniques that leave the flap open and closed.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the bone dimensional changes following
      extraction and ridge preservation with primary coverage (closed flap technique) in comparison
      to secondary intention (open flap technique).

      The investigators hypothesize that the closed flap technique will have more potential to
      maintain vertical bone height when compared with the open flap technique, due to less
      susceptibility from infection and inflammation.

      Secondary aim is to evaluate patients' self-report of postoperative discomfort. The
      investigators hypothesize that open flap technique will have less post-operative
      pain/discomfort due to less flap dissection and elevation when compared to closed flaps.

      Tertiary aim is to have a histomorphometric examination and to assess the formation of new
      bone.

      The investigators hypothesize that better bone volume percentage will be observed in closed
      flap technique when compared to open flap technique.

      The primary outcome is the mean difference in alveolar bone height change between groups.
