      The study will test whether a high dose influenza vaccination results in improved
      immunogenicity in adult SOT recipients as compared to standard vaccine. This will be a single
      center prospective observer-blind randomized controlled trial conducted at the Toronto
      General Hospital Multi-Organ Transplant Unit, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario,
      Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the transplant population
      and can lead to viral and bacterial pneumonia. Although the annual influenza vaccine is
      recommended for transplant patients, studies have shown that standard vaccine has poor
      immunogenicity. Currently, there are no studies that define the effect of high-dose vaccine
      in adult transplant recipients even though this population could potentially benefit from it.
      The study will compare the immunogenicity of two different types of the influenza vaccine in
      240 solid organ transplant patients during the 2016-2017 season. Patients will be randomized
      to receive either high-dose or standard dose influenza vaccine. Antibody titers will be
      evaluated by a standard hemagglutination inhibition assay. The hypothesis is that the
      patients who receive the high-dose influenza vaccine will reach a significantly greater
      response to the vaccine. This study advances research on the prevention of serious viral
      infections in transplant recipients. Results from this study have the potential to directly
      improve patient care. If the use of the high-dose influenza vaccine is successful, this
      strategy may lead to significant reduction in burden of disease, hospitalization, and
      long-term morbidity.
