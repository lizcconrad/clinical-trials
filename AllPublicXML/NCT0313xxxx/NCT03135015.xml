  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood sugar levels are controlled by insulin, a hormone made by cells in the pancreas. After
      a normal meal, carbohydrates are broken down into glucose (blood sugar) which is absorbed
      from the intestine into the blood leading to a rise in blood glucose which triggers the
      secretion of insulin. Insulin binds to cells in the liver, muscle and fat, triggering them to
      take up glucose and bring the blood glucose level back to normal.

      A high blood sugar level is known as diabetes. The most common form of diabetes, type 2
      diabetes, is caused by insulin resistance; that is, a reduced ability of insulin to stimulate
      glucose uptake into cells. The body compensates for insulin resistance by making more
      insulin; type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas can no longer make enough insulin to
      control blood glucose. The high blood glucose and insulin levels lead to long-term
      complications such as heart attacks, kidney failure, reduced sensation and poor circulation
      in the feet and legs. Reducing blood glucose levels with oral medications and insulin reduces
      risk of diabetes complications. There are several types of oral medications available for
      treating diabetes; however, they do not always control blood glucose adequately. In addition,
      these drugs have complications and are not used to treat insulin resistance and pre-diabetes;
      a condition when blood glucose is higher than normal but not high enough to be called
      diabetes. Pre-diabetes often progresses to diabetes over a period months or years. Effective
      and safe treatments for pre-diabetes could prevent or delay the onset of diabetes.

      Axulin is a natural health product consisting of a mixture of extracts from herbs and
      vegetables present in normal diets which has been shown in cell-culture (cells grown in the
      laboratory) and in animal studies to increase the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose
      uptake into cells. Thus, Axulin may reduce the blood glucose and insulin levels of subjects
      without diabetes after eating. Also Axulin may reduce glucose and insulin responses more in
      insulin-resistant compared to insulin-sensitive subjects.

      Subjects will take 0g, 2g or 4g or Axulin capsules or Axulin tablets in the morning after an
      overnight fast; 40min later they will then consume 75g glucose dissolved in 300ml water.
      Blood glucose, insulin and fats will be measured before and for 2 hours after the glucose
      drink.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After consumption of a meal, pancreatic secretions of various digestive enzymes results in
      the breakdown of carbohydrates into monosaccharides including glucose.1 These sugars are
      subsequently absorbed through the intestinal lumen, resulting in an increased plasma glucose
      concentration. In response to high glucose levels, pancreatic beta-cells are stimulated to
      release the hormone insulin which circulates through the bloodstream and binds to
      insulin-responsive cells including adipocytes (fat tissue), myocytes (muscle tissue), and
      hepatocytes (liver). The resulting insulin-mediated signaling cascade initiates intracellular
      glucose uptake within peripheral tissues leading to a corresponding decrease in circulating
      plasma glucose.

      In insulin responsive cells glucose uptake stimulation begins after the binding of insulin to
      Insulin Receptors (IR), which are found on the membrane surface of cells in insulin
      responsive tissues such as fat, muscle and liver. The IR consists of an extracellular domain
      which binds to insulin, and an intracellular domain that has a protein tyrosine kinase
      activity. The binding of Insulin to the IR initiates a series of auto-phosphorylation events
      within the protein kinase domain that permit interaction and phosphorylation of downstream
      signaling proteins in the cell that mediate the cellular response to insulin. The resulting
      signaling complex includes proteins in the Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS) family known as
      IRS-1 and IRS-2. These key targets of the insulin signaling pathway link IR activation to
      downstream signaling cascades that mediate intracellular processes including GLUT4 mediated
      glucose uptake.

      Pre-diabetes and Type II diabetes involve an impaired post-receptor response to insulin that
      hinders the glucose uptake response after meal consumption. Chronic hyperglycemia and the
      resulting compensatory hyperinsulinemia promote a cohort of acute and chronic sequelae
      including cardiovascular disease, liver complications, central nervous system degeneration
      and hyperglycemic osmotic stress. Axulin is a natural health product consisting of a mixture
      of extracts from herbs and vegetables present in normal diets which was identified by
      screening more than 100,000 compounds and extracts in a patented cell-culture based assay
      system targeting the IRS proteins. In vitro, Axulin has marked effects on the IRS-2 branch of
      the insulin signaling cascade to enhance downstream insulin signaling. Axulin has been shown
      in animal models to increase glucose uptake in peripheral tissues and decrease circulating
      blood glucose and triglyceride concentrations. Regular supplementation of the diet with
      Axulin would be expected to reduce the incidence of associated pre-diabetic and diabetic
      complications, resulting in an increased quality of life for patients without resorting to
      current anti-diabetic prescription drugs such as metformin and others that may have
      substantial unwanted side effects in patients.

      HYPOTHESES Axulin will reduce postprandial glucose and insulin responses in a dose-dependent
      fashion in healthy subjects without diabetes. The reduction in glucose and insulin will be
      relatively greater in insulin-resistant than insulin-sensitive subjects.

      Subjects will take 0g, 2g or 4g or Axulin capsules or Axulin tablets in the morning after an
      overnight fast; 40min later they will then consume 75g glucose dissolved in 300ml water.
      Blood glucose, insulin and triglycerides will be measured fasting and at intervals for 2
      hours after the glucose drink.

    <description>Percentage reduction in the incremental area under the glucose response curve (AUC) after 75g glucose for Axulin capsules relative to the placebo. Incremental AUC is the AUC below the curve above the fasting level; area below fasting is ignored. Percentage reduction will be calculated as 100 x (A-P)/P where A and P are the mean AUC's after Axulin and Placebo treatments, respectively. The blinded AUC results for the 3 capsule treatments will be subjected to repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) examining for the main effects of treatment and subject-group and treatment*group interaction. After demonstration of significant heterogeneity among the 3 coded treatments, differences between individual means will be assessed using Tukey's test to adjust for multiple comparisons. The code will be broken after this analysis has been done. The percentage reductions will be considered to be significant if the difference in mean AUC is significant.</description>
