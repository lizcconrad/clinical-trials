      Evaluation of patient acceptance and characterization of response behaviour for web-based
      compared with respective paperbacked patient reported outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paperbacked pPRO data from up to a total of 100 patients from the cohort of PRAEGNANT are
      planned to be included in the Pepper I PRO study. Additionally 200 patients will be recruited
      in the web based ePRO cohort. The study duration per patient is at least 8 weeks. In cases of
      stable disease the study duration can be extended to up to 6 months with monthly PRO
      assessments, according to the attached visit matrix, taking approximately 20 minutes per
      visit.

      The documentation at baseline should be performed during clinical routine with trained study
      personnel followed by remote self-reporting to minimize the patient effort. Pepper I will be
      conducted as sub-protocol of the PRAEGNANT trial.
