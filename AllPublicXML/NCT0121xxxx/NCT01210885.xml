          4. in good health as determined by the outcome of medical history, physical examination
             and clinical judgment of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any meningococcal vaccine administration;

          2. Current or previous, confirmed or suspected disease caused by N. meningitidis;

          3. Household contact with and/or intimate exposure to an individual with any laboratory
             confirmed N. meningitidis infection within 60 days of enrollment;

          4. Significant acute or chronic infection within the previous 7 days or fever (defined as
             temperature 38C) within the previous 3 days;

             methods at least two months prior to study entry;

          8. Any serious chronic or progressive disease (e.g., neoplasm, diabetes, cardiac disease,
             hepatic disease, progressive neurological disease or seizure disorder; autoimmune
             disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immunodeficiency
             syndrome (AIDS), or blood dyscrasias or diathesis, signs of cardiac or renal failure
             or severe malnutrition);

          9. Known or suspected impairment/alteration of the immune system, immunosuppressive
             therapy, including use of corticosteroids in immunosuppressive doses or chronic use of
             inhaled high-potency corticosteroids within the previous 60 days. [Use of topical
             corticosteroids administered during the study in limited areas (i.e., eczema on knees
             or face or elbows) of the body is allowed]; immunostimulants;

         10. Receipt of blood, blood products and/or plasma derivatives, or a parenteral
             immunoglobulin preparation within the previous 90 days;

             to any vaccine component;

         12. Individuals who received any other vaccines within 2 weeks (for inactivated vaccines)
             or 4 weeks (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this study or who are planning
             to receive any vaccine within 4 weeks from the study vaccines;

         13. Individuals participating in any clinical trial with another investigational product
             30 days prior to first study visit or intent to participate in another clinical study
             at any time during the conduct of this study;

         14. Individuals who are part of study personnel or close family members conducting this
             study;

         15. Individuals with medical history or any illness that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might interfere with the results of the study or pose additional risk to

         16. Individuals with a known bleeding diathesis, or any condition that may be associated
             with a prolonged bleeding time.
