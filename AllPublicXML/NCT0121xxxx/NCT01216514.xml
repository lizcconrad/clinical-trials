    <textblock>
      Factors forecast Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) remain at present essentially on
      clinical factors (extension of the disease, achievement of the perianal ring, requirement of
      surgery, treatment by immunomodulators…). All IBD specific immunological or serological
      markers showed only a diagnostic role for indefinite colitis (hemorrhagic Rectocolitis vs
      Crohn Disease) but were never able to be considered as predictive elements of adults IBD
      evolution. Among the most used, the presence of ANCA's antibody and ASCA allows to separate
      hemorrhagic rectocolitis (ANCA + / ASCA-) from Crohn disease (ANCA-/ASCA +) and their
      combination present an average sensibility about 85 % and a 85 % specificity. However, 8
      other antibody types were recently isolated and estimated individually during IBD in
      particular during child Crohn diseases (anti-OmpC, anti-I2, anti-CBir1, anti-glycans (ALCA,
      AMCA and ACCA) anti-Goblet cells and albicans Candida's specific anti-mannan). These
      complementary assays improve significantly the reliability of the diagnosis. However, if the
      use of these new markers has an indisputable diagnostic role, their predictive role in the
      evolution of IBD was estimated at the adult's only rarely during Crohn diseases.
      Consequently, the investigators suggest realizing an exhaustive analysis of all these new
      immunological markers to define, if their association can have an interest in the
      differentiation of stable (or little evolutionary) and unstable (or quickly evolutionary)
      clinical forms.
