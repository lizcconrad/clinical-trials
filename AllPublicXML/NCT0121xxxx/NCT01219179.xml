  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improved survival rate of extremely low birth weight(ELBW)infants has resulted in new
      fluid and electrolyte problems that have not been encountered previously,in particular
      electrolyte imbalance. ELBW infants are especially vulnerable to hypernatremia(serum sodium
      value &gt;150 mEq/L). Hypernatremia may be due to rapid dehydration or excessive administration
      of intravenous fluids(IV)that contain sodium. The current treatment modality for
      hypernatremia is to increase IV fluids above daily requirements.Enteral sterile water
      feeds(ESWF)are theorized as an endogenous source of fluids that may decrease elevated
      electrolytes such as sodium and potassium in premature infants. By giving ESWF to decrease
      elevated electrolytes, there would be less need for large volumes of IVF that contribute to
      the co-morbidities of prematurity: bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD),intraventricular
      hemorrhage(IVH)and patent ductus arteriosus(PDA).

      The purpose of this proposed study is to determine whether enteral sterile water feedings is
      effective in decreasing the incidence, duration and severity of hypernatremia in ELBW
      infants.

Prophylactic group will receive sterile water feeds starting at 24 hours of life if/or when their serum sodium value is ≥ 145 mEq/L. The volume of sterile water is 10mls/Kg/day based on birth weight, given via continuous infusion feed.
The feeding will be stopped when the serum sodium value is ≤ 140 mEq/L.
The hypernatremia group will receive sterile water feeds when their serum sodium value is ≥ 150 meq/L. The volume of sterile water is 10 mls/Kg/day based on birth weight,given via continuous infusion feed. The feeding will be stopped when the serum sodium value is ≤ 140 mEq/L.</description>
