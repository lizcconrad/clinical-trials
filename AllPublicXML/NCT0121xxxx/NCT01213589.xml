  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-market release registry is to collect additional information
      concerning safety, performance and health economic data with respect to the Medtronic VALIANT
      Thoracic Stent Graft with the Xcelerant Delivery System in the treatment of descending
      thoracic aortic dissections.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient device for use in this registry is the Medtronic VALIANT Thoracic Stent Graft
      System that received CE mark approval in March 2005.

      The Medtronic VALIANT Thoracic Stent Graft with Xcelerant Delivery System is designed to
      treat diseases of the descending thoracic aorta including but not limited to aneurysms and
      dissections. The VALIANT Stent Graft is designed to exclude the aneurysm, the false lumen or
      site of rupture and restore the blood flow through the stent graft lumen. The device is
      intended for use either in patients who are candidates for conventional surgical repair, and
      in patients who are not candidates for conventional surgical repair due to pre-existing risk
      factors.

      This registry is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multi-center, European clinical
      registry with patients diagnosed with descending thoracic aortic dissection.

      For this registry standard hospital procedures with respect to patient interventional care
      for thoracic aortic diseases will be followed.

      This is a descriptive registry in which no specific hypotheses will be statistically tested.

    <description>Complications were assigned a severity score (according SVS scores) so that degrees of morbidity can be assessed and compared. A moderate complication indicates the need for significant intervention, prolongation of hospitalization more than 24 hours, and at most, minor permanent disability that does not preclude normal daily activity. A severe complication necessitates major surgical or medical intervention, may be associated with prolonged convalescence, is usually accompanied by prolonged or permanent disability, and may result in death. Both moderate and severe complications are considered as major complications.

        <description>Complications were assigned a severity score (according SVS scores) so that degrees of morbidity can be assessed and compared. A moderate complication indicates the need for significant intervention, prolongation of hospitalization more than 24 hours, and at most, minor permanent disability that does not preclude normal daily activity. A severe complication necessitates major surgical or medical intervention, may be associated with prolonged convalescence, is usually accompanied by prolonged or permanent disability, and may result in death. Both moderate and severe complications are considered as major complications.

          <title>Freedom From Disease-, Procedure-, or Device-related Severe Complications</title>
          <description>Complications were assigned a severity score (according SVS scores) so that degrees of morbidity can be assessed and compared. A severe complication necessitates major surgical or medical intervention, may be associated with prolonged convalescence, is usually accompanied by prolonged or permanent disability, and may result in death.
