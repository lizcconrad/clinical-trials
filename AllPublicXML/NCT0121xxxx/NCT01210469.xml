      The purpose of this study was compare the efficacy of two exercise programs - the first
      consisting of balance training and muscle strength and the second consisting of balance
      training and muscle stretching exercises - to improve postural control in elderly women with
      osteoporosis.

      The decrease in postural control and muscle strength in lower limbs have been identified as
      major risk factors for falls in older people. Exercises have proven effective in decreasing
      risk factors in healthy elderly, but little is known about the effects of interventions with
      exercise in the elderly with osteoporosis.

      Objective: To compare the efficacy of two exercise programs - the first consisting of balance
      training and muscle strength and the second consisting of balance training and muscle
      stretching exercises - to improve postural control in elderly women with osteoporosis.

      Methods: Fifty elderly aged 65 or older, with a diagnosis of osteoporosis, were randomized
      into 3 groups: Strength Group (n = 17) performed balance training with muscle strengthening;
      Stretching Group (n = 17) performed balance training with stretching; and Control Group (n
      =16) did not do activity. The groups trained for 8 weeks, with sessions of about 60 minutes,
      twice a week. Postural control was evaluated by Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction
      for Balance (CTSIBm) and Limits of Stability test (LOS) in Balance Master force plate, the
      functional balance by Berg Balance Scale (BBS), muscle strength by dynamometry, the
      shortening of the hamstrings by goniometry and posture by PAS/SAPO (Postural Assessment
      Software).
