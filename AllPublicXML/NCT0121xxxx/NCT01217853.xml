    <textblock>
      A study in which intraocular pressure (IOP) will be monitored over 24 hours using the
      SENSIMED Triggerfish® device and Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) in primary open angle
      glaucoma patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the comparability of diurnal IOP
      patterns emerging from SENSIMED Triggerfish and GAT.
