      n-3 FA formulations in healthy males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-chain n-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA) are known to positively affect the lipid profile, vascular tone and blood coagulation.
      Moreover, EPA and DHA possess anti-inflammatory effects and play a central role in the
      functioning of the brain and central nervous system. Therefore, an increased EPA and DHA
      intake is highly recommend. However, it is unknown whether different chemical formulations of
      EPA + DHA rich supplements (re-esterified triglycerides, ethyl-esters, phospholipids) have
      identical bioavailability. The objective of this study is to examine differences in short
      term bioavailability between four n-3 FA formulations:

        -  Supplement 1: EPA+DHA as re-esterified triglycerides (rTGs) from fish-oil uncoated
           capsules

        -  Supplement 2: EPA+DHA as rTGs from fish-oil in gastric acid resistant (coated) capsules
           (GArTG)

        -  Supplement 3: EPA+DHA as ethylesters (EE) from fish-oil uncoated capsules

        -  Supplement 4: DHA+EPA as phospholipids from krill-oil, uncoated capsules (KPL)

      The study preparations are certificated supplements and available on the market.

      There are no comparative investigations, which analyzed the bioavailability of these four n-3
      FA formulations in a similar design.
