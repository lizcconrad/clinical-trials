      The improvement in uroflow and postvoid residual urine in children after urethral meatotomy
      for meatal stenosis. The hypothesis is that there is an improvement in both parameters, thus
      justifying the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urethral meatal stenosis is a known complication of circumcision occuring in up to 3% of
      newborns undergoing circumcision. It is customary to perform a meatotomy in order to prevent
      bladder outlet obstruction, although bladder outlet obstruction has never been proven and
      improvement has only been proved in a single, small, retrospective study. Our intention is to
      evaluate the improvement in objective parameters (uroflow and postvoid residual urine) after
      urethral meatotomy by measuring these parameter before the procedure, one month after the
      procedure and one year after the procedure. Symptoms assessment will also be performed.
