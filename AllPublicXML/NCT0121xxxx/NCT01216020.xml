      BACKGROUND:

      Concomitant radiotherapy and cisplatin (CDDP) based chemotherapy is the standard treatment
      for LA-NHSCC. This combined modality treatment is linked with considerable acute local and
      systemic toxicity.EGFR is overexpressed in 90-100% of the HNSCC cases and is considered an
      unfavourable prognostic marker. EGFR costitutive activation is linked with HNSCC
      pathogenesis.

      Cetuximab is a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody blocking the activation of the receptor and
      signal transduction. Cetuximab combined with radiotherapy is superior to radiotherapy only in
      the treatment of LA-HNSCC and is characterized by an acceptable toxicity profile.

      RATIONALE:

      A direct comparison between concomitant chemoradiotherapy with Cisplatin and the concomitant
      treatment with radiotherapy associated to cetuximab does not exist.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Arm A: Radical radiotherapy (doses and volumes) concomitant with chemotherapy with Cisplatin
      (40 mg/mq/week) Arm B: Radical radiotherapy (doses and volumes) concomitant with therapy with
      the monoclonal antibody Cetuximab (400 mg/m2 [&quot;loading dose&quot;] and subsequently 250 mg
      /m2/week)

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Evaluation and comparison of the compliance of the two treatments;

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Evaluation and comparison of the grade and incidence of acute toxicity; Evaluation and
      comparison of local control; Evaluation and comparison of event free survival (both local
      control and distant metastases); Evaluation and comparison of cause specific and overall
      survival.

      INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        -  Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (biopsy obtained from the tumor and/or
           from its lymphnodal metastases) originating from oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharinx,
           supraglottic larynx;

        -  Locally advanced disease, defined by one of the following criteria: every T, N+, M0 (
           T1, N1 cases excluded); T3-4, N0, M0;

        -  Not a nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, salivary glands tumor;

        -  General conditions and concomitant diseases not considered a contraindication for
           chemotherapy or curative radiotherapy;

        -  No other surgical, chemotherapeutic or radiotherapic treatments for ENT region tumors or
           for tumors of other anatomical sites (with the exception of non-melanoma cutaneous
           tumors and of the carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix and of other solid tumors
           whose primary treatment has been completed more than 3 years before the accrual in this
           study and never relapsed since primary treatment (the patient having been since then
           continuously disease- free);

        -  Availability for follow-up;

        -  Signed informed consent;

        -  An interval of maximum 3 weeks between staging procedures for local disease and
           randomization

        -  An interval of maximum 2 weeks between randomization and the onset of the treatment
