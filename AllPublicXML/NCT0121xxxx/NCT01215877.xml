  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intravenously administered taxanes, docetaxel and paclitaxel, alone and in combination
      with other chemotherapy agents are active in patients with advanced and metastatic bladder
      cancer, and agents of this class are a promising treatment option for some patients.

      Tesetaxel is an orally administered taxane that is in development as treatment for subjects
      with advanced cancers. This study is being conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of
      tesetaxel administered to patients previously treated with chemotherapy for progressive
      metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium.

    <description>Tesetaxel capsules orally once every 21 days; duration of therapy not to exceed 12 months
In Cycle 1, a dose of 27 mg/m2 will be administered. In subsequent cycles,
the dose will be increased to 35 mg/m2 in Cycle 2 for subjects who did not have an ANC &lt; 1,500/mm3, a platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3, or a Grade 3 (or higher grade) nonhematologic adverse event considered by the Investigator to be related to protocol therapy (excluding alopecia, nausea, and vomiting) in Cycle 1. The dose is not to exceed the dose of 35 mg/m2 in any cycle subsequent to Cycle 2.
for all other subjects, the dose administered in Cycle 1 (27 mg/m2) will be administered in all subsequent cycles.</description>
