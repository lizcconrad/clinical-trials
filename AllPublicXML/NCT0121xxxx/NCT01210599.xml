      INTRODUCTION Pamidronate and other bisphosphonates (bisph) have an anti-nociceptive effect in
      animals. In humans, IV pamidronate is analgesic in patients affected by numerous painful
      conditions, including cancer bone pain, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), ankylosing
      spondylitis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The investigators have explored the effect of IV
      pamidronate in the management of chronic low back pain (CLBP), a worldwide public health
      problem in terms of lost workdays, treatment costs, and suffering.

      The study was a randomized, double blind, dose-escalation trial of IV pamidronate. Study
      participants were divided among four study phases. Each group received IV placebo or
      escalating doses of IV pamidronate.

      STUDY DESIGN A phase I-II, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose finding study
      for the treatment of patients with CLBP with IV pamidronate. The study was first conducted at
      Beth Israel Medical Center, NY for the first two groups, and was completed at Mount Sinai
      Medical Center , NY for the remaining groups.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES The intent of this pilot study was to determine the optimal IV pamidronate
      treatment protocol for CLBP in a Phase III trial. Primary study aims were safety and average
      daily pain. Subjects used an electronic diary (LOGPAD) to record their daily adverse events
      (AEs) and their baseline and post-treatment average pain on the 0-10 numerical rating scale
      (NRS).

      STATISTICAL ANALYSES All the analysis were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Primary
      outcomes are LOGPAD change in pain severity and whether a patient was a responder (pain score
      dropped ≥2 points or ≥30%). Because there was no statistical difference in these two outcomes
      among the 4 placebo groups, all placebo patients were combined (Comb PL) in the subsequent
      analyses. Primary analytic tool was mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), assuming
      autoregressive covariance structure (LOGPAD pain and Brief Pain Inventory - BPI
      interferences), and Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model for categorical outcomes
      (Response rates and Patient Global Impression of Change - PGIC). The main objective was to
      assess whether the changes in outcome from baseline or the response rates were the same
      across the study phases, while adjusting for baseline values and time effect. Least square
      means were contrasted. Interaction between time and study phases were also tested to see if
      the treatment effect is a function of time. Fisher's exact tests or ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis)
      tests were performed for cross-sectional group comparison, including baseline.
