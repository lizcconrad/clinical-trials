      The primary objective of this study was to validate the ability of an 8-gene biomarker set to
      differentiate between participants who met or did not meet European League Against Rheumatism
      (EULAR) Disease Activity Score (DAS)-28 Good Response criteria after treatment with
      anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) therapy for 14 weeks in approximately 200 anti-TNF-naïve
      participants. The secondary objectives of this study was (i) to compare the behavior of the
      8-gene marker set in participants who were anti-TNF naïve versus those who began their second
      anti-TNF treatment , (ii) to develop, maintain, and utilize a biorepository of serum, plasma,
      RNA, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples for additional experiments and analyses and
      (iii) to discover novel genetic (DNA) predictors of response to anti-TNF therapy.

        Participants who meet American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for rheumatoid
        arthritis (RA) and who, in the opinion of their treating rheumatologist, are not adequately
        treated with existing therapy and should begin treatment with either an anti TNF agent for
        the first time or with a different anti-TNF agent.

        Key Inclusion Criteria

        To be eligible to participate in this study, candidates must meet the following eligibility
        criteria at the time of enrollment:

          -  Are willing and able to provide informed consent..

          -  Meet the ACR criteria for RA as determined by a rheumatologist who is board certified
             in Rheumatology or a member of the ACR.

          -  Have 4 or more tender and 4 or more swollen joints out of 28 joints as assessed by
             their treating rheumatologist or a trained joint assessor.

          -  Subjects are not taking any of the following treatments and/or have washed out for the
             minimum duration as defined below. If subjects are currently taking these treatments,
             must have been on a stable dosing regimen for the minimum duration as defined below:

               -  Oral DMARDs (MTX, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, cyclosporine,
                  azathioprine): on drug for at least 3 months and washed out or stable for at
                  least 6 weeks prior to baseline sample collection.

               -  Oral corticosteroids: washed out or stable AND ≤10 mg/day of prednisone
                  equivalent for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline sample collection.

               -  Intraarticular or parenteral corticosteroids: Washed out or stable for at least 4
                  weeks prior to baseline sample collection.

               -  NSAIDs: Washed out or stable for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline sample
                  collection.

          -  Are about to start treatment with an anti-TNF agent approved for the treatment of RA
             for the first time OR Have not, in the opinion of the treating rheumatologist,
             achieved or maintained an adequate response to treatment with their first anti-TNF
             agent (any anti-TNF agent approved for the treatment of RA), and have been prescribed
             a different anti TNF agent. Subjects who switch for any reason other than lack of
             efficacy will be excluded.

        Key Exclusion Criteria

        Candidates will be excluded from study entry if any of the following exclusion criteria
        exist at the time of enrollment:

          -  Any medical condition that would preclude safe use of an anti-TNF agent for at least
             14 weeks.

          -  Previous participation in the present study as a subject in the anti-TNF-naïve group.

          -  Prior exposure to 2 or more anti-TNF agents.

          -  Prior exposure to Orencia (abatacept, or CTLA4-Ig) and/or Rituxan (anti CD20), or
             other biologic therapy for RA or other diseases.

        Note: Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
