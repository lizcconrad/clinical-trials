  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, single-treatment, multi centre clinical trial enrolling 30 patients in 2
      centres in Romania, with a clinical and angiographic follow-up at 4 and 9 months to determine
      the primary endpoint of late lumen loss and secondary endpoints. A subgroup of 15 patients
      will also undergo post implantation, 4 and 9 months IVUS examinations. Additional clinical
      follow-ups take place at 1 month and yearly up to three (3) years.

      The objective of this trial is to assess the safety and clinical performance of the ORSIRO
      drug eluting stent in patients with single de-novo coronary artery lesions.

             Documented stable angina pectoris (Canadian cardiovascular society classification
             (CCS) 1, 2, 3 or 4 ), or documented silent ischemia;

          3. Single de novo lesion with ≥50% and &lt;90% stenosis in 1 coronary artery;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤30%;

          5. Known allergies to the following: Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (Aspirin®), Clopidogrel
             bisulfate (Plavix®.) or Ticlopidine (Ticlid®.), Heparin, contrast agent (that cannot
             be adequately premedicated), cobalt-chromium (CoCr), Poly-L-Lactidic Acid (PLLA),

          9. Target vessel has evidence of thrombus or is excessively tortuous that makes it
             unsuitable for proper stent delivery and deployment;

         10. Significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require
             revascularization or impede run off;

         11. Heavily calcified lesion and/or calcified lesion which cannot be successfully
             predilated;

         12. Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft;
