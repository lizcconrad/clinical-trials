      Our proposed study is designed to test the safety of a new vaccine against melanoma. The
      induction of immune activity against cancers such as melanoma is a promising approach to
      cancer treatment, but to date, only a few clinically significant immune responses have been
      seen following vaccine therapy. This is an important problem, since there are very limited
      treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread to lymph
      nodes and organs).

      Studies suggest that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block inhibitory receptors on immune
      cells can enhance the immune responses against cancer, but the intravenous injection of such
      mAbs has caused severe side effects in animals and humans. In our laboratory, we have
      developed a method to deliver mAbs and other proteins that block such inhibitory receptors
      locally at the site where immune responses against melanoma proteins are stimulated by
      vaccination, enhancing anti-melanoma immunity while avoiding the side-effects associated with
      intravenous injection of these immune modulators. This is achieved by loading dendritic
      cells, a type of immune cell, with RNA that encodes the immune modulator. The RNA-loaded
      dendritic cells then make the immune modulatory proteins and release them locally. By mixing
      these dendritic cells with additional dendritic cells loaded with melanoma proteins, the
      immune modulators are released at the site where anti-melanoma immune cells are stimulated.

      In this phase I trial, subjects with metastatic melanoma will undergo the process of
      leukapheresis, in which white blood cells are removed from the body. Monocytes, a type of
      immune cell, will then be purified from the white blood cells and cultured under conditions
      that will change them into dendritic cells. Half of these dendritic cells are then loaded
      with melanoma antigen RNA, which will lead to the production of melanoma antigen proteins
      within the dendritic cells. The remaining half of the dendritic cells will be either
      untreated or loaded with RNA encoding immune modulators so that these dendritic cells will
      release immune modulators at the site of vaccination. These dendritic cells will be mixed
      with the melanoma antigen-loaded dendritic cells and injected as a vaccine into lymph nodes.
      Each subject will receive six weekly injections of their own dendritic cells. Safety and
      toxicity will be closely monitored. In addition, immune responses against melanoma, as well
      as clinical responses, will be assessed.

    <textblock>
      A variety of trials of immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma have clearly demonstrated that
      immune responses against melanoma can be induced, but only a few patient have responded
      clinically, suggesting that new strategies to enhance anti-cancer immune responses are
      needed. Most of these immunotherapy trials have focused on antigen delivery and providing
      stimulatory antigen-specific signals to T cells. However, the induction of antigen-specific T
      cell-mediated immune responses is regulated not only by stimulatory signals, but also by
      inhibitory receptor-mediated signals. Studies have demonstrated that administering mAbs
      targeting such immune-modulating receptors on T cells enhances vaccine-induced anti-tumor
      immunity, suggesting that such an approach might improve the efficacy of clinical cancer
      vaccines. However, systemic administration such mAbs has been associated with severe,
      sometimes fatal, autoimmunity. We have developed an approach for targeted delivery of such
      immune modulatory proteins and mAbs, using immune modulator RNA-transfected dendritic cells
      (DC), to sites where anti-tumor T cells are induced. Our preliminary studies indicate that
      this approach may eliminate the adverse effects associated with systemic administration
      immune modulators, while also enhancing vaccine-induced immune responses.

      Therefore, the objective of this proposed Phase I immunotherapy trial is to determine the
      safety and obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of vaccination of human subjects with
      melanoma tumor associated antigen (TAA) RNA-transfected mature monocyte-derived DC
      coadministered with additional untransfected DC (Study Arm A), DC transfected with RNA
      encoding a soluble GITR-L fusion protein (Study Arm B), DC transfected with RNA encoding the
      humanized heavy and light chains of an antagonistic anti-CTLA-4 mAb (Study Arm C), or DC
      transfected with combined GITR-L and anti-CTLA-4 mAb RNA (Study Arm D). All study subjects
      will undergo leukapheresis for collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and
      purified monocytes will be cultured with the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-4 to produce immature
      DC. After the induction maturation with a standard cytokine cocktail, half of the DC will
      then be transfected with RNA encoding melanoma TAAs MART, tyrosinase, and gp100, and MAGE-3,
      while the remaining half of the DC will be either untransfected (Study Arm A) or will be
      transfected with immune modulator RNA (Study Arm B, C, and D). DC will be cryopreserved.
      Subjects will then be immunized with these DC, weekly for six intranodal injections. For each
      subject, safety and toxicity will be assessed, and anti-tumor immune responses will be
      measured.
