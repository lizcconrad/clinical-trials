      This study will determine the delayed neurotoxicity (12 months) of a hypofractionated high
      dose irradiation (3 Gy x 9) associated with zoledronic acid.

      The administration of zoledronic acid repeat dosages defined under the Authorisation on the
      Market.

      All patients receive a total dose of 27 Gy divided into 3 fractions of 9 Gy performed at
      least 48 hours apart each, for a treatment to J1, J3 and J5.
