    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety of GRNOPC1 administered at a single
      time-point between 7 and 14 days post injury, inclusive, to patients with neurologically
      complete spinal cord injuries (SCI).

    <description>The primary endpoint is safety, as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse events within 1 year (365 days) of GRNOPC1 injection that are related to GRNOPC1, the injection procedure used to administer GRNOPC1, and/or the concomitant immunosuppression administered.</description>

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>

        Major Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neurologically complete, traumatic SCI (ASIA Impairment Scale A), zone of partial
             preservation &lt; 5 levels

          -  Last fully preserved neurological level from T-3 through T-11

          -  From 18 through 65 years of age at time of injury

          -  Single spinal cord lesion

          -  Informed consent for this protocol and the companion long term follow-up protocol must
             be provided and documented (i.e., signed informed consent forms) no later than 11 days
             following injury

          -  Able to participate in an elective surgical procedure to inject GRNOPC1 7-14 days
             following SCI

        Major Exclusion Criteria:

          -  SCI due to penetrating trauma

          -  Traumatic anatomical transection or laceration of the spinal cord

          -  Any concomitant injury or pre-existing condition that interferes with the performance,
             interpretation or validity of neurological examinations

          -  Inability to communicate effectively with neurological examiner

          -  Significant organ damage or systemic disease that would create an unacceptable risk
             for surgery or immunosuppression

          -  History of any malignancy

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &gt; 35 or weight &gt; 300 lbs.
