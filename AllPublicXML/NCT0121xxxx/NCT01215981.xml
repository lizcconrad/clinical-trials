      Study Design:

      This is a randomized, single center study to evaluate immune responses to the seasonal
      influenza vaccine in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients who
      receive one vaccine or two vaccine doses one month apart. In addition, a cohort of healthy
      adult volunteers will be recruited as controls to confirm immune response to a single
      influenza vaccine.

    Lack of patients and no longer influenza vaccine season.

        <description>The secondary endpoint of this study is to measure the response to the vaccine with laboratory studies including viral specific H3 immune responses (IFN-y Elispot). Response is defined as 4 fold increase in H3N1. Response is listed as a number of subjects (evaluable) that successfully responded.</description>
