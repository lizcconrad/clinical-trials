    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Pomalidomide and bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bortezomib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving pomalidomide and bortezomib together with dexamethasone may kill
      more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose
      of bortezomib when given together with pomalidomide and dexamethasone and to see how well it
      works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib in combination with pomalidomide
      and dexamethasone.

      II. To evaluate the hematologic response rate (PR, VGPR, or CR) of pomalidomide, bortezomib
      and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time to progression.

      II. To assess the toxicity of pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE : This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib followed by a phase II
      study. Patients receive oral pomalidomide on days 1-21; bortezomib IV on days 1, 8,15, 22;
      and oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, 22 . Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses.
      Patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising oral pomalidomide on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
