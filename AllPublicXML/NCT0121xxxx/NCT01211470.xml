    <description>The Primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of PMX-30063 in patients treated for acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI). The primary measure of efficacy will be bacteriologic eradication at end of treatment of S. aureus (either Methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) or Methicillin-resistant (MRSA)) in subjects with ABSSSI and having S. aureus isolated from an appropriate infection site prior to randomization.
The secondary objectives are clinical responses, safety and pharokinetics of PMX-300063.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a diagnosis of ABSSSI in which S. aureus is clinically suspected to be the likely
             pathogen

          2. Clinical manifestation of subjects' ABSSSI must include the presence of purulent
             material suitable for microbiologic culture, Gram stain examination and PCR assay.

          3. The ABSSSI must be 75 cm2 or greater in size in order for the subject to be eligible
             for this study. This includes the primary and surrounding erythema, swelling or
             induration.

          4. Super-infected eczema or other chronic medical conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis,
             hidradentitis suppurativa) characterized by prominent signs of inflammation for an
             extended period even after successful bacterial eradication. (Subjects with an ABSSSI
             that involves an anatomic location in which there is no evidence of a chronic skin
             condition are eligible for enrollment.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients who are pregnant, lactating (breast milk feeding), or planning a
             pregnancy during the course of the study.

          2. History of peripheral neuropathy of any form or etiology

          3. Anticipated need for prolonged antibiotic therapy (i.e., &gt;8 days)

          4. ABSSSI known or suspected to be caused exclusively by Gram negative pathogens or
             anaerobes (both Gram positive or Gram negative)

          5. Diabetic foot infection: defined as a subacute or chronic infection (&gt; 4 weeks) below
             the ankle in a patient with diabetic neuropathy

          6. Infected burns

          7. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a CD4 count &lt; 200/mm3

          8. Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C receiving treatment with interferon or other
             immunosuppressive therapy
