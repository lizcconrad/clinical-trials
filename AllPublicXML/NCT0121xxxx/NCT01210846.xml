    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain QTc data, to assess the effects of tivozanib on ECG
      morphology, and to determine the pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationship between
      any observed changes in cardiac repolarization (defined by QTcF duration) and the serum
      concentration of tivozanib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tivozanib is a novel and potent pan-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor
      (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against all 3 VEGFRs (VEGFR-1, -2, and
      -3). In nonclinical models and studies performed in humans, tivozanib has shown strong
      antiangiogenesis and antitumor activity.

      This study is an open-label, non-randomized, exploratory single-arm trial evaluating the ECG
      and pharmacokinetic (PK)-ECG relationship, if any, of tivozanib in subjects with advanced
      solid tumors.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ECG intervals and morphology following treatment
      with tivozanib in subjects with advanced solid tumors and to determine the relationship, if
      any, of the change in QTc duration with serum concentration of tivozanib over time in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors.

        Prohibited 3 weeks prior to first dose and for the duration of the study:

        - Treatment with radiotherapy (limited radiotherapy involving ≤ 25% of bone marrow may be
        allowed for palliative purposes after consultation with the medical monitor, treatment with
        study drug must be stopped during radiotherapy);

        Prohibited 2 weeks prior to first dose and for the duration of the study:

          -  Herbal preparations/supplements/topical applications (except for daily
             multivitamin/mineral supplement not containing herbal components);

          -  Treatment with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors (see Appendix C for examples);

        Prohibited 1 week prior to first dose and for the duration of the study:

        - Treatment with full dose oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, acenocoumarol,
        fenprocoumon, or similar agents. If previously receiving these types of agents, a minimum
        washout of 1 week and documented PT of &lt; 1.5 × ULN will be required prior to start of
        therapy. Full dose anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated
        heparin administered subcutaneously is allowed. Low dose oral anticoagulation (eg, 1-2
        mg/day warfarin) is allowed provided PT remains &lt; 1.5 × ULN during the study.
