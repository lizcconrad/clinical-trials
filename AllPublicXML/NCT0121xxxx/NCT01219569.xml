      This is a study to focus on the feasibility of using a monitor which may signal loss of
      visual function intraoperatively.

    <textblock>
      The degree of a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) has been correlated with the
      severity of an eye injury and has been shown to have prognostic significance as an indicator
      of retinal ischemia. Therefore light flashed evoked pupillometry (LFEP) may serve as a useful
      indicator of visual function. LFEP's are not known to be sensitive to anesthetics. We will
      measure LFEP's using different anesthetic techniques to see if there are measurable
      differences in the latency, amplitude and constriction velocity of the pupillary reflex.
      Prior to induction of anesthesia, pupillometer readings will be taken in the supine position
      in both eyes. The patient will be anesthetised using a standard induction technique. For
      maintenance of anesthesia a remifentanil infusion will be administered and supplemented by
      either propofol infusion (at 120 and 160 mcg/kg/min)or sevoflurane (at 1.5 and 2.5% end-tidal
      in random sequence. The patients will receive muscle relaxants as needed. Pupillometry
      readings will be taken in both eyes after induction, after steady maintenance has been
      achieved and every 10 minutes for 30 minutes at each drug dose.
