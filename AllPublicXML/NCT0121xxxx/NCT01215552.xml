  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging study is designed to explore the relationship
      between HT-0712 dose level and inhibition of brain phosphodiesterase-4 activity, in order to
      optimize the dosage regimens utilized in subsequent trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to demonstrate the inhibition of human brain PDE4 by
      HT-0712, by measuring the inhibition of [11C]R-rolipram binding, a radiotracer which also
      binds to and inhibits PDE4. Plasma samples will be drawn to determine if there is a
      relationship between plasma pharmacokinetics of HT-0712 and its pharmacodynamic effect, as
      determined through the inhibition of [11C]R-rolipram binding in the brain.
