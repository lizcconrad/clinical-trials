    <textblock>
      Part A: 30 patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis despite continued treatment
      with methotrexate will receive once daily two capsules containing either GLPG0259 (25
      mg/capsule) or matching placebo, for 12 weeks. In the course of the study the patients will
      be examined for severity of disease, as well as for any adverse effects that may occur. If
      needed, dosing may be split to one capsule twice daily, or reduced to one capsule of 25 mg.

      Part B: If results of Part A suggest test medication to have a therapeutic advantage over
      placebo and to be well-tolerated, more patients will be recruited for Part B, where various
      dosages will be assessed. These dosages will be established based on results from Part A.
