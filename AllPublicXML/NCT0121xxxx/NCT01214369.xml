      -  Hypothesis:

             -  X-tip intraosseous is an effective supplementary injection in mandibular hot teeth
                as well as Periodontal Ligament (PDL) injection

        -  Purposes:

             -  Comparing the anesthetic efficacy of X-tip intraosseous and PDL injection in
                mandibular hot teeth which had not been anesthetized after 3.6 ml Infra Alveolar
                Nerve Block

        -  Methods and Materials:

             -  forty patients with mandibular hot molar or second premolar which had not been
                anesthetized after 3.6 ml inferior alveolar nerve block injection will be selected
                for this study

      -  Randomization:

             -  All patients will be randomly divided into two groups as follows:

                  1. X-tip intraosseous injection will be used as supplementary

                  2. PDL injection will be used as supplementary

        -  Anesthetic evaluation:

             -  For anesthetic evaluation we will use Visual Analog Scale (VAS)

    <description>Patients will be selected from a group who were not anesthetized following 3.6 ml block injection. Half of the randomly selected patients will receive X-tip intraosseous injection and half will receive PDL injection as a supplementary for completing the anesthesia in selected hot mandibular molar teeth.</description>
