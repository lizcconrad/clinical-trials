  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will look at how the brain may change in people with Alzheimer disease (AD).

      The purpose of this research is to find out whether changes in the brain in people with
      Alzheimer disease can be detected using a brain imaging test. Most people with Alzheimer
      disease have changes in the brain that result in deposits of a protein called beta-amyloid.
      In this study, the investigators will be using a radioactive drug, [18F]MNI-558 that binds to
      beta-amyloid. This drug is experimental and has not been approved by the FDA. Brain imaging
      using PET (positron emission tomography) will be done to see if the investigators can
      evaluate the areas of beta-amyloid in the subjects with Alzheimer disease. The investigators
      will compare these scans with those done in healthy normal volunteers. PET is a
      brain-scanning test used in medicine and scientific research to see how the brain is working.
      The PET imaging test used in this study is not being done for diagnostic purposes.

      This is a phase 0, open-label, single-center, non-randomized single dose study to assess the
      safety and efficacy of MNI-558 PET imaging in detecting amyloid beta plaque in the brain in
      patients with probable AD compared to HVs. All aspects related to image acquisition,
      processing and visual as well as quantitative evaluation will be developed, optimized and
      validated (where required).

      Each subject will be required to visit the study center during the screening phase, on the
      MNI-558 PET imaging day (baseline), and for 1 follow-up visit on the next day. A telephone
      follow-up visit will be performed 7 days after MNI-558 PET administration.

      At the screening visit, each subject and the caregiver will be asked to provide written
      informed consent or assent. During the screening phase (maximum duration - 28 days) subject
      medical, neurological and surgical history, clinical assessments and a neuro-psychiatric
      evaluation will be performed on all eligible subjects. Subjects will be allowed to leave the
      center after all evaluations have been completed. During this period an MRI of the brain must
      be performed. During the MNI-558 PET imaging day, all subjects will receive a single IV
      injection of IMP and scanning will be performed from 0-60 min, 75-135 min, and 150-210 min
      (p.i). Each subject will be asked to return to the site for a follow-up visit (20 to 28 hours
      after IMP administration) and a telephone follow-up will occur 7 days thereafter. Safety will
      be assessed during both follow-up visits.

    <description>To determine diagnostic efficacy of the MNI-558 PET scans in differentiating between patients with probable AD and HVs on the basis of neocortical tracer binding pattern, the PET scans will be visually assessed by a nuclear physician experienced in the field of neuro-imaging.
Safety will be assessed from the rates of adverse events (AEs), changes in vital signs, changes in ECG parameters, changes in physical examination findings, changes in clinical laboratory findings, changes in injection site monitoring at pre-specified time points before and after IMP administration</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Images will be regionally analyzed by applying VOIs to the brain regions indicated above based on PET images coregistered with MRI images; SUV ratios and % injected dose concentrations will be determined using standardized image processing algorithms and commercial algorithms.
