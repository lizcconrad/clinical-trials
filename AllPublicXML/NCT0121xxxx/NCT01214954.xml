  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether supervised progressive resistance training
      is effective in the early phase after Total Hip Replacement. The investigators hypothesise
      that 10 weeks of supervised, progressive resistance training immediately after discharge will
      lead to increased functional performance, muscle strength and muscle power compared to
      standard rehabilitation consisting of home-based exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After total hip replacement (THR) surgery there is a documented deficit in muscle strength
      and functional performance. There is a lack of evidence concerning the effectiveness of
      postoperative physiotherapy and training, however a few small studies have shown promising
      effect of resistance training.

      The present study will provide new and important knowledge concerning the effect of different
      rehabilitation strategies after THR. This might lead to a change in the rehabilitation
      regimes and faster and better recovery after THR surgery.
