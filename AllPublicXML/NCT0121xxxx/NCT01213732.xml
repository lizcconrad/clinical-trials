    <textblock>
      In this study the recombinant human fusion protein L19TNFα will be associated in ILP with the
      standard treatment with melphalan 10mg/l limb volume in subjects affected by stage III/IV
      limb melanoma.

      The recombinant human fusion protein L19TNFα was created with the intention to target TNFα
      directly to tumor tissues with the result in high and sustained intralesional bioactive TNFα
      concentrations.

          6. All acute adverse effects (excluding alopecia) of any prior therapy (including
             surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy) must have been resolved to ≤ Grade 1, except
             elevated liver transaminases judged to be associated with tumor infiltration (see
             below) (graded according to National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 [CTCAE, v.3.0].

             aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and total bilirubin ≤ 2.0
             mg/dL unless liver involvement by the tumor, in which case the transaminase levels up
             to 5 x ULN are allowed.
