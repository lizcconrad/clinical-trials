    <textblock>
      Patients in general wards have abnormal physical values preceding in-hospital cardiac arrest
      or a transfer to intensive care unit (ICU). The purpose of Medical Emergency Team (MET) or
      EMS is to interfere early enough in deteriorating patient status to prevent adverse outcomes
      like cardiac arrest or transfer to intensive care unit. The aims of this study are to record
      and analyze the effects of EMS and department of emergency and both afferent and efferent
      limbs of MET activity in Finnish tertiary Hospital.

    <description>We are going to analyze the number of MET calls and their impact on sudden cardiac arrests in TAUH. The time frame is 1st Jan 2010 -31st Dec 2015. It is known fact that well working MET team inside the hospital should decrease the sudden cardiac arrests. We also analyze the EMS calls and the ED visits in June 2015 to see if patient detoriation is related to sudden in-hospital death.</description>
