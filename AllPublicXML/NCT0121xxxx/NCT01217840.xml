  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large studies of children show that over half of the children in the United States of America
      do not have enough vitamin D stored in their bodies. In children who are overweight or obese,
      the percentage of children who do not have enough vitamin D is even higher.

      Vitamin D is essential for the body to maintain normal calcium levels and strong bones.
      Recent research shows that through the actions of inflammatory markers, levels in the blood
      that measure inflammation in the body, vitamin D plays many other important roles in the body
      like helping to regulate the immune system, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and body fat.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on
      inflammatory markers in obese and overweight adolescents. As a secondary goal, we would like
      to evaluate cardiometabolic risk factors and the correlation between body mass index, vitamin
      D stores and inflammatory cytokines.

      In an observed, randomized controlled trial over 6 months we will provide observed vitamin D
      supplementation or placebo to healthy obese and overweight adolescents and measure changes in
      inflammatory markers, lipids, blood pressure, and mean blood sugars. We hypothesize that
      administration of vitamin D to these patients will improve their inflammatory profile and
      cardiometabolic risk factors (blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid profile).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supplementation with vitamin D at 150,000 IU every 3 months failed to increase serum
      25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) or alter inflammatory markers and lipids in overweight and obese
      youth. Further studies are needed to establish the dose of vitamin D required to increase
      25OHD and determine potential effects on metabolic risk factors in obese teens.

      During the course of the study, blood pressure removed from the prespecified outcome
      measures.
