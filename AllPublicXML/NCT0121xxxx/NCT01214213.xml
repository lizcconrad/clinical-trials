  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence for altered muscle activity patterns in individuals with non-specific
      chronic back pain (NSCBP). It is unknown why these alterations in activation pattern occur
      and how they may be linked to pain experience and to the development of CNSBP. The main
      objective of this study is to investigate the spatial aspects of muscle activation in
      relation to fatigue/endurance and CNSBP. A novel approach, utilizing a new multi-channel
      surface-EMG (MCsEMG) technique will be applied in this project to get insight in fundamental
      mechanisms related to motor control and fatigue/endurance. In this project data from healthy
      persons and from patients with NSCBP will be collected and analyzed. NSCBP patients will be
      compared to healthy persons. To minimize heterogeneity between groups the subject's age range
      will be from 30 - 50 years. The investigators main hypothesis is that motor control
      mechanisms of the lumbar muscles are disturbed in NSCBP patients compared to normals,
      explaining the reduced tolerance for static postures. There has been little investigation of
      the lumbar musculature with MCsEMG recordings. The lumbar musculature has a complex
      organization; many, relatively small muscles, in a restricted area. Utilizing two HDsEMG
      grids with 252 Ag/AgCl contacts will be the superior non-invasive method to investigate motor
      control mechanisms in this region, and further the investigators understanding of
      neuromuscular adaptations related to NSCBP. The project may demonstrate changes that will
      lead us to new insight and new strategies for the treatment of back pain.
