  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Open-label, single-arm, phase II study of ipilimumab in patients with spontaneous
      preexisting immune response to NY-ESO-1.

      Preclinical data suggest, that CTLA-4 blockade enhances polyfunctional T cell responses in
      patients with melanoma. Thus patients with immunological response to NY-ESO-1 might benefit
      from an anti CTLA-4 treatment.

      Eligible patients will receive 10 mg/kg ipilimumab every 3 weeks during a 10-week induction
      period, followed by a radiological assessment in week 12. Patients with clinical benefit
      (partial response, complete response or stable disease according to the immune-related
      response criteria) will continue with an ipilimumab administration every 3 months starting at
      week 24 up to week 48 until the end of the study or until disease progression,toxicities
      requiring discontinuation
