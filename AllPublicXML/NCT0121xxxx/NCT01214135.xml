    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this non-interventional study is to investigate how Seroquel XR and
      Seroquel IR are used in the clinical practice of inpatients with schizophrenia. This will be
      done by a retrospective review of medical records to evaluate patients treated with Seroquel
      XR or Seroquel IR as primary antipsychotic treatment.
