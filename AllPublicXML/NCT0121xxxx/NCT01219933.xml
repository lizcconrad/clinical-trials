  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-arm study will assess the use of glucocorticoids (GC) in daily
      clinical practice and will evaluate the dose reduction of glucocorticoids once low disease
      activity is achieved in patients with rheumatoid arthritis tre ated with GC and background
      RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) 8mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks. In the non-interventional
      phase, the use of GC in daily clinical Belgian practice will be evaluated and described. This
      period of maximum 6 mont hs will allow those patients to obtain the inclusion criteria for
      the secondary interventional phase. In the interventional phase, a systematic GC dose
      reductio n schedule will be evaluated in patients having achieved low disease activity wh ile
      receiving the same background therapy with RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg. Methyl prednisolone
      will be given from a starting dose of &gt;/= 1 mg to &lt;/=20 mg orally d aily and will be tapered
      down. The anticipated study duration is up to 13 months

          <description>Participants received tocilizumab 8 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously (IV) once every 4 weeks and methotrexate (MTX) 7.5 to 25 mg per week (mg/week; per investigator's discretion, or without MTX if intolerant) for up to 13 months. Participants also received an oral glucocorticoid (GC; no product/dose limitation) until low disease activity (LDA; defined as Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count and C-reactive protein [DAS28-CRP] less than or equal to [≤]3.2), up to a maximum of 6 months. Once LDA achieved, GC was switched to methylprednisolone (MP) tablets, by mouth (PO). MP dose determined by recalculating original GC dose to obtain an equivalent MP dose (had to be greater than or equal to [≥]1 mg and ≤20 mg per day [mg/day]), which was administered for 4 weeks. If LDA continued after 4 weeks, MP dose was reduced over the following 6 months per protocol-defined dose reduction schedule to reach 0 mg within 6 months for a maximum duration of 7 months of MP treatment</description>

        <title>Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) During the Noninterventional Phase</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is a self-reported, valid assessment of functional disability in RA. Assessed based on ability of participants to perform daily activities in 8 categories: dressing, arising, eating, walking, reaching, gripping, hygiene, and carrying out daily activities. HAQ-DI score range: 0-3: without any difficulty=0, with some difficulty=1, with much difficulty=2, unable to do=3. HAQ total scores expressed as overall mean score with range 0-3: 0-0.25=normal functioning; 0.25-0.5=mild functional limitation; 0.5-1=moderate functional limitation; more than 1=significant functional limitation. Timepoint was V2, or before V2 for participants withdrawn before V2.</description>

Participants also received GC (no product/dose limitation) until LDA (defined as DAS28-CRP ≤3.2), up to a maximum of 6 months. Once LDA achieved, GC was switched to MP tablets, PO. MP dose determined by recalculating original GC dose to obtain an equivalent MP dose (had to be ≥1 mg and ≤20 mg/day), which was administered for 4 weeks. If LDA continued after 4 weeks, MP dose was reduced over the following 6 months per protocol-defined dose reduction schedule to reach 0 mg within 6 months for a maximum duration of 7 months of MP treatment.</description>

        <title>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score During the Interventional Phase</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The larger the participant’s response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participant’s fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant’s response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-F score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). V3, CV, and the change from V3 to CV was determined.</description>

Participants also received GC (no product/dose limitation) until LDA (defined as DAS28-CRP ≤3.2), up to a maximum of 6 months. Once LDA achieved, GC was switched to MP tablets, PO. MP dose determined by recalculating original GC dose to obtain an equivalent MP dose (had to be ≥1 mg and ≤20 mg/day), which was administered for 4 weeks. If LDA continued after 4 weeks, MP dose was reduced over the following 6 months per protocol-defined dose reduction schedule to reach 0 mg within 6 months for a maximum duration of 7 months of MP treatment.</description>

        <description>36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well-being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. These 8 aspects can also be summarized as physical and mental component scores (PCS and MCS). Total of 11 variables were analyzed (8 subscales, 2 composite subscales and Question 2 “how would you rate your health in general now?” (range 1= better, 5= worst). The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). Higher scores reflect higher quality of life. V3, CV, and the change from V3 to CV was determined.</description>

        <title>SF-36 Subscale Scores During the Interventional Phase</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well-being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. These 8 aspects can also be summarized as physical and mental component scores (PCS and MCS). Total of 11 variables were analyzed (8 subscales, 2 composite subscales and Question 2 “how would you rate your health in general now?” (range 1= better, 5= worst). The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). Higher scores reflect higher quality of life. V3, CV, and the change from V3 to CV was determined.</description>

            <description>Participants received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV once every 4 weeks and MTX 7.5 to 25 mg/week per investigator's discretion, or without MTX if intolerant) for up to 13 months. Participants also received GC (no product/dose limitation) until LDA (defined as DAS28-CRP ≤3.2), up to a maximum of 6 months. Once LDA achieved, GC was switched to MP tablets, PO. MP dose determined by recalculating original GC dose to obtain an equivalent MP dose (had to be ≥1 mg and ≤20 mg/day), which was administered for 4 weeks. If LDA continued after 4 weeks, MP dose was reduced over the following 6 months per protocol-defined dose reduction schedule to reach 0 mg within 6 months for a maximum duration of 7 months of MP treatment.</description>

Participants also received GC (no product/dose limitation) until LDA (defined as DAS28-CRP ≤3.2), up to a maximum of 6 months. Once LDA achieved, GC was switched to MP tablets, PO. MP dose determined by recalculating original GC dose to obtain an equivalent MP dose (had to be ≥1 mg and ≤20 mg/day), which was administered for 4 weeks. If LDA continued after 4 weeks, MP dose was reduced over the following 6 months per protocol-defined dose reduction schedule to reach 0 mg within 6 months for a maximum duration of 7 months of MP treatment.</description>

          <description>Participants received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV once every 4 weeks and MTX 7.5 to 25 mg/week according to local standard of care and at the investigator's discretion (or without MTX if intolerant) for up to 13 months. Participants also received GC (no product/dose limitation) until LDA (defined as DAS28-CRP ≤3.2), up to a maximum of 6 months.</description>

          <title>Interventional Phase</title>
          <description>All participants who maintained LDA from V2 to V3 were included in the interventional phase for reduction of GC. Once LDA achieved, GC was switched to MP tablets, PO. MP dose determined by recalculating original GC dose to obtain an equivalent MP dose (had to be ≥1 mg and ≤20 mg/day), which was administered for 4 weeks. If LDA continued after 4 weeks, MP dose was reduced over the following 6 months per protocol-defined dose reduction schedule to reach 0 mg within 6 months for a maximum duration of 7 months of MP treatment.</description>
