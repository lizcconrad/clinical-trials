      An observational and multicenter study to assess the effectiveness and safety of Glucobay®- M
      under daily life treatment of type-2 diabetes patients.The study objectives are to
      investigate the effectiveness and safety of Glucobay® -M on blood glucose and patients body -
      weight. Glucobay®- M is taken 1-3 times daily. All patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,
      where investigator feels that addition of Glucobay®-M would be beneficial to patients will be
