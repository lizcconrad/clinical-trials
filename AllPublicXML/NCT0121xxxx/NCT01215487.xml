  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib (IM) is first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase.
      The drug is associated with high rates of cytogenetic responses with minimal toxicity in
      approximately 80% of patients. In 20% of patients however, the disease is either initially
      unresponsive to IM (Imatinib), resistance develops within a few months, or blast crisis
      occurs early and unexpectedly following an initial response. An increasing body of clinical
      evidence indicates that single agent molecularly targeted therapy (as in Gleevec/Imatinib)
      will not cure most patients with CML, as molecular remissions are rare. There is currently no
      clinically useful predictive tests to identify AT DIAGNOSIS those patients who are destined
      to be IM failures. The authors of this study have recently demonstrated that CML
      stem/progenitor cells are biologically insensitive to IM and are also genetically unstable
      and rapidly generate IM-resistant mutants in vitro and in vivo. The team recently discovered
      that the CD34 stem/progenitor cells of newly diagnosed CML patients who subsequently fail to
      respond to IM treatment show a reduced response to IM and a higher frequency of BCR-ABL
      mutations by comparison of 14 IM non-responders with 11 IM-responders. If this finding can be
      validated in a larger prospective cohort of patients, this predictive test could be used to
      more rationally design treatment plans with early addition of alternative therapies ie:
      Dasatinib or combination therapies for patients according to their individual risk profiles.

      Hypothesis:

      The clinical response of newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients to IM can be predicted by
      certain biological properties of their CD34 stem/progenitor cells which are variable among
      patients.

      level of expression of BCR-ABL, OCT1, ABCB1/MDR and ABCG2 transcripts in their CD34+ cells
      and the frequency of mutant BCR-ABL transcripts in the same cells. The cells are cultured for
