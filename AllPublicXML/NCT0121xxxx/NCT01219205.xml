  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although it is important in the clinical management to classify BRVO into subtypes based on
      the location of the occlusion (major or macular), few studies have provided such
      information[8,9]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with macular
      edema due to Branch retinal vein occlusion who were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab
      injection and to determine the concentrations of cytokines in the aqueous humor according to
      the site of the occlusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Branch retinal vein occlusion is the second most frequent major retinal vascular disease
      after diabetic retinopathy. One of the main reasons for visual loss in BRVO is the
      development of macular edema. Treatment options for BRVO include grid laser treatment,
      intravitreal injection of steroids, surgical procedures, and off-label treatment with
      intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents. During recent years,
      intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment with bevacizumab has been shown to efficiently reduce
      macular edema and improve visual acuity in numerous case series and prospective or
      retrospective studies.

    <description>Intravitreal injections of bevacizumab were performed under sterile conditions in the operating room. a 27-gauge needle was inserted through the corneal limbus to withdraw 0.05 ml of aqueous humor and soften the globe. Then, 1.25 mg (0.05 ㎖) of bevacizumab was injected into the vitreous in the superior temporal quadrant with a 30-gauge needle that was inserted into the eye 3.5 mm from the limbus. The postoperative medications included topical antibiotics.</description>
