    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is
      effective in the treatment of suicidal thinking in individuals with a depressive episode and
      either posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), history of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), or
      both conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that depression in general, and suicidal ideation in particular, results
      from a dysfunctional regulatory pathway involving prefrontal cortical governance over limbic
      activity. Repeated daily non-invasive stimulation of the prefrontal cortex with TMS would
      theoretically strengthen and reset this cortical control pathway and reduce suicidal ideation
      and restore healthy circuit behavior.

      The aim of the current study is to assess the efficacy of TMS therapy in the treatment of
      suicidal ideation in patients with depressive episode(s) and either PTSD or mild TBI or both.
      It is hypothesized that participants who receive repetitive TMS (Group 1) relative to sham
      treatment (Group 2) three times daily over three days will evidence more improvement in
      suicidal ideation from baseline to the end of day 3. Participants will be followed for six
      months following treatment to assess safety and long-term efficacy of TMS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Veteran inpatients aged 18-70 years inclusive, with a depressive episode.

          2. Must also have either or both

               1. a diagnosis of PTSD as defined by DSM-IV supported by the SCID, or

               2. a diagnosis of mild TBI, either complicated (i.e., with imaging abnormalities) or
                  uncomplicated, as defined by INTRuST criteria. The American Congress of
                  Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) definition of mild TBI will be utilized for this
                  study (Kay et al., 1993). That definition will be operationalized using the
                  INTRuST Screening Instrument.

          3. Admitted because of suicidal ideation.

          4. SSI score &gt; 12.

          5. HRSD question #3 &gt; 3.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test.

          7. Comorbid (non-principal) diagnoses of psychiatric disorders not explicitly listed in
             the following Exclusion Criteria section are generally permitted (with final
             eligibility determination by Site Principal Investigator clinical assessment).

          8. Subjects must be able to speak English and complete study forms, adhere to treatment
             regimens, and be willing to return for regular visits.

          9. After full explanation of the study, subjects must demonstrate their willingness to
             participate by signing the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have clinically unstable medical disease (cardiovascular, renal,
             gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, other); CNS disease deemed
             progressive; moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients with mild TBI,
             however, will not be excluded from study participation. The ACRM definition of mild
             TBI will be utilized for this study (Kay et al., 1993). That definition will be
             operationalized using the INTRuST TBI Screening Instrument.

          2. Females who are pregnant or currently breast feeding.

          3. Current or history of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder (except psychosis NOS
             when the presence of sensory hallucinations are clearly related to the subject's
             trauma), bipolar Type I disorder, or dementia (vascular, Alzheimer's disease, other
             types). Patients with bipolar Type II disorder will not be excluded.

          4. Subjects who repeatedly abused or were dependent upon drugs (excluding nicotine and
             caffeine) within 6 days of study entry will be excluded, (with the exception of
             alcohol abuse which, at the discretion of the primary site investigator, may be
             permitted*).

          5. Subjects actively participating (or planning to enroll) in an evidence-based
             exposure/cognitive treatment for PTSD during the trial, or who have been enrolled in
             one during the past 6 weeks; participation in other psychotherapeutic modalities must
             have been stable for 3 months prior to enrollment and remain stable throughout
             participation.

          6. Subjects currently taking medications that have short half-lives, lower the seizure
             threshold, and do not have evidence of antidepressant efficacy. These include high
             dose theophylline, or stimulants such as methylphenidate. Patients taking buproprion
             have to be on a stable dose and take less than or equal to 300 mg/day. Stable means
             the same dose for 5 half-lives.

          7. Subjects with metal in their head (other than dental implants), implanted devices in
             their head (shunts, cochlear implants).

          8. Subjects with a history of seizures or a seizure disorder.

          9. Subjects with borderline personality disorder or who have clear evidence of secondary
             gain as a reason for admission.
