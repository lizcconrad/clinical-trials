      This is a Prospective Interventional, non-comparative study in 20 consecutive patients who
      will be selected from the outpatient services. After taking an informed consent, the patients
      will be given intravitreal Pegaptanib 0.3 mg every 6 weeks for 3 procedure of injection.
      Thereafter, patients will continue to be examined every 6 weeks (± 2 weeks) and of may
      receive additional injections as needed based on the presence of one or more re-treatment
      criteria (please see below). Final assessment will be done at 54 weeks and all the baseline
      investigations will be performed.
