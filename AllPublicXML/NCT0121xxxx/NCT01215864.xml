  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation study of TCD-717, a novel drug that is a specific inhibitor
      of the enzyme choline kinase alpha, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The objectives of
      this study are to evaluate the safety of the drug and to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      and appropriate dose for phase II studies. Secondary objectives are to measure the efficacy
      of TCD-717; and in a substudy to be conducted in the MTD confirmation cohort only, to
      evaluate the potential correlation between the levels of tumor choline and tumor response to
      the choline kinase alpha inhibitor, TCD-717, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
      Pharmacokinetics analysis will be performed on patients enrolled in the maximum tolerated
      dose confirmation cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TCD Pharma has developed TCD-717, a novel drug that is a specific inhibitor of the enzyme
      choline kinase alpha (ChoKα), involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, which
      constitutes the major phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes and has been described as a
      potent oncogen when overexpressed in human cells. TCD-717 will be evaluated in this Phase I,
      open-label, single arm study to be performed at multiple centers. TCD-717 will be
      administered as a 4 hour infusion on two separate days per 7-day period per 28-day cycle (8
      administrations per cycle). Eligible patients must have confirmed, metastatic or
      recurrent/refractory solid tumors.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically-confirmed solid tumors, metastatic or recurrent and
             refractory after standard therapy for the disease or for which conventional therapy is
             not reliably effective or no effective therapy is available.

          2. Where possible, it is recommended that a paraffin block of tumor tissue or slides
             containing sections of tumor tissue be available (a sample should be collected and
             stored appropriately for the potential evaluation of choline kinase alpha expression
             in tumor tissue at the end of the study).

          3. Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          4. Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1 or 2 and an estimated life
             expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks.

          5. Patients must have adequate clinical laboratory values (i.e., absolute neutrophil
