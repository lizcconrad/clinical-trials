  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omega-3 fatty acids have been associated with a decline in inflammation. As dry eye disease
      is associated with inflammation of the ocular surface (DEWS report, Ocular Surface, 2007),
      the investigators hypothesize that the omega-3 fatty acid supplements used in this study will
      help to improve dry eye signs, such as eye surface irritation (staining) and tear film
      osmolarity, which is an overall measure of tear film stability and dry eye status. Further,
      the investigators hypothesize that dry eye symptoms, the end result of dry eye disease, such
      as discomfort and burning, will also improve with supplementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry Eye is a disorder of the tear film due to tear deficiency or excessive tear evaporation
      which causes damage to the exposed ocular surface and is associated with symptoms of ocular
      discomfort. If left untreated, severe dry eyes can lead to desiccation of the corneal
      epithelium, increased discomfort and sometimes loss of vision. Abundant evidence from animal
      models and clinical evaluations confirm that inflammation is an integral part of all moderate
      and severe Dry Eye Disease (DED) states and is likely to be significant in the pathogenesis
      leading to the chronicity of DED. Omega-3 essential fatty acids (EFAs) have been shown to
      have anti-inflammatory effects and inhibit multiple aspects of inflammatory response.

      DED is a common and growing problem as our population ages, causing chronic pain and visual
      disturbance that is not adequately treated with current approaches. If left untreated, severe
      dry eyes can lead to desiccation of the corneal epithelium, increased discomfort and
      sometimes loss of vision.The benefits are the possibility of alleviating or eliminating these
      symptoms of DED and the clinical data that will be gained on the safety and efficacy of
      omega-3s, which are already being marketed over-the-counter for the treatment of DED without
      any hard scientific data. The potential benefits of treatment outweigh the minimal risk of
      participation.

      This study hopes to discover more about the efficacy and tolerability of omega-3 EFA's in the
      treatment of dry eye and ocular surface disease.

    <measure>Change in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks into treatment, 8 weeks into treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Based on previous unpublished work by our group (and others), it is suggestive that a 10 unit change in OSDI score may be clinically meaningful. There currently is no accepted survey instrument to monitor change in DED clinical trials, although the OSDI has wide acceptance clinically. This study will help define what unit of change may be clinically and statistically acceptable for future trials.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Osmolarity (TearLab) value</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TearLab also has limited use in DED clinical trials. Our best estimate of a clinically meaningful change is 7 mOsm/kg (reported dry eye, 315mOsm/kg - reported normal, 308 mOsm/kg). Again, as this has never been assessed, these results here are pilot in nature.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Staining scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in average staining scores (average of 5 corneal regions; 6 conjunctival regions) and sum staining scores will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>This portion of the study is exploratory in nature. iTRAQ proteomics using mass spectrometry and RayBiotech quantibody microarrays will be used evaluate changes in inflammatory mediators for future biomarker search and pathway analysis.</description>
