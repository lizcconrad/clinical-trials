      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate dose proportionality of fluticasone furoate (FF)
      and equivalence of vilanterol (VI)following single dose administration of FF/VI via the novel
      dry powder inhaler in healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      The study will be an open-label, randomised, 3-way cross-over single dose study in 24 healthy
      subjects to demonstrate dose proportionality of fluticasone furoate (FF) and equivalence of
      vilanterol (VI) following single dose administration of FF/VI via the novel dry powder
      inhaler. In each of 3 treatment periods, subjects will receive 4 inhalations of 50/25 mcg,
      100/25 mcg, 200/25 mcg FF/VI. Blood samples will be taken for pharmacokinetic analysis and
      safety (12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory test, vital signs, adverse events) will be
      monitored following each dose.
