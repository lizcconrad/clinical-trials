    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of a pacemaker device used in heart failure
      patients which is called Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT). Specifically the
      investigators aim to investigate if the CRT pacemaker has an effect on breathing stability in
      these patients and particularly breathing stability at night. Our theory is that the CRT
      pacemaker may improve the stability of breathing in patients with heart failure.

      AIM To investigate the effect of Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) on chemosensitivity
      in patients with Chronic Heart Failure with and without Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB).

      OBJECTIVE To conduct a physiological observational study to measure hypercapnic ventilatory
      responses in a group of CHF patients before and 3 months after implantation of clinically
      indicated CRT devices. Additionally to conduct nocturnal polysomnography to establish if any
      change in chemosensitivity is related to the presence of SDB at baseline and, where present,
      any change in SDB after implantation.

      HYPOTHESIS Primary hypothesis: CRT implantation will be associated with a reduction in the
      hypercapnic ventilatory response from baseline to 3 months post implantation.

      Additional hypothesis: This reduction in hypercapnic ventilatory response after CRT
      implantation will be greatest in those CHF patients with SDB at baseline.
