      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and performance of
      the Suprachoroidal Dissection Instrument in creating a fistula between Schlemm's canal and
      the suprachoroidal space in refractory, open angle glaucoma subjects.

    <textblock>
      The Suprachoroidal Dissection Instrument (SDI) is a manually operated surgical instrument
      designed for use within Schlemm's canal. The instrument can access Schlemm's canal through a
      small ab-externo dissection, allowing use in eyes with scarring due to previous surgery or
      trauma.

    <description>The Suprachoroidal Dissection Instrument (SDI) is a manually operated, non-powered, re-usable ophthalmic surgical instrument. The SDI is designed to enter a surgically exposed Schlemm's canal and be advanced up to 90 degrees around the canal from the entry site.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Available for up to 3 years follow-up.

          -  Diagnosed with primary open-angle, pseudoexfoliative, or pigmentary glaucoma or more
             than one glaucoma diagnosis of these types.

          -  Subject scheduled to undergo glaucoma surgery with the Suprachoroidal Dissection
             Instrument involving creation of fistula between Schlemm's canal and the
             suprachoroidal space without combined cataract surgery.

          -  Subject has failed at least one incisional glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy, tube
             shunt, deep sclerectomy, viscocanalostomy, canaloplasty) or angle surgery (Trabectome)
             OR Is not a candidate for conventional glaucoma surgery due to reasons such as the
             presence of scleral buckle or compromised conjunctiva.

          -  Subject has IOP ≥ 16 mm Hg on maximally tolerated medications within the six week (-42
             days) period prior to surgery.

          -  Visual field defect defined as mean deviation (MD) score worse than or equal to -10 dB
             on the Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm [SITA] Standard 24-2 Humphrey Analysis
             during the 6 month period prior to surgery. OR Subject has vertical cup-to-disk ratio
             ≥ 0.75 during the 6 month period prior to surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant lens opacities or patient is candidate for cataract surgery during the
             duration of the study.

          -  The patient had developmental glaucoma or a secondary glaucoma including
             steroid-induced, uveitic, or neovascular glaucoma (with the exception of pigmentary
             and pseudoexfoliative glaucoma).

          -  The patient has narrow angle component possibly associated with glaucoma in the
             operative eye.

          -  The subject has angle recession in the operative eye.

          -  Significant ocular disease other than glaucoma affecting the assessment of visual
             function.
