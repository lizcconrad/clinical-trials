  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal sepsis (serious infection) continues to be one of the major causes of morbidity and
      mortality in the newborn period around the world. India, with one of the world's largest
      populations, continues to struggle with extremely high infant and neonatal mortality rates.
      Sepsis accounts for 50% of deaths among community born (and 20% of mortality among
      hospital-born) infants. Closely linked with this is a burgeoning problem of antimicrobial
      resistance, which is increasingly restricting the therapeutic options for medical care
      providers. Friendly bacteria called &quot;Probiotics&quot; have been used in multiple infectious and
      inflammatory disease states in humans. Fructooligosaccharides are sugars found naturally in
      many fruits and vegetables and also in human breast milk. These sugars reach the colon
      undigested and serve as food for the friendly bacteria. The current study uses a probiotic
      preparation containing Lactobacillus plantarum and fructooligosaccharides as an attempt to
      prevent neonatal infections. Currently no conclusive data are available on the utility of
      probiotics in such conditions. If successful, such inexpensive preventive therapy can be made
      available to general public in resource poor countries. Similar preparations can also be used
      in the western world to prevent similar infectious conditions of the neonatal period,
      especially in preterm infants where sepsis continues to be a major cause of hospital stay and
      death.

      Our current study is an attempt to put the well known concept of probiotics through rigorous
      scientific testing before it could be recommended as a prophylactic therapy against neonatal
      infections. The study will be conducted in India in 8,442 infants who will receive once daily
      dosing of probiotics for one week. They will be followed for 60 days at home. We have
      designed the study with enough power to detect a 20% drop in the incidence rate and plan to
      collect multiple other demographic data from the mothers and infants to help us discern the
      possible contribution of other confounding risk factors that have been implicated as
      cofactors in neonatal infection and death.

      This will be a randomized controlled clinical trial involving probiotics (Lactobacillus
      plantarum 10 billion bacteria and 150 mg of fructo-oligosaccharide). We will use our well
      established three tier monitoring system in the villages. Infants with any adverse event
      (including sepsis and other infections) will be brought to attached study hospitals for
      clinical care. Blood and/or CSG culture will be done using Bactec blood culture system and
      treatment will be provided based on clinical judgment and microbiological analysis of the
      blood/CSF and/or other findings such as chest X-ray. Data entry will be done on site and
      transmitted to the principal investigator's institution in the U.S. A data safety monitoring
      board convened by expert clinicians, neonatologists, and biostatisticians will monitor the
      study yearly and more frequently if required. Analyzed data will be published in appropriate
      journals.
