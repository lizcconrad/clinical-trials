  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the ability to assess the genetic differences (DNA
      fingerprinting) on polar bodies (excess genetic material given off from the egg) and cells so
      that this technique may be used in the future to confirm markers of reproductive competence
      and improve the efficiency and safety of clinical human in vitro fertilization.

    <textblock>
      Our group has recently validated a technique involving whole genomic amplification followed
      by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis which allows DNA fingerprinting of single
      cells. Given that there are more than 3.3 billion base pairs that constitute the human
      genome, there are approximately 3 million sites where routine variation in the genetic code
      exists. These SNPs have been identified on average to occur approximately once every 1000
      base pairs (bp) and are present on all chromosomes.

      100 couples will undergo routine in vitro fertilization (IVF) stimulation, the protocol to be
      determined by the patient's primary doctor. Following oocyte retrieval and intracytoplasmic
      sperm injection (ICSI), the first polar body will be biopsied using standard laboratory
      procedures, and sent for genetic analysis. 24 hours later, the second polar body will be
      biopsied and sent for genetic analysis. Finally, the embryos will be biopsied prior to
      transfer and the cell will be sent for gentic analysis. Genetic results are not available
      prior to transfer and there are be no delays in the treatment schedule as a result of the
      study. Buccal swabs are collected from infants. SNP profiles are created from the polar body
      and embryo biopsies which are then compared to the SNP profiles created from the buccal
      swabs.
