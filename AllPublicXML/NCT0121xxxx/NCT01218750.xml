    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety end efficacy of combined
      phakoemulsification and vitrectomy with retinal endophotocoagulation and intraoperative use
      of bevacizumab in patients with diffuse diabetic macular edema (DDME), to determine the
      possible preoperative and intraoperative factors that might influence surgical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of the diabetic macular edema is multiple. Therefore treatment of this
      disease should be combined too. VEGF is involved in pathogenesis of diabetic macular edema
      and recently anti-VEGF agents such as bevacizumab have been shown to be beneficial in the
      treatment of this retinal disorder. However, endogenous VEGF is required for visual function.
      Growing body evidence indicates that VEGF acts also on nonvascular cells, it plays survival
      role on Muller cells and photoreceptors. Therefore anti-VEGF therapies should be administered
      with caution and not persistent. Photocoagulation in nonperfused areas eliminate increased
      production of VEGF, proliferation of RPE and increased production of PEDF in surrounded
      impact laser area. Vitrectomy with ILM peeling reliefs traction on the macula, improve
      oxygenation of the macula leading to decreased vascular permeability with subsequent
      resolution or decrease in DME. Removed ILM contains a part of the Müller cell endfeet and the
      horizontal gliosis. It is likely that the proliferation of GFAP-stained gliofibrils, observed
      in microdamaged Müller cells, preserves the blood-retinal barrier, reinforces architectural
      cohesion, and opposes the installation of the edema. Therefore, we made hypothesis that
      combined triple therapy was effective for decreasing macular thickness and improvement of
      vision for eyes with diffuse diabetic macular edema.

      It is important for the surgeon to determine the factors that might influence surgical
      outcome so that patients are chosen for the procedure that they can get benefit from.
      Therefore, we evaluated the possible preoperative and intraoperative factors that might
      influence surgical outcomes

    <description>Diabatic maculopathy comes to the edematous or tractional form. It is believed that epiretinal membranes are comprised from glial components. The processes of these cells may invade through the internal limiting membrane of the retina to the vitreous causing the vitreoretinal adhesion and anomalous posterior detachment of vitreous (APVD). In the macula, APVD causes vitreo-macular traction syndrome, which results in diffuse diabetic macular edema. If vitreoschisis is present, a place of dissection is crucial. If break occurs in front of the hyalocytes remaining on the retinal surface, the vitreous layer is thick and easily shrinks concentrically, which results in the formation of epimacular membrane.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Triple therapy for diffuse diabetic macular edema</intervention_name>
    <description>Three port pars plana vitrectomy is performed by one surgeon (JR). Induction of PVD is initiated by active suction with the vitrectomy probe over the ONH and continued peripherally. Peeling of the epimacular tissue and ILM is performed by grasping the flap of the ILM with an eckhardts forceps. Trypan Blue is used to stain the ILM. Peripheral laser endophotocoagulation is performed in cases of avascular areas based on FA, active neovascularization, peripheral retinoschisis or retinal breaks. All eyes have a 1,25 mg/0,05 ml bevacizumab injection into vitreous cavity and SF6 gas tamponade at the end of the procedure. Even of absence of cataract formation, a combined procedure is performed because of exactly peripheral vitreous shaving and prevention of cataract formation.</description>
