  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) has been used
      for several years as a non invasive imaging technique to study tumor hypoxia. Several
      experimental and clinical studies have indicated that FMISO uptake of tissues is correlated
      with tissue oxygen tension and that FMSO PET allows non-invasive differentiation between
      hypoxic and normoxic tumors. Currently, FMISO-PET represents the best characterized and
      validated noninvasive hypoxia imaging technique. Nevertheless, clinical studies have also
      shown the limitations of FMISO PET. Accumulation of FMISO in hypoxic tumors is relatively
      low, resulting in a low contrast between hypoxic tumors and surrounding normal tissues. In
      addition, imaging needs to be started relatively late after tracer injection (about 3 hours
      post-injection), when a significant percentage of the fluorine-18 label has already decayed
      and the count statistics of the PET images are relatively low. Because of these limitations,
      FMISO PET is still only used at a few research centers, despite high clinical interest in
      hypoxia imaging.

      Objective of the study

      The aim of this study is to:

        -  evaluate a hypoxia imaging agent, HX4, in patients with solitary tumors (i.e., locally
           advanced head and neck cancer)

        -  gain information on bio-distribution of [F-18]HX4

        -  compare the PET images of [F-18] FMISO to [F-18]HX4 for resolution, signal to background
           ratio, and tumor/blood ratio
