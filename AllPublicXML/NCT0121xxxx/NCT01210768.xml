      Primary objective:

        -  To evaluate the disease-free survival (DFS) in the two randomized arms after therapy
           with LC vs. EC in chemo-naive Her2-patients with stage I or II breast cancer

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess the overall survival (OS)

        -  To establish the safety profile by assessing the toxicities and tolerability

        -  To assess the quality of life (QoL)

        -  To evaluate survival correlation with biomarkers expression.
