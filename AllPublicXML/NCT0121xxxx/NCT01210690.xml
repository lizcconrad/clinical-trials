    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to broaden the knowledge of the known safety and
      efficacy profile of Keppra® (Levetiracetam) oral solution in epileptic infants younger than
      12 months when treated according to routine clinical practice. Their data will be collected
      until they reach the age of 13 months.

      This non-interventional sentinel sites post-authorization safety study (PASS) aims to collect
      additional data on use of Keppra® (Levetiracetam) oral solution in clinical practice, and on
      efficacy and safety of Keppra® (Levetiracetam) in infants younger than12 months. Epileptic
      patients between the age of 1 month and 11 months inclusive can be invited for participation
      to the non-interventional sentinel sites PASS, after the physician has decided to initiate
      therapy with Keppra® (Levetiracetam) oral solution (100 mg/ml bottle) and patient has so far
      been treated with Keppra® (Levetiracetam) for no longer than 10 days. The patients will be
      followed and their data will be collected until they reach the age of 13 months.

    <time_frame>From Baseline to the last Treatment Visit (maximum 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of patients with presence of deviation from the normal milestones of psychomotor development during the Treatment Period (maximum 12 months). The treating physician evaluated at each visit, as part of standard clinical practice, the psychomotor development of the patient. The evaluation of the patient's psychomotor development was categorized by the motor development, the social development and the language development.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to the safety follow-up visit (maximum treatment period is 12 months plus 2-week safety follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>For each visit, body weight was measured and standardization for gender and age was performed based on WHO growth charts to obtain z-scores. For this outcome measure, the mean of the differences of individual body weight z-scores from Safety Follow-up Visit to Baseline was determined.</description>

    <description>For each visit, body length was measured and age standardization was performed based on WHO growth charts to obtain z-scores. For this outcome measure, the difference of body length z-scores from Safety Follow-up Visit to Baseline was determined and averaged across the study population.</description>

    <description>Number of patients with abnormalities noted during physical examination over the Treatment Period (maximum 12 months). Any abnormal findings during the physical examination during the study were reported as Adverse Events (AEs).
The Number of Patients With Abnormalities Noted During Physical Examination From Baseline to the Last Treatment Visit cannot be given because abnormalities at Screening are listed only and worsening after Screening were handled as AEs and tabulated along with the other AEs.</description>

&quot;Marked improvement,&quot; &quot;Moderate improvement,&quot; and &quot;Slight improvement&quot; were defined as &quot;Improved.&quot;
&quot;No change&quot; was defined as &quot;Stable.&quot;
&quot;Slight worsening,&quot; &quot;Moderate worsening,&quot; and &quot;Marked worsening&quot; were defined as &quot;Worsened.&quot;</description>
