  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home visits (HV) are one of the multidisciplinary approaches that has already shown to
      benefit the follow-up of Heart Failure (HF) patients. It is considered to be one of the most
      effective and humane approaches as it educates and takes care of the patient in his/her
      routine environment. In this study, the follow-up of HF patients in a home setting after
      being discharged from hospital will include the reinforcement, monitoring and re-evaluation
      of guidelines previously provided about the disease and self-care, compliance to prescribed
      medicines and, specially, the early recognition of decompensation signs and symptoms by
      patients and their caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epidemiological overview of cardiovascular diseases in which HF turns out to be the main
      cause of re-hospitalizations in the Unified Health System, which has not changed over the
      years, impairs the management of the limited resources of the public health system.
      Additionally, HF leads to substantial damage to the quality of life of patients, many of them
      at a socially productive age, resulting in early retirements and absences. In this study, the
      objective is to evaluate the impact of the follow-up of heart failure patients at home,
      interspersed with telephone contacts, by the nursing team, after hospital discharge,
      regarding knowledge of the disease, self-care skills and quality of life improvement,
      compared with the conventional follow-up of patients in a 6-month period without this
      intervention, as well as to build a mobile-technology computer structure to make the use of
      cardiology nursing evaluation forms viable; correlate sociodemographic and clinical
      characteristics with treatment compliance and re-hospitalization rates in both; and ascertain
      home follow-up costs.

      With this purpose, a two-center randomized clinical trial, blinded for the endpoints
      re-hospitalization and costs, was designed.

    <description>There will provided education about what is heart failure, its causes, how to recognize signs and symptoms, monitoring of weight and blood pressure, the importance of compliance to treatment. Patients will be instructed about the medications; a guide to rest and exercise, sexual activity, vaccines, travel and diet will be provided. The involvement of the family will be encouraged; the contact with the team should be done when: patient observes an increase of 1 or 2 kg of weight in 2-3 days, worsening of dyspnea on effort, edema in legs / abdomen, worsening of cough, persistent vomiting, syncope, sputum with blood, fever, persistent tachycardia. In phone calls made between home visits, the compliance to treatment will be evaluated and reinforced.</description>
