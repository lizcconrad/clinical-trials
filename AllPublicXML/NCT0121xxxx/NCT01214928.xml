  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is a prohormone obtained through diet, supplementation, or sun exposure. Once
      absorbed, this nutritional vitamin D undergoes a two-step reaction in the liver and in the
      kidney to become the active hormone, calcitriol. Besides the kidney, many other body tissues
      are capable of local vitamin D activation. This local tissue activity is important for
      maintenance of health and relies on adequate levels of nutritional vitamin D. Not only are
      dialysis patients deficient in calcitriol due to kidney failure, but they are also deficiency
      in nutritional vitamin D. Low levels of vitamin D have been associated with higher rates of
      death, heart and blood vessel disease, osteoporosis, falls, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.
      Despite this, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials (RCT) examining the effects of
      nutritional vitamin D in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The investigators hypothesize that
      long-term supplementation with nutritional vitamin D in HD patients improves survival and
      cardiovascular outcomes. Before embarking on a large scale RCT, the investigators propose a
      small pilot RCT with 20 hemodialysis patients to: i) To determine the effects of
      cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) in raising blood vitamin D levels; ii) To determine the
      feasibility and barriers to successful randomization and adherence to treatment protocols,
      which will inform subsequent studies.
