  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SQ109 was developed with the aim of shortening TB treatment and providing new drugs for
      resistant TB. The drug has demonstrated efficacy in toxicology studies and an acceptable
      safety profile in first-in-man studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      extended early bactericidal activity (EBA), safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      several doses of SQ109 with or without Rifampicin (RIF) for 14 days in adults with newly
      diagnosed, uncomplicated, smear positive, pulmonary TB.
