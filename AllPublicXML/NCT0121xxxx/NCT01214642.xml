      This study is a multi-center, non-randomized, open label, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of
      intravenous LY2523355 in patients with advanced and/or metastatic cancer (including
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) for whom no treatment of higher priority exists.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of advanced and/or metastatic cancer (solid tumors or Non-Hodgkin's
             lymphoma) that is refractory to standard therapy or for which no proven effective
             therapy exists. Participants entering Part B of the study must also have a tumor that
             is safely amenable to serial biopsies

          -  Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or Revised International Working Group
             Lymphoma Response Criteria

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             scale

          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, cancer-related hormonal therapy, or other investigational therapy for at
             least 28 days (6 weeks for mitomycin-C or nitrosoureas) prior to study enrollment

          -  Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved
             contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 3 months following the last dose of
             study drug

          -  Females with child bearing potential must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 12 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have symptomatic, untreated or uncontrolled central nervous system (CNS) metastases.
             Participants with treated CNS metastases are eligible provided their disease is
             radiographically stable, asymptomatic, and they are not currently receiving
             corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants. Screening of asymptomatic participants without
             history of CNS metastases is not required

          -  Have current acute or chronic leukemia

          -  Have had an autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplant

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating
