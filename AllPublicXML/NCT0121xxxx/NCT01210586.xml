      This study investigated whether being on transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
      influenced smoking cessation variables in postmenopausal women undergoing short-term
      abstinence from cigarettes. Women were recruited into two groups according to their
      pre-enrollment medication status - currently on HRT (n = 17) or not on HRT (n = 13). The HRT
      group had their prior medication replaced with a standard 0.1 mg estradiol transdermal system
      and 2.5 mg of Cycrin daily. Following two weeks of medication adjustment, participants
      continued smoking as usual for one week, at which time baseline measurements were taken. For
      the remaining two weeks, participants were instructed to quit smoking. They were provided
      with smoking cessation counseling and monitored for abstinence. Data were collected during
      five clinic visits on all dependent measures: Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale, Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI) Scale, Profile of Mood States, Motor Speed Tasks, and Reaction
      Time Test.

      Part II is identical to Part I, except it randomizes participants to use nicotine patch or
      not.
