    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well giving bevacizumab and combination chemotherapy
      together before surgery works in treating patients with locally advanced esophageal or
      stomach cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving bevacizumab and combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these
      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate two-year disease-free survival in patients with resectable esophageal and
      gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer treated with perioperative bevacizumab and leucovorin
      calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess, by pathological examination after surgical resection, complete and partial
      response to neoadjuvant therapy.

      II. To characterize overall and progression free survival. III. To compare baseline and
      post-chemotherapy/bevacizumab tissues for biomarkers predicting response or resistance to
      this approach.

      IV. To investigate safety in this setting.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT THERAPY: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on
      day 1. Patients also receive FOLFOX chemotherapy comprising oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours
      on days 1-2. Treatment with bevacizumab repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses and treatment
      with FOLFOX repeats every 2 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Patients then undergo planned surgical resection 4-6 weeks after 6 courses of
      chemotherapy and at least 8 weeks since the last dose of bevacizumab.

      ADJUVANT THERAPY: Beginning 8-10 weeks after surgery, patients receive bevacizumab IV,
      oxaliplatin IV, leucovorin calcium IV, and fluorouracil IV as in neoadjuvant therapy.
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
