  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to investigate the postprandial effect of arginine-rich protein (i.e.
      pea-protein) on metabolic control, inflammation and endothelial function after a high-fat
      meal in subjects with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arginine is potential interesting considering the metabolic syndrome. Studies so far
      indicated both long-term effects, as well as acute - postprandial - actions; especially when
      metabolism is already challenged, e.g. in diabetic patients or after a high-fat meal. If
      arginine-rich proteins are equally effective is not known. Therefore we are interested in the
      effect of (arginine rich) protein on postprandial (dys)metabolism, inflammation and
      endothelial function, within 6 hours after a meal.
