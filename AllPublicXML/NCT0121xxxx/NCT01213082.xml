  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that proton beam irradiation combined
      with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy is safe and potentially more effective than intravitreal
      anti-VEGF therapy alone in eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation combined with anti-VEGF therapy has been shown to be synergistic in treating cancer
      and result in sustained tumor regression. On-going clinical trials have shown potential
      synergism between intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and epiretinal brachytherapy administered
      during vitrectomy surgery in treating eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration
      (eAMD). In this study, we test the hypothesis that radiation to the macula administered
      noninvasively via proton beam is well-tolerated in eyes with eAMD when combined with
      intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and that this combination therapy may act synergistically to
      result in sustained treatment effect in eyes with eAMD.
