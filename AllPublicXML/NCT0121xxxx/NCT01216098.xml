  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of doula support on childbirth outcomes
      of women who are eligible for and attempting to have a Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC).
      Doulas are paraprofessionals who provide women with continuous physical and emotional support
      throughout the course of labour. They also conduct home visits in the prenatal and postpartum
      periods in order to provide women with information on childbirth-related topics and
      breastfeeding support. They do not perform clinical tasks. Their value lies in the
      psycho-social care that they provide. It is hypothesized that women who receive doula support
      alongside standard care will have a lower rate of epidural analgesia use and greater cervical
      dilation at time of epidural administration, as compared to those who receive standard care
      alone.

    <textblock>
      A two-armed randomized controlled trial will be conducted at BC Women's Hospital. The
      experimental group will receive both standard clinical care and doula support. The control
      group will receive standard clinical care without doula support. The main outcomes being
      looked at are use of epidural analgesia and cervical dilation at time of epidural
      administration. These outcomes have been chosen because of the association between the use of
      epidural analgesia and both a prolonged length of labour and the need for assisted deliveries
      (i.e. forceps assisted deliveries, vacuum assisted deliveries, and cesarean births). If it is
      found that providing doula support for women who are eligible for and attempting to have a
      VBAC reduces or delays the use of epidural analgesia, then it could be hypothesized that
      doula support for this population may also shorten the length of labour and reduce the need
      for assisted deliveries, thereby justifying ongoing research in this area.

Use of narcotic analgesia during labour (type and amount).
Number of visits to the assessment room before admission.
Mode of delivery (cesarean section, spontaneous vaginal, or forceps/vacuum).
Indication(s) for repeat cesarean (if applicable).
Length of time between admission and the start of active pushing.
Length of time between the start of active pushing and delivery.
Length of time between delivery and discharge.</description>
