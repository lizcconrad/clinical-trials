      RATIONALE: Reflexology and aromatherapy massage may lessen symptoms in patients with cancer.
      It is not yet known whether reflexology is more effective than aromatherapy massage in
      relieving symptoms in patients with cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying reflexology to see how well it works
      compared with aromatherapy massage in relieving symptoms in patients with cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine whether reflexology is as effective as aromatherapy massage for alleviation
           of self-selected symptoms in patients with cancer in an outpatient setting.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the difference between the two therapies with respect to Visual Analogue
           Scale (VAS) relaxation scores before and after each treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to gender (male vs female), treatment
      (chemotherapy vs other) and their first concern choice (pain vs other). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (Reflexology): Patients undergo 45-60 minutes of reflexology for 4 sessions.

        -  Arm II (Aromatherapy massage): Patients undergo 45-60 minutes of of aromatherapy massage
           for 4 sessions.

      Patients complete questionnaires (Measure Yourself Concerns and Well-being [MYCAW]
      questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) at baseline, before and after each session,
      and after completion of all four sessions.
