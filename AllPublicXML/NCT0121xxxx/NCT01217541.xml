  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a serious health problem showing an increasing prevalence rate with increasing
      age. In Norway, about 80% of nursing home patients have dementia. The mean age of nursing
      home residents in Norway is around 84 years. Disruptive and agitated behaviour affect 30-50%
      of all individuals with dementia at some point in the course of the illness. In addition,
      they have a combination of physical and psychological diseases which necessitates a close
      collaboration between different specialities in medicine and Old Age psychiatry. In
      collaboration with the communalities, our Old Age psychiatry services want to provide a new
      approach to this challenge and validate it on patient and personnel level.
