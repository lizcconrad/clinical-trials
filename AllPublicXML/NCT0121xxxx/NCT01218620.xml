      This randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 in treating
      patients with advanced solid tumors. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the extent that RO4929097 induces its own metabolism using a 20mg dose on
      Regimen I and a 50mg dose on Regimen II by comparing Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 10 plasma
      pharmacokinetic parameters.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of the strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole, on RO4929097
      plasma pharmacokinetics.

      II. To evaluate the effect of the strong inducer of CYP3A4, 2D6 and 2C9, rifampin on
      RO4929097 plasma pharmacokinetics.

      III. To evaluate the effect of RO4929097 on the plasma pharmacokinetics of CYP450 substrates;
      midazolam (CYP3A4), omeprazole (CYP2C19), tolbutamide (CYP2C9) and dextromethorphan (CYP2D6)
      after single dose and chronic administration.

      IV. To assess the influence of polymorphisms in CYP3A4, 3A5, 2C9, ABCB1, and 2D6 on RO4929097
      plasma pharmacokinetics V. To assess any evidence of clinical activity (CR, PR, SD) in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

      Regimen I (low-dose of RO4929097): Patients receive low-dose RO4929097 orally (PO) once daily
      on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and midazolam hydrochloride IV over 1 minute, omeprazole PO,
      tolbutamide PO, and dextromethorphan hydrobromide PO on days 1 and 10. After completion of
      course 1, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm A: Patients receive low-dose RO4929097 PO once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and
      ketoconazole PO once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only. For course 3 and beyond, patients
      receive low-dose RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Arm B: Patients receive low-dose RO4929097 PO once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and
      rifampin PO once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only. For course 3 and beyond, patients
      receive low-dose RO4929097 on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Regimen II (high-dose of RO4929097): Patients receive high-dose RO4929097 PO once daily on
      days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and midazolam hydrochloride IV, oral omeprazole, oral tolbutamide,
      and oral dextromethorphan hydrobromide on days 1 and 10. After completion of course 1,
      patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm A: Patients receive high-dose RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and oral
      ketoconazole once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only.

      Arm B: Patients receive high-dose RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17 and oral
      rifampin once daily on days 1-10 for course 2 only.

      In all arms, treatment with RO4929097 repeats every 21 days for &gt;= 3 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetics studies and evaluation of SNPs in CYP2D6, CYP2C9, ABCB1, and CYP3A4/5.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity; caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 concurrently
             with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; furthermore, patients who are
             taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of
             CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk;
             if such patients cannot be switched to alternative medications, they will be
             ineligible to participate in this study

          -  Caution should be exercised when dosing ketoconazole, rifampin, omeprazole, midazolam,
             tolbutamide, and dextromethorphan concurrently with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers,
             and/or inhibitors; furthermore, patients who are taking concurrent medications that
             are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 should be switched to
             alternative medications to minimize any potential risk; if such patients cannot be
             switched to alternative medications, they will be ineligible to participate in this
             study

          -  The effects of RO4929097on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because Notch signal pathway inhibitors are
             known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must use two forms of
             contraception (i.e., barrier contraception and one other method of contraception) at
             least 4 weeks prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for
             at least 12 months post-treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner are participating in this study and for 12 months
             after study participation, the patient should inform the treating physician
             immediately

          -  Women randomized to Regimen I (Arm B) and Regimen II (Arm B), and receiving rifampin
             will need to use an additional, non-hormonal birth control during cycle 2; rifampin
             induces enzymes responsible for hormone metabolism, making hormonal birth control
             ineffective; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, or radiographically evaluable metastatic
             disease (e.g. osseous metastases) with evidence of disease progression (e.g. new
             lesions or rising tumor markers)

          -  Treated, stable brain metastases are allowed; patients must be four weeks from
             radiation with stable brain imaging and off any medications used to treat brain
             metastases, excepting those anti-epileptics not metabolized by cytochrome P450

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered (=&lt; grade 1) from clinically significant adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier; prior palliative radiotherapy is allowed if
             greater than 2 weeks have elapsed and patient has also recovered to baseline or grade
             &lt; 1 from any treatment adverse effects

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to RO4929097, or other agents used in study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, and a
             history of torsades de pointes or other significant cardiac arrhythmia other than
             chronic, stable atrial fibrillation, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RO4929097 is a gamma-secretase
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with RO4929097, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with RO4929097; these potential risks may also apply to other agents
             used in this study

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RO4929097; in addition,
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia,
             hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the
             institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this
             study; Note: it is acceptable to use corrected calcium when interpreting calcium
             levels

          -  Patients must not be taking omeprazole or dextromethorphan, or be willing to take only
             the study dose and formulation on the PK days; patients who require or are likely to
             require therapeutic doses of these drugs are excluded

          -  Patients must not be taking rifampin, ketoconazole, tolbutamide, or midazolam;
             patients who require or are likely to require therapeutic doses of these drugs are
             excluded

          -  Patients must not be taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as Clorgyline,
             Iproniazid, Isocarboxazid, Moclobemide, Nialamide, Pargyline, Phenelzine,
             Procarbazine, Rasagiline, Selegiline, Teloxantrone, or Tranylcypromine because of drug
             interactions with dextromethorphan

          -  Patients must not have acute narrow-angle glaucoma or untreated open-angle glaucoma,
             as midazolam is contraindicated

          -  Baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec

          -  Patients who are serologically positive for Hepatitis A, B or C, or have a history of
             liver disease, other forms of hepatitis or cirrhosis are ineligible

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with
             intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets

          -  Because opioid containing pain medications may be metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway,
             patients should be monitored carefully to avoid toxicity and doses adjusted if
             necessary; subjects who would not tolerate adjustments in their opioid pain
             medications are excluded

          -  Subjects with a history of hypoglycemia, diabetes mellitus, or abnormal glucagon
             regulation are excluded; subjects with a current diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who
             are receiving treatment (i.e. insulin or other medication) are not eligible; a
             diagnosis of diabetes mellitus that is managed by diet is allowable

          -  Subjects with mild to severe skin exanthems are excluded

          -  A requirement for antiarrhythmics or other medications known to prolong QTc
