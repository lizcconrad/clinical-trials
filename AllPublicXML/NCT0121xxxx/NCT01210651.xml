      This was a randomized controlled pilot trial to evaluate clinical efficacy and feasibility of
      hatha yoga as a mono-therapy for major depression. Investigators recruited 38 adults in San
      Francisco meeting criteria for major depression of mild-to-moderate severity, per structured
      psychiatric interview and scores of 14-28 on Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI). At
      screening, individuals engaged in psychotherapy, antidepressant pharmacotherapy,
      herbal/nutraceutical mood therapies, or mind-body practices were excluded. Twenty
      participants were randomized to 90-minute hatha yoga practice groups twice weekly for 8
      weeks. Eighteen participants were randomized to 90-minute attention control education groups
      twice weekly for 8 weeks. Certified yoga instructors delivered both interventions at a
      university clinic. Primary outcome was depression severity, measured by BDI scores every 2
      weeks from intervention start at 0 weeks until finish at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were
      self-efficacy and self-esteem, measured by scores on the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES)
      and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) at 0 weeks and 8 weeks. Blinded assessors analyzed
      whether change in outcome measures would be statistically comparable between the two
      intervention groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, single-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel group,
      pilot trial of an 8-week hatha yoga program as mono-therapy in major depression. Recruitment
      occurred from May to October 2010, and the trial was concluded in January 2011.

      We recruited 38 adults from the San Francisco community who met criteria for major depression
      of mild-to-moderate severity, as per screening diagnostic evaluation with the Mini
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and scores of 14 through 28 on the Beck
      Depression Inventory-II (BDI). At screening, individuals engaged in psychotherapy,
      antidepressant pharmacotherapy, herbal/nutraceutical mood remedies, or any mind-body
      practices were excluded.

      Eligible participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two instructor-led
      intervention groups: a hatha yoga practice group assigned to 90-minute hatha yoga practice
      sessions twice weekly for 8 weeks, versus an attention control education group assigned to
      90-minute yoga history seminars twice weekly for 8 weeks. Participants in the hatha yoga
      group learned and practiced a specific sequence of classical yoga breathing techniques,
      mindful body postures, and a final deep relaxation pose. The attention control education
      group explored the history and philosophy of the main branches of yoga through seminars
      featuring lectures, documentary films, and interactive dialogue between instructor and
      participants; the seminars were designed to control for non-specific mood benefits of the
      hatha yoga intervention, such as attention from study personnel, peer interaction, time spent
      away from routine activities, and anticipation/interest related to mastering novel
      yoga-related information.

      Stratified block randomization was undertaken to ensure that each intervention group had
      equal numbers of participants with mild depression (per screening BDI scores of 14 to 19)
      versus moderate depression (per screening BDI scores of 20 to 28).

      Participants were informed at screening that anyone randomized to the education group would
      be offered 16 free hatha yoga classes, upon completion of the study, to learn and practice
      the same exercises taught to the hatha yoga practice group.

      The primary outcome was depression severity, measured by BDI scores at 2-week intervals from
      intervention start at 0 weeks until intervention end at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were
      self-efficacy and self-esteem, measured respectively by scores on the General Self-Efficacy
      Scale (GSES) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) at 0 weeks and at 8 weeks. Blinded
      assessors analyzed outcome data from both intervention groups, testing whether change in
      outcome measures would be statistically comparable between the two groups.

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI) is a 21-item validated instrument for the self-report of depressive symptoms, with individual item scores summed to yield a total possible BDI score that ranges from 0-63. BDI scores from 0-13 suggest absent to minimal depressive symptoms, from 14-19 mild symptoms, from 20-28 moderate symptoms, and from 29-63 severe symptoms. Regression analysis software examined the BDI scores measured in study participants every 2 wks from intervention start at 0 wks until intervention end at 8 wks, using maximum likelihood estimations to derive an adjusted mean BDI score for each intervention group at each measurement point.</description>

    <time_frame>0 wks, 8 wks</time_frame>
    <description>The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) is a 10-item, self-administered, validated psychometric instrument to measure self-efficacy, defined as the belief that one's actions are responsible for successful outcomes in coping with difficult life demands. Each item is scored from 1 to 4, with a total GSES score derived by summing the individual item scores. Possible GSES scores range from 10 (no belief in one's self-efficacy) to 40 (strongest belief in one's self-efficacy). GSES scores of study completers were examined, and the total change score on GSES was calculated for each intervention group as the mean GSES score at 0 wks subtracted from the mean GSES score at 8 wks.</description>

    <description>The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) is a 10-item, self-administered, validated psychometric instrument to measure self-esteem, defined as having an overall feeling of self-worth and self-acceptance. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, and individual item scores are summed to yield a total possible RSES ranging from 0-30. RSES scores from 0-14 suggest low self-esteem, from 15-25 normal self-esteem, and from 26-30 high self-esteem. RSES scores of study completers were examined, and the total change score on RSES was calculated for each intervention group as the mean RSES score at 0 wks subtracted from the mean RSES score at 8 wks.</description>

    <description>The hatha yoga intervention was a sequence of classical yoga practices, comprised of breathing techniques, mindful body postures, and a final deep relaxation pose. The same sequence was used in all sessions. Yoga practices were broken down into component elements and taught progressively to each student in accordance with his or her ability. Participants were encouraged to remain within their range of motion or comfort. Accommodations were made for those with limitations in tolerance or flexibility for any exercise. Blocks, bolsters and other props were used to support participants in learning and holding yoga poses safely, particularly during back-bends or inverted poses. The intervention was delivered by a licensed, registered nurse, who was also a registered yoga teacher.</description>

Seminars were designed to control for non-specific mood benefits of study participation, such as attention from instructors, peer interaction, time spent away from routine activities, and anticipation/interest related to mastering novel yoga-related information. Since participants would join the attention control group on a rolling basis, seminars were designed to function as stand-alone educational modules, rather than requiring presentation in a specific sequence. The instructor for the seminars was a registered yoga teacher.</description>

          <description>The Folstein Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) is a validated, clinician-administered instrument for assessing cognition via tests of orientation, attention, calculation, memory, and both written and spoken language. Scores from each cognitive test are summed to derive a total score ranging from 0 (worst score) to 30 (best score). Cognitive performance as measured by the MMSE varies within the population by age and educational level, but scores below 24 may suggest cognitive impairment.</description>

        <description>The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) is a 10-item, self-administered, validated psychometric instrument to measure self-efficacy, defined as the belief that oneâ€™s actions are responsible for successful outcomes in coping with difficult life demands. Each item is scored from 1 to 4, with a total GSES score derived by summing the individual item scores. Possible GSES scores range from 10 (no belief in one's self-efficacy) to 40 (strongest belief in oneâ€™s self-efficacy). GSES scores of study completers were examined, and the total change score on GSES was calculated for each intervention group as the mean GSES score at 0 wks subtracted from the mean GSES score at 8 wks.</description>
