      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients with cancer and their
      relatives may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers
      related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at blood samples collected from patients with Ewing
      sarcoma and their relatives.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify and characterize a genetic susceptibility factor to Ewing's sarcoma by
           performing a Genome-Wide Association Study with as many as possible Ewing sarcoma
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood samples are collected from patients and their relatives. Blood DNA samples are analyzed
      for susceptibility genes of Ewing Sarcoma.
