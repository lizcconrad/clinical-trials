      The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 6 months moderate intensity exercise
      training completed three times per week upon traditional and emerging cardiovascular disease
      risk factors in postmenopausal women both with and without type 2 diabetes. These risk
      factors include blood markers associated with increased risk such as cholesterol, insulin,
      glucose and markers of inflammation plus measures of body fat, heart and lung fitness,
      vascular stiffness and vascular function. The study hypothesised that moderate intensity
      exercise training would intervene in the exaggerated risk seen in women following the
      menopause, especially in those with type 2 diabetes.
