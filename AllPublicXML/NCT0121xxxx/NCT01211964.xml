      The purpose of this phase 1 study is to determine the relative bioavailability and
      pharmacokinetics following single oral dose administration of LEO 22811 solution compared to
      LEO 22811 tablet in healthy male subjects as well as to determine the effect of food on the
      single oral dose pharmacokinetics of LEO 22811 tablet in healthy male subjects.
