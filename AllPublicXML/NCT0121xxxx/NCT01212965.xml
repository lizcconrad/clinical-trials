  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pilot trial to obtain preliminary information regarding the
      safety and response rate of patients with symptomatic lymphatic malformations treated with
      oral Selenium. Information obtained in this pilot trial will be used to plan future phase 2
      clinical trials.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Selenium will be safe and efficacious in the treatment of adolescents and young adults
           with symptomatic lymphatic malformations

        -  Disease response will correlate with serum levels of selenium and blood levels of
           antioxidants essential to selenium metabolism.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The investigators chose to terminate the study due to participant attrition. Of the limited
    data evaluable, none of the patients experienced adverse events.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have clinical and radiographic features consistent with a lymphatic
             malformation (LM). Patients with combined venous lymphatic malformations (CVLM) will
             be included if the predominant componet is lymphatic based on MRI. Both macrocystic
             and microcystic LM will be eligible. Tissue biopsy is required to confirm the presence
             of an abnormal lymphatic malformation.

          -  All patients diagnosed with lymphatic malformations between 14 and 30 years of age
             will be eligible.

          -  Patients must have lymphatic malformations with potential to cause morbidity including
             one or more of the following: Lymphedema, Coagulopathy, Chronic Pain, Recurrent
             Cellulitis (&gt; 1 episodes/year), Ulceration and/or bleeding, Impairment of organ
             function, Visceral and/or bone involvement, or Disfigurement.

          -  Patients receiving previous systemic therapy, surgical, debulking, or sclerotherapy
             will be eligible eight weeks following completion of therapy if they meet all
             inclusion criteria.

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent. All institutional FDA requirements for human studies must be met.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Younger than 14 years of age or older than 30 years of age

          -  Life-threatening complications related to LM

          -  Patients with preexisting renal, hepatic, or thyroid disorders

          -  Patients receiving a daily multivitamin supplement or other natural products that
             include selenium

          -  Patients that have received previous selenium therapy will not be eligible

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
