  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild hyponatremia is the commonest electrolyte imbalance in the older population. Recently,
      association between hyponatremia and bone fractures in the ambulatory elderly has been shown.

      Mild chronic hyponatremia is causing falls and lead to hospitalisation because of attention
      deficit.

      Symptoms related to hyponatremia can be very subtle and difficult to detect clinically.
      Twenty elderly patients, retirement homes residents, with serum sodium &lt; 135mEq/L will be
      included. They will be randomised. The physician will review the drug treatment of ten
      patients in coordination with the opinion of pharmacologists. Drug treatment for ten other
      patients wil remained unchanged during the three months of inclusion.

      Useful elements of the medical records of patients randomized to the experimental arm will be
      forwarded to the Pharmacovigilance Regional Center for opinion pharmacologist. The notice,
      subject to the attention of physician of retirement homes, give rise to a therapeutic
      approach towards the patient. It will be followed by weekly monitoring of serum sodium for 4
      weeks to evaluate the impact of the intervention. Thus, the effectiveness of medical
      intervention will be evaluated by an objective biological criteria: serum sodium in the
      fourth week. Secondary endpoints will evaluate the duration of normalization of serum sodium
      and check the interest of correcting hyponatremia to improve postural capacities and
      eventually reduce the number of falls in the medium term (three months).
