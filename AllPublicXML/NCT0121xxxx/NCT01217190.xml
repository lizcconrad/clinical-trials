      The purpose of this study was to assess the single dose bioequivalence of Ondansetron OSF 8mg
      (Manufactured by MonoSol Rx, USA) with Zofran ODT® (Containing Ondansetron 8 mg)
      (Manufactured by Cardinal Heasth Blagrove, Swindon, Wiltshire, UK, SN58RU for Glaxo
      SmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, Made in England) in healthy, male and female
      adult, human study participants under fasting conditions.

      • To monitor clinical status, adverse events, laboratory investigations and to assess
      relative safety and tolerance of ondansetron formulations under fasting conditions.
