  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma usually responds to standard doses of inhaled steroids with or without additional
      therapies to control their symptoms. However, approximately 5-10% do not respond to this
      treatment strategy and are referred to as having difficult asthma. Evidence shows that this
      poor response is not always related to asthma severity with non-adherence to treatment being
      a common underlying problem, in 35% of subjects. Recognising non-adherence in the clinic is
      problematic as there is no straightforward objective test to identify it.

      Patients attending an asthma clinic whose symptoms are not controlled by standard treatment
      will be assessed for airway inflammation using fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and sputum
      analysis. These subjects will be observed taking their medication to determine if this
      reduces their level of airway inflammation. Prescription records will be used to ascertain if
      this test distinguishes those who are non-adherent with their treatment from those adults who
      have severe asthma.

      Identifying patients who are non-adherent to treatment will allow an appropriate change in
      management and enable alternative strategies to be developed to tackle non-adherence in this
      population. Distinguishing patients who are adherent to treatment but have therapy resistant
      disease would significantly improve treatment effectiveness in this group by allowing these
      patients to be suitably targeted with expensive novel therapies such as Omalizumab.

      Hypothesis:

      In a difficult asthma population, a significant reduction in fractional exhaled nitric oxide
      (FeNO) or sputum eosinophils after a directly observed inhaled steroid challenge will
      distinguish non-adherent subjects from subjects with refractory asthma.

      Study Design The study will consist of two phases. The development phase will identify the
      response of FeNO / sputum eosinophils after directly observed inhaled steroid challenge, in
      non-adherent subjects and define cut-off values for a positive and negative test and identify
      the optimum length of steroid challenge. The validation phase will trial and validate the
      test in a 'real life' clinical setting.

      Phase 1 - Development Phase

      During this phase, two groups will be studied:

        -  Non-adherent group - subjects with &lt; 50% prescription filling in previous 6 months and
           persistently high FeNO.

        -  Adherent group - subjects with high prescription filling (&gt; 75%) and persistently high
           FeNO.

      On Day 0, subjects will have a FeNO measurement will be repeated, perform induced sputum and
      complete an asthma control questionnaire. After inhaler technique is deemed satisfactory, all
      subjects will be directly observed taking 1600μg of inhaled budesonide via Turbohaler (or
      bioequivalent dose of Budesonide via MDI / spacer). On the next 6 days, the investigator will
      visit the subjects and perform FeNO measurements, followed by directly observed inhalation of
      1600 μg of inhaled budesonide via appropriate inhaler device.

      On Day 7, subjects will undergo FeNO measurement, induced sputum and an asthma control
      questionnaire. Following who fail to suppress their FeNO level will receive an intramuscular
      injection of Triamcinolone 80mg and will be asked to attend the clinic weekly for 4 weeks for
      measurement of FeNO levels and induced sputum.

      Based on results the investigators will:

        1. Identify if there is a clearly different response in FeNO / sputum eosinophils in
           adherent and non-adherent groups during a 7 day treatment period, with observed high
           dose inhaled steroid therapy, which will define the clinical utility of the technique.

        2. Define cut-off values for a positive test (i.e. which is consistent with non-adherence)
           and a negative test which should mean adherence and consequently refractory asthma.

        3. Define the optimal length of steroid challenge for the validation phase based on
           clinical ease of use and differentiation precision.

      Phase 2 - Validation in a real life Clinical Setting

      Having defined the test, the validation phase will involve prospectively recruited subjects,
      who have a raised FeNO but the investigators will not have access to their prescription
      records at this stage. These subjects will undergo the steroid challenge defined above and
      will be deemed adherent or non-adherent. After the steroid challenge has been performed, this
      will be compared to prescription records and patient confrontation to identify if the
      challenge identifies non-adherence.
