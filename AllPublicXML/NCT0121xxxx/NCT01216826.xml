      The purpose of this study is to determine the Everolimus aim response in children and
      adolescents with refractory or relapsed osteosarcoma.

      The aim response is defined as complete or partial response (according to RECIST criteria)
      for at least 4 weeks, or stable disease for at least 12 weeks.
