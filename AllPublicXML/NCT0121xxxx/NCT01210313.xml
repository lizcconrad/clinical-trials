      In this phase II pilot project the feasibility of a defined medical physical activity should
      be verified for increased physical conversation. The study is conducted multicentric (single
      group) with a study population of 30 patients. After completion of adjuvant chemotherapy the
      patients will participate a defined physical training, 3 times per week within a time period
      of 52 weeks. Planned study duration 2 years.
