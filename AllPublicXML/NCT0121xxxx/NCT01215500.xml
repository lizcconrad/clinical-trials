  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic cancer are generally treated with chemotherapy, which has improved
      median survival compared to best supportive care. Despite this, patients continue to have
      persistent disease at sites that were initially involved with cancer. Radiation therapy is an
      effective modality for treating localized cancer but generally has been only used for
      palliation of symptoms once a patient develops metastatic disease. Since patients often have
      persistent disease after chemotherapy, the goal of this trial is to use increasing doses of
      radiation therapy to all sites of involved disease in order to determine the safety and
      efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to establish a maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities,
      and recommended phase 2 dose of hypofractionated radiation therapy.

    <description>RT to site of metastatic disease for three fractions separated by 3 to 8 days. Doses of radiation will increase as follows in order to determine the MTD in Gy:
For all sites the dose levels are as follows:
8 Gy/ fraction x 3 fractions = 24 Gy
10 Gy/fraction x 3 fractions = 30 Gy
12 Gy/fraction x 3 fractions = 36 Gy
14 Gy/fraction x 3 fractions = 42 Gy
16 Gy/fraction x 3 fractions = 48 Gy
18 Gy/fraction x 3 fractions = 52 Gy
20 Gy/fraction x 3 fractions = 60 Gy</description>
