  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      70% of all cancer patients develop some form of visceral (internal organs) or skeletal
      metastases (spread of disease). Approximately one third of cancer patients develop metastases
      to the spinal column. The prognosis once spinal metastases have been diagnosed and the most
      appropriate treatment still remains controversial. To date there is no one good diagnostic
      tool to predict survival and/or outcome after radiotherapy or surgical intervention.

      Tokuhashi, et al, formulated and presented a preoperative scoring system to evaluate
      indications for surgery and predict outcome in patients with metastases to the spinal column.
      Six variables are measured to calculate this score: general medical condition, number of
      extraspinal metastases, number of vertebral metastases, status of metastases to the major
      internal organs, primary tumor type, and presence of a neurologic deficit. This scoring
      system has been gaining acceptance in literature. In 1998, Tokuhashi, et al, modified this
      scoring system by diversifying the tumor types into six categories. After a retrospective
      analysis Tokuhashi reported that patients with scores less than or equal to 8 will die of
      their disease within 6 months and those with scores of 12 or greater will survive an average
      of 12 months or more.

      The purpose of this study is to determine 1) the Tokuhashi score's validity in predicting
      survival after developing spinal metastases, 2) the relationship of treatment on survival
      after detecting spinal metastases in relation to the Tokuhashi score. Patients will be
      enrolled into the study and followed prospectively for as long as possible regardless of
      intervention.

      There will be three groups based on their Tokuhashi score, each group will require
      approximately 163 subjects statistically.
