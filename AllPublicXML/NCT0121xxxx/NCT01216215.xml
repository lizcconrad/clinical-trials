      Research Problem Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the world that affects
      approximately 300 million individuals worldwide. It is characterized by airway inflammation
      and bronchoconstriction leading to airflow obstruction, however, the triggering factors
      behind asthma development remains to be elucidated. Genetic risk factors have been suggested
      to play a central role in asthma development. Twin studies supported a strong genetic
      component to asthma, especially childhood asthma, with heritability estimates suggesting that
      48-70% of asthma risk is attributed to genetic risk factors. Suggestive susceptibility genes
      have been identified in European and American populations but not yet in the Middle East
      including Saudi Arabia. Identified genes whether they are polymorphic variants of genes
      encoding known pathophysiological molecules or novel genes identified by linkage or
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are inconsistent in different populations thereby
      adding to the need to undertake genetic studies on different ethnic populations and in
      different countries. Here, the investigators hypothesize that polymorphic variation of novel
      susceptibility genes form a major risk factor for asthma development, response to treatment
      and progression in the Saudi population with strong diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic
      implications.

      Research Significance Since the manifestation of complex inflammatory disorders with strong
      heritability is complex involving genetic and environmental interaction, each ethnically
      distinct population must be examined to know whether gene-disease association exists in that
      population. The objectives of this proposal are to discover novel asthma susceptibility genes
      in the Saudi population. A better understanding of the genetic mechanisms of asthma will
      enhance our knowledge of its pathophysiology. Asthmatic patients with distinct genotypes
      respond differently to asthma medications. Therefore, improvements in diagnostics and
      pharmacogenetics may be the first clinical developments of these extensive studies. This
      embraces the concept of asthma subphenotypes and stratified medicine where interventions are
      targeted at those individuals who will best benefit from them with minimal side effects.
      Physicians looking after asthmatic patients will be able to provide better medical service
      tailored to those patients, as well as to identify Saudi people at high risk for the
      development of asthma, especially the more severe forms of the disease.

      Research Objectives The main objective of our proposal is to identify known and novel asthma
      susceptibility genes in the Saudi population and to investigate their interaction with
      clinical, environmental, and inflammatory factors contributing to asthma pathophysiology.

      Research Methodology In this proposal, the investigators will investigate the genetic factors
      contributing to asthma susceptibility by determining in Saudi population, the presence of
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been previously reported from linkage and
      GWAS in other populations. Whole genome DNA will also be scanned for novel SNPs of selected
      &quot;asthma genes&quot; using microarrays. This will enable us to identify new SNPs that contribute to
      the risk of asthma specifically in the Saudi population. In addition, the investigators will
      cross-reference all genetic and immunological parameters with the corresponding clinical data
      in order to elucidate the impact of certain genes, or their products (e.g. cytokines), on the
      clinical manifestation of asthma.

    <measure>IL-4 receptor alpha and STAT6 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of asthma in a Saudi Arabian population.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>IL-4Rα rs1805010 and rs1801275 SNPs have been found to be significantly associated with asthma susceptibility in different ethnic groups; some STAT6 SNPs, including rs324011 and rs324015, have also been associated with asthma predisposition and/or IgE levels. Risk evaluations of IL-4Rα and STAT6 SNPs in association with asthma have never been evaluated in Saudi Arabian populations. Methods: Saudi Arabian patients with documented history of severe asthma (n=190) and healthy subjects (n=194) were recruited. Allelic and genotype association to asthma was assessed for IL-4Rα and STAT6 polymorphisms using nucleotide sequencing. Results: The IL4Rα rs1801275 SNP A/G-G/G genotypes, but not the A/A genotype, were significantly associated with asthma predisposition (OR=0.47; 95% CI=0.31-0.72; P&lt;0.001*; dominant model); Similarly, for STAT6 rs324011, odds were significantly higher that homozygous T/T genotype could be associated with asthma.</description>

        This is a multi-center observational study. Asthmatic patients attending major hospitals in
        Riyadh with clear and well defined inclusion criteria (see below for details, Appendix I)
        will be recruited. We anticipate recruiting 1000 asthmatic patients and comparable number
        of control subjects. The controls will be recruited from people attending blood bank for
        donation or other patients attending different clinics with history excluding atopic
        diseases and asthma. Ethical approval for this study will be obtained from CMRC ethical
        committee of the KKUH as well as other involved centers
