  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, multicenter, open-label, repeat-dose, Phase 1/2 study consisting of a Dose
      Escalation Phase (Phase 1) and a Cohort Expansion Phase (Phase 2). In both phases, KB004 will
      be administered by IV infusion once weekly as part of a 21-day dosing cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of Phase 1 is to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for KB004 when
      administered to subjects with hematologic malignancies who meet the entry criteria. Phase 1
      has completed enrollment July of 2014, the recommended Phase 2 dose is 250 mg. AML 20 mg
      Cohort completed enrollment Dec 2014.

      The purpose of Phase 2 is to characterize preliminary clinical activity. The Phase 2 portion
      of the study consists of two parts:

        -  Part A: Subjects with AML or MDS who meet the entry criteria

        -  Part B: Subjects with MF who meet the entry criteria

        Key Inclusion Criteria (Phase 1):

        - Confirmed hematologic malignancy, including Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Chronic
        Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
        (ALL), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Multiple Myeloma (MM), Myelofibrosis (MF),
        Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN) or MDS/MPN overlap diseases. (Once Phase 2 has started
        subjects with AML will be eligible for inclusion in the Phase 1 portion of the study only
        if their malignancy has been shown to have c-Cbl mutation, trisomy 3, trisomy 11, inv(16),
        or elevated FLT3. [Other AML and subjects with MDS will no longer be eligible for inclusion
        in the Phase 1 portion of the study]).

        Key Inclusion Criteria (Phase 2):

          -  Part A: AML or MDS patients with an acceptable level of EphA3 expression
