  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot clinical trial of carbidopa to treat disabling attacks of nausea and vomiting
      in patients with familial dysautonomia (FD, also known as Riley Day syndrome or hereditary
      sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III). FD is a rare autosomal recessive disease in which
      the growth and development of selective nerves is impaired. Patients with FD suffer recurrent
      uncontrollable nausea and vomiting crises accompanied by skin flushing, tachycardia and
      arterial hypertension. Current treatments of nausea are ineffective or have intolerable side
      sides. Our long-term goal is to treat nausea effectively and without side effects, a
      therapeutic intervention that would markedly improve the quality of life of patients with FD.

      The investigators have recently found that resting plasma dopamine levels are high in
      patients with FD and increase up to 40-fold during nausea and vomiting attacks. This led us
      to postulate that stimulation of dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the
      brainstem is the likely mechanism of vomiting.

      Carbidopa is a reversible competitive inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (also
      known as dopa-decarboxylase) that cannot cross the blood brain barrier. It has been used
      successfully for many years to block the extracerebral synthesis of dopamine and avoid nausea
      and vomiting in patients with Parkinson's disease taking levodopa. The investigators reasoned
      that carbidopa could have a similar antiemetic effect in patients with FD.

      The investigators propose to conduct a pilot trial to assess the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of carbidopa for the treatment of nausea in patients with FD. The pilot trial will
      recruit 25 patients with FD who complain of severe nausea that affects their quality of life.
      The trial will be divided into two consecutive, but independent parts. Part 1, will address
      the safety and tolerability of carbidopa in patients with FD using an open-label dose
      titration phase followed by 4-weeks of open-label treatment. Part 2, will address the
      efficacy of carbidopa for the treatment of nausea in patients with FD using a randomized,
      placebo controlled, double blind, 4-week cross over design.

      The investigators hope to demonstrate that carbidopa is a safe, well-tolerated drug that
      blocks the peripheral formation of dopamine and thus prevents dopamine-induced nausea and
      vomiting attacks in patients with FD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with familial dysautonomia (FD), also called Riley Day syndrome or hereditary
      sensory and autonomic neuropathy type III, suffer recurrent attacks of uncontrollable nausea
      and vomiting that can last several hours or days and are severely disabling. Hypertension,
      tachycardia and skin blotching frequently accompany these attacks. Our long-term objective is
      to develop an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting in patients with FD.

      In preliminary studies we found that plasma levels of dopamine were very high during attacks.
      Stimulation of dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brainstem is a
      well-known cause of nausea and vomiting. The investigators postulate that acute increases in
      circulating dopamine levels are the cause of paroxysmal nausea and vomiting in FD.

      Dopamine is synthesized by decarboxylation of the aminoacid L-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPA)
      by the enzyme aromatic L-aminoacid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase. Patients
      with Parkinson's disease suffer nausea and vomiting when they receive treatment with L-DOPA.
      However, when L-DOPA is administered together with carbidopa, a reversible competitive
      inhibitor of DOPA decarboxylase that does not cross the blood brain barrier, nausea and
      vomiting are prevented. The investigators hypothesize that by blocking the conversion of DOPA
      to dopamine and thus preventing its increase in plasma, treatment with carbidopa will
      decrease nausea and vomiting in patients with FD.

      Although carbidopa has been used for many years in patients with Parkinson's disease, it has
      never been used in patients with FD. The first specific aim of this proposal is to assess the
      safety and tolerability of carbidopa in patients with FD.

      The second specific aim of this proposal is to determine whether blocking the peripheral
      synthesis of dopamine with carbidopa will improve recurrent nausea in patients with FD.

    <description>Daily scores were reported on a modified version of the Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting and Retching, which included all 5 items relating to nausea and retching. Items addressing vomiting/throwing up were omitted, as all participants had antireflux surgery that prevented vomiting (Nissen fundoplication). Retching distress, nausea distress, number of nausea episodes per day, number of retching episodes per day, and the amount of time spent feeling nauseous were graded on a 5-point scale. Scores range from 0 (no nausea/distress) to 20 (most nausea/distress).</description>

        <title>Composite Daily Score</title>
        <description>Daily scores were reported on a modified version of the Rhodes Index of Nausea, Vomiting and Retching, which included all 5 items relating to nausea and retching. Items addressing vomiting/throwing up were omitted, as all participants had antireflux surgery that prevented vomiting (Nissen fundoplication). Retching distress, nausea distress, number of nausea episodes per day, number of retching episodes per day, and the amount of time spent feeling nauseous were graded on a 5-point scale. Scores range from 0 (no nausea/distress) to 20 (most nausea/distress).</description>

Carbidopa : The trial will be divided into two consecutive, but independent parts. Phase 1, will address the safety and tolerability of carbidopa in patients with FD using an open-label dose titration phase followed by 4-weeks of open-label treatment. Phase 2, will address the efficacy of carbidopa for the treatment of nausea in patients with FD using a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, 4-week cross over design.</description>
