  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to check the T and B cells of the immune system in 50 newly
      transplanted patients whom have received a kidney (50 recipients and 50 donors totaling 100
      anticipated participants). This will be done to see how the Standard of Care (SOC)
      anti-rejection medication, Alemtuzumab (Campath 1-H®) affects these cells- Campath 1-H®
      reduces the number of T cells produced by one's body. We will look for these cells using a
      number of laboratory tests; It will require the subjects to each give 65mL of blood at each
      of the 3 visits that occur during phase 1. Up to 12 subjects will be chosen from phase 1 to
      participate in phase 2 depending on lab results.

      In phase 2, subjects will be randomized to one of the three following groups:

      Group one: Continue normal immunosuppression with tacrolimus and Cellcept® (control group)

      Group two: Cellcept® will be tapered down to 70% in three months. Tacrolimus will be
      continued at the same dosage.

      Group three: Tacrolimus will be reduced to 70% in three months. Cellcept® will be continued
      at the same dosage.

      There will be an analysis of these cells at different time point, pre and post kidney
      transplant. The data collection will allow us to study the stability over time of particular
      phenotypes (cell structures) and T cell function. We will also evaluate how the two different
      &quot;minimizing protocols&quot; effect the cell structure. Results from laboratory testing may allow
      us to define certain criteria that can be broadly applied in solid organ transplant
      recipients. This may allow for safe reduction of the anti-rejection medication that
      transplant recipients receive.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1: 50 subjects were to receive study intervention. If any subjects demonstrated persistent donor specific unresponsiveness at the 12 month post-transplant time point, they would proceed into Phase 2. In that phase, the unresponsive subjects would have been randomized to one of three arms that would modify their standard of care immunosuppression.
None of the 50 subjects from Phase 1 demonstrated persistent donor specific unresponsiveness, therefore, phase 2 was never started.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Blood was collected to assess peripheral blood leukocytes prior to kidney transplant, 6 months &amp; 12 months post-transplant as follows: to obtain absolute count of circulating CD4, CD8 positive T cells, B cells &amp; NK cells, naive &amp; memory cells (CD45RA, CD45RO), activated T cells (CD4/CD38, CD8/CD38), regulatory cells (CD4+ CD25+). To also obtain quantification of donor specific antibody cells for class I &amp; class II donor HLA antigens, and measurement of C-reactive protein cells(marker of inflammation). 50cc of urine also obtained for measurement of urinary cytokines &amp; markers of inflammation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult subjects between ages 18-65 years old of either gender

          2. Recipients have an available ABO compatible living donor for transplant

          3. Subjects are listed to be a single-organ transplant recipient (kidney only)

          4. Subjects have the ability to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects have panel reactive antibody greater than 35%

          2. Subjects have the potential to have a high recurrence rate of their primary renal
             disease (i.e. Focal Segmental Glomerulonephritis )

          3. Subjects who have a history of Hepatitis C

          4. Subjects who have had a previous organ transplant

          5. Subjects are unable to fully understand the purpose of the study, thereby unable to
             give a fully informed consent

          6. Subjects with a positive lymphocytotoxic crossmatch using donor lymphocytes and
             recipient serum

          7. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing

          8. Subjects who, due to the existence of a surgical, medical or psychiatric condition,
             other than the current transplant, which in the opinion of the investigator, precludes
             enrollment into this trial.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>All patients were approached pre-operatively in the transplant clinic at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Recruitment began on July 28, 2005 and lasted until April 14, 2008.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The first year of the study was specimen collection only. Group assignment (phase 2) was intended to begin after 12months of sample collection and there were not any subjects who continued into phase 2. An additional pair enrolled compared to the number that started this study. This is due to a loss of samples from a processing inconsistency</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>The Effect of T Cell Depletion on Phenotypic &amp; Functional Profiles of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Steroid-free Kidney Transplant Recipients.</title>
        <description>Blood was collected to assess peripheral blood leukocytes prior to kidney transplant, 6 months &amp; 12 months post-transplant as follows: to obtain absolute count of circulating CD4, CD8 positive T cells, B cells &amp; NK cells, naive &amp; memory cells (CD45RA, CD45RO), activated T cells (CD4/CD38, CD8/CD38), regulatory cells (CD4+ CD25+). To also obtain quantification of donor specific antibody cells for class I &amp; class II donor HLA antigens, and measurement of C-reactive protein cells(marker of inflammation). 50cc of urine also obtained for measurement of urinary cytokines &amp; markers of inflammation.</description>
        <time_frame>Pre-transplant, 6months &amp; 12 months post-transplant</time_frame>
        <population>samples from 26 recipient/donor pairs were collected = 52 analyzed. Some samples were discarded due to processing inconsistencies.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Processing of blood samples was inconsistent and lab results were questionable. Research blood specimens were in addition to Standard of Care (SOC) required blood. Most research visits were planned at the same time as SOC visits.</limitations_and_caveats>
