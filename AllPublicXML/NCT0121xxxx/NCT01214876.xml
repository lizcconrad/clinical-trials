  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A longitudinal study on immune responses in relation to protection against clinical malaria
      episodes will be conducted in Apac District, Uganda. Three cohorts will be recruited:
      children 1 to 5 years of age (n=250), children 6 to 10 years of age (n=125) and adults 25 and
      above (n=125). After finger prick sampling (~300µL) and examination at enrolment,
      participants will be followed up for one year. Follow-up will include fortnightly active case
      detection and three-monthly cross-sectional surveys. Clinical malaria attacks and the
      associated clinical and parasitological parameters will be related to immunological profiles
      determined utilizing a protein microarray as a capture substratum to profile the humoral
      immune response against a vast number of parasite antigens.

      For individuals who experience a clinical malaria attack or who are diagnosed with high
      density parasitaemia (≥15,000 parasites/µL) during cross-sectional surveys, a 5mL blood
      sample is obtained to determine the diversity of parasite antigens in the population in
      relation to antigen recognition in the cohort.
