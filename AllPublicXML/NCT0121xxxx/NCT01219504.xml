      This study will recruit patients from the NY/NJ/CT/eastern PA area only.

      All patients will undergo an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle with hormonal stimulation and
      an egg retrieval procedure as deemed appropriate for their diagnosis. Following biopsy, the
      embryos will be transferred. There will be no delay in the time of transfer as no cells will
      be analyzed prior to transfer.

      On day 3 or day 5 of embryo development, all patients will undergo a two (2) embryo transfer.
      The embryos selected for transfer will be the 2 morphologically best of the embryo cohort.
      Once selected for transfer, the embryos will be randomized so that one will be biopsied and
      the other will be transferred without undergoing biopsy. The embryo randomized to biopsy will
      have a single cell biopsied.

      Following delivery, buccal swabs will be collected from infants.
