  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Candida albicans is the most common and important clinical fungal pathogen. Our previous
      surveillance disclosed that fluconazole could induce different morphological changes in
      clinical strains. Our current study on C. albicans causing candiuria disclosed that renal
      insufficiency , diabetes mellitus, respiratory failure and uremia were risk factors of
      treatment failure. However, we also found results of E-test drug susceptible test could not
      predict outcome. Hence, retrospective analysis of 31 months period, cases that had C.
      albicans inducing candidemia were reviewed and 60 cases were enrolled for morphological study
      and potential virulent gene analysis.

      This study is designed to clarity the clinical meaning of morphological form and virulent
      genes on candidemia. To do this study is probably helpful for treatment of candidiasis.
