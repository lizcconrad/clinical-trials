  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With 11.000 deaths and 150.000 attempts each year in France, the suicide represents an
      important public health problem. For each death by suicide, one can count 6 &quot;direct&quot; bereaved
      people and 20 people in more indirect connection with this mourning (Terra 2001). In term of
      impact, there is thus 300.000 people (annually) touched by the deaths by suicide and
      3.750.000 people (annually) touched by the &quot;suicide attempt&quot; of a close relative. It seems
      indeed important to have Public Health data on this cascade repercussion of the suicide
      attempt.

      A suicide attempt propagates a suffering cascade on the various circles of the family and
      close entourage, which can be measured in term of traumatic stress and medico-economic
      impact.

      Objective = To measure the medico-economic impact on the entourage, in the 3 months following
      the suicide attempt and at 1 year.

      Secondary objectives = To measure the impact of the suicide attempt in traumatic term of
      stress on the close relatives of committing suicide confronted with the suicidal scene To
      compare the evolution of consumption of care of the close relatives and of committing suicide
      To measure the evolution of the general health condition of the close relatives and of
      committing suicide

      The study participants (committing suicide it and the relatives) will be recontacted by
      telephone, after 3 months and to 1 year.

      Consumption of care (number of consultations, drugs consumption) of the population of the
      close relatives of committing suicide will be compared with the data of the Research
      Institute and Documentation in Economy of Health (IRDES) on the French population (sample of
      20.000 people, representative of 95% of the French households).
