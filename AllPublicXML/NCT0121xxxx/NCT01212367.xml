  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will study how to activate the immune system by using gene transfer. Gene
      transfer involves inserting a specially designed gene into cancer cells. A gene is a part of
      the genetic code that instructs the cells of our bodies to produce specific compounds
      (proteins) important for the makeup or function of the cell. The study hypothesis is that
      repeated doses of SCH 721015 given over a three day interval would result in gene transfer.

      Ad.hIFN-α (SCH 721015, adenoviral-mediated interferon alpha) is a replication-defective
      recombinant adenoviral vector containing the human interferon-alpha (hIFN-alpha) gene. This
      Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of two
      doses of Ad.hIFN-alpha injected into the pleural (intrapleural, IP) and given 4 days apart in
      subjects with pleural mesothelioma.

      Subjects who meet eligibility will have a pleural catheter placed 2 weeks prior to the first
      dose. Subjects are then admitted to the research center on Days 1 and 4 for dosing and
      overnight observation. Subjects are then followed-up as outpatients for a total of 6 months.
      Radiographic evaluations are repeated on Day 64 and at 6 months. The pleural catheter is
      removed once it is not necessary.
