  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the first implant in September 1982, the Medtronic Hancock® II has provided more than
      20 years of excellent hemodynamic performance and durability. Design improvements over the
      past generations include: low profile, flexible stent, Supra-X™ supra-annular placement, T6
      anti-calcification tissue treatment, modified fixation process, CINCH® advanced implant
      system and ULTRA™ minimized sewing ring. Valve sizing is a critical consideration in
      obtaining optimal hemodynamic performance. This is particular true in small aortic roots. A
      critical issue is the size of the prosthesis in relation to the patient's annulus.

      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate, at six and twelve months, the
      hemodynamic performance of the HancockÒ Ultra™ bioprosthesis in the aortic position, to
      analyze the incidence of patient prosthesis mismatch, correlation of gradients, and to
      ascertain frequency at which a larger valve size is used vs. a patient's debrided annulus
      diameter.

    <description>This will be measured by comparing the mean aortic valve gradients pre- and post-surgery.Left ventricular mass regression will be compared pre operative and at 6 months follow-up. The follow-up data at 12 months will be used to see if there was any improvement with the 6 months follow-up visit. .</description>

        The patient population includes all patients who require aortic valve replacement for heart
        valve disease (acquired or congenital) and who are candidates for a bioprosthetic valve.
        Patients will be informed about the aspects of this study and will be asked to give their
        Informed Consent.
