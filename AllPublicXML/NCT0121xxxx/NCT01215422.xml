  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two new instruments on the market that anesthesiologists use when putting a
      breathing tube into the lungs of patients. The purpose of this study is to see how easily
      anesthesiologists can learn to use them in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each anesthesiologist performed 20 timed baseline intubations. They were then randomized to
      perform 20 timed intubations with one of the two new videolaryngoscopes followed by 20 with
      the other new videolaryngoscope. The goal was to see how quickly they could become
      proficient.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Success in Learning to Use a Videolaryngoscope(VLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 minutes per intubation</time_frame>
    <description>Anesthesiologists were to perform 20 intubations with each videolaryngoscopes. #1-10 were for practice. &quot;Rapid Success&quot; was no failed intubation attempts on #11-20 and a median time-to-intubation no more than 50% longer than their baseline median time-to-intubation on #11-15 . &quot;Delayed Success&quot; was achieving these same parameters on #16-20 if they were not achieved on #11-15. Operators who did not achieve either goal were labeled as having &quot;No Success&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cormack &amp; Lehane Score</measure>
    <time_frame>reported during intubation (up to 5 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>This Outcome was designed to determine if the view of the airway as determined by the Cormack &amp; Lehane grading system is improved by use of the GlideScope (GS) video laryngoscope and/or the Karl Storz Direct Coupled Interface (DCI) (KS) video laryngoscope as this would be a surrogate marker for utility in a difficult airway. Score is reported as a whole number from I to IV with I being an easy intubation and IV being one where the larynx cannot be visualized at all.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Intubation, Analyzed by Order of Laryngoscopes Used</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if the learning curve was altered by the order in which the two new laryngoscopes were learned by the anesthesiologist,mean and median times on intubations #16-20 were compared for the two videolaryngoscopes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Intubation, Stratified by Weight of Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the time-to-intubation for these laryngoscopes in children of different weights.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Years Since Completion of Anesthesiology Residency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (assessed as of 2008)</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate whether there was a correlation between the years since completion of anesthesiology residency to the mid-point of study (2008)and median time-to-intubation for all first attempt intubations for the study. Years since completion of anesthesiology residency reported in the data table, correlation reported in the statistical analysis below</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Intubation Attempts to Reach &quot;Best Obtainable Time to Intubation&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>less than 5 minutes per intubation</time_frame>
    <description>For each anesthesiologist, the median time-to-intubation for patients #1-5, #6-10, #11-15, and #16-20 was determined. The anesthesiologist was considered to have reached &quot;Best Obtainable Time (BOT) to Intubation&quot; once the median time on any group of 5 consecutive patients was less than 3 seconds faster than the median time in the previous group of 5 consecutive patients, provided that there were no failed intubations or subsequent failed intubations using the same device.</description>
