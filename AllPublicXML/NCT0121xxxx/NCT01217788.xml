  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of PH94B, a new class of therapeutic
      compound, administered intranasally for the management of acute anxiety in patients diagnosed
      with generalized social phobia.

      The essential features of generalized social phobia are defined by the Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), criteria as a marked and
      persistent fear of most (generally accepted as four or more) social or performance situations
      in which the patient believes embarrassment could occur as a consequence of exposure to
      unfamiliar people and/or possible scrutiny by others. The anxiety resulting from the social
      or performance situation is profound. The avoidance, fear, or anxious anticipation of these
      situations interferes significantly with the person's daily routine, having a marked impact
      on occupational functioning and/or social life. The disorder has a lifetime prevalence
      estimated at up to 13%, with onset typically in the mid-teens, and it is diagnosed slightly
      more frequently in females than in males. Social phobia tends to be a chronic disorder with
      periods of exacerbation, with a reported mean duration of illness of approximately 20 years.

      There are two subtypes of social phobia: (i) generalized (discrete), which is suffered by
      approximately 50% of social phobia patients and in which fear and avoidance extend to a wide
      range of social situations, and (ii) non-generalized, in which the patient fears only one or
      a few circumscribed situations. Speaking in front of large groups is by far the most
      prevalent of social fears (Lang and Stein, 2001).

      Social phobia has a lifetime comorbidity rate of approximately 81% with other psychiatric
      disorders (particularly affective disorders, other anxiety disorders, and substance abuse
      disorders), as well as to being associated with increased nonpsychiatric medical
      difficulties. People with social phobia identify social impairment, inadequate social
      support, overall role impairment, specific impairment in education, work, and other
      activities, as well as interference in their efforts at self-improvement. Unfortunately, for
      these patients, there is a strong consensus that social phobia is one of the least commonly
      recognized and treated mental disorders

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject currently meets the Diagnosis of Social Phobia as defined in Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition which is not secondary to another
             pre-existing psychiatric condition or to a medical condition.

          -  Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) score greater than or equal to 60 at Screening.

          -  Score of 75 or greater on the SUD scale at one of the Performance Phase time points
             during either the Public Speaking or Social Interaction Challenge

          -  Written Informed Consent prior to commencing any study specific procedures.

          -  Women of child-bearing-potential must be able to commit to the consistent and correct
             use of an acceptable method of birth control throughout the study and have a negative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any psychotropic medication within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Acute or chronic psychiatric disease which is the primary diagnosis (except Social

             diagnosis.

          -  Subjects with a history of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar
             disorder, and psychosis are to be excluded.

          -  Presence of a clinical condition or disease, or use of a concomitant medication, that
             in the clinical judgment of the Investigator could place the patient at undue risk,
             interfere with study participation, or confound the results of the study.

          -  Use of substances of abuse within the year prior to study entry.

          -  Concomitant use of any over-the-counter, prescription product, or herbal preparation

             prior to study entry and use of non-study anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines during
             the study and within 30 days prior to study entry.
