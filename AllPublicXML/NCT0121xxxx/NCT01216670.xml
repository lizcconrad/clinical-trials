      The CARRYING ON for heart failure (HF) study is a national, prospective, post market
      interventional, multi-center, open-label, pilot trial.The purpose of the study is to assess a
      short term and a long term period, incidence of pre-specified clinical and arrhythmic events
      in patients with a low ejection fraction (EF) that are hospitalized for acute cardiac
      decompensation.

      The CARRYING ON for heart failure (HF) study is a national, prospective, post market
      interventional, multi-center, open-label, pilot trial designed in two phases.

      The purpose of the study is to assess a short term (6 months follow-up - Phase 1) and a long
      term period (24 months follow-up - Phase 2), incidence of pre-specified clinical and
      arrhythmic events in patients with a low ejection fraction (EF) that are hospitalized for
      acute cardiac decompensation. A previously implanted Reveal® XT device will be used to
      collect heart rhythm information.
