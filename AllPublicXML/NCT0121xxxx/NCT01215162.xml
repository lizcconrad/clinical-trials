  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to determine the tolerance to single fraction intra-operative
      electron irradiation (IOERT) and external beam photon irradiation (EBRT) following lumpectomy
      for T1/T2N0M0 breast cancer. IOERT is used in lieu of the 5-8 days of electron beam boost
      irradiation that is usually given after EBRT. Data from two centers as well as preliminary
      data from a randomized trial in Europe suggest that IOERT boost is well tolerated and
      efficacious. In our study, patients will undergo standard lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node
      sampling or axillary dissection. After the lumpectomy, IOERT of 10 Gy will be delivered in a
      single fraction to the tumor bed by a mobile electron machine in the operating room. EBRT to
      the whole breast will be administered once the surgical wound has healed adequately. The
      primary objective is to determine the feasibility and acute patient tolerance to IOERT and
      EBRT after lumpectomy. Secondary objectives include assessment of local control and distant
      control of disease, as well as evaluation of long-term side effects and cosmetic outcome of
      the treatment.

    <description>IOERT is given to the tumor bed. Applicator selection should allow treatment of the tumor bed plus 1-2 cm margin. The surgical incision may need to be enlarged slightly to allow the placement of the appropriate applicator. The use of more than 1 treatment field is discouraged. In order to encompass the entire tumor bed in 1 treatment field, it may be necessary to suture the mammary parenchyma loosely so that the lateral margins of the tumor bed are brought into apposition. Electron energy used for the treatment. If the tumor bed can be flattened and encompassed by an applicator, 6 MeV electron is recommended. Use of bolus material may be considered to increase the surface dose. If the mammary parenchyma has been brought into apposition by sutures, a higher electron energy may be necessary to allow adequate dose coverage to a depth of 1.0-2.0 cm into the tumor bed. The dose of IOERT is 1000 cGy, prescribed to the 90% isodose line.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligibility:

          1. Histologically proven primary invasive breast carcinoma.

          2. Tumor pathologically determined &lt;= 5cm in diameter.

          3. Single, discrete, well-defined primary tumor.

          4. Any micro-calcifications must be focal. A specimen radiograph is required after
             lumpectomy to assure removal of all malignant appearing calcifications.

          5. Pathologically negative surgical margins.

          6. Axillary lymph node status can be determined by level I and II lymph node dissection
             or sentinel lymph node sampling.

          7. ECOG performance status 0-2.

        Contraindications:

          1. Multicentric disease and/or diffuse malignant appearing microcalcifications.

          2. Evidence of metastatic breast cancer.

          3. Axillary lymph node involvement.

          4. Pre-existing collagen vascular disease except rheumatoid arthritis that does not
             require immunosuppressive therapy.

          5. Prior irradiation to the ara of planned radiation field.

          6. Pregnant or lactating women.
