  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this observational study is to collect prospective data regarding neuromuscular
      monitoring practices and extubation standards (Train-Of-Four [TOF] value) during surgery, in
      countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEE/EEMEA countries).
      Secondarily the study will observe, for which surgical procedures neuromuscular blocking
      agents (NMBAs), and reversal agents to such, are used. This study is a non-interventional
      clinical trial, and administration of NMBAs, and respective reversal agents, (as well as all
      drugs used during anesthesia) will be done in accordance with routine anesthesiology
      practice, and labeling guidelines. Neuromuscular transmission will be monitored according to
      routine anesthesiology practice by means of acceleromyography. The assignment of the
      participant to a particular therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by a trial
      protocol, but falls within current practice and the prescription of the medicine is clearly
      separated from the decision to include the patient in the study.

    <time_frame>At extubation (approximately &lt;1 to 125 minutes after end of surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Neuromuscular function assessment was performed according to routine anesthesiology practice. This typically involves application of repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve and assessment of twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. The TOF-ratio, expressed as a decimal from 0.0 up to 1.0, is the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to that of the first twitch (T1). The greater the T4/T1 ratio the greater the recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The TOF-ratio was measured at the time of post-surgical extubation. TOF-ratio at time of extubation was to be recorded for each participant, if available, irrespective of the criteria used to make the decision to extubate the participant. TOF-ratio &lt;0.9 at extubation is considered to indicate a high risk for development of postoperative residual curarization (i.e, residual neuromuscular blockade), which can result in respiratory complications.</description>

    <description>This measure is the duration from the last surgical wound stitch to the post-surgical extubation of the participant. The time of extubation was to be recorded for each participant, irrespective of the criteria used to make the decision to extubate the participant. Data are presented by TOF-ratio &lt;0.9 and â‰¥0.9 at extubation. The TOF-ratio is a measure of neuromuscular function ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The greater the T4/T1 ratio the greater
the recovery from neuromuscular blockade. TOF-ratio &lt;0.9 at extubation is considered to indicate a high risk for development of postoperative residual curarization (i.e, residual neuromuscular blockade), which can result in respiratory complications.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With a Train-Of-Four (TOF)-Ratio &lt;0.9 at Extubation</title>
          <description>Neuromuscular function assessment was performed according to routine anesthesiology practice. This typically involves application of repetitive Train-Of-Four (TOF) electrical stimulations to the ulnar nerve and assessment of twitch response at the adductor pollicis muscle. The TOF-ratio, expressed as a decimal from 0.0 up to 1.0, is the ratio of the magnitude of the fourth twitch (T4) to that of the first twitch (T1). The greater the T4/T1 ratio the greater the recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The TOF-ratio was measured at the time of post-surgical extubation. TOF-ratio at time of extubation was to be recorded for each participant, if available, irrespective of the criteria used to make the decision to extubate the participant. TOF-ratio &lt;0.9 at extubation is considered to indicate a high risk for development of postoperative residual curarization (i.e, residual neuromuscular blockade), which can result in respiratory complications.</description>

        <description>This measure is the duration from the last surgical wound stitch to the post-surgical extubation of the participant. The time of extubation was to be recorded for each participant, irrespective of the criteria used to make the decision to extubate the participant.

the recovery from neuromuscular blockade. TOF-ratio &lt;0.9 at extubation is considered to indicate a high risk for development of postoperative residual curarization (i.e, residual neuromuscular blockade), which can result in respiratory complications.</description>
