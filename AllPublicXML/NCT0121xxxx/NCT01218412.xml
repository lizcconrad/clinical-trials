  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the proposed study are:

        -  1. To determine if web-based Motivational Interviewing (MI) is effective, compared to an
           informational web-based comparison group, in enhancing physical activity (PA)
           participation; and

        -  2. To assess the mechanisms by which web-based MI enhances PA through changes in
           targeted cognitive mediators.

      The specific hypotheses of the study include that:

        -  Hypothesis 1: Web-based MI will increase PA;

        -  Hypothesis 2: Web-based MI will lead to stage progression in the direction of increased
           readiness to participate in PA;

        -  Hypothesis 3: Web-based MI will influence theoretically identified cognitive variables;

        -  Hypothesis 4: Cognitive variables will mediate increases in PA participation.

      Increasing physical activity (PA) is a public health priority. There is preliminary support
      for application of Motivational Interviewing (MI) for physical activity (PA),
      web-applications for PA promotion, web-based MI for behavior change, and finally web-based MI
      for PA. Based on collective findings in these areas of inquiry, it is necessary to
      investigate the efficacy of MI as a method that lends readily to practical applications for
      PA promotion. The current study seeks to investigate whether web-based MI can be applied in
      an adult population to enhance PA participation using a physician referral scheme.
      Additionally, mechanisms of behavior change are considered in order to inform future research
      and intervention.
