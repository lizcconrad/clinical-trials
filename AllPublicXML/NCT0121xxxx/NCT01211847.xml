  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population will consist of Statin-naive and Statin-treated subjects, all without diabetes
      mellitus, with fasting triglyceride levels in the range of ≥ 500 mg/dL and &lt; 1500 mg/dL.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: DCCR and Placebo

      Approximately 44 subjects will be enrolled in the study and stratified by Statin use at a 1:1
      ratio in each treatment group,
