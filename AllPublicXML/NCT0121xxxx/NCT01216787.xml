      This pilot phase II trial is studying how well RO4929097 works in treating patients with
      stage III, or stage IV melanoma that can be removed by surgery. RO4929097 may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the molecular effects of Notch signaling inhibition using gamma-secretase
      inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) in patients with resectable stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV intact
      melanoma tumors in the neoadjuvant setting.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess any indication of clinical activity of RO4929097 in these patients. II. Assess the
      effect of RO4929097 on Akt-mediated downstream biomarkers in melanoma tissue.

      III. Assess the effect of RO4929097 on the melanoma stem cell subpopulation. IV. Identify
      patient-specific micro-RNA signatures that may correlate with response to therapy,
      recurrence, and overall survival.

      V. Determine the clinical feasibility of measuring circulating melanoma tumor cells in the
      blood and correlating levels with recurrence and/or survival.

      VI. Correlate the shedding of collagen cryptic epitopes in the serum and urine with tumor
      response and risk of recurrence.

      VII. Measure the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RO4929097 in these patients.

      VIII. Evaluate the impact of RO4929097 on serum markers of angiogenesis. IX. Measure serum
      autoimmune biomarkers and correlate with clinical response and outcome in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) once daily on days 1-3,
      8-10, and 15-17. Within 35-56 days after completion of therapy, patients with stable or
      responsive disease undergo surgery. Patients may continue RO4929097 for 28 days after surgery
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue biopsies at baseline and after completion of study therapy for
      4E-BP1 and Akt-mediated downstream biomarkers, stem cell subpopulation, and patient-specific
      micro-RNA signatures studies by IHC and PCR assays. Blood and urine samples are also
      collected at baseline and periodically during study for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      studies, circulating melanoma endothelial cells and progenitor cell levels, collagen cryptic
      epitopes, serum markers of angiogenesis, and autoimmune biomarker analysis by ELISA.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
