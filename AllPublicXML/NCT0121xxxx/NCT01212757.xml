  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether apremilast is safe and effective in the
      treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis.

      Apremilast is proposed to improve signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis (tender and
      swollen joints, pain, physical function) in treated patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis that occurs in 6-39% of psoriasis
      patients. The immunopathogenesis of PsA, which mirrors but is not identical to that seen in
      psoriatic plaques, reflects a complex interaction among resident dendritic, fibroblastic and
      endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells attracted to the synovium by cytokines and
      chemokines. Apremilast (CC-10004) is a novel oral agent that modulates multiple inflammatory
      pathways through targeted phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) enzyme inhibition. Therefore,
      apremilast has the potential to be effective in the treatment of PsA.

    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set; participants with a baseline value and at least 1 postbaseline value at or prior to Week 24 are included; LOCF imputation was used. The Week 16 value was carried over to Week 24 for participants who escaped early at Week 16.</population>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: - 28 tender joint count (TJC), - 28 swollen joint count (SJC), - Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; - Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables: - 28 tender joint count - 28 swollen joint count, which do not include the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee; - C-reactive protein (CRP) - Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue scale is a 13-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses both the physical and functional consequences of fatigue. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale, where 0 means “not at all,” and 4 means “very much.” The FACIT-Fatigue scale score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores denoting lower levels of fatigue. A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>Modified PsARC response is defined as improvement in at least 2 of the 4 measures, at least one of which must be tender joint count or swollen joint count, and no worsening in any of the 4 measures: • 78 tender joint count, • 76 swollen joint count, • Patient global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm visual Analog scale (VAS), where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest; • Physician global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest. Improvement or worsening in joint counts is defined as decrease or increase, respectively, from baseline by ≥ 30%, and improvement or worsening in global assessments is defined as decrease or increase, respectively, from baseline by ≥ 20 mm VAS.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dactylitis Severity Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet will be rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set. Participants with a baseline dactylitis severity score &gt; 0 (i.e., pre-existing dactylitis) and at least 1 postbaseline value at or prior to Week 24 are included. LOCF was used. The Week 16 value was carried over to Week 24 for participants who escaped early at Week 16.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: • 28 tender joint count (TJC), • 28 swollen joint count (SJC), • Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; • Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8; Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10; Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22; High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue scale is a 13-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses both the physical and functional consequences of fatigue. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale, where 0 means &quot;not at all,&quot; and 4 means &quot;very much.&quot; The FACIT-Fatigue scale score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores denoting lower levels of fatigue. A positive change from baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Good or Moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response at Week 16</title>
        <description>A EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity and an attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the DAS-28 score. A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 compared with Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2. A Moderate Response is defined as either: • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or, • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Good or Moderate EULAR Response at Week 24</title>
        <description>EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity and an attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the DAS-28 score. A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 compared with Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2. A Moderate Response is defined as either: • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or, • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Dactylitis Score of Zero at Week 16</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with pre-existing dactylitis whose dactylitis severity score improves to zero after 16 weeks of treatment. Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet was rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: • 28 tender joint count (TJC), • 28 swollen joint count (SJC), • Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; • Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables: • 28 tender joint count • 28 swollen joint count, which do not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee; • C-reactive protein (CRP) • Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the DAS28 at Week 52</title>
          <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables: • 28 tender joint count • 28 swollen joint count, which do not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee; • C-reactive protein (CRP) • Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <description>A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of Investigational Product (IP). The severity of each adverse event (AE) and serious AE (SAE) was assessed by the investigator and graded based on a scale from Mild - mild symptoms to Severe AEs (non-serious or serious). A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which:
Resulted in death
Was life-threatening
Required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Was a congenital anomaly/birth defect
Constituted an important medical event</description>
