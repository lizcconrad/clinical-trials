  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II open-label study will be performed to evaluate the response rate of brain
      metastases from lung and breast tumors under treatment with WBRT and lapatinib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with breast or lung cancer who have developed brain metastases will be treated with
      WBRT (30Gy in 10 fractions) and lapatinib 1250mg once daily, followed by lapatinib treatment
      1500mg once daily for a total duration of 6 weeks. At the 6 weeks timepoint, radiological
      assessment with brain MRI will take place to evaluate the response of the patients.
      Subsequent to the 6 weeks treatment period with lapatinib, the patients may discontinue
      lapatinib as monotherapy and the physicians can proceed with any therapy, according to their
      discretion. The patients will be followed-up every 12 weeks for disease progression and
      survival.
