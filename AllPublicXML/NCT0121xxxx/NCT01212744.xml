    <textblock>
      This 16-week multi-center, open-label, Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability,and efficacy of daily SC injections of rAvPAL-PEG in subjects with PKU. Subjects
      who are naïve to prior treatment with rAvPAL-PEG and who have met the other study eligibility
      criteria will be enrolled at approximately 8 sites in the US and Canada. Up to 6 daily dose
      levels of rAvPAL-PEG are planned and may be assessed during this study (0.06 mg/kg/day, 0.1
      mg/kg/day, 0.2 mg/kg/day;0.4 mg/kg/day, 0.6 mg/kg/day, or 0.8 mg/kg/day). Enrollment will
      begin with the 0.4 mg/kg/day dose level and additional higher or lower doses may be added.
      The additional dose levels chosen for assessment will be based on the safety (systemic
      reaction or clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results assessed as related to
      study drug) and efficacy (blood Phe reduction to less than or equal to 60 μmol/L) information
      of at least 3 subjects with at least 2 weeks of daily dosing with rAvPAL-PEG. Initiation of
      dosing at higher or lower dose levels will be per the determination of the Sponsor's Medical
      Officer in consultation with the Investigator.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of PKU with both of the following: current blood Phe concentration of ≥ 600
             micromol/L at screening and average blood Phe concentration of ≥ 600 micromol/L over
             the past 3 years, using available data

          -  Evidence that the subject is a non-responder to Kuvan® treatment (ie, 4 weeks of
             treatment with 20 mg/kg/day of Kuvan, insufficient response per investigator
             determination, and treatment end date ≥ 14 days prior to Day 1 [ie, first dose]).
             Subjects who have had a previous response to Kuvan® treatment but are not currently
             taking Kuvan® because of noncompliance and have been off treatment for ≥ 4 months
             prior to screening are eligible for participation.

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent, or, in the case of
             participants under the age of 18, provide written assent (if required) and written
             informed consent by a legally authorized representative, after the nature of the study
             has been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures.

             considered not of childbearing potential are those who have been in menopause for at
             least 2 years or have had a tubal ligation at least 1 year prior to screening, or who
             have had a total hysterectomy.

          -  Willing to use an acceptable method of contraception while participating in the study
             (sexually active subjects only).

          -  Maintained a stable diet with no significant modifications during the 4 weeks
             preceding the administration of study drug.

          -  In generally good health as evidenced by physical examination, clinical laboratory
             evaluations (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), and ECG at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any medication that is intended to treat PKU within 14 days prior to the
             administration of study drug.

          -  Use or planned use of any injectable drugs containing PEG (other than rAvPAL-PEG),
             including Depo-Provera, within 3 months prior to screening and during study
             participation.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to rAvPAL-PEG excipients.

          -  Breastfeeding at screening or planning to become pregnant (self or partner) or to
             breastfeed at any time during the study.

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study participation or
             safety (eg, history or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             hepatic, renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic,
             neurological, oncologic, or psychiatric disease).

          -  Any condition that, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at high risk
             of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Creatinine &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.
