  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      • Background: Peridontitis is a group of diseases with complex bacterial etiology that
      affects a large proportion of the Chilean and worldwide population. Its treatment, based on
      an anti-infective mechanical therapy including scaling and root planning procedures, has been
      highly effective in numerous short and long term clinical trials. The use of adjunctive
      systemic antibiotics has shown significant improvements in the initial therapy results of
      specific periodontal disease types or patient profiles.

      The synergic combination of Metronidazole plus amoxicillin has been widely and successfully
      used for the treatment of aggressive and severe chronic periodontitis, demonstrating
      additional benefits in clinical and microbiological parameters over scaling and root planning
      alone. However, and despite its proven efficacy, there is a lack of evidence that evaluates
      the impact of antimicrobials intake at different times of the mechanical treatment,
      emphasizing the necessity of a study that compares, simultaneously, the variation of the
      adjunctive antibiotic effects when they are administered in different moments through the
      periodontal therapy course.
