  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research purpose of this project is to create a registry, and blood and tissue bank for
      individuals at high-risk for pancreatic cancer. We plan to conduct histopathological and
      molecular analysis of resected pancreatic tissue prospectively collected from a cohort of
      pancreatic cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. In
      order to improve outcomes of this disease, significant research efforts have focused on
      understanding the changes that occur in the pancreas prior to tumor occurrence. The types of
      changes most often associated with tumor have been named pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia
      (PanIN). It is not yet clear how to identify the PanIN lesions most likely to develop into
      cancer and the length of time required for this progression. In order to evaluate these
      questions, we are interested in examining the microscopic and genetic characteristics of
      PanIN lesions in two &quot;high-risk&quot; patients: 1) patients who underwent surgery for pancreatic
      cancer and developed tumor recurrence after surgery and 2) patients with a strong family
      history of pancreatic cancer or with a genetic syndrome that puts them at risk for pancreas
      cancer. The surgical specimens from these patients will be evaluated by a pathologist for
      evidence of widespread PanIN lesions. In addition, PanIN lesions will be tested for
      abnormalities in several major genes that are known to be important in pancreatic cancer.
