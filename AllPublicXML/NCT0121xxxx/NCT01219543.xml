  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase I, open-label and dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of AZD1480(JAK2 inhibitor) in Asian patients with advanced solid tumors (Part A and C) and in
      patients with advanced HCC (Part B) in the escalation phase, EGFR or ROS mutant NSCLC and
      non-smokers with lung metastasis and gastric cancer in the expansion phase and to evaluate
      daily and BID dosing.
