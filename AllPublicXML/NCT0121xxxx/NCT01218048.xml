  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no useful tests to identify patients who will respond to cetuximab
      therapy, notably because EGFR levels do not correlate with the clinical responses observed.
      Thus, the investigators are investigating the role of cellular immunity and immune escape
      mechanisms to explain the differential clinical response to cetuximab.

    <textblock>
      This prospective phase II clinical trial of preoperative, single-agent cetuximab treated
      patients is being conducted in order to obtain specimens before and after 4 weeks of
      cetuximab for immune biomarker studies. Stage III/IV HNC patients will be treated with
      definitive surgical resection and observed for disease recurrence. Cetuximab will be
      administered for a 3-4 week preoperative period to study biomarker modulation in correlation
      clinical response by CT scan and tumor apoptosis/proliferation after tumor excision,
      immediately after neoadjuvant cetuximab but before surgery. We will biopsy the skin/acneiform
      rash in all patients to correlate rash with biomarker modulation and clinical response.
      Cetuximab may also be given in the adjuvant setting. A primary scientific hypothesis will be
      tested: does short term pre-operative exposure to cetuximab modulate blood immune biomarkers
      and is immune modulation associated with anti-tumor effect? Forty (n=40) patients with
      complete specimens (tumor, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and serum) are necessary
      to enable adequate statistical power to be reached using paired specimens. A secondary set of
      hypotheses will evaluate the association between pre-operative biomarker levels and
      modulation with disease recurrence. The proposed trial will accrue stage II, III or IV
      surgical candidates without distant metastasis.
