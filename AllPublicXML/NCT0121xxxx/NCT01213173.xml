      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The sample size was insufficient for the secondary endpoints. Besides, the treatment prior to study did not correlate well with 47.5 mg metoprolol succinate, but with some higher dose. last the quality control of the study needs further improvement.</limitations_and_caveats>
