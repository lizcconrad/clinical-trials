      Eligibility for participation of this study will be determined from demographic information,
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
      within 3 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study will be
      admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Seoul National University Hospital on the day before
      dosing, and they were overnight-fasted from 10 p.m. of Day -1. Urine collection is scheduled
      drug 24 hour before midazolam administration. Subjects will be dosed study drug via
      intravenous around at 9 a.m. of Day 1. Subjects performed scheduled procedures including
      clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms and pharmacokinetic samplings. Subjects will be
      discharged on Day 2, and visited Clinical Trials Center on Day 5-7 for ketoconazole
      administration. Subjects will be admitted on Day 7 for period 2. Subjects performed scheduled
      period 2 (ketoconazole co-administration phase), and period 3 (rifampicin co-administration
      phase) procedure. Study participation was terminated on post-study visit (Day 30-32).
