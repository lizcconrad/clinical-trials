  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a bilateral, chronic, external ocular inflammatory
      disease of unknown cause. It is a fairly common disease in hot, dry environments,
      representing as much as 3% of severe ophthalmic diseases and up to 33% of all eye pathology
      seen among young patients in eye clinics in Central Africa. Symptoms and signs can persist
      for years with an important visual morbidity and social impact. Corneal changes (e.g. corneal
      ulcers) can be sight threatening, occurring in up to 10% of VKC children. Topical steroid
      therapy remains the current standard treatment, but in developing countries its use often is
      chronic and not medically supervised, potentially leading to bacterial infections,
      steroid-induced glaucoma and cataract. Chromoglycate drops have less side effects but lack
      the power to control a flare-up. Topical cyclosporine has the potential to offer an efficient
      but safer alternative to steroid drops in the management of VKC in an African setting. Its
      safety and efficiency in the management of vernal keratoconjunctivitis have been described in
      several uncontrolled studies and double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, but those studies
      were relatively small and involved populations outside Africa with predominantly palpebral
      and mixed forms of VKC. Controversy still remains on the efficiency of cyclosporine in severe
      forms of allergic conjunctivitis like VKC. We therefore undertake a larger prospective
      randomized double-masked, standard treatment controlled clinical trial in Central Africa to
      compare the short-term efficiency of cyclosporine A (CsA) 2% eye drops, solved in olive oil
      vehicle, with that of steroid drops in predominantly limbal forms of VKC. During 4 weeks the
      participants will be randomised to either cyclosporine or dexamethasone as attack treatment
      for VKC. The 4 weeks thereafter all participants will receive chromoglycate drops as
      maintenance treatment. Additional objectives are to document any difference in rebound
      phenomenon while on chromoglycate during the maintenance phase between the 2 treatment groups
      and to evaluate safety and tolerance of the test medication.
