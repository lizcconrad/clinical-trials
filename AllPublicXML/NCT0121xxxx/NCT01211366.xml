  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transfusion of washed intra-operative cell salvage post-operatively in the PCICU can be
      performed safely without increased risk of bleeding or release of inflammatory mediators.
      This will reduce the need for allogeneic blood products as well as crystalloid and colloid
      infusions and thus decrease the length of ventilation and intensive care duration for these
      infants.
