      The goal of this study is to determine the dose of LY573636 that can be administered safely
      in combination with liposomal doxorubicin in patients with advanced cancer who have failed a
      prior treatment.

      The study consists of a dose escalation phase to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)and a dose
      confirmation phase in patients with platinum resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or
      primary peritoneal cancer who have never been treated with doxorubicin.

    <description>Individualized dose is dependent on patients height, weight, gender and is adjusted to target a specific exposure range corrected for a patient's laboratory parameters. Intravenous dosing is done on Day 1 of a 28 day cycle.
Patients may continue on study drug until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 of liposomal doxorubicin or doxorubicin is reached, or other withdrawal criterion are met.</description>
