  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disease with high
      prevalence worldwide and with relevant impact on patient-related quality of life, morbidity
      and mortality. There is evidence that airway inflammation correlates with the severity of the
      disease and that airway inflammation is further enhanced during exacerbation. However, it is
      unknown whether daily fluctuation of symptoms or changes in lung function is paralleled by
      changes in airway inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo a visit every 7 days during one month (5 visits in total). At each
      visit airway inflammation (exhaled NO, sputum inflammatory cell count) and lung function will
      be performed. At home patients will be asked to fill a daily diary for symptom assessment.
