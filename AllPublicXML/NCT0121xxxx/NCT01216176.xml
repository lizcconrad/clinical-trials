  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a Phase I/randomized Phase II study design in order to
      test the tolerability and efficacy of AZD0530 when used together with anastrozole in therapy
      for ER+ and/or PR+, postmenopausal breast cancer. The Phase I pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort of
      the study (cohort A) in postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer 2008-2009 showed
      initial safety,tolerability and good bioavailability of both drugs and determined the doses
      for use in the ongoing Phase II trial. In the randomized Phase II cohort of the study (cohort
      B), postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed, previously untreated ER+, HER2 negative breast
      cancer that is at least 2 cm or more in diameter by clinical exam or radiology will be
      randomized to either neoadjuvant treatment with anastrozole plus placebo, or anastrozole in
      combination with AZD0530. The Phase II cohort will permit extended assays of tolerability,
      initial estimates of efficacy, and the investigation of molecular predictors of drug
      efficacy.
