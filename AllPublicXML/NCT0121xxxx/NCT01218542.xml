  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are the most common adult intracranial tumor, occurring in approximately 10%
      to 30% of adult cancer patients, and represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality.
      The most widely used treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases is whole brain
      radiation therapy (WBRT). The use of WBRT after resection or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
      has been proven to be effective in terms of improving local control of brain metastases.

      RapidArc (RA) (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) is a new method of delivering radiation
      that uses &quot;arcs&quot; to deliver highly conformal intensity modulated three dimensional dose
      distributions. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate an alternative strategy for
      giving WBRT with highly focal boost to gross visible lesions in patients with brain
      metastasis.

      Given the limitations of the SRS boost technique, the purpose of our investigation is to
      evaluate an alternative strategy for giving WBRT with highly focal boost to gross visible
      lesions in patients with brain metastasis. In this study, we plan to assess the tolerability
      of using volumetric modulated arc therapy (RapidArc) on patients with brain metastasis to
      simultaneously treat the entire brain with a concomitant focal boost to grossly identified
      lesions on MRI scan to try to improve local control and reduce neurocognitive toxicities.

      This previous version of this study was a phase I dose escalation trial giving 25 Gy in 10
      fractions to the whole brain with simultaneous infield boost (SIB) to a total of 45 Gy in 10
      fractions to gross brain metastatic disease. Prior to this, patients were enrolled onto one
      of two cohorts with whole brain dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions with SIB to total of 45 Gy in
      10 fractions to gross brain metastatic disease or whole brain dose of 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions
      with SIB to total of 52.5 Gy in 15 fractions to gross brain metastatic disease. A total of 12
      patients have been previously enrolled on this trial. No patients have experienced a dose
      limiting toxicity (grade 3 or above) at least possibly due to study therapy. Also, no
      patients experienced local brain failure/progression at a site of treated metastatic brain
      disease. Based on this, we no longer feel that dose escalation to the gross brain disease is
      warranted and would proceed with a single arm pilot study treating patients with 25 Gy in 10
      fractions to the whole brain with simultaneous infield boost (SIB) to a total of 45 Gy in 10
      fractions to gross brain metastatic disease.

    <time_frame>Length of treatment for feasibility); at 2 yrs for locoregional control</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment plans using the RapidArc treatment planning software to deliver simultaneous in-field boosts to gross metastatic lesions have been successfully generated in our department. Therefore, the main question of feasibility is regarding whether the treatment setup and delivery can be accomplished in a &quot;reasonable&quot; period of time. A typical treatment slot for conventional radiation therapy in our department is 15 minutes. We will define 2 treatment slots, or 30 minutes as a &quot;reasonable&quot; time for this treatment. Therefore, this treatment will considered feasible if the treatment setup/delivery time is &lt;30 minutes in &gt;90% of treatment fractions. Purpose is to also determine the locoregional control defined as non-progression of gross metastatic brain lesions and areas of brain not involved with gross lesions seen on brain MRI treated with dose escalated simultaneous infield boost and lower &quot;prophylactic&quot; whole brain radiation dose, respectively.</description>
