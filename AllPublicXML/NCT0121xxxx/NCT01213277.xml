    <textblock>
      HbA1c is used as a gold standard to see whether patients have optimal glycemic control.
      Today, many physicians rely solely on HbA1c to change medication. However, there is a select
      group of patients that have low average glucose levels but high HbA1c levels. The
      investigators believe that these patients are fast glycators meaning that they incorporate
      sugar into their hemoglobin faster than normal. The investigators want to determine whether
      these patients are fast glycators.
