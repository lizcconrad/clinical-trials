    <textblock>
      Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is one of the most common of oral mucosa diseases that
      affects approximately 20% of the general population. Despite the fact that clinical,
      pathologic and therapeutic feature of the disease has been comprehensively studied, the
      pathophysiology of aphthous ulcers remains incompletely understood.

      Zinc is a potent catalyst of wound healing and zinc deficiency may be a common cause of
      delayed tissue repair. Use of zinc sulfate in promotion wound healing and preservation of
      epithelial integrity advocated its possible use in the treatment or prevention of recurrent
      oral ulcers.

      The purpose of the present study was to determine of systemic zinc sulphate in the treatment
      of recurrent aphthous stomatitis.

      Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of man characterized by
      painful ulceration recurring with varying frequency. The pathophysiology of aphthous ulcers
      remains partly understood. The primary disorder appears to be the result of activation of the
      cell-mediated immune system. Aphthous ulcers may have abnormalities in cell communication and
      epithelial integrity. The diagnosis of aphthous ulcers is primarily clinical. Aphthous ulcers
      occur on areas of nonkeratinized mucosa of the mouth particularly the buccal mucosa, the
      labial mucosa, the floor of the mouth, the ventral surface of the tongue, and the soft
      palate. The treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) still remains unclear and is
      based mainly on experimental data. The purpose of therapy include the management of pain and
      functional injury by suppressing inflammatory responses, in addition to reducing the
      frequency of recurrences or keeping away from the onset of new ulcers .Zinc has been
      identified as an important factor in repair of tissue.After considerable searching zinc was
      recognized as the beneficial impurity and a effective factor in healing .The goal of this
      study is to present the efficiency of dietary zinc supplements in the rate of Recurrent
      aphthous stomatitis healing.

    <description>patients with clinical signs and symptoms of RAS , in whom clinical diagnosis was accompanied with low level of zinc serum were selected for the study. Gender, age, medical history, symptoms, types and site, number, size, pain level, intervals, disease duration and form of treatment were recorded for all participants. Patients were randomly divided into two groups . The case group (n=7) received a single dose of zinc sulphate in the form of 220 mg capsules for 1 month ,while starch-containing placebo was administered with the same dosage and period in the control group.
The clinical data were scored according to the size of lesions were scored subjectively.
the symptomatology score was obtained using a visual analogue scale(VAS). All participants in both groups were examined up to 5 months in order to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. At the end of fifth month the serum zinc level was tested again.</description>
