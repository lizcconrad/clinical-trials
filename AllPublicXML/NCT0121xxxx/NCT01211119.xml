    <textblock>
      Currently, most knee meniscal tears are treated by partial or complete meniscectomy, or by
      suture repair when it is possible. Recently, the investigators have successfully developed
      and implanted a novel biomaterial, platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), to treat articular cartilage
      defect in pigs. The PRF is autogenesis as a natural fibrin-based biomaterial favorable to the
      development of microvascularization and enables local and progressive delivery of growth
      factors providing unique properties for tissue remodeling and wound healing. The advantages
      of using PRF implantation include no transplant rejection and no need to perform second
      operation. Knee meniscal repair using PRF has not been reported before. The aim of this study
      is to investigate whether PRF implantation can facilitate regeneration process of
      meniscectomized knee and T2-map MRI can monitor the process in those patients with meniscal
      tears.

      A total of 18 adult patients with torn menisci (outer 1/3, posterior horn, medial meniscus)
      will be recruited and randomly divided into three groups: A (n=6), implantation of PRF after
      partial menisectomy; B (n=6), implantation of PRF after partial menisectomy and suture; C
      (n=6), partial menisectomy only. All studied knee will be scanned on a 1.5-T MRI with surface
      coil at baseline before surgery, 3 months and 6 months and 12 months after surgery.

      The investigators believe that PRF enables to facilitate regeneration of meniscectomized
      knee, and T2-map MRI enables monitoring healing process of meniscal tears.
