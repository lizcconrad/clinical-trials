  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether panitumumab in combination with
      capecitabine/oxaliplatin are effective as first-line treatment in wild-type k-ras, metastatic
      colorectal cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm trial in which previously untreated, wild-type k-ras metastatic
      colorectal cancer patients will receive therapy with the combination of panitumumab with
      capecitabine and oxaliplatin. During the treatment period of 6 cycles, subjects with evidence
      of complete response, partial response or stable disease will continue to receive the
      combination of chemotherapy with panitumumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity
      or withdrawal of consent. Those patients with disease stabilization who are not appropriate
      for chemotherapy may continue with panitumumab alone. Patients with disease progression will
      be discontinued from chemotherapy and panitumumab and will be followed every 3 months after
      the last drug administration until death. Tumor response will be assessed according to the
      RECIST criteria (investigator's read of scans), every 6 weeks through week 18 and every 3
      months thereafter, until disease progression. Disease progression will also be evaluated
      radiographically at the time of clinical suspicion of progression.

    <description>Response will be evaluated using the RECIST criteria. Response rates will be presented as counts and proportions along with 95% exact confidence intervals.
An Objective Response is defined as either a Complete Response or a Partial Response. Analysis will be performed in the intent-to-treat population, i.e. all eligible patients enrolled in the study.</description>

    <time_frame>Tumor response will be assessed every 6 weeks through week 18 and every 3 months thereafter, until disease progression.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be calculated from the date of enrolment to the date of disease progression, or death, or last contact. Deaths without a documented progression will be treated as events at the time of death for the PFS analysis.
Time to event distributions will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>The purpose of economic evaluation will be to estimate the total treatment cost of therapy and its componenents from perspective of the health care system and payers. Thus, all resources consumed will be valued to get an idea of the financial implications of therapy.</description>
