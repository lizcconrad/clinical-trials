    <description>Tolvaptan tablets (as multiples of 15 or 30 mg) will be given orally twice daily until the last subject originating from the 156-04-251 trial who is eligible for efficacy analysis has completed the Month 24 visit. Dosing should occur on waking and approximately 9 hours later, irrespective of meals. Exact timing of dosing may be adjusted based on wake/sleep habits (eg, standard 8 AM and 5 PM may be switched to 10 PM and 7 AM if working a night shift). However, dosing times should be consistent for each individual's daily dose to maximize receptor suppression.Subjects should be titrated to the highest dose tolerated unless an equivalent dose was not tolerated and was associated with a significant adverse event in a prior trial. For example, the following titration schedule could be followed:
Day 0 - 45/15 mg split-dose regimen assigned Week 1 - tolerated dose, up-titrate to 60/30 mg Week 2 - tolerated dose, up-titrate to 90/30 mg Week 3 - tolerated dose, 90/30 mg continued.</description>
