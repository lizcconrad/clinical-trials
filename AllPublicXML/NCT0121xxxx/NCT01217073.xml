  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the hypothesis that treatment with study medication
      (omarigliptin; MK-3102) provides greater reduction in A1C Hemoglobin (a marker of diabetic
      severity) compared with placebo, after 12 weeks of treatment. The study will evaluate 5
      different doses of omarigliptin to identify which dose is the most effective in the treatment
      of type 2 diabetes.

      MK-3102-006-Ext 1 added a 66-week extension to the base study (MK-3102 P006) to assess the
      long-term safety and tolerability of omarigliptin. To be eligible for the extension,
      participants must complete the double-blind base study, must have had at least a 75%
      compliance with study drug during the base study and can not meet any of the criteria for
      discontinuation. Participants randomized to placebo in the base study will be switched in a
      blinded manner to pioglitazone 30 mg once daily, in the extension study prior to
      implementation of amendment P006-13. Once amendment P006-13 has been IRB/IEC approved and
      blinded metformin drug supply is available at the site, participants will be switched from
      pioglitazone to metformin, starting at 500 mg once daily and titrated up to 1000 mg twice
      daily. Participants with a contraindication to metformin will be discontinued from the study.
      Participants randomized to 0.25 mg, 1 mg, 3 mg, and 10 mg of omarigliptin in the base study
      will be switched to omarigliptin 25 mg; those randomized to 25 mg of omarigliptin in the base
      study will continue on the same dose in the extension study. After the clinical dose of
      omarigliptin selected for further development has been identified based upon the results of
      the base study, all participants randomized to omarigliptin will be switched to the
      identified clinical dose.
