    <textblock>
      This study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, students from the University of
      Nantes completed the two assessment tools of gambling related cognitions (GABS : Gambling
      Attitudes and Beliefs Survey ; GRCS : Gambling Related Cognitions Scale), and a reference
      tool for gambling problem severity (SOGS : South Oaks Gambling Screen). In the second stage,
      consecutive pathological gamblers seeking treatment at the University Hospital of Nantes
      completed the three questionnaires. Only questionnaires from participants who reported
      gambling at least one time in the past year were kept for analyses.Responses of students
      gamblers and pathological gamblers presenting for treatment have been compiled for
      analysis.The main objective of the study is to validate the French adaptations of the GABS
      and the GRCS, and to explore their psychometric properties and structures.
