  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral ankle sprain (LAS) is one of the most common injuries in sports. There is a unique
      style of socks that have become popular in Japan among athletes that could also improve
      postural control. The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of five-toed
      socks on dynamic postural control in individuals with and without chronic ankle instability.

      Lateral ankle sprain (LAS) is one of the most common injuries in sports. Ankle braces and
      orthotic insoles also have been shown to influence the neuromuscular control system by
      enhancing the proprioceptive and cutaneous afferent inputs to the central nerve system;
      thereby improving postural control. There is a unique style of socks that have become popular
      in Japan among athletes that could also improve postural control by enhancing cutaneous
      afferent inputs from the plantar surface of the foot and toes. The purpose of the study is to
      determine the effectiveness of five-toed socks on dynamic postural control in individuals
      with and without chronic ankle instability.

    <description>The primary outcome measurement for this study will be to determine differences in Center of Pressure (COP) and static postural control patterns in individuals with and without CAI during the single limb balance test. Additionally, performance will be compared with eyes-open and eyes-closed.</description>
