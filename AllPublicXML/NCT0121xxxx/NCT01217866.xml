    <textblock>
      Retrospective charts review from one surgeon to compare Group A- cases where the laparoscopic
      portion of the case used an EN~SEAL device to Group B - the laparoscopic BSO was done using a
      3mm EN-SEAL device through 2 lateral 5mm ports.

      79 women with benign uterine disease underwent laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy
      with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Subjects charts were divided into two groups
      based on surgical technique and the following parameters were reviewed retrospectively:
      surgical time, blood loss, uterine weight, patient weight, patient age, post operative fever
      &gt;100.4 F, readmission to hospital within one week, return to operating room within 24 hours,
      length of hospital stay, and blood transfusion. Group A, N=35 used traditional suture
      technique vaginally. Group B, N=44 used Enseal coagulation cutting device vaginally.
