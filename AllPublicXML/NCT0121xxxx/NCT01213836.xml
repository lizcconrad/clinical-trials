    <textblock>
      This will be a phase IV 20 -32 day prospective, double blind, double-dummy, randomised
      crossover study that will evaluate the effect of quetiapine XR and quetiapine IR on cognitive
      performance in patients with schizophrenia stabilized on a single antipsychotic medication.

    <measure>Mean for Attentional Standardised Composite Score Based on Performance Scores From the CogState Test Battery Domains Detection (Speed of Processing)and Identification (Attention/Vigilance)</measure>
    <time_frame>Period 1 at 3 visits,(post 1),(post 2),(post 3), in a 5-day (maximum 8 day) period. Period 2 at 3 visits,(post 1),(post 2),(post 3), in a 5-day (maximum 8 day) period.</time_frame>
    <description>Attentional standardised composite score: Standardised speed of performance score. Higher Score=better performance. Score range minus infinity to plus infinity. Measured at baseline (before study drug administration) and in Period 1 at 3 visits,(post 1),(post 2),(post 3), in a 5-day (maximum 8 day) period. (Last test day not earlier than after 10 days of randomised)and in Period 2 at 3 visits,(post 1),(post 2),(post 3), in a 5-day (maximum 8 day) period.

    <measure>Mean Treatment Satisfaction for Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire of Medication (TSQM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before taking study drug, end of Period 1 and end of Period 2</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM is a 14-item questionnaire with 4 sub-scales: effectiveness of the medication; treatment side effects; convenience of the medication; global satisfaction with the medication. Scale range 0-100 for each sub-scale, higher=greater satisfaction/milder side effects/greater convenience/greater overall satisfaction.
There are 2 measurement, (after the start of taking study drug) one at end of period 1 and one at end of period 2. That is one measurement per patient per treatment. The mean of all the patients is presented, one mean value per treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Mean Overall Sedation as Measured by the Modified Bond-Lader Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) When Administered According to Label</measure>
    <time_frame>Period 1 at 3 visits,(post 1),(post 2),(post 3), in a 5-day (maximum 8 day) period. Period 2 at 3 visits,(post 1),(post 2),(post 3), in a 5-day (maximum 8 day) period.</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Bond-Lader VAS: The degree of sedation was marked by the patient on a 100 mm VAS ranging between Alert (=0 mm) and Drowsy (=100 mm). The marked length in millimetres.
There are 3 assessments made in each period (post 1, 2 and 3 for each period). That is three measurements per patient per treatment. The mean is an overall mean of all the recordings in all patients, one mean value per treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Mean Overall Sedation as Measured by the Stanford Sleepiness Scale When Administered According to Label</measure>

    <description>Stanford Sleepiness Scale: The sleepiness was assessed by the patient on a 7 item rating scale ranging from 1 (Feeling active and vital) to 7 (Almost in reverie).
There are 3 assessments made in each period (post 1, 2 and 3 for each period). That is three measurements per patient per treatment. The mean is an overall mean of all the recordings in all patients, one mean value per treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Mean Ratio of Morning Plasma Concentration of Quetiapine and Nor-quetiapine for Quetiapine IR and Quetiapine XR, at Steady-state Conditions in the End of Each Treatment Period 1 and 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Period 1, end of Period 2</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio was derived as individual plasma concentration of quetiapine divided by the plasma concentration of nor-quetiapine. The mean ratio was derived for each treatment, XR and IR, respectively.</description>

        <description>TSQM is a 14-item questionnaire with 4 sub-scales: effectiveness of the medication; treatment side effects; convenience of the medication; global satisfaction with the medication. Scale range 0-100 for each sub-scale, higher=greater satisfaction/milder side effects/greater convenience/greater overall satisfaction.
There are 2 measurement, (after the start of taking study drug) one at end of period 1 and one at end of period 2. That is one measurement per patient per treatment. The mean of all the patients is presented, one mean value per treatment group.</description>

          <title>Mean Treatment Satisfaction for Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire of Medication (TSQM)</title>
          <description>TSQM is a 14-item questionnaire with 4 sub-scales: effectiveness of the medication; treatment side effects; convenience of the medication; global satisfaction with the medication. Scale range 0-100 for each sub-scale, higher=greater satisfaction/milder side effects/greater convenience/greater overall satisfaction.
There are 2 measurement, (after the start of taking study drug) one at end of period 1 and one at end of period 2. That is one measurement per patient per treatment. The mean of all the patients is presented, one mean value per treatment group.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS)used for efficacy analysis included all patients who in both study periods, received at least 1 dose of investigational product and for whom post-dose efficacy data was available.</population>
