    <textblock>
      Extravasation is an unintentional injection or leakage of fluids in the perivascular or
      subcutaneous space. Extravasation can be associated with tissue injury with various level of
      severity and long term consequences. Currently the confirmation of intravenous location of
      the Intravenous (IV) catheter requires close observation of the insertion site with
      sufficient infiltration in the perivascular area to allow detection of swelling,
      discoloration and discomfort. Under Anesthesia direct observation is frequently prohibited.
      IV sodium bicarbonate (SB) is used frequently to treat different metabolic conditions and is
      known to cause a temporary elevation of exhaled carbon dioxide. This study aim is to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of intravenous SB as a detector of intravenous placement of an IV
      line in anesthetized patients.

      Patients and Methods: The study has three parts, in part 1, the safety of subcutaneous
      injection of sodium bicarbonate was evaluated in 6 rats. In each animal the macroscopic and
      microscopic effects were evaluated and a safe dilution was determined. In the second part of
      the study the investigators will evaluated the efficacy of IV diluted SB to detect the proper
      location of IV catheters. 20 adult patients age 20 to 50 years will be enrolled. Patients all
      under general anesthesia with standard controlled ventilation via endotracheal tube. The
      correct placement of IV catheter will be confirmed by easy aspiration of blood from newly
      placed IV catheter. In each patient a bolus of 50 cc of 0.5 meq/cc SB or volume equivalent of
      normal saline will be injected in random order. The data collection will include patient's
      demographics, the presence or absence of an increase in the expired end-tidal carbon dioxide,
      onset and peak changes of end-tidal carbon dioxide as well as the hemodynamic changes after
      each injection.
