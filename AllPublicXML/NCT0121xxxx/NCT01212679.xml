  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic bain injury(TBI) remains a hidden epidemic involving individuals affected
      predominantly at a young age who in the most severe cases remain with permanent
      physical,psychological and cognitive deficits.This study will investigate the therapeutic
      effects of intranasal Nerve Growth Factor(NGF) in TBI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early NGF concentration in the cerebral spinal fluid(CSF)correlates significantly with the
      severity of head injury, and NGF upregulation correlates with better neurologic outcomes and
      could be useful to obtain clinical and prognostic information in patients with serve TBI.

      However, the clinical use of NGF is difficulty associated with delivering them to the CNS
      because of the existing of blood-brain barrier(BBB). Intranasal delivery drug is a
      noninvasive and convenient novel method bypassing BBB, which results in targeting
      therapeutics to the CNS rapidly.

      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trail of NGF, starting
      between 24 to 72 hours post TBI, continuing for 2 weeks.
