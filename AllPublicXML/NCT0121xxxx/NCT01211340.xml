      The ACTIVE Intervention to Improve Hospice Caregiver Pain Management The major goal of this
      project is to implement and test this promising intervention in three hospice programs. The
      mixed methods evaluation of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) will provide
      evidence-based data for a tested intervention manual that hospice staff members can use to
      integrate the intervention into their practices.

      The ACTIVE Intervention to Improve Hospice Caregiver Pain Management The major goal of this
      project is to implement and test this promising intervention in three hospice programs. The
      mixed methods evaluation of this RCT will provide evidence-based data for a tested
      intervention manual that hospice staff members can use to integrate the intervention into
      their practices. We will rigorously test the effectiveness of the ACTIVE intervention. We
      will investigate whether the assessment of the informal caregivers perception of pain
      management will identify those who will benefit most and whether changes in the perceptions
      of informal caregivers will result in improvement of patient pain. We will explore barriers
      and challenges in the implementation of this into every day practice within hospice

    <measure>Caregiver Perceptions of Pain Medicine Questionaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 14 days until the death of the patient for an average of 45 days-Only measure used in analysis is the last completed measure</time_frame>
    <description>This 16 question instrument measures the perceptions hospice caregivers have toward the administration of pain medications. Scores on items vary from 1-5 with the lower scores indicating more problematic perceptions of pain management. A Total score is computed between 16-80 Only the last available measure will be used to reflect the measure closest to time of death.</description>

Scores on items vary from 1-5 with the lower scores indicating more problematic perceptions of pain management. A Total score is computed between 16-80 Only the last available measure will be used to reflect the measure closest to time of death.</description>
