    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to test whether offering pregnant smokers a high intensity
      intervention for smoking cessation increases the rate of smoking cessation at the third
      trimester of pregnancy, compared to low intensity intervention for smoking cessation that is
      the usual care, control condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial that compares the efficacy of a proactive
      pregnancy-tailored high intensity intervention for smoking cessation, with a usual care low
      intensity intervention, that is the control condition.

      Intervention group participants will receive a high intensity intervention, which includes:
      30 minutes of cognitive-behavioural intervention delivered by a trained health care
      professional through out the first 24 weeks of gestation and a self-help manual especially
      tailored for smoking cessation during pregnancy. Control group participants will receive 5
      minutes of low intensity intervention.

      Participants' smoking status will be biochemically validated with urine cotinine and nicotine
      both at the baseline and at the 32nd week of gestation, expired carbon monoxide (CO) will be
      measured only at the baseline. After childbirth the infants' birth weight, the premature
      birth and any other complications in pregnancy and childbirth will be recorded. No medication
      is going to be used.

      <recruitment_details>This research took place in two hospitals situated in the area of Attici, Greece namely through the Peripheral General Maternity Hospital ‘Helena Venizelos’ and the Maternity Unit of the ‘Attikon’ University Hospital. Recruitment lasted from November 2009- February 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Sixty-six enrolled participants were excluded from the trial before assignment to groups because 36 of them did not meet the inclusion criteria and 30 of them refused to participate.</pre_assignment_details>
