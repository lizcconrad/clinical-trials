    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether obese, normal weight, and successful weight loss
      maintainers differ in their food choice decision-making and/or executive function, and
      whether participation in a behavioral weight loss program leads to neural and/or behavioral
      changes. The investigators will examine behavioral performance on several tasks involving
      decision-making and self-control in conjunction with brain imaging data acquired during a
      food-choice decision-making task. Participants enrolled in the behavioral weight loss program
      will also be assessed following the treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  women, ages 35-55, who are either currently obese (BMI = 30-40 kg/m2), always normal
             weight (lifetime BMI &lt; 25, NW) or successful weight loss maintainers who have lost 10%
             of their body weight and maintained that loss for at least 1 year (lifetime maximum
             BMI = 30-40 kg/m2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  weight loss medications, binge eating, standard MRI contraindications (e.g., metal
             implants, claustrophobia, pregnancy), left-handedness, food allergies, neurological or
             psychiatric conditions, including but not limited to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
             epilepsy, stroke and traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness, and, among
             obese participants, inability to participate at two time points and lack of interest
             in participating in a behavioral weight loss trial

          -  serious current physical disease (e.g., heart disease and cancer) for which physician
             supervision of diet and exercise prescription is needed, physical problems that limit
             the ability to exercise, participation in a weight loss program in the last 2 months
             and intention to become pregnant in the next 6 months
