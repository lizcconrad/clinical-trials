      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study

      Patients will be enrolled into one of two parallel cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: impaired renal function AND poor performance status (cycle length = 28 days).
           Everolimus 10 mg orally daily

        -  Cohort 2: impaired renal function OR poor performance status (cycle length = 28 days).
           Everolimus 10 mg orally daily + IV Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on D1, 8, 15

      Restaging evaluations will be performed after every 2 cycles.

      Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Karnofsky performance status 60-70%

      Renal:

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance of &lt; 60 using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

      Cardiovascular:

        -  No symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York heart Association Class III or IV.

        -  No unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction

          -  No uncontrolled diabetes as defined by fasting serum glucose &gt;1.5 x ULN.

          -  No impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of everolimus (e.g., ulcerative disease,

             resection).

          -  No active, bleeding diathesis.
