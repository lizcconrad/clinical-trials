      Background:

      - Gene therapy is being investigated as a possible treatment for individuals with
      immunodeficiency diseases or other conditions that make it difficult to fight off infection.
      Gene therapy avoids problems with donor identification and possible rejection of bone marrow
      transplant by using the patient s own modified blood cells to help treat the disease.
      Researchers are interested in collecting stem cells from the blood of individuals with
      immunodeficiency diseases in order to use the cells to develop potential gene therapy
      treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To collect blood stem cells from patients with immunodeficiency diseases tto test our
      ability to correct the defects of these cells in the test tube. .

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 40 years of age with immunodeficiency diseases.

        -  Individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will not be able to participate in
           this study.

      Design:

        -  Participants will provide an initial blood sample for disease screening (such as
           hepatitis B and C, syphilis, or viruses like the Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex
           virus, or toxoplasmosis) and to check kidney and liver function.

        -  Starting 5 days before blood donation, participants will receive daily injections of a
           drug called G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor, or filgrastim), which pushes
           stem cells out of the bone marrow and into the bloodstream. Participants will receive
           the injections at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

        -  On day 5, participants will have a single leukapheresis procedure to collect the stem
           cells from the blood.

        -  No additional treatment will be provided as part of this protocol. The cells that are
           collected will be used fore experiments in the lab and will not be used to treat
           individuals with these diseases.

      BACKGROUND:

      Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) represent candidate genetic disorders for new
      therapeutic approaches. Our laboratory is developing gene therapy for patients with PID using
      autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Gene therapy may circumvent problems with
      allogeneic HSC transplantation, especially graft rejection and graft-versus-host-disease. We
      are particularly interested in three PID: Dedicator of CytoKinesis-8 (DOCK8) deficiency,
      Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency type 1 (LAD-1), and GATA2 Deficiency. For DOCK8 deficiency, and
      LAD-1, the disease gene has been cloned. The genetic basis for MonoMAC has now been
      determined to be due to mutations in GATA2.. Testing new vector constructs and transduction
      conditions for gene therapy would be considerably enhanced by the acquisition of peripheral
      blood CD34+ cells from patients with these immunodeficiency diseases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To provide a source of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral
      blood CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) for laboratory research studies including
      optimization of vector and transduction conditions for gene therapy for DOCK8 deficiency,
      LAD-1, and MonoMAC.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Patients 15-40 years old with DOCK8 deficiency, LAD-1, and MonoMAC who meet the eligibility
      requirements will be considered for this protocol.

      DESIGN:

      Patients 15-40 years old with DOCK8 deficiency, LAD-1, and MonoMAC will receive five days of
      G-CSF followed by a single apheresis. CD34+ cell will be selected and frozen in aliquots by
      the Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine. No treatments, or
      investigational therapy will be administered on this protocol.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Patient age of 15-40 years.

        DOCK8 Deficiency

        Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the DOCK8 gene.

        LAD-1

        GATA2 Deficiency

          -  Onset of immunodeficiency disease beyond infancy.

          -  Clinical history of at least two episodes of life-threatening infection with
             opportunistic organisms.
