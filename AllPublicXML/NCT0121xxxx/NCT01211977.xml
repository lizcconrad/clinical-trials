      Background:

        -  Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses that produce episodes of inflammation such as
           fever, rash, or joint swelling. Some of these diseases can be treated with medications
           that block the body's reaction to a protein called IL-1, which may be part of the cause
           of the inflammation. IL-1 blocking agents are very helpful in treating autoinflammatory
           diseases and have become the standard of care for treatment for some of these diseases.
           However, more research is needed on related diseases that may be treated with new and
           currently used IL-1 blocking agents.

        -  XOMA 052 is an experimental drug that is currently being tested as a possible treatment
           for type 2 diabetes. Initial studies have shown that XOMA 052 neutralizes a specific
           kind of IL-1, and is also active against certain indicators of inflammation. Researchers
           are interested in determining whether XOMA 052 can be used to treat autoinflammatory and
           related diseases.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the effectiveness of XOMA 052 as a treatment for inflammation in adults with
      the autoinflammatory diseases Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS)/Muckle-Wells
      Syndrome (MWS) and Behcet's Disease.

      Eligibility:

        -  FCAS/ MWS: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a known history of the typical
           disease.

        -  Behcet's Disease: Individuals at least 18 years of age who have evidence of active
           disease, such as oral or genital ulcers or eye disease.

      Design:

      FCAS/MWS Participants

        -  Participants will have an overnight evaluation of their disease, including optional
           tests (e.g., eye or skin exams). Participants who currently take medications to treat
           their symptoms will stop taking the medication and will be monitored by study
           researchers. At the first flare of symptoms, participants will begin to receive XOMA
           052.

        -  Participants will have further tests on days 3, 7, and 10 after the initial dose of XOMA
           052. If the disease remains under good control, participants will have a clinical exam
           every 5 days for up to 10 weeks until another disease flare occurs (determined either by
           symptoms or by inflammation observed in laboratory studies). If the disease is not well
           controlled with the initial dose of XOMA 052, participants will have additional doses
           starting at day 7 until either the disease is controlled or researchers determine that
           the medication is not effective.

        -  Participants will have the option to continue XOMA 052 treatments for up to 1 year. XOMA
           052 wil...

      Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses characterized by episodes of inflammation that,
      unlike autoimmune disorders, lack the production of high titer autoantibodies or
      antigen-specific T cells. There is growing genetic and clinical evidence that Interleukin-1
      (IL-1) plays a pathogenic role in several of these diseases. This exploratory study aims to
      examine the utility of the experimental drug candidate, XOMA 052 (XOMA (US), LLC) in the
      treatment of adult subjects with the autoinflammatory disorders familial cold
      autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) or Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS) associated with mutations in
      cryopyrin-encoding CIAS1 and in adult subjects with Behcet's Disease (BD), a disease which
      may be responsive to IL-1 blockade. XOMA 052 is a human recombinant IL-1beta antibody with
      picomolar affinity for IL-1beta and a beta half-life of 22.4 days in humans. This agent is
      currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes and initial
      studies have shown activity against clinical and biochemical indicators of inflammation.

      This pilot study is designed to address: 1) the utility of XOMA 052 in the treatment of FCAS
      / MWS, in a disease known to respond to IL-1 blockade (FCAS / MWS) as shown by a response to
      treatment with anakinra (Kineret(Registered Trademark), recombinant IL-1 receptor
      antagonist), rilonacept (Arcalyst(Registered Trademark), IL-1 Trap, a fusion protein of the
      IL-1 receptor and the Fc portion of IgG), and canakinumab (Ilaris(Registered Trademark),
      IL-1beta blocking antibody); the latter two FDA approved for the treatment of this condition;
      2) the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of treatment with XOMA 052 in FCAS / MWS; 3) the effect
      of XOMA 052 on laboratory biomarkers in BD; and 4) an exploratory assessment of the utility
      of XOMA 052 in the treatment of BD.

      For FCAS / MWS, biochemical and clinical correlates of autoinflammatory disease will be
      measured at baseline following withdrawal of currently used IL-1 inhibitors. Subjects will
      receive a course of therapy with XOMA 052 that is predicted to provide an estimated 4 weeks
      of anti-inflammatory activity. If a favorable response is obtained, the continuation phase
      will last twelve months. For BD, subjects will receive XOMA 052 for three to six months and
      patients with a positive response will then be randomized to withdrawal or continuation of
      drug for six months. Clinical and biochemical correlates of inflammation will be measured in
      both patient groups at appropriate intervals to assess response and to further elucidate
      disease mechanisms.

             undue risk for the subject's safety, inhibit protocol participation, or interfere with
             interpretation of study results, and in the judgment of the investigator would make
             the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.
