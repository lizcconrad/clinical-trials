    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety of
      a von Willebrand Factor/Factor VIII (VWF/FVIII), Biostate, in children with Von Willebrand
      disease (VWD) in whom treatment with a VWF product is required for prophylactic therapy,
      haemostatic control during surgery, or control of a non-surgical, spontaneous, or traumatic
      bleeding event.
