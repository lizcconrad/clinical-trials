      Purpose: To investigate the relationship between retinal thickness (RT) and metabolic risks
      (MRs) in patients without retinal lesion.

      Methods: Fifty-two patients over 60 y/o were divided into four groups according to their MRs
      of hypertension, hyperlipidemia or hyperglyceremia. After complete ophthalmic examination,
      optical coherence tomography was performed to measure RT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We enrolled the patients included age more than 60 years old, no positive finding
             during dilated fundus examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria were as followed:

               -  systemic disease that will affect visual acuity evaluation (for example: CVA),
                  *opaque cornea and vitreous

               -  glaucoma

               -  uvietis and other clinically established ocular disease.

          -  According to the LOCS III11, those who had nuclear opalescence, nuclear color more
             than grade 3 or any grade of cortical cataract and posterior subcapsular cataract were
             also eliminated.
