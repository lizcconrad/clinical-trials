      This study is designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the 2010-2011 NH season
      formulation of intradermal (ID) influenza vaccine as part of a post registration commitment.

      Objectives:

        -  For all groups, to evaluate compliance, in terms of immunogenicity, of the corresponding
           strength of the intradermal (ID) or intramuscular (IM) influenza vaccine Northern
           Hemisphere (NH) 2010 2011 formulation with the requirements of the Committee for Human
           Medicinal Products (CHMP) Note for Guidance (NfG) CPMP/BWP/214/96

        -  For all groups, to describe the safety

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive a single dose of study vaccine on Day 0. Immunogenicity data
      will be collected before vaccination and on Day 21 post vaccination. Safety will be assessed
      throughout the study.
