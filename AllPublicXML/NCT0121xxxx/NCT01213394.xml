      The purpose of this research study is to determine if adding or increasing the dose of
      CellCept while lowering the dose of tacrolimus (Prograf or Advagraf) or cyclosporine
      (Neoral), and/or steroids can reduce the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease in
      the next 10 years.

      The investigators will calculate the change in risk of developing coronary heart disease
      using the Framingham score. The Framingham score is a mathematical equation that includes the
      following information: Age, Gender, Diabetes status, Smoking status, Lipids, Blood Pressure.
      The Framingham score estimates how likely it is that someone will develop coronary heart
      disease over the next 10 years.

    <textblock>
      Kidney transplant recipients are required to take medications called immunosuppressants to
      lower their immune systems to help protect the donated kidney. The medications have improved
      over the years and as a result the donated kidneys are generally working longer. This allows
      the Transplant Team to focus more on the long term complications of kidney transplantation
      such as cardiovascular disease.

      There have been few prospective (looking forward) research studies looking at kidney
      transplant recipient cardiovascular risk factors after transplant.

      We know that immunosuppressive medications have a number of serious side effects that can
      increase cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, high lipids (fats
      in the blood), and high blood sugar. Medications such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine and
      prednisone work well to protect the donated kidney but are also known to increase the risk of
      developing or worsening cardiovascular disease.

      CellCept is another type of immunosuppressive agent. CellCept is not associated as much with
      the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

      This is a pilot study being done to collect information about cardiovascular risk factors in
      kidney transplant recipients and to see if adjusting the immunosuppressive medications can
      help to lower the overall risk for developing heart disease in the future.

      This research study plans to enroll 45 participants from 2 different transplant centres in
      Canada: St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and St. Paul's Hospital in Saskatoon. The study
      duration is approximately 7 months per participant. The study will be looking for
      participants who are 30 years of age or older and who are at least 6 months after the
      transplant operation.

    <description>Introduction of CellCept or increase in the dose of CellCept to a maximum of 2 g/day. In patients not already receiving CellCept, azathioprine (AZA), enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) or sirolimus (SRL) will be discontinued and replaced by CellCept in divided doses to a maximum of 2 g/day. CNI doses will be reduced to conform to the target trough levels in the low-dose CNI arms of the ELITE-Symphony study +/- steroid dose reduction. Any CNI dose change will require measurement of CNI trough levels at 7 days post dose change +/- 3 days.
Target CNI trough levels in the Symphony study:
Low-dose CsA: Initial oral dose of 1-2 mg/kg bid, to achieve a target trough level of 50-100 ng/mL.
Low-dose TAC: Initial oral dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day divided into two doses* with a target trough level of 3-7 ng/mL (*Advagraf may also be used at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg once daily with a target trough level of 3-7 ng/mL)</description>
