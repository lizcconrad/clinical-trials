  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies in Western country show that triple-negative breast cancer has aggressive
      clinical and pathological features compared with non-triple negative breast cancer, including
      onset at a young age, advanced clinical stage, high histologic and nuclear grade and more
      distant recurrence.

      According to the characteristics of triple negative breast tumor, the TNBC patients can
      benefit neither from hormonal therapies nor from target therapies against Her2 receptors. The
      only systemic therapy currently available is chemotherapy, and prognosis remains poor. It
      becomes more and more important to investigate the sensitive chemotherapy regimen for triple
      negative patients.

      Cisplatin-based regimen was active for the patients of lung cancer, colorectal cancer and
      ect. Triple negative breast cancer patients were more sensitive to platinum-based
      chemotherapy regimens according to the results of some retrospective studies.

      The investigators hypothesized that paclitaxel combined with cisplatin is more sensitive to
      triple negative breast cancer compared with CEF followed by docetaxel.

      Eligibility Female adults(&gt;18 years old) are eligible if they had histologically confirmed
      primary breast cancer. Patients also had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) Performance
      status of 0 or 1, absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt;1500/mm3,hemoglobin &gt;8.0g/dL, and platelet
      count &gt;100,000/mm3,creatinine&lt;2.5 times the upper limit of normal(ULN)）, transaminases&lt;2.5
      times ULN or alkaline phosphatase&lt;4 times ULN if transaminases was normal, and total

      malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of cervix or adequately treated nonmelanomatous
      carcinoma of the skin), any documented distant metastasis and uncontrolled systemic diseases.

      to guidelines for good clinical practice and the Helsinki Declaration.All patients provided
      written informed consent.
