  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effect of high intensity non-invasive
      positive pressure ventilation (HINPPV) for stable, hypercapnic COPD patients. The
      investigators believe that HINPPV, used at least 6 hours nocturnally over three months, will
      benefit the stable hypercapnic COPD patient through a reduction in the daytime partial
      pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) levels.

      The High Intensity Non-invasive Positive Pressure trial is a single arm interventional study.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of High Intensity Non-invasive
      ventilation (HINPPV)in stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary patients with chronically
      elevated carbon dioxide levels. Participants will undergo various testing ( ABGs, PFTs, PSGs,
      6 minute walk tests)over a 3 month period to determine if this type of therapy will improve
      daytime carbon dioxide levels. The participants will also complete quality of life
      questionnaires to help ascertain improvements in their daily living activities.

    <description>The High Intensity Non-invasive Pos.Pressure trial is a single arm interventional study. All participants that meet eligibility criteria will receive high intensity non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (HINPPV). Participants will receive HINPPV via bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) if they require an inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) less than or equal to 30 cmH2O; or the Trilogy ventilator if they require an IPAP greater than 30 cmH2O.</description>

    <description>High Intensity Non Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (HINPPV) will be applied to hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients for a period of 3 months. The Respironics bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) Synchrony device has a maximum inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) setting of 30 cmH2O and will be used for all participants in the study. If it is determined through the titration study the participant requires an IPAP greater than 30 cmH2O, they will be placed on the Respironics Trilogy ventilator.</description>
