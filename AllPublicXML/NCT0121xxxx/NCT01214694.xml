  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test two on-line interventions for families of young children
      who have experienced moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). This project builds
      upon the investigators' previous research by modifying the online intervention content to
      address the needs of young children with TBI. The goal of this project is to develop an
      intervention that will encourage positive parenting behaviors, improve child behaviors, and
      reduce parent distress and burden following TBI. The investigators hypothesize that the
      intervention groups will exhibit more effective parenting skills as well as better child
      functioning and lower levels of parental distress at follow-up than will the active
      comparison group.

      The investigators will conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the
      efficacy of 7-week Internet-based Interacting Together Everyday, Recovery after Childhood
      Traumatic Brain Injury Express (I-InTERACT Express) and 24-week long web-based positive
      parenting skills programs Internet-based Interacting Together Everyday, Recovery after
      Childhood Traumatic Brain Injury (I-InTERACT) to an internet resource group (IRC) involving
      access to internet resources and education about brain injury. The project builds upon the
      feasibility and efficacy findings from an ongoing randomized trial comparing the efficacy of
      a 24-week positive parenting skills program to access to internet resources. However, it
      differs in size and scope by including multiple sites, and by including an abbreviated
      parenting skills training arm in response to family feedback that the existing 24-week
      intervention was excessively long, resulting in adherence difficulties. The investigators
      anticipate that the improvements in parenting skills and psychological functioning will
      translate into improved parent-child relationships and reductions in child behavior problems.
      Over time, such improvements in child and parent functioning should contribute to academic
      and social success and more successful community integration.
