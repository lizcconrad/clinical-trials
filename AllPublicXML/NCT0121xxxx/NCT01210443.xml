  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy at 100 mg once daily for oral dose of sitaxentan sodium were
      demonstrated in the STRIDE clinical trial program. Sitaxentan sodium was approved in the EU,
      Canada and Australia. In this study, the long-term safety and efficacy after administrations
      of sitaxentan sodium at a dose of 100 mg alone or in combination with another medication will
      be investigated in Japanese PAH patients.

    Safety Issue: The trial was prematurely terminated on Dec 9, 2010, due to safety concerns,
    specifically new emerging evidence of hepatic injury.

        <population>The efficacy analysis set was defined as all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug during this extension study and have efficacy observations at baseline of the preceding study (B1321052) in any efficacy assessments.
Descriptive statistics for any efficacy endpoints were not calculated due to a small number of participants.</population>
