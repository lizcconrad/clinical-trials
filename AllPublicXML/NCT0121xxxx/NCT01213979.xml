      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmakokinetic properties of higher doses (500 mg
      and 1000 mg) of Monofer(R)in patients suffering from non-hematological malignancies with
      Chemotherapy induced anaemia.

          7. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.

          8. Willingness to participate after informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Anaemia caused primarily by other factors than CIA.

          2. IV or oral iron treatment within 4 weeks prior to screening visit.

          3. Erythrypoietin treatment within 4 weeks prior to screening visit.

          4. Blood transfusion within 4 weeks prior to screening visit.

          5. Imminent expectation of blood transfusion on part of treating physician.

          6. Iron overload or disturbances in utilization of iron (e.g. haemochromatosis and
             haemosiderosis).

          7. Drug hypersensitivity (i.e. previous hypersensitivity to Iron Dextran or iron mono- or
             disaccharide complexes or to iron sulfate).

          8. Known hypersensitivity to any excipients in the investigational drug products.

          9. Subjects with a history of multiple allergies.

         10. Decompensated liver cirrhosis and hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) &gt; 3 times
             upper normal limit).

         11. History of Immunocompromise and/or history of Hepatitis B and/or C.

         12. Active acute or chronic infections (assessed by clinical judgement and if deemed
             necessary by investigator supplied with white blood cells (WBC) and C-reactive protein
             (CRP)).

         13. Rheumatoid arthritis with symptoms or signs of active joint inflammation.

         14. Pregnancy and nursing (To avoid pregnancy, women have to be postmenopausal (at least

             child bearing potential must use one of the following contraceptives during the whole
             study period and after the study has ended for at least 5 times plasma biological
             half-life (5 days) of the investigational medicinal product: Contraceptive pills,
             intrauterine devices (IUD), contraceptive depot injections (prolonged-release
             gestagen), subdermal implantation, vaginal ring, and transdermal patches).

         15. Planned elective surgery during the study.

         16. Participation in any other clinical study (except chemotherapy protocol) within 3
             months prior to screening.

         17. Known intolerance to oral iron treatment.

         18. Untreated B12 or folate deficiency.

         19. Any other medical condition that, in the opinion of Principal Investigator, may cause
             the subject to be unsuitable for the completion of the study or place the subject at
             potential risk from being in the study. Example, Uncontrolled Hypertension, Unstable
             Ischemic Heart Disease or Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus.
