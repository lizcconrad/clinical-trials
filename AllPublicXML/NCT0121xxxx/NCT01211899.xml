  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data on 4G/5G polymorphism of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene are limited in
      Asian patients with sepsis. Therefore, the investigators aim to prospectively investigate the
      incidence of 4G/5G polymorphism and its relationship with disseminated intravascluar
      coagulatin in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
