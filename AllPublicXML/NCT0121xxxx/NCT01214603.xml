    <description>The dose to be evaluated is 40mg LY2090314 administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle for at least two (2) 28 day cycles. Patients experiencing clinical benefit may continue treatment until after the discontinuation criteria are met.
Due to amendment on September 2010, study added two additional treatment schedules. Schedule 1 is a 40 mg dose given on Days 1, 5, and 9 of a 21-day cycle. Schedule 2 is 40 mg dose given on Days 1, 5, 9, and 12 of a 21-day cycle. Participants experiencing clinical benefit may continue treatment until after the discontinuation criteria are met.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have confirmed diagnosis of one of the following:

               -  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that is refractory or relapsed disease. If
                  participants have acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), they must have received
                  prior all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide unless ineligible or
                  intolerant to them

               -  Untreated AML (de novo or arising from a myelodysplastic syndrome). In the
                  opinion of the investigator, the participant should not be a candidate for
                  standard therapy and a clinical trial is a preferred treatment option

          -  Have given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures

          -  Have adequate organ function including:

               -  Hepatic: Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal
                  (ULN). Alkaline phosphatase and transaminases (ALT and AST) less than or equal to
                  5 times ULN

               -  Renal: Serum creatinine less than or equal to the ULN. No known active renal
                  disease. In rare cases, participants may enter treatment with a serum creatinine
                  greater than the ULN as elevations of serum creatinine may be secondary to
                  dehydration

          -  Have a performance status of less than than or equal to 2 on the Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) scale

          -  Have discontinued all previous approved therapies for acute leukemia, including
             chemotherapy for at least 14 days, and recovered from the acute effects of therapy.
             Hydroxyurea used to control peripheral blast count is permitted within the first 2
             cycles of treatment on study, but it must be stopped at least 24 hours before study
             drug administration in Cycle 3

          -  Are reliable and willing to be available for the duration of the study and are willing
             to follow study procedures

          -  Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved
             contraceptive precautions during the trial and for 3 months following the last dose of
             study drug

          -  Females with childbearing potential must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of greater than or equal to 6 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within 14 days of the initial dose of study drug with an
             experimental agent for noncancer indications that has not received regulatory approval
             for any indication

          -  Participants with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) including blast crisis phase

          -  Participants with known central nervous system (CNS) leukemia by spinal fluid cytology
             or imaging

          -  Have serious pre-existing medical conditions (left to the discretion of the
             investigator)

          -  Have one of the following abnormalities: QTc (Fridericia corrected) interval &gt;450
             milliseconds (msec) on screening electrocardiogram (ECG), previous history of QTc
             prolongation with another medication that required discontinuation, congenital long QT
             syndrome, previous history of ventricular tachycardia or unexplained syncope, left
             bundle branch block, or chronic atrial fibrillation

          -  Have family history of long QT syndrome or sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmia

          -  Concomitant medication that may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades de Pointes
             at the time of study entry

          -  Have systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 millimeter of mercury (mm
             Hg) and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg

          -  Have a serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction within 6 months,
             angina, or heart disease, as defined by the New York Heart Association Class II or
             higher or participants with a history of arrhythmia that is symptomatic or requires
             treatment

          -  Have uncorrected electrolyte disorders including potassium

          -  Have other active malignancy (with the exception of basal and squamous cell skin
             cancer) at time of study entry

          -  Have received an autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplant within 75 days of the
             initial dose of study drug

          -  Have uncontrolled systemic infection

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Presence of clinical evidence of viral disease caused by human immunodeficiency virus,
             hepatitis B, or hepatitis C
