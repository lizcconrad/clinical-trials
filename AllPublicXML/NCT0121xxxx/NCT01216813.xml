      RATIONALE: Gathering information from patients who have undergone treatment for upper
      gastrointestinal cancer or gynecological cancer may help doctors learn more about patients'
      physical and psychosocial rehabilitation needs and plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the physical and psychosocial rehabilitation needs
      of patients after diagnosis and treatment of upper gastrointestinal cancer or gynecological
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To explore the patients' perspective of their physical and psychosocial rehabilitation
           needs following the diagnosis and treatment for an upper gastrointestinal or a
           gynecological cancer.

        -  To assess patients' experiences of the physical and social impact of cancer in the
           treatment and post-treatment phase.

        -  To explore patients' met and un-met needs.

        -  To explore the patients' opinion of how it might be possible to manage any of the issues
           that arise.

      Secondary

        -  To generate theories and a hypothesis from the data collected for use in a future
           interventional study.

      OUTLINE: The study consist of a series of focus groups that take place in a private room
      within the Royal Marsden Hospital in the United Kingdom. Patients attend only one focus group
      session, which is audio-tape recorded. The focus groups discuss and explore the patient's
      needs and experiences using a semi-structured interview question schedule over 60-90 minutes.
      The groups are single-sex groups to allow the patients to express themselves freely with
      respect to any sensitive topics they may wish to discuss. If individual patient issues arise
      from the group discussions, the lead researcher may refer the patient to a member of the
      hospital team, the patient's physician, or for appropriate psychological support.

      Data from the focus group dialogue and patients' baseline demographic information are
      analyzed. The results from this study are used to design an interventional study in the
      Rehabilitation Department.
