    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 5168 subjects have been enrolled in this study. Primed subjects had received at least 1 dose of an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine and had received 2 doses of seasonal influenza vaccine. Unprimed subjects had not received any influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine or seasonal influenza vaccine.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The duration of the study was approximately 4-8 weeks to complete enrolment, with at least six months extended safety follow-up (ESFU) after first vaccination, and lasted until the end of the influenza like illness (ILI) surveillance period.</pre_assignment_details>
