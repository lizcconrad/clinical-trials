  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety, pharmacokinetics and effects of GSK1292263 when taken
      alone or when co-dosed with atorvastatin to subjects with dyslipidemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This compound has been studied in healthy subjects and subjects with type II diabetes and is
      now being studied in subjects with dyslipidemia. Because many patients with dyslipidemia are
      on statins, it is important to study how GSK1292263 behaves when taken with a potent statin,
      atorvastatin. The cholesterol lowering drug, ezetimibe, is included for comparison.

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical events that jeopardize the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or a drug-induced liver injury.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected fasting on Days 1 (pre-dose), 7 and 15 prior to checkout (24 hours post-dose), and at Follow-up. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample will be collected (example, when 24 hours post-dose = pre-dose (time 0) for the next dose). Baseline was the closest scheduled value prior to dosing. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value is missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the change from Baseline divided by the Baseline value then multiplied by 100.</description>

             is capable of giving informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea. In questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;140

                  confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms
                  of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the
                  blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
                  confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during
                  the study.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 21 centers in the United States during the period 14 September 2010 to 29 June 2011. There were 6 total participants in Part A, then Part B started with total of 281 participants which flowed through the rest of the phases of the trial. Part B had washout phase and run-In phase followed by treatment phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total 130 participants were randomized and received at least one dose of study drug in the treatment period phase. Part B Run-In excludes those participants randomized to monotherapy arms; that is, these participant counts are only those who were receiving Atorvastatin.</pre_assignment_details>

When this resulted in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected (example, when 24 hours post-dose = pre-dose (time 0) for the next dose). Data for only those parameters (Hematocrit, Hemoglobin and Total neutrophils) are presented for which findings are of PCI either high or low.</description>

        <description>Samples were collected fasting on Day -2, and prior to breakfast (early in the morning, fasting) on Days 2 (pre-dose), 4, 7, 10, 13 and on Day 15 prior to checkout (24 hours post-dose), and at Follow-up. When this resulted in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample was collected (example, when 24 hours post dose = pre-dose (time 0) for the next dose). Data for only those parameters (Glucose, Total bilirubin, Albumin, Magnesium, CO2/HCO3, Calcium, ALT, AST, Inorganic phosphorus, Potassium and Sodium) are presented for which findings are of PCI either high or low.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline for Lipid Metabolism: Apolipoprotein A1 and Apolipoprotein B100 at Day 14</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected fasting on Days 1 (pre-dose), 7 and 15 prior to checkout (24 hours post-dose), and at Follow-up. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample will be collected (example, when 24 hours post-dose = pre-dose (time 0) for the next dose). Baseline was the closest scheduled value prior to dosing. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value is missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the change from Baseline divided by the Baseline value then multiplied by 100.</description>

When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample will be collected (example, when 24 hours post-dose = pre-dose (time 0) for the next dose). Baseline was the closest scheduled value prior to dosing. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value is missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the change from Baseline divided by the Baseline value then multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Lipid Metabolism: LDL/HDL Ratio at Day 14 (24 Hours)</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected fasting on Days 1 (pre-dose), 7 and 15 prior to checkout (24 hours post-dose), and at Follow-up. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample will be collected (example, when 24 hours post-dose = pre-dose (time 0) for the next dose). Baseline was the closest scheduled value prior to dosing. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value is missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the change from Baseline divided by the Baseline value then multiplied by 100.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Lipid Metabolism: LDL/HDL Ratio at Day 14 (24 Hours)</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected fasting on Days 1 (pre-dose), 7 and 15 prior to checkout (24 hours post-dose), and at Follow-up. When this results in multiple samples at the same time point, only one sample will be collected (example, when 24 hours post-dose = pre-dose (time 0) for the next dose). Baseline was the closest scheduled value prior to dosing. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value is missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the change from Baseline divided by the Baseline value then multiplied by 100.</description>
