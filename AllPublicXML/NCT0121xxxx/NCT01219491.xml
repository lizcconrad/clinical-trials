    <textblock>
      To identify the characteristics in an egg donor that are important to a recipient and to see
      if those characteristics change over time.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No study has explored how recipients' attitudes and reactions change over time regarding the
      selection criteria for their donors. Consequently, programs have no guidance in how to
      counsel prospective recipients as to whether their donor preferences will change over time.
      Participants will complete a survey at 4 points in time as they go through the process of
      selecting an egg donor and pursuing a pregnancy using that egg donor.
