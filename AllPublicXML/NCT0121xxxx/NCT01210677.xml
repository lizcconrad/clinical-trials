    <textblock>
      There are no published clinical consensus guidelines on the treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis.
      Corticosteroid therapy is advocated by some experts, but is based on small observational
      studies, with varied clinical response.

      Objectives of this trial:

        -  to systemically assess the response of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis, to treatment
           with corticosteroids

        -  to identify the clinical predictors of response to treatment with corticosteroids

        -  to assess the utility of imaging with PET and MRI to predict response to treatment with
           corticosteroids

        -  to determine the prevalence of cardiac sarcoidosis in young patients with unexplained
           heart block and in patients with unexplained dilated cardiomyopathy associated with
           ventricular tachycardia

        -  to use the data from this pilot study to assess the need, feasibility, and sample size
           for a larger multicentre trial
