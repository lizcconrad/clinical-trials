      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and the preliminary efficacy of treatment
      by the VascuActive device on peripheral diabetic neuropathy, and to correlate this effect
      with physiologic changes.

      Patients will undergo a 4-week period of home treatment by the VascuActive device, and will
      be monitored during this period and during a two-month follow-up period for the efficacy of
      the device in reducing neuropathic pain, sensation impairment and other signs and symptoms.
