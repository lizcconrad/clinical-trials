      lips and on the cheeks when compared to each other in the same patient. The products being
      tested are Juvéderm® Ultra and CosmoDerm® 1.

             allowed at the investigator's discretion;

          -  Concurrent participation in an investigational drug or device study or participation
             within 30 days of study start;

             period;
