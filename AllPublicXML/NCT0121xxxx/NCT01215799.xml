    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of administration of bafetinib in subjects with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), as measured by the objective response rate (ORR), which is a combination of CR (PSA ≤0.12 ng/mL) and PR (≥50% reduction in PSA from baseline).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>At six months.</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of bafetinib in this population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, and vital signs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>At six months.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to first documentation of objective PSA or tumor progression, or to death due to any cause in the absence of previous documentation of objective tumor progression.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males age ≥18 years.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Hormone-refractory prostate cancer having progressed despite androgen deprivation
             therapy that resulted in a castrated level of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL) or orchiectomy;
             with or without evidence of measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  PSA increase defined as 2 consecutive rises; first increase in PSA occurred a minimum
             of 1 week from the reference value; increase in PSA should be at least 25% above the
             reference value and absolute PSA value should be &gt;5 ng/mL.

          -  May have received no more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen. Prior immunomodulatory
             therapy (sipuleucel-t (Provenge), interferon) is allowed.

          -  Must be taking a single agent LHRH agonist or antagonist, unless previously underwent
             orchiectomy.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Able to swallow pills.

             are excluded. Subjects treated with a stable dose of a bisphosphonate for &gt;4 weeks and
             the tumor has still progressed can be enrolled in the study.

          -  Known CNS disease or CNS metastases.

          -  History of other malignancies within the last five years except curatively treated
