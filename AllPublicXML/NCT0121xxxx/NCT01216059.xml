  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis is a common problem faced by patients of all ages and backgrounds.
      Treatment regimens and specific therapies may be time consuming and multiple studies have
      documented a parallel decrease in compliance as time after an office visit increases. The
      adolescent population is an extremely challenging sub-group of patients in terms of complying
      with a treatment regimen. Not only are they striving for independence and thus lacking
      supervision of a regimen by a parent, but their complex thinking skills are immature, leading
      to forgetful behavior. By introducing a reminder system for these vulnerable patients that is
      easily incorporated into their daily lives, the investigators propose that patients will have
      better compliance at applying their medication and thus improving their atopic dermatitis.
      Text-messaging via cell phones has become very popular among teenagers and adults and
      provides a non-obtrusive method of sending a treatment reminder.

      We propose to conduct a randomized, controlled 6-week trial to evaluate the impact of a text
      message-based reminder program on adherence to health maintenance behaviors among adolescents
      diagnosed with Atopic Dermatitis. After obtaining informed consent, subjects will be
      randomized into either an intervention or control group. Subjects in the intervention group
      will receive a daily text message with a tailored message regarding atopic dermatitis, while
      control group subjects will receive a weekly text message with information on local weather,
      sport or news without any reference to atopic dermatitis. Of note, the decision to send a
      weekly text message to the control group reflects the expectation that a message will be
      sent, although the frequency and content of the message will not be revealed.

    <description>We will assess the difference in number of missed doses of topical medication in the control group (weekly unrelated text message) and the intervention group (daily eczema-related text message group). All subjects will record missed doses via calendars (diaries). Those in the intervention group will be able to text on a weekly basis the number of days they forgot their medication that week.</description>
