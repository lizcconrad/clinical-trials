  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence regarding optimal methods of insulin dose adjustment is lacking in the literature.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two approaches to
      escalate prandial insulin therapy in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus not achieving
      adequate glycemic control on basal insulin.

    <textblock>
      Participants who enter the study and are already taking insulin glargine with a screening
      HbA1c &gt;7.0% will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. Both arms will add prandial
      insulin to existing basal insulin therapy.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 24 Week Endpoint in Body Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight was measured twice at each indicated visit and the average of the 2 measurements was used for analyses. Least Squares (LS) mean calculated using mixed model repeating measure (MMRM) analysis that included baseline, treatment, country, sulfonylurea/meglitinide use, baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) strata (≤8% and &gt;8%), visit and treatment-by-visit interaction .</description>

    <measure>Time to Reach Glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) Target Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants is the number of participants who achieved HbA1c target values of ≤6.5% or ≤7.0% during the specified time period divided by the total number of participants who did not discontinue from the study but had not reached HbA1c target at the beginning of the specified post baseline time period (≤100 days and ≥101 days). Participants who did not experience an outcome before discontinuation or completion of the study were censored using the date of discontinuation. Participants who were lost to follow up the date of discontinuation were considered to be the date of last contact.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization through 24 weeks overall</time_frame>
    <description>A hypoglycemic episode was defined as any time a participant felt they were experiencing a sign or symptom that was associated with hypoglycemia, or had a blood glucose level of ≤70 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL, ≤3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L)] even if it was not associated with signs, symptoms or treatment (consistent with current American Diabetes Association 2005 guidelines).</description>

    <measure>The Number of Participants ≥65 Years of Age With Hypoglycemic Episodes (Incidence)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization through 24 weeks overall</time_frame>
    <description>A hypoglycemic episode in participants ≥ 65 years of age was defined as any time a participant felt they were experiencing a sign or symptom that was associated with hypoglycemia, or had a blood glucose level of ≤70 milligram per deciliter [mg/dL, ≤3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L)] even if it was not associated with signs, symptoms or treatment (consistent with current American Diabetes Association 2005 guidelines).</description>

    <measure>The Rate of Hypoglycemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization through 24 weeks overall</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Severe Hypoglycemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by low plasma glucose.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in 7-Point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) Profile</title>
        <description>7-Point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose profiles are measures of blood glucose concentration taken 7 time a day at the morning pre-meal, morning 2-hours (HR) postprandial (PP), midday pre-meal, midday 2-hours post-meal, evening pre-meal, bedtime and 0300 hour (3 am). Each participant took measures over any 3 days and the average was calculated for each of the 7 time points. Least Squares (LS) mean calculated using mixed model repeating measure (MMRM) analysis that included baseline, treatment, country, sulfonylurea/meglitinide use, baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) strata (≤8% and &gt;8%), visit and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Daily Dose of Insulin Per Kilogram of Body Weight: Total, Basal and Prandial (Bolus)</title>
        <description>Total insulin was the sum of basal insulin (glargine) that was required to manage normal daily blood fluctuations and prandial insulin that was taken at meal time. Total, basal and prandial amounts were then divided by the participant's body weight in kilograms (kg). Least Squares (LS) mean calculated using mixed model repeating measure (MMRM) analysis that included baseline, treatment, country, sulfonylurea/meglitinide use, baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) strata (≤8% and &gt;8%), visit and treatment-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <description>Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by low plasma glucose.</description>
