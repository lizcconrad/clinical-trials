  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dextrose injection in end-stage knee arthritis will cause growth of cartilage cells in a
      particular area of complete cartilage loss. Dextrose concentration will be 12.5%. Cartilage
      status will be monitored by pre and post treatment arthroscopy views with specialized
      (methylene blue) staining for cartilage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historical, compliance, examination,anesthetic injection, radiographic and arthroscopic
      screening will be completed. One month after arthroscopy completion, the intervention phase
      will begin.

      INTERVENTION

        -  Injection of 12.5% dextrose at 0, 1 and 2 months.

        -  Stand up without using only the non-injected leg for 3 days after each injection.

        -  Avoid running and squatting as feasible.

        -  Ensure that the injected knee descends stairs first ascends stairs last for 3 days.

        -  May take Acetaminophen.

        -  No NSAIDS for 2 days before and 10 days after a treatment. PRN NSAIDs only.

        -  No glucosamine or chondroitin should be taken.

      SECOND ARTHROSCOPY TIMING

        -  A minimum of 4 months after first arthroscopy, when schedulable.

        -  After a minimum of 3 monthly injections of dextrose 12.5% .

      METHOD OF ARTHROSCOPY

        -  Only the medial compartment will be entered to minimize trauma.

        -  Methylene blue will be applied and allowed to remain in knee for 5 minutes prior to
           flush.

        -  A standardized method video scan of the medial femoral compartment will be conducted.

        -  At second arthroscopy, the area of heaviest cartilage growth, if any, in the base of the
           Out-IV lesion will be biopsied with a Jamshidi needle at a 45 degree angle. (Limited by
           the optics of single port entry ).

        -  Biopsy, if taken, will be sent for decortication to enable specimen to be cut, safranin
           O application to determine proteoglycan production, polarized light to differentiate
           fibrous from hyaline cartilage, and immunohistologic straining for Type I and Type Ii
           cartilage.

Still photos of the biopsy study site wiThe photo of the Out IV lesion will be analyzed in a blinded fashion for a visual or computerized assessment of the percentage of lesion size covered by cartilage buds.</description>
