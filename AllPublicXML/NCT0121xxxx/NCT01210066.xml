  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Providing pain management to the patient who abuses prescription opioids presents a clinical
      challenge, not only due to concerns about &quot;drug-seeking&quot;, but because they have increased
      sensitivity to pain, a phenomenon identified as opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). In an
      effort to improve pain treatment, the aims of the proposed work are to evaluate the analgesic
      and hyperalgesic effects of opioids to acute pain in this vulnerable population, and to
      examine the role of opioid-induced proinflammatory changes in these responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both acute pain and opioid administration have been shown to induce a systemic
      pro-inflammatory response. However, the presence of these inflammatory responses is unknown
      in situations where a co-occurrence of pain and opioid administration exists as is the common
      clinical case of a patient with acute pain and taking opioid analgesics. A patient population
      for whom the combined effects of pain and opioids on immune function are particularly complex
      are the estimated 5.2 million Americans aged 12 or older who abuse prescription opioids. Not
      only are these individuals at risk for poor pain management due to their status as an
      &quot;addict&quot;, but there is good preclinical evidence to suggest that their chronic opioid use
      brings with it a general state of systemic inflammation, and thus setting the patient up for
      a unique or enhanced inflammatory response to the combination of acute opioids and pain. To
      better understand the health implications of treating acute pain with opioids in patients and
      in particular, those who abuse prescription opioids, inflammatory responses to the main and
      interaction effects of acute pain and opioid administration will be examined in
      well-characterized samples of each. Specifically, we will evaluate the inflammatory and
      cytokine responses to: (1) experimental pain; (2) an acute opioid challenge; and (3) the
      combination of opioid administration followed by cold-pressor pain, in healthy control
      subjects and age- and gender-matched prescription opioid abusers.
