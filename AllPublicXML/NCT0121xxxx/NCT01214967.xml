  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants are born at substantial risk for poor health and developmental outcomes,
      which commonly include hearing and vision problems, developmental delays, and poor school
      performance. Premature infants of low-income families face additional social risks known to
      worsen these outcomes. The Institute of Medicine recognized this important public health
      problem in its 2006 report, Preterm Birth, which argued for the need to improve the quality
      of follow-up care for preterm infants discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU). The underpinning of this proposal is that maternal depression - common among families
      of premature infants - interferes with adherence to follow-up services, and (both through
      this mechanism and directly) adversely impacts child health and development. Conversely,
      alleviating depressive symptoms among these women represents a promising strategy to improve
      adherence to NICU follow-up services and to improve the outcomes of this vulnerable
      population.

      This project aims to mitigate the adverse effects of maternal depression in this specific
      high-risk population by testing a theory-based, parent-directed empowerment strategy, called
      Problem Solving Education (PSE). In the past, similar strategies have been proven effective
      for improving the mood and functioning of depressed adults, and for improving adherence to
      medical treatment. However, they have never been tested in the setting of a parent-child
      relationship or among families of premature infants.

      This project involves a clinical trial of PSE among 50 low-income mothers at risk for
      depression, who have premature infants in two Boston NICUs: Boston Medical Center and Tufts
      Medical Center. The investigators aim to determine the impact of PSE on maternal depressive
      symptoms and functioning, and adherence to child health supervision and immunization
      schedules, vision screening, and early intervention evaluation for babies with suspected
      developmental delays.

      Approximately 100,000 children are born prematurely to low-income families each year.
      Parent-directed PSE aims to improve outcomes for these children through the prevention and/or
      attenuation of maternal depressive symptoms, as well as through family activation and
      promotion of adherence to follow-up care. If successful, PSE could also provide the
      cornerstone of a more generalizable empowerment strategy for families of children with
      chronic medical conditions.
