    <textblock>
      The purpose is to place implants in HIV positive and HIV negative patients, follow patients
      over 3 years period of time, to evaluate how well dental implants perform in HIV-positive
      patients versus HIV-negative patients.

      The purpose is to place implants and restore them with crowns in both HIV positive and HIV
      negative patients then follow patients 3 years period of time, to evaluate how well dental
      implants perform in HIV-positive patients versus HIV-negative patients.
