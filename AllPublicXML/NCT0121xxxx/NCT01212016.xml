      Background:

      - Food allergies are characterized by abnormal immune system responses to certain foods, such
      as peanuts, strawberries, and shellfish. Some individuals with these allergies have immediate
      allergic reactions on contact with the food in question and need immediate treatment to
      prevent severe complications. In contrast, eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders
      are related disorders in which white blood cells in the intestinal tract react to certain
      foods, causing abdominal pain, nausea, and other digestion problems. Researchers are
      interested in studying these conditions to better understand how the immune system responds
      to food allergies.

      Objectives:

        -  To examine how the immune system responds to food allergens.

        -  To examine how certain white blood cells contribute to disease in individuals with food
           allergies and other inflammatory diseases.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have a history of (a) severe allergic
           reaction to peanuts (and have peanut-specific antibodies), (b) allergy or inflammatory
           disease, or (c) eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder (with at least two
           documented food allergies).

        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 65 years of age who have no known allergies or asthma.

      Design:

        -  All participants will have a screening visit and a procedure visit. The procedure visit
           will take place within 30 to 60 days of the screening visit, and will take 3 to 4 hours
           depending on the procedure(s) done.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, and will
           provide blood samples for testing. Participants with peanut or other allergies will have
           additional tests to determine their levels of sensitivity to certain foods. Participants
           with eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder will provide stool samples for
           testing.

        -  At the procedure visit, participants with peanut allergies and participants with other
           allergies will provide blood samples and have leukapherisis to collect white blood cells
           for examination.

        -  At the procedure visit, healthy volunteers and participants with eosinophil-associated
           gastrointestinal disorder will provide blood samples and have leukapherisis to collect
           white blood cells for examination. In addition, some but not all of these participants
           will have a procedure called esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which will examine the
           esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Participants who are scheduled to have EGD will
           be asked to fast for 6 hours before the procedure.

    <textblock>
      Food allergy refers to a number of disorders characterized by clinical diseases associated
      with abnormal immune responses to food antigens. Classical IgE mediated anaphylactic food
      allergy is characterized by immediate hypersensitivity, and has a prevalence of approximately
      6% and 3% in children and adults, respectively. In contrast, eosinophil associated
      gastrointestinal disorders (EGIDs), including eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and eosinophilic
      gastroenteritis (EG), are food allergy associated disorders characterized by eosinophilic
      inflammation of the gut, typically without anaphylaxis. Progress in the treatment and
      management of these food allergies requires further understanding of the immunological
      pathogenesis of these disorders. A subset of peripheral blood food allergen specific
      interleukin (IL) -5 producing T cells that are present in EGID but not peanut allergic
      subjects has recently been characterized. The primary objective of this study is to determine
      if similar IL-5 producing T cells are present in the gut of EGID subjects. To this end, both
      EGID and healthy non-allergic subjects will be enrolled and gastrointestinal biopsies will be
      obtained for intracellular cytokine staining, RT-PCR and ELISA.

      Additionally, this protocol will supply blood and leukapheresis samples for exploratory
      studies on immunologic mechanisms underlying anaphylactic food allergy and EGIDs. A total of
      up to 400 subjects recruited from outside physician referrals and support groups, as well as
      from those in existing National Institutes of Health (NIH) protocols will be enrolled in this
      Clinical Center study.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects must meet all of the inclusion criteria:

        All Subjects must:

          1. Be willing to have samples collected and stored for future research.

          2. Have a documented clinical history compatible with EGID, peanut allergy, or other
             allergic and inflammatory diseases or be healthy without known allergic conditions.

        In addition to the above inclusion criteria for all subjects, the subjects in the following
        groups must meet additional group-specific inclusion criteria.

        Subjects with EGID must:

          1. Be greater than or equal to 18 years of age

          2. Maintain a primary non-NIH physician for routine care

          3. Have one of the types of EGID below:

               -  Eosinophilic gastroenteritis: Have a clinical history of eosinophilic
                  gastroenteritis -including gastrointestinal symptoms-, and histological evidence
                  of stomach or duodenal eosinophilia with no other known etiology for the
                  eosinophilia despite careful clinical evaluation.

        OR

        -Eosinophilic esophagitis: Have a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis, including evidence
        of esophageal dysfunction with a peak count of greater than or equal to 25 eosinophils per
        high powered field, for which the biopsy was obtained while under proton pump inhibitor
        treatment.

        OR

        -Probable eosinophilic esophagitis: Have a likely diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis,
        based on evidence of esophageal dysfunction and a peak count of greater than or equal to 15
        eosinophils per high powered field, but for which the biopsy was not obtained under proton
        pump inhibitors (per section 6.3). To confirm

        a diagnosis of EoE, these subjects may be treated with proton pump inhibitor therapy at
        recommended doses for gastroesophageal reflux disease for at least 84 weeks prior to EGD
        and biopsy. The decision to recommend diagnostic biopsy will be according to concensus
        guidelines [7] and current standards of care: based on the severity of symptoms, history of
        food impactions, and evidence of remodeling (strictures).
