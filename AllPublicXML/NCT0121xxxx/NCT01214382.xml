    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate how the body absorbs and processes the medication
      sertraline (ZoloftÂ®) before compared to how it is absorbed at two time points after gastric
      bypass surgery. Participants will be asked to take part in this study at three time points:
      1) before their bariatric surgery, 2) at three months following the surgery, and 3) twelve
      months following surgery. This study will enroll approximately 30 participants.

    <description>The primary aim of this research is to provide a prospective, longitudinal comparison of pharmacokinetic measures associated with a single-dose of sertraline in RYGBP patients. Comparisons will be based upon sertraline plasma concentrations obtained prior to surgery and repeated at three and 12 months following surgery. A 24+ month post-surgery follow-up to evaluate sertraline tablet AUC will be offered to a subset of study volunteers.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Male or female between 18 and 60 years of age at the time of Informed Consent

          -  2. Scheduled to undergo Roux en Y Gastric Bypass Surgery (RYGBP) or in evaluation for
             surgery prior to scheduling at the investigators' discretion.

          -  3. Ability to swallow whole medication tablets and eat solid foods

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Those taking any medication at the time of the study which has a known, clinically
             significant, drug-interaction with sertraline, which may affect participant safety or
             threaten the validity of the data.

          -  2. Hypersensitivity to sertraline or any excipient contained in either the tablet or
             solution

          -  3. Inability to tolerate blood draws

          -  4. History of or current bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, or current major
             depressive disorder or suicidality, or other psychiatric condition that the
             investigator feels may put the subject at additional risk by participating in the
             study

          -  5. Alcohol or other substance abuse in the past four weeks or dependence in the past
             year

             during the study

          -  7. Female participant unwilling to use an accepted method of birth control during the
             study assessment periods.

          -  8. Disulfiram or metronidazole at baseline (due to small percentage of alcohol in
             sertraline solution) or other medication with a similar interaction with a very small
             amount of alcohol

          -  9. Inability or unwillingness to avoid alcohol or grapefruit juice for the required
             study duration

          -  10. Baseline medications which significantly alter gastrointestinal transit time (e.g.
             oral anticholinergic medications, metoclopramide, erythromycin) and are taken on a
             routinely scheduled basis. In addition, any such medication cannot be taken in close
             proximity (minimum of five half-lives of the drug) to the study sertraline
             administration.

          -  11. Medical condition which may increase participant risk with sertraline

          -  12. Hepatic insufficiency (Hepatic insufficiency will be defined as any liver enzyme
             test on a standard hepatic panel of greater than or equal to twice the upper limit of
             normal, or any other hepatic abnormality identified on physical exam, self-report, or
             laboratory testing that puts the participant at risk in the opinion of the study
             physician or physician assistant.)

          -  13. History of daily tobacco product use in the past six months

          -  14. Participants who have undergone any type of prior surgical procedure for weight
             loss
