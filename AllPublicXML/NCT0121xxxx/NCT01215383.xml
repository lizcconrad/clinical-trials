      Background:

      Among individuals with schizophrenia, there is an increased prevalence of obesity,
      dyslipidemia ,diabetes mellitus and related conditions such as cardiovascular disease. People
      with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, depression or bipolar disorder, have
      worse physical health and reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. Number
      of epidemiological studies of patients with schizophrenia have documented a higher incidence
      of cardiovascular disease than in the general population, and patients with schizophrenia may
      be at an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease even in the absence of antipsychotic
      treatment.

      Affinity for the H1 receptor is most closely linked to increased weight gain, although
      affinity for D2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C and a2-receptors may also be involved. Drug affinity for the
      H1, M3 and 5-HT2C receptors is correlated with an increased risk of diabetes.

      High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration in the blood is independently and
      inversely associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease(CVD). However many
      patients with 'normal' or even 'elevated' plasma HDL experience clinical events. HDL may not
      always be atheroprotective and in some conditions, it paradoxically enhances the process of
      atherosclerosis. In addition to its role in reverse cholesterol transport, HDL shows many
      other protective properties towards atherosclerosis. HDL inhibits the chemotaxis of monocytes
      , prevents endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis, prohibit slow-density lipoprotein (LDL )
      oxidation, and stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells.
      These anti-inﬂammatory, antioxidative, antiaggregatory, anti-coagulant, and pro-ﬁbrinolytic
      activities are exerted by different components of HDL

      Aim of the study:

      To investigate the functional properties of HDL in psychiatric patients before and during
      antipsychotic therapy.

      Patients and methods:

      The blood will be drawn at baseline before the initiation of antipsychotic drugs and 2 months
      under the antipsychotic treatment.

      Study procedures:

      Full lipid profile including triglycerides, LDL-C, Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apo
      AI, apoAII and apoB100.

      Serum Paraoxanase Activity

      LDL oxidation and resistance to oxidation (measured by conjugated diens formation during
      incubation in the presence of copper).

      HDL composition: total and unesterified cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids, TBARS
      content before and after exposure to AAPH as a major indicator of oxidative stress, PON
      activity using phenylacetate as a substrate, apoA1and PAF.

      Serum parameters e.g. Diacyl glycerol acyltransferase activity, free ApoA1 and LCAT activity.

      3 [H]-Cholesterol efflux will be measured by incubating J744 macrophages with serum.
      Radioactivity will measured by β counter in the cell lysate and the medium.

      Statistical methods:

      One-way AVOVA and Student's t-test for paired samples will be used for comparison of multiple
      groups and paired samples, respectively. p&lt;0.05 will be considered significant.
