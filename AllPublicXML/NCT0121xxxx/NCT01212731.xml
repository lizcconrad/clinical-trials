    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  estimate the degree of memory loss, if any following radiotherapy to the base of skull
           or brain as measured by standard neurocognitive battery testing.

        -  describe radiotherapy dose-related changes in vascular perfusion, in spectroscopic
           parameters of neuronal injury and changes in the degree and directionality of tissue
           water diffusivity (diffusion tensor imaging) as a measure of white axonal injury.

        -  to relate these imaging characteristics to the degree of memory loss.

      Data suggests that regions of the normal brain exposed to radiation doses that has otherwise
      been regarded as safe and not limited by current radiation treatment planning may contribute
      to the risk of late neurocognitive injury. Radiation dose-dependent subclinical vascular
      effects have been reported in irradiated normal brain tissue and have been hypothesized to be
      a potential mechanism of action. Direct neuronal injury is another potential mechanism of
      injury. 1)Estimate the degree of cognitive loss following RT. 2) Demonstrate evidence of
      radiation induced subclinical vascular and neuronal injury in adjacent brain regions
      receiving exit doses of radiation. Subjects will include patients with malignancies of the
      skull of the skull base or patients with low grade glioma who require radiotherapy. Baseline
      MRI imaging of the brain utilizing established techniques will be used to identify and
      characterize the regions of interest anatomically adjacent to the regions of intended high
      dose irradiation. The MRI data for the ROIs will be registered with the radiotherapy
      treatment planning CT in order to create a single volume of data where each voxel corresponds
      to a vector containing the multi-parametric information. Subsequent repeat MRI imaging will
      be at 1.5, 4.5, 12 and 24 months following completion of the radiotherapy for patients with
      low grade glioma and 1.5 and 12 months post radiotherapy for patients with malignancies
      involving the skull base. Both cohorts will repeat standard neurocognitive evaluation at 1.5,
      4.5,12 and 24 months following completion of radiotherapy. Analysis: Neurocognitive domains
      will be evaluated at the designated time points.
