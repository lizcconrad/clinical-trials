    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of using the European Organisation for Research
      and Treatment of cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 + LC 13) to
      identify and target therapies in patients with lung cancer. The study will assess whether
      using the questionnaire will result in an improvement in QoL.

    <textblock>
      Patients with lung cancer who have completed a course of treatment (or who are in-between
      treatment) at the Royal Marsden Hospital would be eligible for inclusion in the study.
      Participants will be randomised into 3 groups. Group 1 - this group will complete the QoL
      questionnaire and will receive targeted therapies by a doctor (and other members of the
      oncology team) during a clinic consultation. Group 2 - will complete the QoL questionnaire
      however the questionnaire will not be seen by the doctor during a clinic consultation. Group
      3 - the control group will not complete the QoL questionnaire before a clinic consultation.
      All patients will complete a diary of all contact they have with health care professionals
      during the study. The study will last for 6 weeks and at the end of the study all patients
      will complete the QoL questionnaire.
