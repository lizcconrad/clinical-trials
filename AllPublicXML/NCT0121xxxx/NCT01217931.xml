      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare 6 different 2-drug &quot;sequences&quot; of
      everolimus, bevacizumab, or pazopanib to learn how they may affect metastatic kidney cancer.
      For the 2-drug sequence, participants will receive 1 of these drugs and may start taking
      another of these drugs after that. Researchers will also study the safety of these 2-drug
      sequences.

      The Study Drugs:

      Everolimus is designed to block the growth of cancer cells, which may cause cancer cells to
      die.

      Bevacizumab is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients necessary
      for tumor growth. This may prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells.

      Pazopanib is designed to block a protein that may cause uncontrolled tumor growth. Blocking
      this protein may prevent cancer from growing and spreading.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the roll of dice) to 1 of 6 groups. There is an equal chance of being assigned to each
      group.

        -  Group 1 will receive pazopanib, possibly followed by bevacizumab.

        -  Group 2 will receive pazopanib, possibly followed by everolimus.

        -  Group 3 will receive everolimus, possibly followed by bevacizumab.

        -  Group 4 will receive everolimus, possibly followed by pazopanib.

        -  Group 5 will receive bevacizumab, possibly followed by pazopanib.

        -  Group 6 will receive bevacizumab, possibly followed by everolimus.

      If the disease gets worse while you receive your first assigned drug, you will stop taking
      the drug. Then if you are not having side effects, you will start taking your second assigned
      drug 2-4 weeks later.

      Everolimus is taken by mouth 1 time per day (at about the same time each day).

      Bevacizumab is given by vein over 30-90 minutes, 1 time every 2 weeks.

      Pazopanib is taken by mouth 1 time per day (at about the same time each day on an empty
      stomach).

      You may be able to receive the bevacizumab doses at your local doctor's office. Ask your
      study doctor about this.

      Study Visits:

      Every week during Weeks 1-4, your blood pressure will be checked (either at home, at the
      clinic, or by your local doctor) if you are taking pazopanib or bevacizumab. If you are
      checking your own blood pressure at home, you should keep a log to write down your blood
      pressure. Bring the log to your next clinic visit.

      Every 2 weeks, urine will be collected for routine tests if you are receiving bevacizumab.

      Every 4 weeks:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are receiving
           everolimus, you will fast (have nothing to eat or drink except water) starting the night
           before these tests. The doctor will discuss this with you.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests if you are receiving everolimus or pazopanib.

      Every 8 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed. If you are receiving the
      study treatment at your local doctor's office, you must return to MD Anderson for these tests
      and procedures.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you are receiving
           pazopanib, this blood will also be used to check your thyroid function.

        -  You will have CT scans of the chest and abdomen to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will fill out 5 questionnaires about the quality of your life and about how you are
           feeling. This should take about 30 minutes.

      Every year, you will have an MRI of the brain to check the status of the disease.

      Every year, you will have an ECHO or MUGA scan to check the health of your heart.

      Anytime the doctor decides it is needed, you will have scans such as a CT scan of the pelvis,
      an MRI scan of the abdomen or brain, ECHO or MUGA scan, and/or a bone scan.

      After 1 year, if the disease has not gotten worse, you may have less clinic visits and tests.

      Length of Participation:

      You may continue taking a study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take a study drug if intolerable side effects occur,
      or if the disease gets worse after you take your second assigned study drug.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      When you are finished taking the study drug(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After your End-of-Treatment visit, the study staff will contact you by phone, e-mail, or you
      will come in for a clinic visit. You will be asked about how you are feeling and any side
      effects you may have had. Each follow-up will take about 5 minutes. Follow-up will take place
      every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the third year, and 1 time a year
      after that. The last follow-up will be about 5 years after the last patient is enrolled.

      This is an investigational study. Everolimus, bevacizumab, and pazopanib are all FDA approved
      and commercially available for kidney cancer. The investigational part of this study is to
      find out which order these drugs should be given in.

      Up to 240 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

          7. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             (serum/plasma or urine) within 7 days prior to beginning treatment on the study due to
             the possible teratogenic effect

          8. Patients of child fathering or childbearing potential must agree to practice a form of
             medically acceptable birth control while on study

          9. Patients must give written informed consent prior to initiation of study-related
             procedures. Patients with a history of major psychiatric illness must be judged able
             to fully understand the investigational nature of the study and the risks associated
             with the therapy

         11. Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease

         12. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents,
             breast-feeding should be discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this trial.

         13. Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with some of these agents.

         14. Patients must not have a clinical history of coagulopathy or bleeding diathesis.
             Patients may be on therapeutic anticoagulation preferably a low-molecular weight

             therapeutic level and must be checked weekly for the first four weeks, then every 2
             weeks for 4 additional weeks. Thereafter, they may be followed at the discretion of
             the treating provider. Antiplatelet agents are allowed.

         15. Concomitant treatment with rifampin, St. John's wort, or the cytochrome p450
             enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, carbamazepine or Phenobarbital) is not
             allowed on this study.

         16. Patients with significant baseline proteinuria defined as 300 or greater by screening
             U/A will be excluded if they have &gt; 1,000 mg proteins in a 24-hour urine collection or
             if they have a random urine protein over creatinine (UPC) ratio &gt;1.

         17. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to study enrollment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during
             the course of the study

         18. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess

             of study entry or during study period. Close contact with those who have received
             attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples
             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,
             BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.

         23. Patients with severely impaired lung function as defined as spirometry and DLCO that
             is 50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest
             on room air

         24. Liver disease such as cirrhosis or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C).
             Note: A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be
             done at screening for all patients. HBV DNA and HCV RNA PCR testing are required at
             screening for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors
             and/or confirmation of prior HBV/HCV infection.

         25. Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with steroids in pharmacological doses
             or immunosuppressive agents are excluded. Patients who receive steroids for
