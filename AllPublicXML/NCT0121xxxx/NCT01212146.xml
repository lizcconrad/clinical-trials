  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present randomized double-blind controlled crossover study is to compare the
      effects of the 15-day consumption of artichokes enriched with the probiotic Lactobacillus
      paracasei LMGP22043 with those of ordinary artichokes on treatment preference, satisfactory
      relief of symptoms, bowel habit and the modulation of SCFA production in a group of patients
      suffering from functional constipation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional constipation is a common problem in westernized societies and is characterized by
      different gastrointestinal symptoms.Different therapeutic strategies have been proposed, but
      a new therapeutic approach for constipation could be based on the modulation of intestinal
      microflora by administering prebiotics and/or probiotics. Currently, probiotic products are
      mainly incorporated in fermented milk-based products or concentrated probiotic preparations.
      To enlarge the range of choice and to exploit the nutritional qualities of plant matrices, an
      innovative line of probiotic vegetable products such as artichokes has been developed. The
      use of these vegetables containing live probiotic strains can take advantage of some their
      peculiar features for growth and improved bacterial survival. Artichokes can, therefore, work
      as valid &quot;active&quot; vehicles for the transport and release of adequate amounts of bacterial
      populations.

    <description>The participants will be asked about satisfactory relief of symptoms by using a visual analogue scale (VAS) with grades from 0 (no relief) to 100 (best imaginable relief of symptoms). VAS values will be categorized in 4 classes: 0-25: no or poor relief of symptoms, 26-50: moderate relief of symptoms; 51-75: good relief of symptoms; 76-100: very good relief of symptoms.</description>

    <description>participants will complement their usual lifestyles and dietary intakes with probiotic artichokes, enriched with the probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC2.1 (LMGP22043). The product contains approximately 1.20 x 10^8 CFU of live probiotic cells of Lactobacillus paracasei IMPC 2.1 LMGP22043 per gramme, which resulted in a daily dose of about 2 x 10^10 CFU.</description>
