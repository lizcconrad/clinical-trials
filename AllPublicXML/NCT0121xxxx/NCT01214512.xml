    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to evaluate the performance of the Micromedic CD24 assay in identifying
      colorectal adenoma using Western blot and ELISA assays. These assays are designed to detect
      CD24 protein in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). Elevated levels of CD24 may be indicative
      of colorectal adenoma (inclusive of optically detectable early adenoma to late adenoma, and
      cancer).

      Fresh blood samples are collected and separated. Plasma is collected and stored and rest is
      discarded of. Leukocytes are separated, lysed and the supernatant is stored. As DNA is
      retained in the pellet, which is discarded, no DNA is retained in the samples stored.
