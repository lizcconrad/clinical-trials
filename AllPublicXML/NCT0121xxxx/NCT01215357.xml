      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that ecopipam is able to reduce urges to gamble
      in patients diagnosed with Pathological Gambling.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to determine if ecopipam is able to stop urges to gamble in
      patients diagnosed with Pathological Gambling. Nerves communicate with each other by
      releasing chemicals called &quot;neurotransmitters&quot;. One of these neurotransmitters in the brain
      is called &quot;dopamine&quot;. After dopamine is released by the nerve it &quot;talks&quot; to other nerves by
      interacting with receptors that are unique to that neurotransmitter. Ecopipam is a drug that
      selectively blocks one family of dopamine receptors. Some scientists believe that the urge to
      gamble is related to having too much dopamine in the brain. By blocking the receptors that
      dopamine uses, ecopipam may be able to relieve the urge to gamble.
