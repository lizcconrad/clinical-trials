    <measure>Validity of activity monitor/smartphone to accurately measure and record physical activity of COPD patients</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Conduct tests to evaluate the activity monitor/smartphone system's ability to capture physical activity for COPD patients in comparison with the gold standard device in the field. The average number of steps and minutes per day spent in physical activities recorded by the experimental device will be compared to the gold standard device.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the feasibility of using the smartphone/activity monitoring technology for motivational interviewing based counseling .</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will test the usability of the smartphone diary for chronic disease self-management health coaching. Several measures of the usability of the diary will be collected.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the effectiveness of smartphone/activity monitor plus the motivational interviewing based coaching to increase physical activity, improve quality of life or palliate symptoms .</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Several measures will be collected,Physical Activity Level (total energy expenditure/resting metabolic rate), steps, quality of life, self efficacy and also a qualitative feedback .</description>

    <description>Initial health coaching at enrollment will involve the collaborative creation of an action plan with personally relevant, specific actions for increasing physical activity. The short term goals will be rated for self-efficacy and modified to maximize likelihood of success. Health coaches will discuss important mediators of physical activity (e.g., self-efficacy, enjoyment, social support, problem-solving). Weekly coaching calls will involve discussion of progress toward goals and problem-solving of barriers utilizing a motivational interviewing approach. Motivational messages will also be developed and sent daily to participants via the smartphone. These messages will indicate the percentage of steps related to their daily goal.</description>
