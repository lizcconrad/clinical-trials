    <textblock>
      This is post-marketing observational study in which data on safety and effectiveness of
      Xirtam H will be collected from routine clinical practice. The study objectives are to
      investigate the effect of Xirtam-H on blood pressure and achievement of target blood pressure
      as well as safety and satisfaction of treatment. All hypertensive patients (Blood pressure &gt;
      140/90 mmHg) where investigator feels that addition of Xirtam H would be beneficial to
      patients will be included in non interventional study. The routine investigation suggested by
      the attending physician will be done in patients of hypertension. No additional investigation
      will be done for the study purpose. The patient not controlled on existing treatment and
      prescribed Xirtam H will be included in study after taking the informed consent. The patient
      will be followed up for 2-follow up visit each after 6 weeks. The physical examination,
      routine investigation, blood pressure measures will be done and the data will be entered in
      the CRF as mentioned in CRF in each visit. The study is planned to be carried out in 9604
      patients from around 300 - 350 trial sites in India.
