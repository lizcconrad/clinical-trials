    <textblock>
      The repair of large osseous defects remains still unsolved. Aim of this study is to isolate
      and cultivate fat-derived progenitor cells and differentiation into osteoblasts. Therefore,
      our research idea is to pre-engineer large synthetic bone grafts and study the
      vascularization process in vivo.
