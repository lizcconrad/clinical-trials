  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation exposure in orthodontic patients by the
      use of a new imaging protocols based on non-ionizing orthodontic records (e.g. digital dental
      models, three-dimensional photograph) The first step in this process is to develop and
      validate an orthodontic analysis able to assess craniofacial proportions, dental, skeletal,
      and facial soft tissue. The investigators working hypothesis is that data from
      three-dimensional facial photographs and from digital dental casts can be registered
      accurately and consistently, and the diagnostic information about tooth position and facial
      soft-tissue derived from them are comparable to x-ray derived data
