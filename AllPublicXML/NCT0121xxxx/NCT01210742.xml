  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for early osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is an increasing problem yet much of the
      research into OA, to date, concentrates on predisposition, genetic and cellular aspects and
      the treatment of late stage disease (arthroplasty). Clinicians reviewing patients with early
      OA have great difficulty in recommending an appropriate and efficacious intervention.

      The first line of treatment for patients with early OA is exercise, self-management and
      weight loss. These tools are suggested to minimize the need for higher risk treatments such
      as non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and surgery. Viscosupplementation using
      intra-articular injections of hyaluronan (Synvisc One) is a relatively new treatment. To
      date, the ideal patient for viscosupplementation has yet to be defined. It is not known
      whether incorporation of viscosupplementation into the overall clinical management will have
      beneficial influence for patients with early OA of the knee.

      This study will generate rigorous pilot data to assess the need and inform a larger
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the efficacy of viscosupplementation. The study
      will be a single blind randomised RCT. 60 patients with documented early OA will be
      randomised into one of two groupsÍ¾ Group V will undergo &quot;one shot&quot; viscosupplementation using
      Synvisc One in addition to routine physiotherapy management for knee OA. Group No V (control)
      will have no viscosupplementation but will undergo similar routine management including
      physiotherapy management for knee OA. Outcome measures will include walking pain (The Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index-WOMAC), the overall WOMAC score, Oxford
      Knee Score (OKS), American Knee Society score (AKS), complications, activity level and
      patient satisfaction. Health economics will also be evaluated. Measurements will be recorded
      pre-intervention and at six months following treatment.

      The risks associated with viscosupplementation are minimal. Considering the limited resources
      currently available in health care, if the latter is shown to have higher effectiveness than
      physiotherapy alone, in addition to patient benefit, there will be important health economic
      implications.
