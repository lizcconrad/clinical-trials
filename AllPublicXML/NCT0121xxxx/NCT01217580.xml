  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if injecting a local anesthetic, or numbing
      medication, above each hip will decrease the amount of narcotic pain medicine that is
      typically required by a patient after a cesarean delivery. Ultrasound pictures will be used
      to guide placement of this injection. Either ropivicaine (a type of numbing medication called
      a local anesthetic) or a placebo (saline) will be injected. For 24 hours, you will be given a
      button to press when you have pain. When the button is pressed, you will be given a small
      amount of pain medication called hydromorphone through your IV. You will also be given a pain
      medication called ketorolac through your IV every 8 hours for 24 hours after surgery.

    <description>Ultrasound guided TAP blocks will be performed once patient is in the recovery area. Patients will be placed on their back with their hands resting comfortably above their head. Using an ultrasound guided technique, the ultrasound probe will be positioned on abdominal until the three lateral abdominal wall muscles and TAP are clearly imaged. A two or four inch, 20 gauge needle will be advanced using an in-plane technique. After visual confirmation that the needle tip is in the TAP, 1 ml of preservative free 0.9% sodium chloride will be injected to reconfirm correct placement in the TAP. Then 20 ml of 0.5% ropivacaine will be injected. The procedure will be repeated on the other side.</description>
