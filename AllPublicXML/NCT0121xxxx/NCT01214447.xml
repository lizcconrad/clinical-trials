  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study is planned to validate OSND against the prospective
      morbidity and mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients and to examine the hypothesis that
      OSND risk stratification of chronic HD patients is useful in predicting outcomes and better
      than its component alone or in diverse combinations. The investigators specific aim is to
      validate OSND in chronic HD patients by comparing it with conventional measures of
      nutritional state, including blood tests, anthropometry, MIS, GNRI, bioelectric impedance
      analysis and several measures of clinical outcome including prospective mortality and
      hospitalization.
