    <textblock>
      Trafermin is a recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; original development
      code, KCB-1), which is manufactured by genetic engineering using Escherichia coli by Kaken
      Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Trafermin 0.01% cutaneous spray product kit
      consisting of a glass bottle containing lyophilized trafermin, a glass bottle with solvent
      for solution and a spray part to fit the glass bottle after reconstitution of the final
      product.

      We conduct a multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group,
      multicentre study consisting of a placebo run-in phase (2w), a treatment phase (max. 12w) and
      a follow-up phase (3mo+6mo). The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate a superior
      wound closure rate of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) of neuropathic origin after a maximum of 12
      weeks topical daily application of trafermin 0.01% spray compared with placebo, in addition
      to best local care (off-loading, dressings). Approximately 210 patients will be randomized
      and it is planned that this study will be conducted at approximately 40 investigational sites
      in Europe.
