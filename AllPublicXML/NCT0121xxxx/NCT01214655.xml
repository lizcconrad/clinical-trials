      This study is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation with intra-patient
      dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of intravenous LY2523355 to determine the dose of LY2523355
      that can be safely administered to patients with acute leukemia. Part A and Part B are dose
      escalation of two schedules in patients with acute leukemia. Parts A and B will enroll
      concurrently. Part C is a dose expansion for each schedule in patients with acute
      myeloblastic leukemia (AML).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Dose escalation period for both schedules:

          -  Patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of acute leukemia regardless of sub-type for
             whom experimental phase 1 therapy is appropriate

          -  Are greater than or equal to 18 years of age

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             scale

          -  Females with childbearing potential must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug

        Dose confirmation period for both schedules:

          -  Participant must have a confirmed diagnosis of untreated AML, should not be a
             candidate for standard therapy, and a clinical trial is a preferred treatment option
             or acute AML that is relapsed or refractory to no more than 2 prior induction
             regimens. Hydroxyurea to control prior blast counts is not considered a prior regimen.

          -  Are greater than or equal to 60 years of age

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             scale

          -  Females with childbearing potential must have had a negative urine or serum pregnancy
             test less than or equal to 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within 28 days of the initial dose of study drug with a drug
             that has not received regulatory approval for any indication.

          -  Participants with known central nervous system (CNS) leukemia by spinal fluid cytology
             or imaging. A lumbar puncture is not required unless CNS involvement is clinically
             suspected. Participants with signs or symptoms of leukemic meningitis or a history of
             leukemic meningitis must have a negative lumbar puncture within 2 weeks of study
             enrollment.

          -  Have other active malignancy (with the exception of basal and squamous cell skin
             cancer) at time of study entry

          -  Have had an autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplant within 3 months. All organ
             toxicity must be resolved.

          -  Have evidence of graft-versus-host disease due to an allogenic bone marrow transplant

          -  Have uncontrolled systemic infection

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Have known positive test results in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBSAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCAb) (screening not required)
