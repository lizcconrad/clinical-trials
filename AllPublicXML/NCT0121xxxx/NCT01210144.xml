  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, pilot, open-label, national, multi-centric study planned to determine the
      gene expression profiles and histologic changes of the endometrial tissue before and after
      stimulation with Gonal-f®. Physicians are interested in identifying predictive genetic
      markers in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in addition to the clinical predictive
      factors already known. Among those predictive factors, the state of the endometrium is
      considered as an important implantation determining factor for which pharmacogenomic research
      is of great interest.

      The direct benefits of this study will be to know whether the endometrial gene expression
      profile is modified in response to stimulation treatment and have an impact or not on the
      endometrial tissue receptivity. The potential benefits of this study could be to assess the
      therapy optimization based on individual treatment response and gene expression profile
      compared to group treatment response in infertile women and prediction of response to therapy
      based on gene expression profiling before and after Gonal-f® stimulation in infertile women.

      This is a pilot open-label, national, multi-centre, Phase IV trial. This trial will be
      conducted with outpatients. Once subject has met all eligibility criteria, she will be
      treated with Gonal-f® prefilled pen and will receive on a randomization basis the GnRH
      agonist or antagonist. The follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation will start on day 2
      of the menstrual cycle with a pre-defined fixed dose of 150 IU per day until follicles are
      recruited and developed. Dose adjustment will be allowed strictly in case of risk of ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Ovulation triggering will be performed using a single
      injection of 250 mcg Ovitrelle®.

      Ultrasound scans (US) will be performed concomitantly with hormonal assessment at each visit.
      Ovulation will be triggered as soon as there are at least 3 follicles &gt; 16 mm, and with E2 &gt;
      1 mcg/L if agonist used. Oocyte retrieval, in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic
      sperm injection (ICSI) and blastocyst transfer will be performed as per centre's standard
      practice. Vaginal progesterone will be administered in the luteal phase for all subjects (600
      milligram per day [mg/d]).

      Hormonal assessment and endometrial biopsy will be performed on:

        -  Day Luteinizing Hormone+7 (&quot;LH+7&quot;) of the previous spontaneous cycle

        -  Day of Oocyte Retrieval (OR) of the stimulated cycle

        -  Day &quot;OR+5 or 6&quot; (biopsy performed only in subjects that did not have blastocyst(s)
           transfer).

      Gene expression profiling will be carried out on ribonucleic acid (RNA) from endometrial
      tissue. As the main objective of this trial is to determine the gene expression profiles of
      endometrial tissue before and after controlled ovarian stimulation with Gonal-f®, a minimum
      of 2 endometrial samples per subject will be collected, 1 at day LH+7 of spontaneous cycle
      and 1 after the stimulation, on the day of OR.

      The subjects will be followed up until 15 days after the last injection of Investigational
      Medicinal Products (IMPs) for the safety assessment. For subjects who will have blastocyst
      implantation, the pregnancy outcomes will be recorded until 12 weeks of gestation if a
      pregnancy is ongoing up to that period.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To determine the gene expression profile and histological changes of endometrial tissue
           before (at day LH + 7 of spontaneous cycle) and after stimulation with Gonal-f® (Day of
           OR: 36 +/- 2 hours post r-hCG administration) in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)
           [IVF/ICSI]

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To correlate the gene expression profile of the endometrial tissue at Day LH + 7 of the
           spontaneous cycle with the blastocyst implantation rate in subjects undergoing ART with
           Gonal-f®

        -  To correlate the gene expression profile and histological changes in endometrial tissue
           before and after stimulation by Gonal-f® with the &quot;down regulation&quot; protocol used
           (agonist or antagonist) and fertilization mode, IVF/ICSI

        -  To correlate the gene expression profile and histological changes in endometrial tissue
           before and after stimulation by Gonal-f® according to the hormonal status of subjects

        -  To characterize the gene expression profile and histology of endometrial tissue after
           stimulation with Gonal-f in subjects without blastocyst during the theoretical window of
           implantation (OR + 5 or 6 days)

        -  To characterize the gene expression profile and histology of endometrial tissue of good
           and poor responders to stimulation with Gonal-f® on the Day of OR (response being based
           on the following criteria):

             1. Quantity of mature oocytes retrieved:

                  -  Poor responders: 5 mature oocytes or less

                  -  Good responders: more than 8 mature oocytes

             2. Quantity of Gonal-f® used

To prevent premature ovulation in participants undergoing a COS, 0.25 mg GnRH antagonist daily was started from Day 6 of Gonal-f® stimulation treatment as per SmPC, in multi-dose antagonist protocol.</description>

Histological patterns included: Proliferative phase (described as the endometrial on the first two weeks after the menstruation [or before ovulation]), Early secretory phase (first step of the secretory phase, located at the Day 16-18 of the cycle), Intermediate secretory phase (secretory phase located at the Day 20-22 of the cycle and describes endometrial closer to the implantation phase).</description>

      <desc>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, or diseases that emerge or worsen relative to baseline during a clinical study with an IMP, regardless of causal relationship and even if no IMP has been administered.</desc>

        <group group_id="E1">
          <title>Gonal-f® + Ovitrelle® (Long Agonist Protocol)</title>
          <description>Participants received 150 International Units (IU) per day of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH, Gonal-f®) subcutaneously (sc) starting from Day 2 of menstrual cycle until follicles were recruited and developed. Ovulation triggering was performed with a single dose of 250 microgram (mcg) recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin alfa (r-hCG alfa, Ovitrelle®) sc, as soon as follicles satisfied the criteria for follicular development (at least 3 follicles greater than [&gt;] 16 millimeter [mm], and with estradiol [E2] &gt;1 microgram per liter [mcg/L]). To prevent premature ovulation in participants undergoing a controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), 0.1 milligram (mg) GnRH agonist daily was started after endometrial biopsy, 7 days after the peak day of luteinizing hormone (Day LH + 7) as per summary of product characteristics (SmPC), in long agonist protocol.</description>

          <title>Gonal-f® + Ovitrelle® (Multi-dose Antagonist Protocol)</title>
          <description>Participants received 150 IU per day of r-hFSH (Gonal-f®) sc starting from Day 2 of menstrual cycle until follicles were recruited and developed. Ovulation triggering was performed with a single dose of 250 mcg r-hCG alfa (Ovitrelle®) sc, as soon as follicles satisfied the criteria for follicular development (at least 3 follicles &gt;16 mm). To prevent premature ovulation in participants undergoing a COS, 0.25 mg GnRH antagonist daily was started from Day 6 of Gonal-f® stimulation treatment as per SmPC, in multi-dose antagonist protocol.</description>
