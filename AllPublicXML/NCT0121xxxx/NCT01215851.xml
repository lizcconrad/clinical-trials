    <textblock>
      The trial will evaluate the extended bactericidal activity of 14 consecutive days of oral
      administration of TMC207 alone, TMC207 with pyrazinamide, TMC207 with PA-824, PA-824 with
      pyrazinamide and PA-824 with moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide, as determined by the rate of
      change of log CFU in sputum over the time period Day 0-14 in participants with smear positive
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). A control group will receive standard treatment.

    <measure>Early Bactericidal Activity (EBA) Measured as the Mean Rate of Change of log10 Colony Forming Units (CFU) of M. Tuberculosis Per ml Sputum on Solid Medium Over Time (Days 0-14).</measure>
    <time_frame>14 consecutive days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Log10 CFU rates of change were calculated for each individual patient from the slopes β1 and β2 of the bi-linear regression fitted to the data for each individual patient (log10CFU versus Day). Mean log10 CFU changes from baseline were compared. A higher slope value indicates a greater change in log10 CFU from baseline. Note that to facilitate interpretation the sign of these slopes are reversed for logCFU. A positive slope value therefore indicates a reduction in log10 CFU from baseline.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written, informed consent prior to all trial-related procedures including HIV
             testing.

          2. Male or female, aged between 18 and 65 years inclusive.

          3. Body weight (in light clothing and with no shoes) between 40 and 90 kg, inclusive.

          4. Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB.

          5. A chest X-ray picture which in the opinion of the Investigator is compatible with TB.

          6. Sputum positive on direct microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (at least 1+ on the
             IUATLD/WHO scale).

          7. Ability to produce an adequate volume of sputum as estimated from a spot assessment
             (estimated 10 ml or more overnight production).

          8. Females may participate if they are: 1) of non-childbearing potential (have had a
             bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy or have been postmenopausal for at least 12
             consecutive months), 2) if they are using effective birth control methods and are
             willing to continue practicing birth control methods throughout treatment or 3) be
             non-heterosexually active, practice sexual abstinence or have a vasectomized partner
             (confirmed sterile). Therefore to be eligible for this study women of childbearing
             potential should either: 1) use a double barrier method to prevent pregnancy (i.e. use
             a condom with either diaphragm or cervical cap) or 2) use hormonal based
             contraceptives in combination with a barrier contraceptive, or 3) use an intrauterine
             device in combination with a barrier contraceptive. They must also be willing to
             continue these contraceptive measures until 6 months after the last dose of study
             medication or 6 months after discontinuation from study medication in case of
             premature discontinuation. (Note: Hormone-based contraception alone may not be
             reliable when taking IMP; therefore, hormone-based contraceptives alone cannot be used
             by female participants to prevent pregnancy).

          9. Male participants who are having heterosexual intercourse with females of
             child-bearing potential are required to use one of the following birth control methods
             during their participation in the trial and for 12 weeks after their last dose of
             study medication to prevent pregnancy:

               -  a double barrier method which can include a male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap,
                  or female condom; or

               -  a barrier method combined with hormone-based contraceptives or an intra-uterine
                  device for the female partner.

        The use of the above mentioned birth control method does not apply if the male participant
        has been vasectomised or has had a bilateral orchidectomy minimally one month prior to
        screening, or is not heterosexually active, or practice sexual abstinence or if the female
        sexual partner has had a bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy or has been
        postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.

             laboratory reference range. An evaluation resulting in an isolated abnormal value
             (i.e., only 1 of the 3 hormones is abnormal) may be repeated using a morning (ideally,
             8am) serum specimen. If the laboratory value on the repeat specimen is outside the
             laboratory reference range, unless the result is deemed not clinically significant by
             the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor, the participant

             or less of one of these drugs or substances, if there has been a wash-out period
             before administration of IMP equivalent to at least 5 half-lives of that drug or

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited from outpatient clinics and were admitted to the hospital for the duration of the study at one of 2 centers in Capetown, South Africa. The study was conducted between October 2010 and August 2011. Patients aged 18 and 65 years with newly diagnosed smear-positive pulmonary TB were recruited and randomized centrally.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In the screening period, TB treatment was not provided while baseline sputum was collected/tested. This period was up to 9 days, up to 6 days screening followed by 3 days baseline sputum collection. Hospitalization during this time was left to investigator discretion. 173 patients were screened and 88 patients discontinued before randomization.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Early Bactericidal Activity (EBA) Measured as the Mean Rate of Change of log10 Colony Forming Units (CFU) of M. Tuberculosis Per ml Sputum on Solid Medium Over Time (Days 0-14).</title>
        <description>Log10 CFU rates of change were calculated for each individual patient from the slopes β1 and β2 of the bi-linear regression fitted to the data for each individual patient (log10CFU versus Day). Mean log10 CFU changes from baseline were compared. A higher slope value indicates a greater change in log10 CFU from baseline. Note that to facilitate interpretation the sign of these slopes are reversed for logCFU. A positive slope value therefore indicates a reduction in log10 CFU from baseline.</description>
