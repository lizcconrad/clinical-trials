      This proposal is for the pilot study that will inform the conduct of a larger prospective
      randomized controlled trial to guide perioperative work up and the cost/utility of CTCA (high

      This proposal is for a pilot study that will inform the conduct of a prospective, blinded
      randomized controlled trial designed to determine the cost effectiveness of an algorithm for
      pre operative cardiac risk stratification that uses coronary CT angiography. In addition
      perioperative and long-term cardiac event rate will be recorded to determine if there is any
      difference in these rates between the 2 groups.
