  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether the aluminum-adjuvanted or the non-adjuvanted formulation of
      the candidate pneumococcal vaccine (V114) is non-inferior to Prevnar 13™ based on immune
      responses to the 13 serotypes in common Prevnar 13™
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A primary reason why this study was amended was to extend the comparison between V114 and
      Prevnar 13™ to all 13 serotypes in common, and to evaluate the response after dose 4 as a
      primary outcome measure.

             allow the child to participate by giving written informed consent.

          -  Afebrile, with a rectal temperature &lt;38.1°C (&lt;100.5°F) or axillary temperature &lt;37.8°C
             (&lt;100.0°F) on day of vaccination.
