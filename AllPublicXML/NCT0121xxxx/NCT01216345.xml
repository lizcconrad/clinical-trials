    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective single-centre phase II study is to investigate the therapeutic
      efficacy and safety of cetuximab in combination with Gemcitabine and Oxaliplatin (GEMOX) in
      the palliative first line treatment of biliary tract cancer (BTC) patients.

      Primary Objective(s) The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the best overall
      response of cetuximab in combination with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as first line
      treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  toxicity

        -  secondary resection rate

        -  progression-free survival (PFS)

        -  overall survival (OS)
