  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if activities that challenge the brain (mentally
      stimulating activities) can improve memory and other types of thinking in patients with Mild
      Cognitive Impairment. The study will compare the effects of different methods of mental
      stimulation.
