      This is a single arm, one center, phaseⅡ study evaluating efficacy and safety of erlotinib as
      neoadjuvent treatment in patients with EBUS confirmed stage ⅢA N2 NSCLC with activating EGFR
      mutation in exon 19 or 21.

      Screening phase:

      Patients clinically diagnosed as stage ⅢA N2 lung caner by CT technique will be
      pathologically proven as NSCLC with N2 by EBUS. The pathology specimen will be detected EGFR
      mutation by DNA sequencing. The patients with EGFR mutation in exon 19 or 21 will be enrolled
      in this study.

      Neoadjuvant treatment phase:

      Patient will receive erlotinib 150mg/day. Treatment will be scheduled to continue for a total
      of 8 weeks or disease progression or unacceptable toxicities.

      Surgery treatment phase:

      Tumor response will be evaluated with CT scan after 8 weeks of induction treatment. The
      patients with responsive disease considered to be technique resectable will undergo
      resection.

      Post-surgery phase:

      It is the discretion of the investigator whether the patient is a candidate for
      post-operative treatment which is considered to be in the best interest of the patients. It
      is recommended that patients with positive margins or residual tumor after surgery should
      receive radiation therapy. Patients after surgery will receive long-term follow-up including
      chest CT scan every 3 months for up to 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Written informed consent provided. Males or females aged ≥18 years. Able to comply with the
        required protocol and follow-up procedures, and able to receive oral medications.

        Stage IIIA N2 NSCLC according to the pathological evidence of endobronchial
        ultrasound(EBUS).

        The biopsy specimen shows EGFR mutation in exon 19 or 21 by DNA sequencing. Measurable
        disease must be characterized according to RECIST criteria: measurable lesions are defined
        as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be
        recorded) as ≥20cm with conventional techniques (PE, CT, XR, MRI) or as ≥ 10cm with spiral
        scan.

        ECOG performance status 0-1. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks.

        Female subjects should not be pregnant or breast-feeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The biopsy specimen shows EGFR wildtype in exon 19 or 21 by DNA sequencing. Patients with
        prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib, cetuximab,
        trastuzumab).

        Patients with prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic anti-tumour therapy (e.g.
        monoclonal antibody therapy).

        Known hypersensitivity to Tarceva or any of its recipients.

        Evidence of any other disease, neurological or metabolic dysfunction, physical examination
        or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
        contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or puts the subject at high risk for
        treatment-related complications.

        Sexually active males and females(of childbearing potential) unwilling to practice
        contraception during the study.
