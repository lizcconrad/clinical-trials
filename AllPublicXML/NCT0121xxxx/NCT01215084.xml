  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the Pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety
      profiles of fampridine-PR 10 mg in Chinese and Japanese adult healthy volunteers. The
      secondary objective of this study is to compare the PK and safety profiles of fampridine-PR
      10 mg among the Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian adult healthy volunteers.

      The Caucasian group is included to allow comparison of pharmacokinetic and safety data from
      different race groups to be performed with data obtained from the same study under the same
      controlled conditions.
