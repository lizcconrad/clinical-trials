  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to evaluate the basal serum levels of anti-mullerian hormone
      (AMH) and inhibin B as early predictors of ovarian response, implantation rate, and pregnancy
      rate in women 38 years old or older that are undergoing an IVF cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specifics aims are: a) to describe AMH and inhibin levels on day 3 previous to ART cycle; b)
      to analyze the association between these hormone levels and the retrieved metaphase II
      oocytes quantity; c) to analyze the association between these hormone levels and quality
      embryo score d) to analyze the association between these hormone levels and the number of
      gestational sacs per transferred-embryo (implantation rate); e) to analyze the association
      between these hormone levels and the pregnancy rate; f) to make a prediction model for
      pregnancy rate by using a multivariable regression analysis.

      Patient participation includes signing the consent and having additional tubes of blood drawn
      at a regularly scheduled blood draw. This blood is used to run the study tests (AMH and
      inhibin levels).
