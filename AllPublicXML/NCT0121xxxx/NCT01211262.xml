  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IMCgp100 is a new biological therapy designed for the treatment of melanoma skin cancer. The
      drug is designed to target melanoma cells and stimulate immune cells to kill them. This trial
      is designed to establish the level of drug that can be given to a patient that is tolerable.
      It also designed to establish the best dosing schedule for the drug and to look for signals
      that the drug is working as intended.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IMCgp100 is a bispecific biologic incorporating an engineered T cell receptor (TCR) specific
      for a peptide antigen derived from the protein gp100 presented in the context of HLA A2 on
      the surface of melanoma cells. The TCR is fused to an anti-CD3 antibody single-chain variable
      fragment (scFv) that recruits and activates non-melanoma specific T cells (killer T cells) in
      physical contact with the cancer T cell. This is a Phase I study designed to assess the
      safety profile and establish a tolerable dose of IMCgp100 in HLA A2 positive malignant
      melanoma patients. The study has two treatment arms with different treatment schedules,
      weekly or daily dosing. Each treatment arm in the study has two parts. In the first part,
      dose escalation, the safety and tolerability of the drug are examined and the optimal dose of
      drug is established. In the second part of the trial, patients will receive an extended
      course of treatment with a view to assessing the effect of the drug on disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologically documented Stage IV malignant melanoma or unresectable Stage III
             melanoma for which no standard effective therapy exists or for which an appropriate
             window exists between alternative therapeutic options. Patients for whom early
             treatment with vemurafenib is indicated e.g. rapidly progressing or symptomatic
             disease, are excluded from this trial.

          2. Previous surgery (other than resection of skin metastases), radiotherapy,
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy or experimental therapy completed &gt;4 weeks before and all
             adverse events resolved to ≤ grade 1. In cases where localised radiotherapy has been
             applied, treatment with IMCgp100 can be commenced after a two week period.

             following the last study drug infusion and must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test upon entry into this study. Otherwise, female patients must be
             postmenopausal (no menstrual period for a minimum of 12 months) or surgically sterile.

         10. Male patients must be surgically sterile or willing to use a double barrier

         11. Patients with a history of adrenal insufficiency, maintained on stable replacement
             dose corticosteroid (&lt;10 mg/d prednisone or the equivalent) are eligible for treatment
             with IMCgp100, unless there is a past history of adrenal crisis. Eligible patients
             with a history of adrenal insufficiency receiving replacement dose corticosteroid must
             receive prophylactic stress dose corticosteroid prior to dosing during the first four
             doses of IMCgp100 treatment, regardless of weekly or daily dosing regimen.

             excised nonmelanomatous skin cancer or any other malignancy that in the opinion of the
             investigator is considered to be cured.

          3. Comorbid medical condition that would increase the risk of toxicity in the opinion of
             the investigator or sponsor. Symptomatic on-going infection must be resolved before
             the patient can be treated in the study.
