  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumors must be seen clearly on CT scan to be radiated completely and safely. Breathing causes
      tumors to move. If the tumor moves during breathing, it can look blurred on the CT scan. This
      makes it difficult to see on CT scan. The investigators wish to investigate whether a new
      computer method makes tumors less blurry and easier to see on CT scan. Cone-beam CT is a type
      of CT scanner attached to the radiation treatment machine that produces 3D images of the
      patient. Since your tumor can move because of your normal breathing, it is often blurry and
      difficult to see accurately in a standard cone-beam CT scan. The investigators intend to use
      a computer method which processes the cone-beam CT data in a way that reduces the blurring
      and makes the tumor easier to see.

    <description>Thoracic malignancies (study group 1): Patients to be treated for gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) malignancy undergo an implantation procedure of two or three radiopaque markers several days prior to treatment simulation, which are used to correct patient position at treatment. At treatment simulation, patients receive a standard CT scan followed by an RCCT scan. In cases of GEJ malignancy, oral contrast is administered prior to the standard CT scan; this is done at the treating physician's discretion. The standard CT is used to design the radiation treatment plan, where as the RCCT is used to define a volume that encompasses the motion extent of the tumor with breathing and is transferred to the standard CT.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologic proof of a thoracic or abdominal malignancy, confirmed
             at MSKCC and suitable for radiation therapy, in order to be eligible for this study.
             Thoracic malignancies (study group 1) include those in lung and gastro-esophageal
             junction. Abdominal malignancies (study group 2) include those in liver and pancreas.
             Patients having both thoracic and abdominal malignancies will be placed in only one of
             the study groups, because the limited field-of-view of the CBCT precludes imaging of
             both malignancies in the same scan. Patients must be older than 18 years of age

          -  At least part of the tumor must be visible as observed in a diagnostic or planning CT.
             The tumor must exhibit at least 5 mm motion from respiration as observed in the
             respiration-correlated CT (RCCT) at simulation. The RCCT scan must be interpretable
             and not exhibit excessive motion artifacts caused by irregular patient breathing.

          -  Patients must have Karnofsky Performance Status â‰¥ 70%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mesothelioma and other tumors of the pleura

          -  Pregnant Women

          -  Allergic to iodine or intravenous contrast agent (applies only to patients with a
             pancreas or liver malignancy)

          -  Renal impairment due to the use of a contrast agent

          -  Patients with pacemakers and defibrillators
