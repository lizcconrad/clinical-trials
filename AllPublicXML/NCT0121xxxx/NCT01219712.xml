  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients undergoing surgery for proximal hip fracture have a high risk of morbidity
      and mortality (M&amp;M) postoperatively. Several studies including some from the investigators
      department have shown that there is a high risk of cardiovascular complications in this group
      of patients and 3-month mortality is 15-20%. One of the causes of this high M&amp;M is the high
      incidence of cardiac failure associated with an increased NT-proBNP in this group of
      patients. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether optimization of preoperative
      cardiac function can reduce cardiac M&amp;M postoperatively. Following verbal consent, patients
      with an increased NT-proBNP would be randomized to goal-directed preoperative optimization or
      standard management according to current hospital routines. Following optimization, the
      patients would be transferred to the operating rooms and subsequent management including
      perioperative patient management would be left to the discretion of a specialist
      anesthesiologist who is directly involved in patient care. Postoperatively, Troponin T and
      NT-proBNP would be measured in all patients according to the study protocol. In addition,
      major adverse cardiac events would be documented and follow-up would be done by after 30 days
      and 3 months postoperatively.

      This is a prospective, open, randomized, multi-center study. Primary screening of patients
      would take place in the Emergency room or Orthopedic ward according to the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria (see below). All patients (&gt;= 65 yr) with a proximal hip fracture would be
      required to provide either written or verbal informed consent prior to being included in the
      study. Subsequently, NT-proBNP would be taken and if this is above the recommended levels
      suggesting cardiac failure (&gt; 900 ng/l in patients 65-75 yrs old, and &gt;1800 ng/l in patients
      &gt; 75 yrs), the patients may be included into the study. Included patients would then be
      randomized into two groups: Standard management according to existing hospital routines and
      Optimized Management Patients with a normal NT-proBNP would be listed but would not be
      included in the study. Patients with proximal femur fracture who are &gt; 65 yrs old and have an
      increased NT-proBNP and who have given informed consent would be randomized to either
      Standard Management or Optimized Management. The former group would be managed according to
      the hospital routines and cared for by a Specialist Anaesthesiologist and Orthopaedic surgeon
      preoperatively.

      Group O= Optimization Patients who are randomized to the Optimization group would be
      transferred to a Holding Area, which is close to the Operating Rooms 4-6 hours prior to
      planned surgery. The main aim of optimization is to achieve a normal oxygen delivery to the
      tissues preoperatively i.e. DO2: 500-600ml/min/m2. Optimized management means that patients
      first have an Echocardiography to evaluate myocardial function. Subsequently, an arterial
      line is inserted and optimization achieved by using this arterial line connected to a
      Flo-track system (Vigileo, Edwards). The system uses pulse wave analysis to assess several
      parameters including: stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular
      resistance index (SVRI), as well as oxygen delivery (DO2).The main aim of goal-directed
      therapy is to achieve a normal oxygen delivery to the tissues i.e. DO2 500-600ml/min/m2.• Hb
      would be optimized to &gt; 90 g/l

        -  SaO2 &gt; 96%

        -  Stroke volume index (SVI) &gt; 30

        -  Heart rate should ideally be &lt; 80

      Stroke volume index (SVI) &gt; 30 is achieved by repeated volume substitution in the form of
      100-200 ml colloid. If, despite bolus doses of colloids, the SVI is &lt; 30, one would have to
      use ionotropic drugs e.g. dobutamine or levosimendan, in order to achieve this goa

      The study would be done in three hospitals: University Hospital, Linköping, University
      Hospital, Örebro and Jönköping Hospital. A total of 200 patients (100 in each group) would be
      included. It is expected that the study would be ongoing during a period of two years.

    <description>Patients who are randomized to this group would be managed according to existing routines within the hospital. Consequently, these patients would be transferred to the Orthopaedic ward after initial management in the Emergency Department, including fluid therapy, oxygen and pain management. Since these patients have a significantly high NT-proBNP, a Cardiologist would be consulted and a decision for optimization taken together with the attending Anaesthesiologist and Orthopaedic Surgeon prior to surgery.</description>
