    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, multi-center, open label, randomized; two-arms cross over study.

      This is the test protocol for the InsuPatch device, whose purpose is to improve insulin
      delivery into the blood when the insulin is infused using an insulin-infusion pump by
      controlled heating of the area surrounding the point of infusion.

      Fifty five(55) type 1 IDDM subjects in three centers who use the MiniMed paradigm insulin
      pump, meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria as outlined below and who provide written
      Informed Consent will be enrolled in the study.

      The study will be done with subjects randomized into one of two procedure sequences. Each
      subject will undergo 3 procedures (two clamps with the InsuPatch and one clamp without the
      InsuPatch) and will thus serve as his/her own control. The same 55 subjects will be
      randomized into one sequence or the other. The order of the procedures will be selected
      randomly and will be performed both within one month.

      There will be six Device visits starting with a screening and randomization visit, 3 clamps
      and a completion visit.
