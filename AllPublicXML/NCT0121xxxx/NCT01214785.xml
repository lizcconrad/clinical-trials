  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a cluster-randomized, controlled trial conducted among 100 villages (including
      approximately 3500 households and 20,000 people) in Puri district, State of Orissa, India.
      The study aims to assess the impact of the construction and use of latrines in rural settings
      on diarrhoeal disease, helminth infections and nutritional status. The study will also report
      on the cost and cost-effectiveness of the intervention and its impact on lost days at school
      and work as well as on expenditures on drugs and medical treatment. The study will document
      how the intervention actually impacts exposure to human excreta along principal transmission
      pathways by evaluating the impact on (i) faecal contamination of drinking water, (ii) the
      presence of mechanical vectors (flies) in food preparation areas, and (iii) the presence of
      faeces in and around participating households and villages. The study will also explore the
      extent to which different levels of acquisition and use of on-site sanitation among
      householders impact disease throughout the community.
