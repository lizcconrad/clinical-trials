    <textblock>
      In the light of ONTARGET and TRANSCEND studies results, it would be interesting to
      investigate the real-life telmisartan treatment tolerability. It is well known and accepted
      that the Real-life setting is much more adequate to reflect the antihypertensive and safety
      properties of the drug in comparison to the organized and scheduled setting of the clinical
      trial. Because there are not much data on the cough in relation to telmisartan, therefore it
      would we worth to observe the cough frequency and general treatment tolerance in patients
      treated with telmisartan, who had to stop their previous ACE-I treatment due to cough.
