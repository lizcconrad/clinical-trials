      The main objective of the study is to follow prospectively a cohort of patients with
      pre-diabetes to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in switching from
      pre-diabetes to type 2 diabetes and to identify new biomarkers of type 2 diabetes risk in
      this population.

    <description>The timing of the study is :- Screening of high metabolic risk patients based on a clinical score : Finnish Diabetes Risk Score ≥ 15- if Diabetes Risk Score ≥ 15 or if history of blood glucose between 1.10 and 1.26 g/l (impaired fasting glucose): measuring fasting glycaemia + HbA1C + lipids profile + creatinemia + liver enzymes- if fasting blood glucose between 1.10 and 1.26 g/l (=V0):* OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) to identify subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (optional)* establishment of a serum bank to identify biomarkers (serum, genomic, proteomic) - to plan for 10 years annual follow-up (V1 to V10) with blood sample (fasting glycemia + HbA1C + lipids profile + creatinemia + liver enzymes + serum bank (not after V5)) Making a total of 11 visits (V0-V10) with 6 blood samples.</description>
