    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomised after surgery, provided surgery is macroscopically adequate, that
      there is a flap of tissue protecting the vascular axis and that wound healing allows
      reirradiation to begin less than 8 weeks after surgery.Reirradiation will begin in the two
      arms less than 8 weeks after surgery in the irradiated area. The reirradiated volume : tumour
      bed + a safety margin of &lt; 2 cm with immediate protection of bone marrow. This volume should
      be jointly defined by the radiotherapist and the surgeon. During reirradiation, 60 Gy will be
      delivered in the two arms but will last 11 weeks in the reference arm and 5 weeks in the
      investigational arm.Acute toxicity (NCI-CTCAE) will be evaluated at the end of reirradiation
      and at 6 months from randomization (first follow-up consultation)

    <description>six 5-day cycles with a 9-day rest period between each cycle (split course). Each cycle includes : a single-fraction at a dose of 2 Gy per session for 5 sessions, combined with 5FU (800 mg/m2/day) and Hydrea (500 mg x 3/day) over the 5 days of the cycle. The total dose of radiotherapy is therefore 60 Gy delivered over 11 weeks.</description>

    <description>Bifractionated radiotherapy at a dose of 1.2 Gy per session at a rate of 2 sessions per day, at least 6h apart, 5 days per week over 5 weeks, without a split course, combined with Cetuximab. The total dose of radiotherapy is 60 Gy delivered over 5 weeks. Cetuximab (Erbitux√í) is to be administered in a 2-hour IV infusion at a dose of 400 mg/m2, 8 days before the start of radiotherapy, then in a 1-hour infusion at a dose of 250 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 of radiotherapy.</description>
