      Ge Gen Qin Lian Decoction are one kind of Chinese prescription, and previous study showed
      they had antidiabetic effects on the clinical patients and no obvious toxicity was found. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different dosage of Ge Gen

      two hundred and forty primary diabetic patients will be expected to be recruited, which were
      divided into different groups in a randomized, doubled blind, dose-paralleled-control
      multi-centre clinical design. The patients were randomly taken with high-dosage(5 times of
      low-dosage),mild-dosage(3 times of low-dosage), low-dosage,placebo(4.5% of low dosage) by 2
      times every day for 12 weeks. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Fasting plasma glucose
      (FPG),postprandial 2 hours plasma glucose(2hPG),insulin(0h,1h,2h),syndrome,symptoms,body mass
      index (BMI),waist circumference (WC) of these groups were measured and analyzed. Some safety
      indexes such blood and urine and stool routine examination, electrocardiogram (ECG)and liver
      and kidney function tests were measured and analyzed during the experiment. The treatment
      period is 12 week.
