  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to determine if eating sweetened, dried cranberries or
      strawberry fruit pieces will increase the types of different E. coli bacteria in the
      intestines which may reduce the likelihood of a major, or highly harmful urinary type of
      bacteria which cause urinary tract infections in susceptible women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study about the number and types of bacteria that cause urinary tract
      infections (E. coli strains) that are present in the intestine. The bacteria will be
      collected and analyzed before and after eating either sweetened, dried cranberries or
      strawberry fruit pieces. This study will help us learn more about whether or not the
      components of consumed sweetened, dried cranberries or strawberry fruit pieces reduce the
      numbers of harmful E. coli bacteria in the vaginal and intestinal tracts, thereby reducing
      the number of urinary tract infections among women.
