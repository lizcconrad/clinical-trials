  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study has been designed to provide current data on GERD prevalence in several
      regional areas of Greece outside the two major urban centres (Athens and Thessaloniki), to
      measure the treatment response in GERD patients, and to assess the correlations between the
      two methods of diagnosing GERD, i.e. reporting of symptoms by the patient to the physician
      and completion of the GerdQ questionnaire by the patient. Additionally, this study aims to
      provide data on the prevalence of extraesophageal symptoms in GERD patients in Greece. The
      XQS questionnaire will be applied for the identification of these patients and the assessment
      of the extraesophageal disease burden (frequency and intensity/severity). Finally, an
      association between the GerdQ and XQS scores will be attempted.
