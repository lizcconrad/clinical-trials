    <textblock>
      The study consists in two treatment groups, one group will receive Diurisa® (furosemide 40 mg
      + amiloride chloride 10 mg) and the other one will receive furosemide 40 mg (Lasix®)

      General Purpose

      1. To comparatively evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a fixed combination of
      furosemide (40 mg) and amiloride (10 mg) compared with furosemide alone, in the treatment of
      patients with HF functional class II (NYHA)

      Specific Purposes

        1. To evaluate the effect on kalemia of the fixed combination of furosemide and amiloride
           compared with furosemide alone in the treatment of patients with HF functional class II
           (NYHA)

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of the fixed combination of furosemide and amiloride in
           reducing edema of the LLLL, as compared with furosemide alone, in the treatment of
           patients with HF functional class II (NYHA).

    <description>General physical examination and measure of potassium level in blood will be used for measuring the improvement of CHF symptoms and decrease in peripheral edema. The exams will be performed before the enrollment in the clinical study and every 7 days. Patients who have potassium levels below normal (normal K+ ≥ 3.5 mEq/l) after visit 2 may receive oral replacement, at the investigator's discretion, pursuant to the study site routine. The final evaluation will be performed 42 days after the inclusion of the last patient.</description>
