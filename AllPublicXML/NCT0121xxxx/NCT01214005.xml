    <textblock>
      This project tests two hypotheses concerning the low smoking cessation rates in smokers with
      schizophrenia. The first hypothesis is that smokers with schizophrenia experience stronger
      and more sustained effects of smoking abstinence on negative mood and smoking urge than
      control smokers without psychiatric illness. The second hypothesis is that smokers with
      schizophrenia experience stronger reinforcing effects of a smoking lapse (i.e., more
      rewarding effects of smoking after a period of abstinence) than control smokers without
      psychiatric illness.

      In this study, smokers with schizophrenia and smokers without psychiatric illness participate
      in a nicotine preference task before and after a 3-day period of continuous smoking
      abstinence. The investigators will experimentally control abstinence by providing
      participants with high-value cash incentives contingent upon smoking abstinence verified with
      breath carbon monoxide levels. The investigators will measure nicotine withdrawal and smoking
      urge during the abstinence period. In the nicotine preference task, participants will make
      choices between nicotine-containing and denicotinized cigarette puffs to provide a measure of
      nicotine reinforcement, and the investigators will also measure the effects of smoking on
      mood. After the second nicotine preference task, participants will receive a small-value
      reinforcer if they continue to abstain for another day, and the investigators will measure
      time to the second lapse.
