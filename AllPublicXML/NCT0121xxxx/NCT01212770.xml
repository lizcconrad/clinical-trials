  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether apremilast is safe and effective in the
      treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis and a qualifying psoriasis lesion.

      Apremilast is proposed to improve signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis (tender and
      swollen joints, pain, physical function) in treated patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis that occurs in 6-39% of psoriasis
      patients. The immunopathogenesis of PsA, which mirrors but is not identical to that seen in
      psoriatic plaques, reflects a complex interaction among resident dendritic, fibroblastic and
      endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells attracted to the synovium by cytokines and
      chemokines. Apremilast (CC-10004) is a novel oral agent that modulates multiple inflammatory
      pathways through targeted phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) enzyme inhibition. Therefore,
      apremilast has the potential to be effective in the treatment of PsA.

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with Baseline psoriasis body surface area (BSA) involvement ≥ 3% who achieved 75% or greater improvement from Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score after 16 weeks of treatment. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) scored on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: • 28 tender joint count (TJC), • 28 swollen joint count (SJC), • Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; • Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 16</title>
          <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: • 28 tender joint count (TJC), • 28 swollen joint count (SJC), • Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; • Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables: • 28 tender joint count • 28 swollen joint count, which do not include the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee; • C-reactive protein (CRP) • Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>Modified PsARC response is defined as improvement in at least 2 of the 4 measures, at least one of which must be tender joint count or swollen joint count, and no worsening in any of the 4 measures: • 78 tender joint count, • 76 swollen joint count, • Patient global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm visual Analog scale (VAS), where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest; • Physician global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest. Improvement or worsening in joint counts is defined as decrease or increase, respectively, from baseline by ≥ 30%, and improvement or worsening in global assessments is defined as decrease or increase, respectively, from baseline by ≥ 20 mm VAS.</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with Baseline psoriasis body surface area (BSA) involvement ≥ 3% who achieved 75% or greater improvement from Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score after 24 weeks of treatment. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) scored on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Entheses Score (MASES) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score quantitates inflammation of the entheses (enthesitis) by assessing pain at the following entheses (sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone): 1st costochondral joints left/right; 7th costochondral joints left/right; posterior superior iliac spine left/right; anterior superior iliac spine left/right; iliac crest left/right; 5th lumbar spinous process; and the proximal insertion of the Archilles tendon left/right. The MASES, ranging from 0 to 13, is the number of painful entheses out of 13 entheses.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: • 28 tender joint count (TJC), • 28 swollen joint count (SJC), • Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; • Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8; Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10; Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22; High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables: • 28 tender joint count • 28 swollen joint count, which do not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee; • C-reactive protein (CRP) • Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

          <description>Percentage of participants with pre-existing dactylitis whose dactylitis severity score improved by ≥ 1 after 16 weeks of treatment. Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet was rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis severity score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Dactylitis Improvement ≥ 1 Point at Week 24</title>
          <description>Percentage of participants with pre-existing dactylitis whose dactylitis severity score improved by ≥ 1 after 24 weeks of treatment. Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet was rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis severity score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set; participants with a baseline dactylitis severity score &gt; 0 are included; LOCF was used. The Week 16 value was carried over to Week 24 for participants who escaped early at Week 16. Participants who did not have sufficient data (observed or imputed) for a determination of response status at Week 24 were counted as non-responders.</population>

        <description>Percentage of participants with pre-existing dactylitis whose dactylitis severity score improves to zero after 16 weeks of treatment. Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet was rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis severity score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a ≥ 75% Improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Score (PASI75) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with Baseline psoriasis body surface area (BSA) involvement ≥ 3% who achieved 75% or greater improvement from Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score after 52 weeks. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) scored on a scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease. Two-sided 95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the CDAI Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: •28 tender joint count (TJC), •28 swollen joint count (SJC), •Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; •Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the CDAI Score at Week 52</title>
          <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: •28 tender joint count (TJC), •28 swollen joint count (SJC), •Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; •Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the DAS28 at Week 52</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables: •28 tender joint count •28 swollen joint count, which do not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee; •C-reactive protein (CRP) •Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Good or Moderate EULAR Response at Week 52</title>
        <description>A EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity and an attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the DAS-28 score. A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 compared with Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2. A Moderate Response is defined as either: • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or, • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2. Two-sided 95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with pre-existing dactylitis whose dactylitis severity score improves to zero after 52 weeks. Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet was rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis severity score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present. Two-sided 95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

          <description>Percentage of participants with pre-existing dactylitis whose dactylitis severity score improves to zero after 52 weeks. Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet was rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis severity score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present. Two-sided 95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <description>A TEAE is an adverse event (AE) with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of investigational product (IP) and no later than 28 days after the last dose of IP. An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. A serious AE is any AE that results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or constitutes an important medical event. For both AEs and SAEs the investigator assessed the severity of the event according to the grading scale: Mild: asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, Moderate: symptoms causing moderate discomfort or Severe: symptoms causing severe discomfort or pain.</description>
