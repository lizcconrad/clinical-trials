  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will be comparing the effectiveness of two types of chiropractic
      manipulation and standard medical care for patients with a recent onset of low back pain. The
      two types of chiropractic treatments being compared will be hands-on (manual) manipulation
      and mechanical-assisted (Activator) manipulation. The standard medical care will consist of a
      medical examination and prescription for over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks (post treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry (OSW) Questionnaire provides the level of self-reported impairment of activity of daily living (ADLs) due to low back pain. There are 10 items in the OSW, each rated on a Likert scale from 0-5. The total range of possible scores is from 0 -50, which is converted to a percentage ranging from 0-100. The percentage of self-reported disability ranges from 0='no impairment' to 100='complete impairment'. Our statistical analysis looked at the change in OSW score (in percentage points) from baseline to 4 weeks (post treatment).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks (post treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported level of low back pain. We used the mean of 3 numeric pain rating scales: 1) current pain; 2) worst pain in the past 24 hours; and 3) average pain over the past week. Three individual 0 to 10 Likert scales were anchored by 0 indicating &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;unbearable pain&quot;. Our primary statistical analysis looked at the change in pain scores from baseline to 4 weeks (post treatment).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>We recruited 112 patients with a new episode of low back pain from the general population of the Greater Pittsburgh Metropolitan region. Recruitment took place during the period of time between November 2010 and April 2013.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>197 patients were screened for potential eligibility. We excluded 85 patients for not meeting the inclusion criteria. Of the 40 patients randomized to Standard Medical Care, 3 never showed up for their first visit and 2 were withdrawn by the PI before receiving any treatments; leaving only 35 in that arm.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index</title>
        <description>The Oswestry (OSW) Questionnaire provides the level of self-reported impairment of activity of daily living (ADLs) due to low back pain. There are 10 items in the OSW, each rated on a Likert scale from 0-5. The total range of possible scores is from 0 -50, which is converted to a percentage ranging from 0-100. The percentage of self-reported disability ranges from 0='no impairment' to 100='complete impairment'. Our statistical analysis looked at the change in OSW score (in percentage points) from baseline to 4 weeks (post treatment).</description>
