      RATIONALE: Placing a gene into T cells may improve the body's ability to recognize cancer
      cells and build an immune response to fight cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Biological
      therapies, such as aldesleukin, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Giving specially treated T cells together with cyclophosphamide,
      fludarabine phosphate, and aldesleukin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I clinical trial is studying the side effects and best dose of treated T
      cells when given together with cyclophosphamide, fludarabine phosphate, and aldesleukin in
      treating patients with cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T
           lymphocytes in combination with preconditioning chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide
           and fludarabine phosphate plus aldesleukin in patients with CEA-positive tumors.

        -  To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the dose of MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes
           required to give optimal survival of these cells in the circulation (recommended phase
           II dose).

      Secondary

        -  To assess whether MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes isolated
           from the circulation are functional.

        -  To determine the preliminary tumor response to MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA
           MFEz T lymphocytes.

        -  To evaluate the safety of MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous
      anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis 7-14 days before study therapy begins. Cells are then
      transduced with a retrovirus vector and expanded to produce MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous
      anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes.

      Patients receive preconditioning chemotherapy comprising fludarabine phosphate IV over 15
      minutes on days -5 to -1 or cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -7 to -6 and fludarabine
      phosphate IV over 15 minutes on days -5 to -1. They receive MFE23 scFv-expressing autologous
      anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes IV over 30 minutes on day 0. Patients also receive high-dose
      aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 12 doses beginning on day 0, in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If there is evidence of MFE23
      scFv-expressing autologous anti-CEA MFEz T lymphocytes survival, patients may receive
      additional high-dose aldesleukin.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      studies. Some patients may undergo a tumor biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 weeks for 6 weeks,
      every 4 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
