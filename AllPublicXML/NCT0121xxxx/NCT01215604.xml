    <textblock>
      The investigators propose that the translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF4GI may be
      involved in resolution of acute inflammation (regardless of age). Furthermore, the
      investigators suggest that differences in translation initiation factors state of activation
      may contribute to inflammation. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that differences in
      translation initiation factors state of activation may underlie the immune compromised state
      of the very elderly affording additional explanation for the heightened morbidity from
      infection in this group.

      In the current study the investigators aim to test these hypotheses by measuring the levels
      of eIF4E and eIF4G, their regulators, and targets in elderly (65-84yrs) and very elderly
      (85yrs&lt;) patients hospitalized at Meir hospital for acute infection and after their recovery
      (detailed in study design).
