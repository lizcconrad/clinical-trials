      Objective: To study the weight and the post menstrual age (PMA) at the time of nasal CPAP
      (NCPAP) wean utilizing the method of sudden wean as compared to gradual wean. . Methods: A
      prospective randomized trial was conducted comparing sudden weaning with gradual weaning from
      NCPAP in neonates with gestational age (GA) &lt;32 weeks. The patients were randomized to one of
      the two methods of weaning from NCPAP and their success was compared.
