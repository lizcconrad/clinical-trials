    <textblock>
      Falls are a common problem in elderly people which they have to receive the operation.
      Hemiarthroplasty is one of the common orthopedics operations. The prompt operation and good
      pain control will provide the good recovery and outcome. The investigators compare the
      efficacy of postoperative pain control between Intrathecal morphine 0.1 milligrams (mg.) with
      the local infiltration of 0.25% Bupivacaine for 20 milliliters (ml.) in patients received hip
      hemiarthroplasty under spinal anesthesia.

      Study process All the patients who assigned the hip hemiarthroplasty without any exclusion
      criteria will be enrolled in the study and be divided into 3 groups randomly

        1. control group : the patients will be received spinal anesthesia with 0.5% Isobaric
           Bupivacaine and postoperative pain control by intravenous (IV) Patient - control
           Analgesia (PCA)

        2. Morphine group : the patients will be received 0.1 mg. of Morphine added in Isobaric
           Bupivacaine for spinal anesthesia and postoperative pain control by IV PCA

        3. Local group : the patients will be received spinal anesthesia and periarticular tissue
           infiltration with 0.25% Bupivacaine and postoperative pain control by IV PCA

      Data collection

        1. Demographic data : age, sex, Body Weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), ...

        2. Pain score every 3 hours postoperatively in the first 6 hours and at the 12th hours by
           visual analogue scoring system

        3. Patient global assessment and patient satisfactory visual analogue scoring system at
           24th and 48th hour

        4. the amount of morphine during 24 and 48 hours postoperative and the time of first dose
           they received
