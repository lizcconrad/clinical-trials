    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of the MIND-USA (Modifying the Impact of ICU-Induced Neurological
      Dysfunction-USA) Study is to define the role of antipsychotics in the management of delirium
      in vulnerable critically ill patients. We and others have shown that delirium is an
      independent predictor of more death, longer stay, higher cost, and long-term cognitive
      impairment often commensurate with moderate dementia. The rapidly expanding aging ICU
      population is especially vulnerable to develop delirium, with 7 of 10 medical and surgical
      ICU patients developing this organ dysfunction. Antipsychotics are the first-line
      pharmacological agents recommended to treat delirium, and over the past 30 years they gained
      widespread use in hospitalized patients globally prior to adequate testing of efficacy and
      safety for this indication. Haloperidol, the most commonly chosen antipsychotic, is used by
      over 80% of ICU doctors for delirium, while atypical antipsychotics are prescribed by 40%.
      Antipsychotics safety concerns include lethal cardiac arrhythmias, extrapyramidal symptoms,
      and the highly publicized increased mortality associated with their use in non-ICU geriatric
      populations. The overarching hypothesis is that administration of typical and atypical
      antipsychotics—haloperidol and ziprasidone, in this case—to critically ill patients with
      delirium will improve short- and long-term clinical outcomes, including days alive without
      acute brain dysfunction (referred to as delirium/coma-free days or DCFDs) over a 14-day
      period; 30-day, 90-day, and 1-year survival; ICU length of stay; incidence, severity, and/or
      duration of long-term neuropsychological dysfunction; and quality of life at 90-day and
      1-year. To test these hypotheses, the MIND-USA Study will be a multi-center, double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled investigation in 561 critically ill, delirious
      medical/surgical ICU patients who are (a) on mechanical ventilation or non-invasive positive
      pressure ventilation or (b) in shock on vasopressors. In each group (haloperidol,
      ziprasidone, and placebo), 187 patients will be enrolled and treated until delirium has
      resolved for 48 hours or to 14 days (whichever occurs first) and followed for 1 year.

      The primary and secondary outcomes of the MIND-USA investigation will be analyzed both
      according to the individual comparisons by group of &quot;haloperidol treated&quot; vs. &quot;placebo
      treated&quot; and &quot;ziprasidone treated&quot; vs. &quot;placebo treated&quot; and also the combined grouping of
      both antipsychotics (&quot;haloperidol plus ziprasidone treated&quot; patients vs. &quot;placebo treated&quot;
      patients). In the latter third of the study, as a result of a paper by Patel S et al AJRCCM
      2014 about rapidly reversible delirium (RRD), we considered modifying delirium assessments to
      detect those who might convert from CAM-ICU positive to negative following SATs, but we
      estimated that only 5 patients per arm would be in this category (and indeed &lt;20 per arm in
      the entire study using the 10% rate published by Patel). With such low numbers and the
      assurance that through randomization we would have all groups analyzed similarly according to
      the study drug assignment, we elected not to alter the protocol and not to conduct subgroup
      analyses according to RRD status.
