  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cervix cancer is the second malignant neoplasia more common between women. The combined
      treatment involving chemotherapy and radiotherapy was defined as the standard. This study
      will evaluate the safety, toxicity and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of everolimus in
      association with cisplatin and pelvic radiotherapy, in patients with squamous cells carcinoma
      of uterine cervix, in stages IIB and IIIB.
