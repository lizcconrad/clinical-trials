    <textblock>
      According to the studies CC is successful at inducing ovulation in 50%-75% of cases, but only
      30-40% becomes pregnant. The difference has been attributed to a negative action of clomifen
      citrate(CC) in the form of prolonged antiestrogenic effects on endometrial receptivity. For
      avoiding of these negative effects, giving ethinyl estradiol in sufficient dosages may be
      effective. The purpose of this study is comparing pregnancy rates after IUI in women who use
      CC alone and those who use CC in combination with ethinyl estradiol

      The proposal of This study approved by our institutional review boards and institution's
      ethical committee, and all Participants will sign a written consent before enter to study.
      All patients will be randomly divided into two groups, A and B. Stimulation will begin on day
      3 with the administration of 100 mg of clomifen citrate(CC) daily for 5 days. On day 8,
      ethinyl estradiol will be given daily for 5 days in group A and placebo will be given for 5
      days in group B. Plasma levels of estradiol(E2), Luteinizing hormone (LH) and
      Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) will be evaluated on days 3 and 13 of the menstrual cycle.
      Ultrasound examination will be done on days 3, 13 and days of HCG administration and IUI for
      determining of endometrial thickness, number of follicles and size of the dominant follicle.

      When the diameter of at least one follicle reached equal or greater than 18 mm, human chronic
      gonadotrophin (HCG) 10,000 IU will be administered.

      The pulsatility index also will be recorded in both uterine arteries on day of HCG
      administration. A single IUI will be performed 24-36 hours after the administration of hCG.
      Pregnancy will be confirmed by increasing level of concentration of serum Î²HCG which will be
      assessed 14 days after IUI
