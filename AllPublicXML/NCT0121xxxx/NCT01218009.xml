  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-year study to look at the safety of a dry powder inhaler with albuterol. After
      a one-week run in, for the first 3 months subjects will use an inhaler with either albuterol
      or a dummy drug at regular times four times a day. Then for the last nine months of the
      study, all subjects will be given the albuterol dry powder inhaler and will use it only when
      needed to help with breathing problems. Subjects will need to keep a daily diary (both paper
      and electronic) throughout the study recording any inhaler use and health problems. There
      will be visits to the study doctor about once a month for a year. This study is intended to
      show that the albuterol dry powder inhaler works well and is safe for use over a long period
      of time.

      The Sponsor terminated this study due to the need for a modification to the Spiromax device
      utilized in this study; the problem identified has no impact on patient safety. Exposure
      ranged from 3 to 49 days with the majority of subjects receiving ≤30 days of double-blind
      treatment.

    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 49 (study termination)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) summarized in this table are those that began or worsened after treatment with study drug (treatment-emergent AEs). An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

    <description>A complete physical examination was planned at study screening, week 12 and week 52 or early termination/discontinuation of the participant. At weeks 12 and 52,the qualified healthcare professional was to evaluate whether each physical finding is a new finding, worsening, improvement or resolution of an existing condition compared with the baseline physical exam. Where possible, the same qualified healthcare professional that performed the physical examination at study screening should perform all the scheduled physical examinations.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were to collected for laboratory evaluations at the screening visit and at weeks 12 and 52 or early termination/discontinuation of the participant. The blood samples were to be drawn after an overnight fast of at least 6 hours and analyzed by a central laboratory.</description>

    <description>A standard 12-lead ECG was to be performed at screening and at week 12 and week 52 (TV15) or early termination/discontinuation of the participant. The ECG recording methods were to be centralized and standardized across all study subjects.</description>

    <description>Vital sign measurements (heart rate and blood pressure) were to be evaluated as part of the safety profile assessment. The participant was to be seated at least 2 minutes before vital signs were performed. Either an electronic or manual sphygmomanometer could be used.</description>

        <description>Adverse events (AEs) summarized in this table are those that began or worsened after treatment with study drug (treatment-emergent AEs). An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

        <description>A complete physical examination was planned at study screening, week 12 and week 52 or early termination/discontinuation of the participant. At weeks 12 and 52,the qualified healthcare professional was to evaluate whether each physical finding is a new finding, worsening, improvement or resolution of an existing condition compared with the baseline physical exam. Where possible, the same qualified healthcare professional that performed the physical examination at study screening should perform all the scheduled physical examinations.</description>
