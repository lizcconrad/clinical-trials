  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aromatherapy with lavender oil compared to
      placebo lowers anxiety levels in women during colposcopy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aromatherapy is a modality that might reduce anxiety. Women experience high levels of anxiety
      and negative emotional responses at all stages of cervical cancer screening. High levels of
      anxiety before and during colposcopy can be bad. If lavender oil aromatherapy reduces
      anxiety, then simple use of this modality may improve experiences during colposcopy.
