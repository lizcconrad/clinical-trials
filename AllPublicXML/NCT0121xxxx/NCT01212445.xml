    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the proportion of subjects with a bowel
      movement (BM) without straining or without hard and/or lumpy stool within the first 24 h of
      treatment for subjects taking 1 of 3 single doses of Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) plus
      Electrolytes (PEG+E) (13.125 g, 26.25 g, 39.375 g). The doses specified relate to the doses
      of PEG. Secondary objectives were measured by analysis of a subject diary and self-reported
      BM data. The secondary objectives included comparisons of PEG+E doses at 24 h for: BM
      control; relief of gas; relief of bloating; and relief of abdominal discomfort/cramping.

      In addition, the proportion of subjects with a BM (without straining and without hard and/or
      lumpy stool) within the first 24 h of treatment for subjects taking different doses of PEG+E
      was evaluated for the time to first BM.

    <measure>Mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Rating for BM Control</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of study drug treatment up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a psychometric response scale which measures responses along a continuum of values. The BM control VAS uses a 100 mm horizontal line with the two ends representing the opposite, extreme limits of the participant's experience of BM control. Participants marked where they felt they resided between the two ends with a vertical line. The distance from the left end of the VAS (0 mm) to the participant's mark was measured and recorded in mm. BM Control ratings ranged on a continuous scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 mm=Calm, not urgent and 100 mm= Not able to hold BM, very urgent.
Participants completed a VAS after every BM or attempted BM. The VAS ratings recorded in the diaries for each BM were averaged (with range) to yield a single score for each participant. Participant scores were then averaged by treatment group</description>

    <measure>Mean VAS Rating for Gas</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of study drug treatment up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a psychometric response scale which measures responses along a continuum of values. The Gas VAS uses a 100 mm horizontal line with the two ends representing opposite, extreme limits of the participant's experience with BM-related gas. Participants marked where they felt they resided between the two ends with a vertical line. The distance from the left end of the VAS (0 mm) to the participant's mark was measured and recorded in mm. Gas ratings ranged on a continuous scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 mm=None and 100 mm= Severe.
Participants completed a VAS after every BM or attempted BM. The VAS ratings recorded in the diaries for each BM were averaged (with range) to yield a single score for each participant. Participant scores were then averaged by treatment group.</description>

    <time_frame>From time of study drug treatment up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a psychometric response scale which measures responses along a continuum of values. The Bloating VAS uses a 100 mm horizontal line with the two ends representing opposite, extreme limits of the participant's experience with BM-related bloating. Participants marked where they felt they resided between the two ends with a vertical line. The distance from the left end of the VAS (0 mm) to the participant's mark was measured and recorded in mm. Bloating ratings ranged on a continuous scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 mm=None and 100 mm= Severe.

    <time_frame>From time of study drug treatment up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a psychometric response scale which measures responses along a continuum of values. The Abdominal Discomfort/Cramping VAS uses a 100 mm horizontal line with the two ends representing opposite, extreme limits of the participant's experience with BM-related abdominal discomfort/cramping. Participants marked where they felt they resided between the two ends with a vertical line. The distance from the left end of the VAS (0 mm) to the participant's mark was measured and recorded in mm. Abdominal discomfort/cramping ratings ranged on a continuous scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 mm=None and 100 mm= Painful.
Participants completed a VAS after every BM or attempted BM. The VAS ratings recorded in the diaries for each BM were averaged (with range) to yield a single score for each participant. Participant scores were then averaged by treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Mean Participant Global Assessment of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of study drug administration up to 2 Days</time_frame>
    <description>At the End of Study Visit, the study staff asked the participant to rate their global assessment of the study treatment according to the following categories: 0 = not at all effective, 1 = a little bit effective, 2 = moderately effective, 3 = quite a bit effective, 4 = extremely effective.</description>

        <title>Mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Rating for BM Control</title>
        <description>The VAS is a psychometric response scale which measures responses along a continuum of values. The BM control VAS uses a 100 mm horizontal line with the two ends representing the opposite, extreme limits of the participant's experience of BM control. Participants marked where they felt they resided between the two ends with a vertical line. The distance from the left end of the VAS (0 mm) to the participant's mark was measured and recorded in mm. BM Control ratings ranged on a continuous scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 mm=Calm, not urgent and 100 mm= Not able to hold BM, very urgent.
Participants completed a VAS after every BM or attempted BM. The VAS ratings recorded in the diaries for each BM were averaged (with range) to yield a single score for each participant. Participant scores were then averaged by treatment group</description>

        <title>Mean VAS Rating for Bloating</title>
        <description>The VAS is a psychometric response scale which measures responses along a continuum of values. The Bloating VAS uses a 100 mm horizontal line with the two ends representing opposite, extreme limits of the participant's experience with BM-related bloating. Participants marked where they felt they resided between the two ends with a vertical line. The distance from the left end of the VAS (0 mm) to the participant's mark was measured and recorded in mm. Bloating ratings ranged on a continuous scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 mm=None and 100 mm= Severe.
Participants completed a VAS after every BM or attempted BM. The VAS ratings recorded in the diaries for each BM were averaged (with range) to yield a single score for each participant. Participant scores were then averaged by treatment group.</description>
