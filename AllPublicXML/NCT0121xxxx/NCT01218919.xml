      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a rechargeable Deep Brain
      Stimulation as an adjunctive treatment for reducing some of the symptoms of advanced,
      levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease that are not adequately controlled with medication.

      This is the first observational study for the use of the BRIO™ rechargeable constant current
      device, using a lead with an active electrode tip for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson
      subjects. The current study was designed to conform to normal medical practices, taking into
      consideration the current day economic constraints, while assessing the best set of
      circumstances for the successful sustained reduction of some of the symptoms of advanced,
      levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease that are not adequately controlled with medication.

      This study is designed as a prospective, observational, non-randomized, multi-centered study
      for a total of 10 years in duration. It is a 10 year study from system implantation and
      activation with a yearly database lock and report, with the subjects being used as their own
      control. The primary outcome assessment will occur at three months. Following completion of
      the primary outcome assessment, patients will have an annual visit up to 10 years post
      implant.

      Comparison of measures within the same person from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be
      performed.

      During the implantation procedure, each subject will undergo a trial of stimulation in the
      operating room among other potential assessments to determine proper lead placement. The
      device may be internalized after a successful intra-operative trial or at a later date
      according to investigator site practice. The date that all components are implanted and
      programmed will be classified as &quot;Day 0&quot;. After system activation the subject will return to
      clinic for post-operative evaluations at 1 month (+/-14 days), 3 months (+/-14 days), 6
      months (+/-14 days) and 12 months (+/-30 days). Thereafter, a long term data collection
      program will be followed for 10 years post-implant.
