  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Admission BNP was a useful marker for diagnosing and predicting type IV cardio-renal syndrome
      type IV in patients with chronic kidney disease admitted to the ICU for acute heart failure
      in a retrospective study. Therefore, we aim to prospectively investigate the utility of serum
      BNP in evaluating the treatment adequacy and predicting future cardiac events in patients
      with type IV CRS.
