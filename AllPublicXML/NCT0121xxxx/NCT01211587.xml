  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research trial is to determine if safinamide (experimental drug) can
      improve cognition in cognitively impaired but non-demented Parkinson's disease patients. The
      word &quot;experimental&quot; means the trial drug is not approved by Health Authorities (government
      authorities) and is still being tested for safety and effectiveness.

      Approximately one hundred (100) patients will participate in this research trial. The
      research trial will be conducted in approximately thirty (30) medical centers in the
      following countries: Argentina, Canada, Italy, Peru, South Africa, Spain and USA. The
      research trial will last until June 2012.

    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total score reduction in the PD-CRS at 12 weeks compared to the Baseline. The PD-CRS detects early cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. It is composed of 2 scales, the subcortical scale (items 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) and the cortical scale (items 2, 6). The total score of the subcortical scale is from 0 to 114. The total score of the cortical scale is from 0 to 20. The PD-CRS Total score represents the sum of scores on the cortical and subcortical scales. It ranges from 0 to 134. The more points, the less the impairment.</description>

    <measure>Dementia Rating Scale - 2 (DRS-2) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DRS-2 will provide a general measure of cognitive ability in PD subjects. It has thus been chosen as a tool to compare cognitive performance in PD across different trials. Administered at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 24. The DRS-2 consists of 36 tasks divided into 5 subscales (Attention, Initiation/Perseveration, Construction, Conceptualization, and Memory). The maximum score on each subscale is as follows: Attention = 37; Initiation/Perseveration = 37; Construction = 6; Conceptualization = 39, Memory = 25. The DRS-2 total score = 144 (the more points, the less the impairment).</description>
