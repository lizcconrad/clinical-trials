      RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether
      sunitinib is effective in treating non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying sunitinib to see how well it works when given as
      maintenance therapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung
      cancer which is previously treated with combination chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To investigate the effect of sunitinib malate on the progression-free survival of
           patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer Secondary

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of sunitinib when administered in the maintenance setting.

        -  To evaluate the additional response rate to sunitinib malate when administered in the
           maintenance setting.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival of patients treated with sunitinib. After completion of
           study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1
           year, and periodically for 3 years.
