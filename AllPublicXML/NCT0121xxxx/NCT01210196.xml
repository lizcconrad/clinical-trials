        Male and female patients with a genetically confirmed Fabry disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women: A confirmed exonic mutation within the α-Galactosidase gene Men: A confirmed
             exonic mutation within the α-Galactosidas gene and/or reduced α- Galactosidase
             activity

          2. Female patients ≥ 25 years-old and male patients ≥ 25 years-old

          3. The patient has not received enzyme replacement therapy for treatment of Fabry disease

          4. The patient must have voluntarily signed an Institutional Review Board
             (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved informed consent form after all
             relevant aspects of the study have been explained and discussed with the patient

          5. The patient has already mild symptoms of Fabry disease presented in at least one minor
             organ involvement, e.g. proteinuria 1, mild cardiac symptoms not needing treatment
             yet, pain attacks, gastrointestinal symptoms or history of TIA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has received ERT or investigational product(s) for any reason within 30
             days prior to study entry.

          2. Any contraindication for MRI-diagnosis

          3. Incompatibility to MRI contrast agent (elevated serum creatinine - according to SPC of
             contrast medium) The patient is unable to comply with the protocol, e.g., has a
             clinically relevant medical condition making implementation of the protocol difficult;
             has an uncooperative attitude; is unable to return for study evaluations; or is
             otherwise unlikely to complete the study, as determined by the investigator.

          4. Planned ERT within the next 24 months (nevertheless if a ERT becomes medically
             necessary in the observational period ERT might be introduced)
