      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of minimal (MECC) versus conventional (CECC)
      extracorporeal circulation on neurocognitive function after elective coronary bypass grafting
      (CABG) as well as whether this can be attributed to improved cerebral perfusion
      intraoperatively.

      Despite improvements in the biocompatibility of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuits, the
      activation of inflammatory systemic response can result in clinically relevant organ
      dysfunction. Regarding the central nervous system, prolonged hypoperfusion and
      microembolization during conventional CPB have been related to postoperative neurologic
      impairment with an incidence varying from 30% to 60%. This clinical scenario covers a
      spectrum from a transient subtle cognitive dysfunction to a permanent stroke. Postoperative
      cognitive decline (POCD) is characterized as impairment in attention, cognition, recognition,
      orientation, memory, and learning. It may result in prolonged hospitalization, increased
      morbidity and mortality, while it has an adverse impact on quality of life after surgery.

      Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a continuous and noninvasive monitoring of
      regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). Recent studies have shown a significant
      relationship between intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturation, indicative of cerebral
      ischemia, and early POCD in patients undergoing elective coronary bypass grafting (CABG) with
      conventional extracorporeal circulation (CECC). In an attempt to reduce CPB-inherent side
      effects, a minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) system was developed and it is evaluated
      in clinical practice. The aim of this pilot study was to define whether there is a difference
      in early postoperative neurocognitive functioning between patients being operated for CABG on
      MECC versus CECC systems as well as whether this can be attributed to improved cerebral
      perfusion intraoperatively.

    <description>The MECC system (Maquet Cardiopulmonary, Hirlingen, Germany) consists of a pre-connected closed CPB circuit containing a RotaFlow centrifugal pump and a Quadrox D diffusion membrane oxygenator. A flow meter and a bubble sensor are integrated in the drive unit of the centrifugal pump. The system features a tip-to-tip heparin coating (Bioline Coating, Maquet Cardiopulmonary, Hirlingen, Germany). No arterial or venous line filters are included. Initial priming volume of the system is 500 mL, while using retrograde autologous priming (RAP) the circuit could be filled in with autologous blood, thus reducing hemodilution. Since no cardiotomy suction is used, shed blood is collected with a cell-saving device (Haemonetics Corp, Braintree, MA).</description>

    <description>A standard open CPB circuit is used, consisting of uncoated PVC tubing, a hard-shell venous reservoir, a microporous membrane oxygenator (Dideco, Mirandola, Italy) and a roller pump (Stöckert S3, Munich, Germany). The circuit contains a 40 μm arterial line blood filter (Dideco, Mirandola, Italy) and it is primed with 1500 mL of a balanced crystalloid/colloid solution (1000 mL of Ringer's solution, 200 mL of mannitol 20%, and 300 mL of hydroxyethyl starch 6%). Cardiotomy as well as sump sucker are integrated to the circuit.</description>
