  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary disease is one of the most frequent pathology of the modern world and the leading
      cause of death in the investigators country. In Spain more than 50.000 coronary percutaneous
      intervention and more than 5.000 coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures are performed
      every year. Despite this data about 12% of patients have diffuse coronary disease and are not
      candidates to conventional therapies. Also between 15-25% of patients undergoing coronary
      bypass grafting receive an incomplete revascularization due to the poor quality of the
      coronary vessels.

      Transmyocardial revascularization (TMR) is a surgical procedure that uses a laser to create
      channels through the myocardial, so this laser stimulates local angiogenesis and provides
      blood in the ischemic area. Results of this procedure have shown clear benefits in terms of
      reduction of angina and increase of survival of patients, compared to medical treatment.

      Cell therapy in heart disease is offering in recent years encouraging results despite the
      methodological difficulties that being able to use this technique sometimes involves. The
      basis lies in the potential ability of stem cells to differentiate into any type of adult
      cell. In the case of cardiac cell therapy, stem cells can differentiate into myocardial cells
      or vascular cells capable of developing angiogenesis. Further studies are needed to draw firm
      conclusions about the clinical impact that the use of stem cells has on cardiovascular
      disease.

      Recently a system has been developed to create, at the same time and in a simple and
      effective way, the laser channels and the introduction of stem cells on the edges of these
      channels. This system called PHOENIX ™ consists of a laser probe capable of creating
      transmural channels in the myocardium.

      Based on the what has just been explained, it is quite possible that the combination of both
      therapies can increase successful results regarding the reduction in angina these patients
      need. Initially, and after having some experience with this type of treatment, the results
      could be analyzed and compared with the results obtained through laser therapy, with the help
      of a controlled clinical trial, such as the one the investigators are proposing.

    <description>The system called PHOENIXTM consists of a laser probe with Holmium:YAG energy capable of creating transmural channels in the myocardium. Surrounding this fibre 3 needles with side holes are arranged so that the implantation of stem cells is done on the edges of the channel and not on the channel itself. This device is capable of distributing stem cells in those channels created by the laser, carrying out both procedures simultaneously.</description>
