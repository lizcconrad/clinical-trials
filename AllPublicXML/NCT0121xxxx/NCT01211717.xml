      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the 3 Branched Chained Amino
      Acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) on treating Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness, a type of
      muscle pain which usually develops after exercising.

    <textblock>
      Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness is a common painful sensation experienced by individuals who
      have been recently inactive and begin with an unaccustomed exercise protocol. Branched
      Chained Amino Acids have been found as a useful supplement for promoting muscle recovery
      following exercise; however the effects of this supplement have not been investigated amongst
      individuals with diabetes.

    <description>Two doses of the Branched Chained Amino Acid supplement will be taken. The first dose will be taken 35 minutes before the intended exercise, and the other dose will be taken right after completing the exercise. The amount of the Branched Chained Amino Acid supplement administered to the subjects in the experimental group will vary from one person to the other but a total dose of 1 gram of BCAA per kilogram of lean body mass will be used. This dose will be divided in half and administered at the two specified occasions. The ratio of isoleucine, leucine, and valine will be 1:2.5:1 respectively</description>
