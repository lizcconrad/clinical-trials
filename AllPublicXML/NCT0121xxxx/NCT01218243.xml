    <textblock>
      To evaluate efficacy of BL33 for mild and moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH).There
      are trials showing that electroacupuncture on BL33 for mild and moderate BPH is more
      effective than terazosin. It could reduce the International Prostate Syndrome Score (IPSS) by
      6.68±2.84(39.79%),lower urinary symptoms bother of score(BS) and bladder residual urine, and
      increase maximum urinary flow rate.But the efficacy of BL33 has not been studied. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate efficacy of BL32 for mild and moderate BPH by
      comparison with non-acupoint group.

      <pre_assignment_details>Diagnosis and assessment were made by an independent urologist who was uninvolved in the treatment process.Baseline assessments included international prostate symptom score (IPSS), postvoid residual urine (PVR) and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax).</pre_assignment_details>
