    <textblock>
      The study will compare procedural and post procedural outcomes for photoselective
      vaporization of the prostate (PVP) and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The
      study requires use of the CE marked GreenLight XPS™ Laser System (GreenLight XPS) or a CE
      marked monopolar or bipolar loop TURP system for the treatment of benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH). The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that PVP is not inferior to
      TURP.

    <description>GreenLight XPS laser console GreenLight XPS consists of a 532 nm laser console capable of achieving power outputs between 20W and 180W. Laser technology is used to vaporize tissue for debulking prostatic hyperplasia and improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms. The 532 nm wavelength is in the visible spectrum as green light and is strongly absorbed by oxyhemoglobin.
Monopolar and bipolar loop TURP Systems The TURP procedure requires the use of a resectoscope, camera system and irrigation fluid. The system consists of a generator unit and a wire loop with an electrical current running through the loop used to cut prostate tissue and cauterize. Prostate tissue is cut away in small pieces and removed at the end of the procedure using irrigation. There are many manufacturers of TURP systems. Any monopolar and bipolar loop system that carry the CE mark may be used for the study.</description>
