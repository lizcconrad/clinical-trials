    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities

          2. Progressive disease or relapse of multiple myeloma (according to the IMWG definition)
             after one or two prior therapeutic treatments or regimens for multiple myeloma that
             achieved a response duration of at least 6 months

          3. Prior therapeutic treatment regimens may have included Thalidomide and Lenalidomide.
             Regarding patients previously treated by Lenalidomide, only patients who achieved at
             least Partial Response duration of at least 6 months can be included. The patient must
             not have discontinued treatment due to Lenalidomide intolerance.

          4. Measurable disease, as indicated by one or more of the following:

               -  Serum M-protein ≥ 0.5 g/dL If Serum Protein Electrophoresis is felt to be
                  unreliable for routine M-protein measurement (particularly for patients with IgA
                  MM), then quantitative immunoglobulin levels can be accepted).

               -  Urine Bence-Jones protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h

               -  Involved serum Free Light Chains (sFLC) level ≥ 10 mg/dl ( ≥ 100 mg/l) provided
                  sFLC ratio is abnormal (&lt;0.26 or &gt;1.65)

          5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2

          6. Clinical laboratory values at screening

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance (according to MDRD) &gt; 60 ml/min

               -  Platelet ≥ 75 x 109 /l for patients with &lt; 50% BM plasma cells, and ≥ 30 x 109 /l
                  for patients with &gt; 50% BM plasma cells

               -  ANC &gt; 1 x 109 /l

               -  Bilirubin levels &lt; 1.5 ULN ; ALT and AST &lt; 3 ULN (grade 1 NCI)

          7. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL within 10 - 14 days prior to
             and again within 24 hours of prescribing Lenalidomide (prescriptions must be filled
             within 7 days) and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual
             intercourse or begin TWO acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective
             method and one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before
             she starts taking Lenalidomide. FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men
             must agree to use a latex condom during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have
             had a successful vasectomy

          8. All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and
             be willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt; 18 years or &gt; 80 years

          2. Non secreting multiple myeloma or non measurable disease (&lt; 0.5 g /dL M-Protein in
             serum or &lt; 200 mg urinary M-protein / 24 h or &lt;10 mg/dl involved sFLC)

          3. Life-threatening conditions related or not to MM relapse

          4. Pregnant or breast feeding females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed
             while taking Lenalidomide)

          5. Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide or IMiD®.

          6. Use of any investigational agent within the last month

          7. Treatment by systemic corticosteroids (except inhaled corticosteroids) or chemotherapy
             (including consolidation and maintenance) within the last month (use of biphosphonates
             is permitted)

          8. Radiotherapy within the last month

          9. Primary or associated amyloidosis

         10. Peripheral neuropathy of grade ≥ 3 according to the CTCAE of the NCI

         11. Abnormal cardiac status with any of the following

               -  NYHA stage III or IV congestive heart failure

               -  myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months

               -  cardiac arrhythmia remaining symptomatic despite treatment

         12. Current active infectious disease or positive serology for HIV, HCV or positive Hbs
             Antigen

         13. History of or current auto-immune disease

             carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervix carcinoma)

         15. Serious concurrent uncontrolled medical disorder

         16. History of allograft or solid organ transplantation

         17. Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
