      The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of TS determination in a multicenter
      trial setting using a central facility for measurement and confirm its role as predictive
      factor for 5-FU treatment in MCRC.

      Eligible were patients with non-resectable metastasized or recurrent histologically proven
      CRC with the presence of a reference lesion two-dimensional measurable and accessible for a
      biopsy.The biopsy was taken from the reference lesion either by surgery during primary tumor
      resection, by trans-cutaneous true-cut needle biopsy or by trans-anal approach. Intratumoral
      relative TS mRNA expression levels were determined using samples shipped in RNA-preserving
      solution or as glass slides after microdissection of tumor cells. An independent company
      stratified the patients according to ther relative TS mRNA expression level in TS low and TS
      high followed by randomization to receive either FUFA of Folfiri. Response to chemotherapy
      was evaluated and documented according to the RECIST criteria after every therapy cycle.
