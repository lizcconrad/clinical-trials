  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a one year open-label treatment of
      tasimelteon in male and female subjects with Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (N24HSWD) occurs when individuals, primarily those without
      light perception, are unable to synchronize their endogenous circadian pacemaker to the
      24-hour light-dark cycle, and the timing of their circadian rhythm instead reflects the
      intrinsic period of their endogenous circadian pacemaker. As a result, the circadian rhythm
      of sleep-wake propensity in these individuals moves gradually later and later each day if
      there circadian period is &gt; 24 hours and earlier and earlier if &lt; 24 hours. These individuals
      will be able to sleep well at night when their sleep-wake propensity rhythm is approximately
      aligned with the 24-hour light-dark and social cycle. However, after a short time, the
      endogenous sleep-wake propensity rhythm and the 24-hour light-dark cycle will move out of
      synchrony with each other, and they may have difficulty falling asleep until well into the
      night. In addition to problems sleeping at the desired time, the subjects experience daytime
      sleepiness and daytime napping.

      This will be a multicenter, open-label study. The study has two phases: the screening phase
      and the evaluation phase. The screening phase is comprised of a screening visit where a
      patient's general health and initial eligibility will be evaluated. The evaluation phase is
      comprised of a baseline visit and a 52 week segment. Patients that meet all entry criteria
      for the study at baseline visit will enter the treatment segment where patients will be asked
      to take 20 mg tasimelteon daily approximately 60 minutes prior to their target bedtime for 52
      weeks in an open-label fashion. An optional sub-study extension phase is available to
      subjects who complete the first year of treatment and consists of continued open-label
      treatment for up to 3 years additional.
