  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised , placebo controlled, double blind , multicentre, Phase II/III study
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of Kamada AAT for inhalation in patients with Emphysema
      caused by Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency.

    <textblock>
      Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, also called Alpha-1-Proteinase Inhibitor (API) deficiency, is
      a genetic disorder characterized by the production of an abnormal amount of AAT protein and
      reduced circulating levels of this protein. Subjects with AAT deficiency are at increased
      risk for developing Emphysema. It is believed that this is the result of the chronic activity
      of elastase released by cells continually present in the lungs in low numbers.

      Three blinded interim analyses have shown that there are no safety issues and no concerns
      regarding tolerability.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Principal Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of emphysema confirmed by CT scan. If a report of past CT scan is not
             available at site documenting then a CT scan is to be performed at screening

          -  Male or female patients at least 18 years of age.

          -  Able and willing to sign an informed consent.

          -  Patient with record of congenital AAT deficiency of phenotype PiZZ (homozygote) or
             other rare phenotypes related to AAT deficiency and with AAT serum level ≤ 11
             micromole. For patients receiving IV AAT augmentation therapy the serum AAT level
             threshold does not apply.

          -  FEV1/SVC &lt;70% of predicted value post bronchodilator (SVC is slow VC) and FEV1 &lt; 80%
             of predicted value post-bronchodilator

          -  History of at least two moderate or severe exacerbations that required change in
             treatment (antibiotics, systemic steroids, hospitalization) in the last 18 months
             prior to date of screening , with at least one of these occurring within the last 12
             months prior to screening.

          -  Ability to comply with completion of electronic diary.

          -  Ability to self-administer inhaled AAT.

          -  No significant abnormalities in serum hematology, serum chemistry and serum
             inflammatory / immunogenic markers according to the Principal Investigator's judgment,
             taking into considerations the potential effects of the AAT deficiency.

          -  No significant abnormalities in urinalysis according to the Principal Investigator's
             judgment, taking into considerations the potential effects of the AAT deficiency.

          -  No significant abnormalities in ECG per investigator judgment.

          -  Negative for HBsAg and for antibodies to HCV, HIV-1.

          -  AAT deficient patients who are either naïve (not receiving IV augmentation therapy) or
             AAT deficient patients (receiving IV augmentation therapy), if they have been stable
             on regular therapy for at least 3 months prior to the screening visit and are willing
             to continue the same regime throughout this trial. Note that only sites in Germany can
             recruit patients who are currently being treated with IV AAT.Patients who stopped IV
             augmentation treatment 6 months prior to screening date and will not re-start this
             treatment for the course of the study will be considered Naïve.

          -  Non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients, whose screening pregnancy test is
             negative and who are using contraceptive methods deemed reliable by the investigator,
             or who are at least 2 years post-menopausal or surgically sterilized.

        Principal Exclusion Criteria:

          -  FEV1 &gt;= 80% or FEV1 &lt; 20% of predicted value post-bronchodilator.

          -  FEV1/SVC&gt;=70%

          -  History of lung transplant.

          -  Any lung surgery within the past two years.

          -  On any thoracic surgery waiting list.

          -  End of last exacerbation less than 6 weeks prior to screening/re-screening visit.

          -  Clinically significant intercurrent illnesses (except for respiratory or liver disease
             secondary to AAT deficiency), including: cardiac, hepatic, renal, endocrine,
             neurological, hematological, neoplastic, immunological, skeletal or other) that in the
             opinion of the investigator, could interfere with the safety, compliance or other
             aspects of this study. Patients with well-controlled, chronic diseases could possibly
             be included after consultation with the treating physician and the sponsor.

          -  Active smoking during the last 12 months from screening date.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Woman of child-bearing potential not taking adequate contraception deemed reliable by
             the investigator.

             impair the patient's ability to give informed consent or to comply with the
             requirements of the study protocol.

          -  Evidence of ongoing viral infection with HCV, HBV and/or HIV.

          -  Evidence of alcohol abuse or history of alcohol abuse or illegal and/or legally

          -  Inability to attend scheduled clinic visits and/or comply with the study protocol.

          -  Any other factor that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent the patient
             from complying with the requirements of the protocol.
