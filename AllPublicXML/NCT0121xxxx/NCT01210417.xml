      In the prehospital setting it would be helpful to assess primary changes in central blood
      volume or preload (venous return, stroke volume, diastolic ventricular volume) that occur
      during the stability phase following injury when regulatory mechanisms are still functioning.

      Obviously in this setting a non invasive bedside beat-to-beat index would be helpful.

      Pulse Transit Time (PTT) is the sum of Pre-Ejection Period (PEP), the time interval between
      the onset of ventricular depolarization and the ventricular ejection, and Vascular Transit
      Time (VTT), the time it takes for the pulse wave to travel from the aortic valve to the
      peripheral arteries (Obrist et al. 1979). PEP variations are known to correlate with
      reductions in central blood volume induced by head-up tilt (Chan et al., 2007b, 2008). The
      same authors also demonstrated that PTT variations follow closely PEP variations and
      therefore central blood volume variations (Chan et al., 2007b). Following central blood
      volume reductions induced by head-up tilting ventricular diastolic filling time increases
      involving an increase in PEP and PTT. Chan et al. (Chan et al., 2007b) concluded that PTT
      could have been used to assess early central hypovolemia and suggested that joint analysis of
      PTT and RR intervals could help in predicting the extent of blood volume loss. The
      investigators hypothesized that sympathetic drive associated with trauma would act on cardiac
      contractility through beta activity thus shortening PTT without reducing RR interval to the
      same extent in healthy hearts. We also hypothesized that progressive hypovolemia would lead
      to a rising of PTT (augmented diastolic filling time) and a RR interval shortening (relative
      tachycardia). In this study the investigators propose and index based on the beat-to-beat
      PTT/RR ratio to assess central hypovolemia in traumatic patients enrolled by our Helicopter
      Emergency Medical System (HEMS) in a prehospital setting.
