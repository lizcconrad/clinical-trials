      This study will compare the analgesic efficacy of a single-dose of a novel ibuprofen
      formulation to placebo and acetaminophen in the treatment of post-surgical dental pain
      following &quot;wisdom&quot; tooth (third molar) removal.

    <measure>Time-weighted Sum of Pain Relief Rating With Pain Intensity Difference From 0 to 6 Hours (SPRID 0-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID: time-weighted sum of pain relief rating combined with pain intensity difference (PRID) over 6 hours. Score range: -6(worst) to 42(best) for SPRID 0-6. PRID: sum of pain intensity difference (PID) and pain relief rating (PRR) at each time point. Score range for PRID: -1(worst) to 7(best). PID: baseline pain severity score minus pain severity score at a given time point (score range 0=none to 3=severe; baseline score range 2=moderate to 3=severe). Total score range for PID: -1 (worst) to 3 (best). PRR: assessed on 5-point pain relief rating scale (0=No relief to 4=Complete relief).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of Meaningful Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluated the time to meaningful relief by stopping a second stopwatch labeled 'meaningful relief' at the moment they first began to experience meaningful relief. Stopwatch was active up to 6 hours after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or rescue medication was administered.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Confirmed First Perceptible Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 6 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluated the time to first perceptible relief by stopping a stopwatch labeled 'first perceptible relief' at the moment they first began to experience any relief. Stopwatch was active up to 6 hours after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or rescue medication was administered. The first perceptible relief was considered confirmed if the participant also stopped the second stopwatch indicating meaningful relief.</description>

          <description>Participants evaluated the time to first perceptible relief by stopping a stopwatch labeled 'first perceptible relief' at the moment they first began to experience any relief. Stopwatch was active up to 6 hours after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or rescue medication was administered. The first perceptible relief was considered confirmed if the participant also stopped the second stopwatch indicating meaningful relief.</description>

        <description>PRID was sum of PID and PRR at each post-dosing time point. The overall possible score range, for PRID was -1 (worst) to 7 (best). PID was derived by subtracting the pain severity score at a given post-dosing time point (pain severity score range 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) from the baseline score (Baseline pain severity score range 2 [moderate] to 3 [severe]). Total possible score range for PID: -1 (worst) to 3 (best). PRR was assessed on 5-point categorical pain relief rating scale (0=No relief to 4=Complete relief).</description>
