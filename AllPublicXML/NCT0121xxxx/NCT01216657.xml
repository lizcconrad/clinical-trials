  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sunitinib is a novel small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with direct antitumor
      effects as well as antiangiogenetic activity. Preclinical and clinical data for Sunitinib and
      data about angiogenesis and growth regulation in melanoma suggest the activity of Sunitinib
      in melanoma. This study will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of Sunitinib
      as palliative treatment in chemo-refractory metastatic melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single agent 2-step phase 2 study with a one-year follow-up to evaluate the
      antitumor activity of Sunitinib administered in treatment cycles of 6 weeks duration (4 weeks
      treatment and 2 weeks rest) in patients with chemo-refractory melanoma. If the first step
      shows sufficient efficacy and tolerability the study will continue to step 2. Treatment will
      continue for 9 months or until disease progression or until intolerable adverse events occur.
      Subsequently the patients will be followed up for 1 year. Tumor assessment will be performed
      at baseline, at the end of cycle 1,2,3 and subsequently at the end of every uneven cycle
      (5,7,9,…).

      A total of 40 patients will be enrolled in this trial.
