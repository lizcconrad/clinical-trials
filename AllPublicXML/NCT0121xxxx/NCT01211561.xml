  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selenium's ability to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) has been suspected for nearly 30 years,
      but has never been directly studied in humans. The investigators will directly assess
      selenium's ability to prevent CRC by measuring alterations in aberrant crypt foci (ACF), an
      accepted surrogate marker for CRC.

      ACF's are very small (i.e., microscopic) collections of abnormally shaped cells that are a
      commonly used marker of CRC risk. Screening colonoscopy at UIC routinely uses methods that
      allow ACF counting to be done as a part of standard practice. ACF's are not fixed, like
      polyps or cancers, but can disappear as a person's risk for developing CRC decreases.

      The investigators propose giving patient's with 6 or more ACF's 200 mcg selenized yeast or
      placebo, and determining if there is a drug-dependant decrease in ACF number. The primary
      objective is to determine whether selenized yeast supplementation, compared to placebo,
      causes significant reduction of ACF number from baseline levels. The primary endpoint will be
      change in ACF number

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - All non-pregnant patients &gt;50 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The following will be specifically looked for, and result in patients not being
             eligible for study enrollment:

               -  Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or glucocorticosteroids within 60
                  days of study entry.

               -  History of chronic IBD or prior pelvic radiation (inflammation distorts crypt
                  pattern).

               -  Intake of any selenium supplements within 60 days of study entry, including
                  vitamins.

               -  Patients with increased bleeding risk from biopsy protocol (i.e. renal failure,
                  decompensated cirrhosis, blood dyscrasia).
