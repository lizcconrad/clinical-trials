      The aim of this study is to establish the efficacy and duration of effect of intra-articular
      (IA) infliximab vs intravenous infliximab vs current standard care (IA steroid injections) in
      seronegative oligoarthritis. All patients will have seronegative arthritis affecting less
      than 5 joints but including at least one knee. 10 patients will receive IA infliximab
      injections to the affected knee, 10 will receive IA steroid injections to the affected knee
      and 10 will receive a course of intravenous infliximab. Patients will not be aware of their
      group as this is a placebo-controlled study.

          -  Are considered eligible according to the tuberculosis (TB) eligibility assessment,
             screening, and early detection of reactivation rules defined in the protocol

          -  The screening laboratory test results must meet the following criteria

             treatment for latent TB (see Appendix 3) within 3 years prior to the first
             administration of study agent. It is the responsibility of the investigator to verify
             the adequacy of previous anti-tuberculous treatment and provide appropriate
             documentation.

          -  Have no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or physical
             examination.

          -  Have had no recent close contact with a person with active TB or, if there has been
             such contact, will be referred to a physician specializing in TB to undergo additional
             evaluation and, if warranted, receive appropriate treatment for latent TB prior to the
             first administration of study agent.

          -  Within 6 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent, either have a
             negative QuantiFeron test result (see Appendix 3) or have a newly identified positive
             QuantiFeron test result during screening in which active TB has been ruled out and for
             which appropriate treatment for latent TB has been initiated prior to the first
             administration of study agent.

          -  Have a chest radiograph (posterior-anterior view and if required, a lateral view),
             taken within 3 months prior to the first administration of study agent and read by a
             qualified radiologist, with no evidence of current, active TB or old, inactive TB.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Grade 4 osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence score) on plain radiograph of the knee

          -  Rheumatoid Arthritis (defined by the ACR criteria for the diagnosis of RA, 1987)

          -  Ankylosing Spondylitis (defined by the modified New York Criteria)

          -  Clinical diagnosis of gout or previous evidence of crystal arthropathy on synovial

             infusion (this includes father's who plan on fathering a child within 6 months after
             their last infusion).

          -  Have had any previous treatment with biological therapies.

          -  History of receiving human/murine recombinant products or a known allergy to murine
             products. A known allergy to murine product is definitely an exclusion criterion

          -  Previous intra-muscular, intra-articular or intra-venous steroids within 4 weeks prior
             to baseline.

          -  Previous oral steroids at a dose &gt;10mg/day prednisolone or equivalent for 4 weeks
             prior to baseline.

          -  Documentation of seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Documentation of a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C.

          -  Have a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the preceding 6 months that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risks associated with study
             participation or study agent administration, or may interfere with interpretation of
             results.

          -  Have a known history of serious infections (e.g., hepatitis, pneumonia, or
             pyelonephritis) in the previous 3 months.

          -  Have or have had an opportunistic infection (e.g., herpes zoster [shingles],
             cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, or mycobacteria
             other than TB) within 6 months prior to screening

          -  Have had a Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination within 12 months of screening.

          -  Are considered ineligible according to the TB eligibility assessment, screening, and
             early detection of reactivation rules described in Appendix 3.

          -  Have a chest radiograph within 3 months prior to the first administration of study
             agent that shows an abnormality suggestive of a malignancy or current active
             infection.

          -  Have a history of lymphoproliferative disease, including lymphoma or signs suggestive
             of possible lymphoproliferative disease such as lymphadenopathy of unusual size or
             location (e.g., nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck, infraclavicular,
             epitrochlear, or periaortic area), or splenomegaly.

          -  Currently have any known malignancy other than the condition being treated or have a
             history of malignancy, with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin that has been fully excised with no evidence of recurrence.

          -  Have current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, or cerebral
             disease.

          -  Are unable or unwilling to undergo multiple venipunctures because of poor tolerability
             or lack of easy access.

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening or within 5
             half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer.

          -  Presence of a transplanted solid organ (with the exception of a corneal transplant &gt; 3
             months prior to screening).

          -  Have a concomitant diagnosis or history of congestive heart failure.
