  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are exploring a unique weight-training program for men and women 65 years or older that
      emphasizes high speed training. We believe that the speed at which muscles move may be more
      important to the performance of functional tasks than how strong the muscles are. We are
      comparing velocity training with traditional strength training to determine which method has
      the greatest effects on muscle strength, speed of movement, functional performance and
      physical disability. We believe that higher speed training will improve these measures to a
      greater extent than simply training for increased muscle strength.

      Aging also results in loss of bone mass, which increases the risk for falls and fractures.
      Strength training also has been shown to maintain bone mass in the elderly, but no studies
      have examined high velocity resistance training and maintenance of bone mass. We believe it
      is important to examine this aspect of velocity training before recommendations can be made.

      The study compared 12 weeks of explosive high-speed power training with traditional
      slow-speed strength training. Outcome measures included muscle performance: leg press (LP)
      and knee extension (KE) one-repetition maximum (1RM) and LP peak power (PP), velocity at peak
      power (PPV) and force at peak power (PPF) from 40%-90% of the 1RM. Measures of function
      consisted of habitual and maximal gait velocity, the short physical performance battery
      (SPPB), forward tandem walk, and lower limb movement time (braking speed) on an automobile
      driving simulator.

      Participants reported to the laboratory for 2 weeks of baseline measurements. On visit 1,
      subjects were explained the study and completed an informed consent document. On visit 2 and
      3, muscle performance and functional measures were obtained. The following week, all muscle
      performance and functional measures were repeated to establish reliability. At the end of
      baseline testing, participants were randomized to treatment. Following the 12-week RT
      intervention, post-training muscle performance and functional measures were obtained.

      Resistance Training Protocol. Volunteers randomized into high-speed power training (HSPT) and
      slow-speed strength training (SSST) exercised 3 times per week for 12 weeks using
      computer-interfaced Keiser a420 pneumatic leg press and knee extension RT equipment (Fresno,
      CA). For HSPT, each training session consisted of 3 sets of 12-14 repetitions at 40%1RM.
      Participants performed an explosive movement at high speed during the concentric phase of
      each repetition, paused for one-second, and performed the eccentric portion of the
      contraction over 2 seconds. Volunteers randomized into SSST also exercised 3 times per week
      for 12 weeks with each training session consisting of 3 sets of 8-10 repetitions at 80%1RM.
      The participants performed each movement at a slow velocity (2 s for concentric phase of the
      repetition), paused for one second, and performed the eccentric portion of the contraction
      over 2 seconds. CON met three times a week for warm-up and stretching exercises, but
      performed no RT. HSPT and SSST participated in the same warm-up and stretching exercises as
      CON.

      Measures Maximal strength and power. Leg press and seated knee extension 1RM were obtained
      using Keiser pneumatic RT equipment fitted with a420 electronics. The seat of both the
      recumbent LP and KE apparatus was positioned to place the hip and knee joints between 90 and
      100 degrees of flexion. The 1RM was obtained by progressively increasing resistance until the
      subject was no longer able to push out one repetition successfully. The Borg Scale was used
      to assist in evaluating when 1RM (combined with perceived maximal effort) was reached. Peak
      muscle power was obtained at 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% of the 1RM approximately 30
      minutes after 1RM testing (8,9). Participants were instructed to exert &quot;as fast as possible&quot;
      at each relative percentage of the 1RM. Three attempts were made at each resistance and the
      greatest PP output obtained at each resistance was used in the analysis. The corresponding
      PPV and PPF were obtained for each external resistance from 40%-90% 1RM. The 1RM was measured
      bi-weekly in HSPT and SSST only and relative training intensity was adjusted accordingly to
      ensure adequate overload during training. Post-training muscle performance measures were
      obtained using loads relative to the initial baseline 1RM as well as the post-training 1RM.

The Keiser machines allow for the specific measurement of the contributions of force and velocity to the development of power, which will reveal whether the high-speed training protocol impacts speed-related measures of muscle performance.</description>
