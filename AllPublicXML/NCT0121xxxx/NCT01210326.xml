  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Azoospermia , as the name suggests , refers to the condition in which there are no sperm in
      the semen. This diagnosis can come as a rude shock, because most men with a zero sperm count
      have normal libido; normal sexual function; and their semen looks completely normal too. The
      diagnosis can only be made by examining the semen under a microscope in the laboratory.Men
      with non-obstructive azoospermia have a normal passageway, but abnormal testicular function,
      and their testes do not produce sperm normally. Some of these men may have small testes on
      clinical examination. The testicular failure may be partial, which means that only a few
      areas of the testes produce sperm, but this sperm production is not enough for it to be
      ejaculated. Other men may have complete testicular failure, which means there is no sperm
      production at all in the entire testes. The only way to differentiate between complete and
      partial testicular failure is by doing multiple testicular micro-biopsies to sample different
      areas of the testes and send them for pathological examination. This technique is called
      TESA, or testicular sperm aspiration ( also known as TESE, or testicular sperm extraction) or
      mTESE ( micro-testicular sperm extraction).

      This study was performed on 180 men with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), referring to
      royan infertility center, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Testis selection
      (right and left) and techniques (TESE or TESA) were performed randomly in patients. For every
      patient based on random order, TESA or TESE was performed as the following procedures. The
      testis was aspirated at three separated sites (upper, middle and lower pole), using 20 ml
      syringe and 18-gauge needle or testicular biopsy (TESE) was taken from the same 3 sites.
