  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) have three separate, complex heart
      surgeries before they turn three years of age. The first surgery typically happens in the
      first two weeks of life. After this operation, babies come back to the intensive care unit
      with their chests open. Babies who have heart surgery retain body water after surgery and
      this extra water slows recovery. Surgeons cannot close the chest until the baby gets rid of
      the extra water. As a result, babies have to stay in the intensive care unit and on a
      breathing machine for longer.

      Peritoneal dialysis, also known as PD, involves placing a small catheter into the belly
      cavity at the time of surgery. PD helps the kidney to get rid of extra body water. PD
      involves putting small amounts of special fluid into the belly through the catheter. This
      special fluid attracts water and is drained hourly. By allowing the belly cavity to drain,
      this helps both the heart and the lungs. This allows the chest to be closed and the breathing
      tube to be removed. The investigators are looking to see how quickly the babies, with and
      without PD, get rid of the extra water in turn shortening their stay in the intensive care
      unit and in the hospital. PD is not permanent, and only used for the first few days after the
      operation.
