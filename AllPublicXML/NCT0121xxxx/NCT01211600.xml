      To determine whether the rate of wound complications differs based on method of closure of
      skin incision (staples vs. suture) after cesarean delivery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite this large number of cesareans performed annually, there is a paucity of data to
      suggest which technique is superior for closure of the skin incision with regards to wound
      complications, including wound separation and infection. As the morbidity associated with a
      cesarean delivery is usually related to wound complications, especially infection, we feel
      that it is important to examine this outcome by comparing the current skin closure
      techniques: staples versus suture.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound complications</measure>
    <time_frame>4 - 8 weeks after intervention of staples or stitches.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is to evaluate the rate of wound complications for patients undergoing cesarean whose skin incision is closed with staples versus with suture.
Wound complications included infection, hematoma, seroma, and separation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cosmesis</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately postpartum and 4 - 8 weeks after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Whether physician and patient evaluation of cosmesis of the cesarean incision differed from each other and whether the evaluation differed based on closure method: staples vs sutures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately postpartum and 4 - 8 weeks after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Whether the patient's satisfaction with the incison differed based on closure method: staples vs sutures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain perception</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately postpartum and 4 - 8 weeks after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Whether the patient's perception of pain associated with the incison differed based on closure method: staples vs sutures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost</measure>
    <time_frame>4 - 8 weeks after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Cost analysis to compare the two closure techniques, including additional office visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Additional provider visits</measure>
    <time_frame>4 - 8 weeks post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>We will also note whether the patient was evaluated by a provider for a wound concern prior to the scheduled 4-6 week postpartum visit despite not being diagnosed with one of the aforementioned wound complications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wound complications - additional analyses</measure>
    <time_frame>4 - 8 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will also compare wound complications rates between staples and suture with respect to: length of time until staple removal (between days 4 and 10), type of suture used (Monocryl vs. Vicryl), timing of the Cesarean (prior to labor versus after the onset of labor), presence or absence of chorioamnionitis, total operative time for skin closure, gestational age at delivery, and placement of incision with regards to the pannus.</description>
