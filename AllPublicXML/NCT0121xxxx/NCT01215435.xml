    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this trial is to compare the glycaemic control
      when subjects initiate a biphasic insulin aspart 30 treatment followed by an intensified
      treatment if treatment target of HbA1c below 7% is not reached by OAD (oral anti-diabetic
      drugs) alone.
