  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that titration of asthma medication against mannitol challenge
      results will reduce the number of mild asthma exacerbations, in one year, when compared with
      titration against BTS guidelines. To test this hypothesis the investigators propose a primary
      care, parallel treatment, patient blinded study in which matched groups of asthmatic patients
      will be treated in accordance either with BTS guidelines or with our treatment algorithm
      dependent on mannitol challenge result.

      Purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment algorithm based on the
      measurement of airway hyperresponsiveness to mannitol challenge, a surrogate marker of airway
      inflammation, in the long term treatment of asthma in comparison to BTS guidelines.
