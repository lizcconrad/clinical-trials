      Since radiation dose escalation to a large volume of tumour inevitably will induce higher
      toxicity than is currently the case, efforts must be made to limit the volume of tissue
      irradiated. Moreover, the irradiation of larger tumour volumes leads to a lower achievable
      tumour dose when keeping the normal tissue doses constant. Central is thus the question
      whether it would be possible to limit the volume of tumour to be boosted by selectively
      escalating the radiation dose to specific disease sites which are theoretically more prone to
      relapse.

      Hypoxic imaging with PET scans seems attractive for this purpose as hypoxia is associated
      with resistance for radiotherapy and approximately 70 % of SCLC are severely hypoxic at
      diagnosis[2].

      We hypothesize that it might be possible to use a selective boost in these patients to tumor
      areas which are still hypoxic at the end of the standard chemo-radiotherapy to a dose of 45
      Gy in 30 fractions in 3 weeks.

      This way all SCLC (small cell lung cancer) patients can receive a safe, but higher dose of
      radiotherapy to the whole tumor volume, while the most resistant areas receive the highest
      possible dose.

      This is a hypothesis generating trial designed to deliver at least the current standard
      treatment to malignant tissue while defining patient selection criteria for future study.
