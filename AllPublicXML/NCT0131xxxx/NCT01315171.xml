  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin treatment often causes the blood glucose levels to fall too low (hypoglycemia).
      Hypoglycemia can be associated with confusion and disorientation as well as other symptoms
      such as palpitations, sweating and tremors. Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) can be used as a
      fuel in the brain during low blood sugar levels and therefore may prevent or reduce some of
      the confusion and disorientation seen during hypoglycemia. We would like to determine if a
      diet supplemented with medium chain triglycerides can improve cognitive function during
      hypoglycemia, diabetes control and also look at brain activity.

      30 subjects with well controlled type 1 diabetes will be recruited for the study. If you
      agree to participate you will be scheduled for, dietitian visits, and a study visit which
      will include insulin and glucose infusions, an MRI scan and brain function tests. All visits
      will be on the Hospital Research Unit (HRU) on the 10th floor of Yale New Haven Hospital. You
      will be randomized to either the MCT-supplemented diet or the standardized western diabetic
      diet. If you are on the MCT diet, the MCT oil will be given to you and you will be shown how
      to incorporate it into your diet. The MCT supplemented diet is for two weeks (with a two
      gradual transition onto the diet) and the standardized western diet is for two weeks (with a
      1 week transition onto the diet). At the end of the study you will be admitted to the
      Hospital Research Unit for the insulin 'clamp' and MRI scan. A 'clamp' is a procedure which
      involves insulin and glucose infusions. During a 'clamp' study, the insulin infusion is held
      constant, while the glucose infusion is adjusted every 5 minutes as needed to maintain the
      desired blood glucose levels. Compensation for the study is $750.
