    <textblock>
      Most patients with thyroid tumors are effectively treated surgically by practitioners
      experienced in the techniques of thyroidectomy. Many patients, especially women, undergoing
      thyroid surgery are concerned about the postoperative cosmetic appearance of the neck.
      Robotic thyroidectomy which can hide the operative scar was associated with a higher degree
      of patient cosmetic satisfaction.

      Most patients with thyroid tumors are effectively treated surgically by practitioners
      experienced in the techniques of thyroidectomy. Many patients, especially women, undergoing
      thyroid surgery are concerned about the postoperative cosmetic appearance of the neck.
      Robotic thyroidectomy which can hide the operative scar was associated with a higher degree
      of patient cosmetic satisfaction. In this study, we designed a prospective study comparing
      the cosmetic satisfaction and the postoperative body image change which associated with
      patient self-esteem between robotic thyroidectomy and conventional open thyroidectomy group.

        120 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma who underwent thyroidectomy at Yonsei
        University Health System were enrolled. 60patients were conventional open thyroidectomy
        group and 60 patients were robotic thyroidectomy group. All of these patients was over 20
