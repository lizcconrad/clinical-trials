    <textblock>
      Daptomycin was approved since 2005 in Taiwan and have been studied and published in west
      countries. After review the published papers, the few data were described in the Asian
      countries or Taiwan. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      daptomycin for the treatment of Gram-positive infections under actual conditions of use, and
      to understand other information concerned with daptomycin prescription. This study represents
      an opportunity for acquiring real world data on daptomycin usage, and may provide physicians
      in Taiwan with the information of characteristic of the patients receiving daptomycin and to
      evaluate outcomes. It also provides a means to identify safety signals that emerge with
      clinical usage.

      This is a retrospective, non-comparative study, which will be performed after obtaining
      permission from the institutional review board. Patients with serious gram-positive
      infections who had received daptomycin from January 2009 and completed daptomycin therapy by
      the end of December 2010 will be screened, and patients who received â‰¥ 3 days of daptomycin
      will be identified eligible to be included. Eligible patients' medical records will be
      reviewed.

      As this is a retrospective chart review, it is expected that informed consent will not be
      necessary. For patients' confidentiality concern, patients' name or chart number will not to
      be record in any part of Data Collection Form (APPENDIX 1). A patient identification number
      will be assigned to each patient included in this surveillance. A study coordinator at site
      will be identified, and hospital specific process will be utilized to identify patients.
      Information to be collected was shown on Data Collection Form (Appendix 1). After completing
      patient data collection, the efficacy and safety will be evaluated for the included cases.
