    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test an investigational product called Muscadine Plus in the
      treatment of men who have received initial therapy (surgery and or radiation, cryotherapy or
      brachytherapy) for prostate cancer and are experiencing a rise in their prostate-specific
      antigens (PSA) level.

      In phase I the investigators are evaluating the safety of the product and checking blood
      levels of the active components. In phase II the investigators are evaluating the effect of
      MPX on PSA doubling time

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Undergone definitive treatment (surgery, surgery with radiation therapy, cryotherapy,
             radiation therapy or brachytherapy) for the primary prostate tumor.

          -  Rising PSA on a minimum of 3 time points (including screening psa) within the 12
             months prior to study initiation.

          -  &gt; 18 years of age.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Testosterone level of â‰¥1.5 ng/mL at screening.

          -  Adequate kidney, liver and bone marrow function

          -  Agrees to abstain from other commercially available MP products while participating in
             this study.

          -  Subject's use of other dietary/herbal supplements (e.g. saw palmetto, selenium, etc)
             has been stable for at least 2 months prior to screening and the subject agrees not to
             stop or change the dose(s) while participating in the study.

          -  Signed a written informed consent document and agrees to comply with requirements of
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known radiographic evidence of metastatic disease, except for presence of positive
             lymph nodes from the surgical pathology. Pelvic/intraperitoneal lymph nodes less than
             2.0 cm maybe considered nonspecific and the patient would be eligible

          -  Receipt of any therapies that modulate testosterone levels (e.g., androgen
             ablative/anti-androgen therapy, 5 alpha reductase inhibitors) for a minimum of 6
             months prior to study

          -  Prior or concomitant treatment with experimental drugs, high dose steroids, or any
             other cancer treatment within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the study product

          -  Consumption of Muscadine Plus over the past 2 months

          -  Known allergy to muscadine grapes or ellagic acid

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Negative PSA doubling time (1 time point may be excluded per 3e inclusion criteria)
