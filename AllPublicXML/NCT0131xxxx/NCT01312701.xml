  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumors have a systemic immune modifying effect. They affect the immune system similarly to
      states of chronic inflammation and these effects can:

        -  be monitored through analysis of nk t and myeloid cells mainly through studies of the
           zeta chain but also through other means

        -  may be decreased following effective anticancer therapy - may even be used to study the
           effectiveness of anticancer therapy

        -  are important to monitor if the investigators plan on formulation of systemic immune
           therapy Thus immumonitoring of systemic blood cells may turn out to be an important
           prognostic and predictive factor in many cancer types

      CD247 Known also as the zeta chain is important for relaying T-cell induced signal
      transduction.

      Interestingly studies by Baniash and others have demonstrated that this chain is down
      regulated in states of chronic inflammation and cancer in peripheral blood T cells and also
      in NK cells However there has not been a prospective study of this marker in cancer and
      control patients such a study will reveal not only the levels of CD247 in immune cells of
      cancer patients compared to controls but may reveal the effect of anticancer therapies on
      CD247 in cancer patients such a study may contribute significantly to our ability to monitor
      systemic immune system characteristics in cancer patients and help in any further studies of
      immunomodulation such as vaccination schemes in such patients

      The investigators will collect peripheral blood for facts analysis of intracellular levels of
      proteins.

      Some of these cells may be frozen for longer periods of time for comparison with other new
      samples.
