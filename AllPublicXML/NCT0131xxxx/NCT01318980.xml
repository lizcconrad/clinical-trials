      GSK2190915 is a high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that
      attenuates the production of leukotrienes through the blockage of the first step in the
      leukotriene pathway, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activation. GSK2190915 inhibits the production of
      leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs).

      This is an open label, 4-way, 4-treatment period, non-randomised, crossover study with an
      interim analysis. The GSK2190915 formulations used in this study will be: a 100mg and 200mg
      milled tablet, a 100mg enteric-coated tablet, and a [14C] radiolabelled GSK2190915
      intravenous solution.

      This study aims to determine the pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability of GSK2190915
      to enable optimisation of suitable formulations to be used in clinical development Fourteen
      subjects will be dosed to ensure data in 10 at the end of the clinical study. Seven of the
      subjects will receive an IV microtracer in addition to the other treatments.

      GSK2190915 is a high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor that
      attenuates the production of leukotrienes through the blockage of the first step in the
      leukotriene pathway, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) activation. Leukotrienes are potent inflammatory
      molecules produced mainly by mast cells, eosinophils, monocytes/macrophage and neutrophils in
      response to allergic or inflammatory stimuli. GSK2190915 inhibits the production of
      leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs).

      This is an open label, 4-way, 4 treatment period, non-randomised, single-dose crossover study
      with an interim analysis following the third treatment period. The GSK2190915 formulations
      used are: milled 100mg and 200mg tablets, a 100mg enteric-coated tablet, and a [14C]
      radiolabelled GSK2190915 intravenous solution.

      There will be 4 periods. Period 1 includes two cohorts (of 7 subjects each), both of which
      will be administered the 100mg GSK2190915 milled tablet orally; however, the second cohort
      will in addition be dosed with an intravenous radiolabelled infusion of the drug. In the
      second period, a 100mg dose of milled GSK2190915 tablet (a ground half of a 200mg tablet) is
      administered directly to the proximal small bowel using an Enterion capsule. The same dose is
      repeated in the third period, but is administered directly to the distal small bowel. An
      interim analysis will then follow. The decision to proceed will be made following a review of
      the pharmacokinetic data from the first three treatments. In the fourth and final period, the
      treatment will be a 100mg enteric-coated tablet of GSK2190915 administered orally. There will
      be a minimum washout of 7 days in between each period.

      This study aims to determine the pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability of GSK2190915
      to enable optimisation of suitable formulations to be used in clinical development. Periods 1
      to 3 will characterise the absolute bioavailability of GSK2190915 using IV tracer and oral
      formulation, in addition to defining the regional absorption characteristics of the drug when
      released in the proximal and distal parts of the gastro-intestinal tract. The fourth period
      will investigate the oral bioavailability of an enteric coated formulation of GSK2190915.

      Fourteen subjects will be dosed to ensure data in 10 at the end of the clinical study. Seven
      of the subjects (in cohort 2, Period 1) will receive an IV microtracer in addition to the
      other treatments.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy females as determined by an experienced study physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, neurological examination,
             laboratory tests and electrocardiogram (ECG). A subject with a clinical abnormality or
             laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may
             be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the
             finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             the study procedures;

          -  Females must be either:

          -  Of non-childbearing potential, defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
             tubal ligation or hysterectomy or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory]. [Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in Section
             9.4 of the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise,
             they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to
             study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.]

          -  Of child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
             in Section 9.4 of the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the
             product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize
             the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
             until 3 months after the last dose.

          -  Aged 18-65 years;

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-35 kilogram per sqare metre (km/m2);

          -  Subjects must demonstrate their ability to swallow an empty size 000 capsule;

          -  Must be willing and able to participate in the whole study and must provide written
             informed consent;

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase
             and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xUpper Limit of Normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%);

          -  QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec

          -  Subjects of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of the contraception methods
             listed in Section 9.4 from the time of the first dose of study medication until 3
             months following the last dose.

          -  Exclusion Criteria:

             they have a negative drugs of abuse test and have been abstinent for at least 12
             months;)

          -  Positive drugs of abuse test result;
