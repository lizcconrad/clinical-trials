  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells derived from adipose tissue are pluripotent to differentiate into
      myocytes, adipocytes or others. They have an immunosuppressive activity. Complex perianal
      fistula is difficult to cure and easy to relapse. Autologous adipose stem cells have shown
      efficacy and safety on Crohn's fistula in phase 1 study. Based on these results, the
      investigators would apply autologous adipose stem cells on complex perianal fistula to
      evaluate their efficacy and safety.
