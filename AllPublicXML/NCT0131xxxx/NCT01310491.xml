      The purpose of this trial is to determine if by structured telephone based health coaching
      programme supported by remote monitoring system among type 2 diabetes, coronary artery
      disease and heart failure patients the investigators are able to improve their quality of
      life as measured by the SF-36 questionnaire and reduce a value of HbA1c under 6,5 % among
      those type 2 diabetes patients who had elevated value of HbA1c when recruited.

      RENEWING HEALTH is a project covering 9 different European States. It aims at evaluation of
      innovative telemedicine services using a patient-centred approach and a common rigorous
      assessment methodology. In 9 European regions in the implementation of health-related
      information and communication technologies service solutions are already operational at local
      level for the remote monitoring and the treatment of chronic patients suffering from
      diabetes,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiovascular diseases. The services are
      designed to give patients a central role in the management of their own diseases, fine-tuning
      the choice and dosage of medications, promoting compliance to treatment, and helping health
      care professionals to detect early signs of worsening in the monitored pathologies. Every
      area will designed its own real-life trial with certain common elements.
