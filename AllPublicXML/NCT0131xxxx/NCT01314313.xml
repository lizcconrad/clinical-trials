      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards SAPIEN
      XT and the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve and delivery systems which are intended
      for use in patients with symptomatic, calcific, severe aortic stenosis.

    <textblock>
      A prospective multi-center trial of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for severe
      aortic stenosis. Patient cohorts will include the following groups based on operative risk
      for surgical aortic valve replacement: inoperable, high surgical risk (STS ≥ 8%), and
      intermediate risk (STS = 4-8%).

      The Edwards SAPIEN XT transcatheter heart valve (THV) system will be studied in patients
      deemed inoperable or intermediate risk. A subset of inoperable patients will be randomized to
      receive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with either the SAPIEN XT THV or the
      SAPIEN THV. The SAPIEN XT will be studied in intermediate risk patients randomized to receive
      TAVR with the SAPIEN XT or surgical AVR.

      The Edwards SAPIEN 3 THV will be studied in a non-randomized fashion in patients from all
      three risk groups.

      Data will be collected from all patients for up to five years following the valve replacement
      procedure.
