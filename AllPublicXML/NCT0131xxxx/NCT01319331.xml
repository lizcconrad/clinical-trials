    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus based on ADA Criteria for fewer than 5 years but
             more than 100 days

          -  6-45 years of age, inclusive. To assess safety, we will initially enroll 8 patients
             over the age of 16. Following the last infusion of the 8th patient, we will assess
             adverse events. As long as there are no stopping criteria met for these 8 patients we
             will decrease the age criteria down to 6 years old.

          -  C-peptide increase during screening mixed meal tolerance test with a minimal
             stimulated value of ≥ 0.2 pmol/mL.

          -  Positive for antibodies to insulin (if insulin autoantibody positive only,
             determination must be within two weeks of insulin initiation), GAD-65, IA-2 or ZnT8

          -  Agree to intensive management of diabetes with an HgbA1c goal of &lt; 7.0%

          -  If female, (a) surgically sterile or (b) postmenopausal or (c) if of reproductive
             potential, willing to use medically acceptable birth control (e.g. female hormonal
             contraception, barrier methods or sterilization. ) until 3 months after completion of
             any treatment period

          -  If male and of reproductive potential, willing to use medically acceptable birth
             control until 3 months after completion of any treatment period, unless the female
             partner is postmenopausal or surgically sterile

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  AST &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Hematology:WBC &gt; 3000 x 109/L; platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L; hemoglobin &gt; 10.0 g/dL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements of the study protocol

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m2

          -  Unstable blood sugar control defined as one or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia
             (defined as hypoglycemia that required the assistance of another person) within the
             last 30 days

          -  Previous immunotherapy for T1D

          -  Administration of an experimental agent for T1D at any time or use of an experimental
             device for T1D within 30 days of screening, unless approved by the study PI

          -  History of any organ transplant, including islet cell transplant

          -  Active autoimmune or immune deficiency disorder (e.g. sarcoidosis, rheumatoid
             arthritis)

          -  Serum bilirubin &gt; ULN, except those subjects whose abnormal values were attributed to
             any stable, benign condition (such as Gilbert's Syndrome) may be included

          -  TSH outside the normal range at screening, except those subjects on stable doses of
             thyroid hormone replacement therapy may be included

          -  Known HIV positivity, active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C infection

          -  Anticipated pregnancy during active dosing or within 3 months after completion of
             active dosing phase

          -  History of a malignant neoplasm within the previous 5 years (except in situ cervical
             cancer and curable non-melanoma skin malignancy)

          -  Any social condition or medical condition that would, in the opinion of the
             investigator, prevent complete participation in the study or that would pose a
             significant hazard to the subjects' participation

          -  History of active substance abuse within 12 months of screening

          -  A psychiatric or medical disorder that would prevent giving informed consent

          -  Individuals with a history of IgA deficiency

          -  Individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to AAT
