    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to learn the value of the SPY ELITEÂ® intra-operative angiography in
      reducing post-operative complications associated with low breast skin blood flow after breast
      reconstruction using implants.

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women, and over 180,000 women will be
      diagnosed with this disease in 2008. Last year, over 57,000 breast reconstructive procedures
      were performed, of which prosthetic reconstruction constituted 76%. Immediate reconstruction
      has been favored over delayed procedures for psychological and technical reasons. However,
      immediate breast reconstruction is associated with significantly higher complication rates
      (50-52%) than delayed procedures (32-36%), especially when a prosthetic technique is used.
      For prosthetic reconstructions, the most significant early complications include necrosis of
      the mastectomy skin flaps, infection, delayed wound healing and exposure of the implant. The
      published incidence of these complications ranges between 10% and 40% and is predominantly
      associated with malperfusion of mastectomy skin flaps. Thus, evaluation of skin perfusion and
      elimination of poorly vascularized areas could help reduce the high rate of complications in
      immediate breast reconstruction.
