      The purpose of the Collaborative Care for Older Adults with Back Pain (COCOA) Clinical Trial
      is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and feasibility of a collaborative care model
      (medical and chiropractic care) through a pragmatic, prospective pilot trial conducted with
      120 older adults over the age of 65 with low back pain of at least 1 month duration.

    <textblock>
      As America ages, cost‐effective care for chronic diseases, such as low back pain, becomes
      more important. Although estimates vary, 70‐85% of Americans will suffer from back pain at
      some point in their lives. Back pain is well established as one of the most common reasons
      for seeking care from a medical doctor. The American public also turns to alternative
      medicine providers, such as doctors of chiropractic, for back pain care. However, few
      clinical examples and little scientific evidence exist of care coordination between these two
      provider groups in general, and none that specifically target older adults above the age of
      65. The purpose of the Collaborative Care for Older Adults with Back Pain (COCOA) Clinical
      Trial is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and feasibility of a collaborative care model
      (medical and chiropractic care) through a pragmatic, prospective pilot trial conducted with
      120 older adults over the age of 65 with low back pain of at least 1 month duration.
      Participants will be randomized to 3-parallel treatment arms: a) conventional medical care
      (MED CARE), b) unlinked conventional medical and chiropractic care (DUAL CARE), and c) a
      co-management model including conventional medical and chiropractic care (SHARED CARE).
      Participants in all three groups will receive up to 12 weeks of usual back pain treatment
      from medical doctors or doctors of osteopathy (MD/DO) at Genesis Family Medical Center.
      Participants in two treatment groups additionally will receive up to 12 weeks of usual
      chiropractic care for back pain from doctors of chiropractic at the Palmer Research Clinic.
      Outcomes including pain, disability and secondary outcomes will be measured at 1, 2, and 3
      months (primary endpoint) with follow-up assessments completed by telephone at 6, 9, and 12
      months.

    <description>Participants allocated to all three treatment groups receive medical care over a 12‐week period. Medical treatments are standard therapies for back pain. Medical and osteopathic physicians follow clinical practice guideline recommendations for back pain: focused history and physical exam; limited diagnostic imaging; self‐management education; maintaining physical activity as tolerated and local heat/cold application; pharmacotherapy with analgesics and anti‐inflammatory agents. Participants not responding to treatment may receive additional therapies such as physical therapy or specialist referral.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to Dual Care receive medical care as described plus chiropractic care over a 12‐week period. Chiropractic care includes standard therapies for back pain. A doctor of chiropractic determines the therapeutic approach based upon a participant's clinical presentation. Treatments may include spinal or extremity joint manipulation, such as: high velocity‐low amplitude or low velocity‐variable amplitude maneuvers; mechanical device assisted adjustments; or passive mobilization. Recommendations for exercise, lifestyle modifications, or other therapies may be provided.</description>
