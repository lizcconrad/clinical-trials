    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II randomized study for subjects with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or
      primary peritoneal cancer to determine the feasibility and safety as well as immunogenicity
      of OC-L, an autologous vaccine comprised of autologous Oxidized tumor Cell Lysate (OC-L)
      administered by intradermal/subcutaneous injection in combination with Ampligen
      (poly-l:poly-C12U), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. Study duration is 24 months.

      This is a Phase I/II randomized study for subjects with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or
      primary peritoneal cancer to determine the feasibility and safety as well as immunogenicity
      of OC-L, an autologous vaccine comprised of autologous Oxidized tumor Cell Lysate (OC-L)
      administered by intradermal/subcutaneous injection in combination with Ampligen
      (poly-l:poly-C12U), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. Study duration is 24 months. This study
      has two Phases eligible subjects enrolled in Phase 1 will receive the OC-L admixed with
      Montanide ISA 51 with intravenous Ampligen. Subjects enrolled in Phase II will be randomized
      to two ARMS. This randomized design will allow for the unbiased evaluation and comparison of
      immune response among the 2 treatment arms. patients will be randomized (10 per treatment
      arm) in blocks of size 4 or 6, such that treatment assignment will be balanced after each
      group of 4 or 6 patients has been randomized. ARM A 10 patients will receive OC-L. Arm b 10
      patients will receive OC-L with Ampligen. Following each vaccination, subjects in Phase I and
      Arm B will be given intravenous Ampligen 3 times starting 2-3 days after each vaccine
      administration. All subjects will receive vaccine on Day 0, 14, 28, 42 and 56. Subjects will
      receive Prevnar on day 0 and day 14. Subjects will be treated till exhaustion of OC-L or
      disease progression whichever occurs first subjects will be contacted every 6 months for up
      to 5 years and then annually for survival. The OC-L study product is manufactured and quality
      tested at Cell and Vaccine Production Facility and then released to IDS, where it will be
      admixed with Montanide ISA 51 VG on day of vaccination.

    <description>Safety will be established by grading the observed toxicities using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC Version 4.0).

    <description>Immune response will be evaluated by IFN-g ELISPOT analysis of tumor-reactive T cells, and in HLA-A2+ subjects, by tetramer analysis of Her-2 specific T cells in peripheral blood. Response is defined by a &gt; 3 fold increase relative to pre-vaccination.</description>
