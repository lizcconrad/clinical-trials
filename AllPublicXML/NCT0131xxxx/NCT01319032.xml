  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a study conducted in our laboratory few years ago, we genotyped 22 genes in 2 athletic
      groups (endurance and sprinters) and in age and gender matched nonathletic controls. Few of
      these genes were found to be associated with athletic performance and area of specificity.
      Since then a few more genes have been found that are related to athletic performance, and we
      intend to study various genes related to 3 genetic cascade: genes associated with body fluid
      balance and homeostasis, genes associated with muscle strength, and genes associated with
      bioenergy. The results of this study compared with athletic level will provide deeper insight
      into the genetic mechanisms involved in performance.
