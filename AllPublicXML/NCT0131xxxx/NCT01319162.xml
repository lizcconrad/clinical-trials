  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 40% and 85% of women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are overweight or obese
      and obesity is closely linked to the development of PCOS. Although it is well established
      that obesity increases the severity of the clinical features of PCOS, data regarding the
      prevalence of PCOS in obese women and the change in body weight in women with PCOS over time
      are scares. In a prevalence study it was investigated whether obesity increases the risk of
      PCOS in the general population and they demonstrated that the prevalence rate of PCOS in
      underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese women were 8.2, 9.8, 9.9, and 9.0%,
      respectively, similar to that observed in the general population. These results suggest that
      the risk of PCOS is only minimally increased with obesity. On the other hand, in a Spanish
      prevalence study among overweight and obese subjects, they demonstrated a 28.3% prevalence of
      PCOS, which is markedly higher compared with the 5.5% prevalence of PCOS in lean women in
      Spain.

      First the investigators aim to estimate the prevalence/probability of PCOS among obese,
      premenopausal women (between 18 and 50 years) with no symptoms of classic menopausal symptoms
      in Sweden. Secondly, to elucidate whether women diagnosed with PCOS respond to standard
      weight reduction regime to the same extent as women without PCOS.

    <description>The dietary intervention begins with a 12-weeks VLCD/LCD period. The diet comprise of 3 to 5 portions liquid diet with a daily energy intake of 450-800 kcal. In addition, patients will be encouraged to drink 1,5-2L daily of non-caloric beverages (&lt;6 kcal/100 ml). All patients will have scheduled nurse visits at week 0 (baseline), 2, 5, 8, and 12. At these visits general well-being and body weight will be monitored. The patient will also be given support and counselling to enhance compliance to the VLCD/LCD diet.</description>

        All obese women between 18 and 50 years referred to a weight reduction treatment program at
        the Sahlgrenska Obesity Center at Sahlgrenska University hospital will, after oral and
        written informed consent, be screened for the diagnosis of PCOS according to NIH or
        Rotterdam diagnostic criteria depending on the availability of ultrasonography.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PCOS diagnostic criteria should be the presence of both clinical and/or biochemical
        hyperandrogenism and/or oligo-/amenorrhea and/or polycystic ovaries (PCO).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Exclusion of other endocrine disorders such as hyperprolactinemia (s-prolactin &lt;
             27µg/L), nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (17-hydroxyprogesterone &lt; 3nmol/L),
             and androgen secreting tumors.

          2. Pregnancy or breastfeeding the last 6 months.

          3. Any sign of climacteric symptoms.

          4. Language barrier or disabled person with reduced ability to understand information.

          5. Oral contraceptives and insulin sensitizing agents is commonly used among women with
             PCOS since it may interfere with hormone profile. As the prevalence of PCOS can be
             assumed to be increased among women using oral contraceptives and insulin sensitizing
             agents, they are included but analyzed separately.
