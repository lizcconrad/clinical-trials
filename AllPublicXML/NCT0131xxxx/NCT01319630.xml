  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major microvascular blood flow alterations have been documented in patients with severe
      sepsis. It was also demonstrated that the microcirculation improved in survivors of septic
      shock but failed to do so in patients dying from acute circulatory failure or with multiple
      organ failure after shock resolution. Early, effective fluid resuscitation is a key component
      in the management of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock with the goal of improving
      tissue perfusion. The best fluid in this early resuscitation phase has been and still is
      under debate. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Three different
      Fluids(Albumin 5%, Normal Saline, HES 130 kD) on microcirculation in severe sepsis/septic
      shock patients using Sidestream Dark Field (SDF) Microscopy and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy
      (NIRS) analysis.

    <description>SDF will be applied to the sublingual microvascular network with a 5X objective providing a 167X magnification.
After the removal of saliva and other secretions using gauze, the device will be gently applied (without any pressure) on the lateral side of the tongue, in an area approximately 1.5-4 cm from the tip of the tongue. Five sequences of 20 secs each from different adjacent areas will be recorded using a computer and a video card and stored under a random number for later analysis. This will be done at baseline and then 1 hour after Fluid bolus.</description>

    <description>Tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) will be measured by a tissue spectrometer, a noninvasive tool, which uses reflectance mode probes to measure scattering light reflected at some distance from where the light is transmitted into the tissue. The NIRS probe will be placed on the skin of the thenar eminence and a sphygmomanometer cuff will be wrapped around the arm over the brachial artery. After a 3-min period to stabilize the NIRS signal, arterial inflow will be stopped (VOT) by inflating the cuff to 50 mmHg above the systolic arterial pressure. After 3 min of ischemia, cuff pressure will be released, and StO2 recorded continuously for another 3 min period (reperfusion period=Reactive Hyperemia).This will be done at baseline and then 1 hour after fluid bolus.</description>
