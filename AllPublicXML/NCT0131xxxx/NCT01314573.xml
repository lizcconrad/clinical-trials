  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of different exercise intensity training
      programs upon blood vessel function and circulating blood cells involved in blood vessel
      repair in young women. The long term effects of exercise may be beneficial to cardiovascular
      health and it is important to understand the training methods that are the most beneficial.
      In particular we aim to determine if brief maximal exercise improves the function and
      stiffness of blood vessels and enhance blood vessel repair. Two methods of exercising are
      being compared, exercise bouts involving intermittent exercise and exercise completed all at
      once, but at a very high intensity.
