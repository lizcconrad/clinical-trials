  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this trial is to study the efficacy of Namisol® after a single dose of
      Δ9-THC in the treatment of pain resulting from chronic pancreatitis. Objective measures of
      pain processing, e.g. encephalography (EEG) and quantitative sensory testing (QST), are
      included to provide insight in underlying nociceptive processing.

      The most important symptom in chronic pancreatitis (CP) is abdominal pain. Pancreatic pain is
      often recurrent, intense and long-lasting, and is extremely difficult to treat. Medical
      analgesic therapy is considered as first choice in pain management of CP, resulting in
      regularly prescription of opioids. The adverse consequences of prolonged opioid use,
      including addiction, tolerance and opioid induced hyperalgesia, call for an alternative
      medical treatment. Cannabis has been used to treat pain for many centuries.
      Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive substance of the cannabis plant, has
      been shown in previous studies to be a promising analgesic. The development of Namisol®, a
      tablet containing purified Δ9-THC showing an improved and reliable pharmacokinetic profile,
      provides the opportunity to test the analgesic potential of Δ9-THC in favourable conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has chronic pancreatitis, diagnosed using the Marseille and Cambridge
             Classification System (addendum II).37

          -  Patient suffers from chronic abdominal pain typical for pancreatitis, meet the
             criteria for chronic pain according ISAP (intermittent or persistent pain on a daily
             basis in at least 3 months)38, and consider their pain must as severe enough for
             medical treatment (average NRS ≥ 3).

          -  Patient in the opioid group takes stable doses of opioids, e.g. morphine or tramadol,
             for the past 2 months on the day of screening. Stable dose intake is defined as a
             daily equivalent sum of opioid intake according medical prescription within a small
             deviation range as judged by the (principal) investigator.

          -  Patient in the non-opioid group does not take any opioids for the past 2 months on the
             day of screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient used any cannabinoid (by smoking cannabis or oral intake) for at least one
             year on the day of screening.

          -  Patient does not feel a pinprick test in the lower extremities, due to affected
             sensory input (e.g. neuropathy as a result of diabetes mellitus).

          -  Patient has a body mass index (BMI) below 18 or above 31.2 kg/m2.

          -  Patient suffers from serious painful conditions other than chronic pancreatitis or had
             any major pre-existing chronic pain syndrome.

          -  Patient has a (history of) a significant medical disorder that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may interfere with the study or may pose a risk for the patient.

          -  Patient uses any kind of concomitant medication that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may interfere with the study or may pose a risk for the patient (e.g.
             HIV antivirals).

          -  Patient takes amitriptyline on a daily basis.

          -  Patient takes more than 20 mg benzodiazepines 6 hours prior or following intake of
             study medication (11 hour am) according prescription.
