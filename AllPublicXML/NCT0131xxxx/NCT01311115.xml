    <textblock>
      This study proposes a novel behavioral intervention to help smokers in Thailand to achieve
      their goals of quitting. Smoking treatment programs are rare throughout most of Asia and
      unlikely to meet the impending demand for quitting that tobacco control regulations is
      stimulating. New approaches are needed.

      The present study is a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a novel,
      scalable approach to smoking cessation that is targeted toward rural Southeast Asian
      communities. Thailand is used as a test case to explore if pairs of smokers quit successfully
      after making financially-backed commitments and receiving cash incentives to quit. The
      control group receives education and counseling about quitting. In addition to education and
      counseling about quitting, the intervention includes two key components:

        1. Each participant is encouraged to deposit his &quot;cigarette money&quot; on a weekly basis, to be
           returned only if the smoker quits successfully within three months. Such commitment
           contracts, based on theory from behavioral economics, are designed to help a person to
           maintain self-control and motivation in the face of temptation.

        2. Each participant is paired with another study participant. If both quit, each receives a
           cash bonus. The joint incentives are designed to lead partners to support each other
           throughout the quit attempt.

      Thus, group commitment contracts marshal a robust blend of elements: financial commitment,
      social support, peer pressure, and monetary rewards. A larger, follow-up evaluation will
      clarify the relative importance of each of these elements.

    <description>In addition to education and counseling, the intervention includes the following components:
Each participant is encouraged to deposit his &quot;cigarette money&quot; on a weekly basis, to be returned only if the smoker quits successfully within three months.
The project gives a series of two matching contributions of 150 baht each to participants who meet certain deposit requirements.
Each participant is paired with another study participant. If both quit, each receives a cash bonus of 1,200 baht. At enrollment, pairs receive brief counseling on ways to support each other during the quit attempt.</description>

    <description>Each participant is required to deposit at least 50 baht at enrollment. A deposit collector visits each participant on a weekly basis and collects additional deposits on a voluntary basis. All deposits are returned only if the smoker quits successfully within three months.
The project gives a matching contribution of 150 baht for the initial deposit of at least 50 baht. All participants in the treatment group are further randomized to a one-month group and a three-month group. The one-month group receives an additional 150 baht of project funds if they deposit 100 baht of their money within one month of enrollment. The three-month group receives 150 baht for depositing 100 baht within three months of enrollment.
Each participant is paired with another study participant. If both quit, each receives a cash bonus of 1,200 baht. At enrollment, pairs receive brief counseling on ways to support each other during the quit attempt.</description>
