    <textblock>
      The study will determine if bioequivalence can be claimed between the proposed
      commericializable formulation and the current clinical formulation. Specifically, if the 90%
      confidence intervals of the ratio for Area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration
      (CMax) are within the 80%-125% guidance limits.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects including males between the ages of 18 and 55 years and/or females of
             non childbearing potential between the ages of 18 and 55 years. (Healthy is defined as
             no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full
             physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG
             or clinical laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject.

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant dermatologic, hematological, renal,
             endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric,
             neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated,
             asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine- containing products (or a positive urine drug cotinine
             test).

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study medication.

          -  12 lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at Screening. If
             QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females and females of childbearing potential including those with
             tubal ligation. To be considered for enrollment, women of 45 to 55 years of age who
             are postmenopausal (defined as being amenorrheic for at least 2 years) must have
             confirmatory FSH test results at Screening.

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Herbal
             supplements and hormone replacement therapy must be discontinued at least 28 days
             prior to the first dose of study medication. Depo Provera must be discontinued at
             least 6 months prior to the first dose of study medication. As an exception,
             acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of less than 1 g/day. Limited use of
             non prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or the
             overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following
             approval by the sponsor.

          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more
             within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle Guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
