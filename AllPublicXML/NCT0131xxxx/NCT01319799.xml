  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of MRI have shown that the incidence of postoperative cerebral lesions due to
      cerebral embolization is high (1). Nonetheless the extent of postoperative neurological
      dysfunction is only a fraction of the actual amount of new postoperative changes detected on
      MRI. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) has shown the occurrence of extensive microembolic signals in
      intracerebral arteries during open heart procedures (2). The clinical significance of
      cerebral microemboli is not clear (3-5). The use of serological markers to assess cerebral
      injury after open cardiac surgery is difficult to interpret. The levels of markers seems to
      be contaminated from extracerebral sources (6). In order assess the release of markers of
      neuronal damage after open aortic valve surgery the investigators intend to examine the
      levels of S-100B, NSE and Tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by comparing the levels
      preoperative with the levels one day after surgery. Furthermore the investigators will
      determine the total amount of cerebral microembolic signals during the surgical procedure by
      means of TCD. The investigators will statistically test if there is any correlation between
      the increase in cerebrospinal fluid levels of S-100B,NSE and Tau and the cerebral embolic
      load.

      Patients and clinical procedures 10 patients scheduled for open aortic valve surgery at our
      institution will be included into this prospective, observational study. The Human Ethics
      Committee of the University of Gothenburg, approved the study protocol. The day before
      surgery a lumbar puncture at level L3-4 will be performed using a 27G Whitacre needle. A
      sample of 2.5 ml of cerebrospinal fluid will be taken for analysis of S-100B, NSE, Tau and
      albumin.

      On arrival at OR, standard perioperative monitoring will be established, including an
      Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) monitor for anaesthetic depth measurements (AEP Monitor/2,
      Danmeter, Odense, Denmark) and radial arterial and central venous lines. General anaesthesia
      is induced with propofol 0.5-1 mg/kg and fentanyl 10 μg/kg. Tracheal intubation will be
      facilitated using atracurium 0,5 mg/kg. Sevoflurane is used to maintain an anaesthetic depth
      adjusted to an AAI index of 15-30 as recorded by the AEP monitor. Hemodynamic stability will
      be obtained by the use of colloidal solution administration, guided by the use of
      intra-operative transesophageal echocardiography, and norephineprine to maintain a mean
      arterial pressure above 75 mmHg-Also during CPB. A lumbar puncture will be repeated the first
      postoperative day repeating the measurement of markers in CSF A certified cardiologist or
      anaesthesiologist assess focal neurological impairment before and within 24 hours after the
      procedure.

      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) By TCD the right medial cerebral artery (RMCA) will be insonated
      by the transtemporal approach at a depth of approximately 50 mm using standard criteria. The
      investigators use a 2 MHz power M-mode TCD monitor (ST3 ©, Spencer Technologies Seattle, WA),
      with the probe fixed in position using a head frame. The Doppler signals will be continuously
      monitored and saved to monitor hard drive. Two physicians independently evaluate the TCD data
      files offline, and identify microembolic signals (MES) using criteria for counting emboli
      signals on spectral and PMD TCD.

    <time_frame>(day 1) TCD will be performed from start of surgery till end of surgery-exact time cannot be stated in advance</time_frame>
    <description>Transcranial Doppler measurement of microembolic signals will be measured during the surgical procedure.Microembolic signals are detected by offline analysis of the Dopplerspectral analysis of the blood flow in the medial cerebral artery. Different intensities (dB),flow direction and time frame appearances in the Doppler spectral envelope is distinguishable for a neurosonolgist according to predefined criteria for an embolic signal-defined in previous litterature.The total amount of signals during one surgical procedure is counted. The appearance of microembolic signals related to specific procedures performed during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is noted. The exact time range is not possible to estimate in advance,due to the fact that each surgical procedure varies in time.The range of values for each individual patient, based on pilos, will vary from 50 to approximately 1500 embolic counts for one surgical procedure. A high value is negative for the patient.</description>

    <description>Differences in preoperative vs postoperative CSF levels of S-100B in microgram/Liter
The assumption is that a cardiac open heart surgical procedure with cardiopulmonary bypass will influence the postoperative level of marker of neuronal cell damage in the central nerve system. An increase in the levels, compared to the preoperative values, indicates neuronal cell damage detectable in the CSF, namely the brains own extracellular fluid.</description>

        <description>Differences in preoperative vs postoperative CSF levels of S-100B in microgram/Liter
The assumption is that a cardiac open heart surgical procedure with cardiopulmonary bypass will influence the postoperative level of marker of neuronal cell damage in the central nerve system. An increase in the levels, compared to the preoperative values, indicates neuronal cell damage detectable in the CSF, namely the brains own extracellular fluid.</description>
