    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, investigator-masked, parallel group, and
      active-comparator controlled study investigating the clinical outcomes for visual acuity and
      macular thickness after treatment with Bromday (bromfenac ophthalmic solution) 0.09% QD or
      Nevanac (nepafenac ophthalmic suspension) 0.1% TID in subjects who have undergone cataract
      extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two topical NSAIDs currently approved for postoperative treatment of pain and inflammation in
      cataract surgery are bromfenac 0.09% and nepafenac 0.1%. Both purport to treat ocular
      inflammation by acting as a potent inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Clinical studies to
      date lack clarity on which topical NSAID may be the most efficacious.

    <measure>Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Visual Acuities</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>ETDRs visual acuities measured at week 6 following uncomplicated phacoemulsification (phaco). ETDRS charts are a standardized eye chart for visual acuity testing accepted by the National Eye Institute and the Food and Drug Administration. The scale is 30-90 letters with higher numbers signifying improved visual acuities.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment of the cells and flare, signs of inflammation in ocular tissue. SOIS (summed ocular inflammation) = cells in the anterior chamber/1mmx1mm high powered field+flare/1mmx1mm high powered field. The score of the number of cells in the anterior chamber per 1mmx1mm high powered field ranges from 0-4: 0=no cells, 1=1-5 cell, 2=6-15 cells, 3=16-30 cells, 4&gt;=30 cells.Flare scores range from 0-3:(0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Cell+flare are added together (cell score + flare score=SOIS score) for a SOIS score (minimum score=0 and maximal score of 7). Higher numbers would indicate more inflammation.The SOIS scale could range from 0-7 with 0 indicating no cells, no flare and 7 reflecting maximal cell 4(&gt;30 cell/high powered field +3 (severe flare).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>OCT Retinal Thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Stratus OCT scan retinal thickness/volume tabular output report. An experienced ophthalmic technician obtained two scan patterns. The first was the fast macular thickness using 6 radial line scans through a common central axis (fovea) with a retinal thickness/volume tabular output and a retinal-thickness output report. Central retinal thickness was defined as the distance between the inner limiting membrane of the retina and the inner border of the choriocapillaris in the central 1 mm area of the minimum 7 mm posterior pole scan. All scans were reviewed by the principal investigator for quality of foveal centration and signal strength. Macular volume is an objective indicator of macualr swelling and can illustrate the amount of inflammation following surgery. Only the study eye was assessed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are male or female at least 18 years of age who are scheduled for unilateral cataract
             surgery (phacoemulsification or extracapsular) with posterior chamber intraocular lens
             implantation and for whom no other ophthalmic surgical procedures (e.g., relaxing
             incisions, iridectomy, conjunctival excisions, etc) are to be conducted during the
             cataract surgery.

          -  Agree not to have any other ocular surgical procedures in the study or fellow (non
             study) eye within 15 days prior to the initiation of dosing with the test article or
             throughout the duration of the study.

          -  Have a Best Corrected Visual Acuity of 20/200 or better in either eye.

          -  If a woman capable of becoming pregnant, agree to have urine pregnancy testing

        <title>Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS)</title>
        <description>An assessment of the cells and flare, signs of inflammation in ocular tissue. SOIS (summed ocular inflammation) = cells in the anterior chamber/1mmx1mm high powered field+flare/1mmx1mm high powered field. The score of the number of cells in the anterior chamber per 1mmx1mm high powered field ranges from 0-4: 0=no cells, 1=1-5 cell, 2=6-15 cells, 3=16-30 cells, 4&gt;=30 cells.Flare scores range from 0-3:(0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Cell+flare are added together (cell score + flare score=SOIS score) for a SOIS score (minimum score=0 and maximal score of 7). Higher numbers would indicate more inflammation.The SOIS scale could range from 0-7 with 0 indicating no cells, no flare and 7 reflecting maximal cell 4(&gt;30 cell/high powered field +3 (severe flare).</description>

        <title>OCT Retinal Thickness</title>
        <description>Stratus OCT scan retinal thickness/volume tabular output report. An experienced ophthalmic technician obtained two scan patterns. The first was the fast macular thickness using 6 radial line scans through a common central axis (fovea) with a retinal thickness/volume tabular output and a retinal-thickness output report. Central retinal thickness was defined as the distance between the inner limiting membrane of the retina and the inner border of the choriocapillaris in the central 1 mm area of the minimum 7 mm posterior pole scan. All scans were reviewed by the principal investigator for quality of foveal centration and signal strength. Macular volume is an objective indicator of macualr swelling and can illustrate the amount of inflammation following surgery. Only the study eye was assessed.</description>
