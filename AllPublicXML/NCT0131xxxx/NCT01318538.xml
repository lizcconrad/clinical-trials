    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Stage II randomized controlled behavioral treatment development trial was
      to test the effectiveness of the Women's Recovery Group (WRG) relative to mixed-gender Group
      Drug Counseling (GDC) and demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the WRG in an
      open-enrollment (i.e., rolling admission) group format at two clinical sites. The Stage II
      trial aims were to (1) investigate effectiveness of the WRG relative to GDC in a sample of
      women heterogeneous with respect to substance use and co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and
      (2) demonstrate the feasibility of implementing WRG in an open enrollment group format
      characteristic of community treatment programs at two sites.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Stage II trial builds on the Stage I trial that compared the single-gender WRG to
      mixed-gender GDC and demonstrated preliminary support for the WRG in treating women with
      substance use disorders (SUDs). It was hypothesized that women in the WRG would decrease
      their substance use more so than women in the GDC. The GDC was chosen as the comparison group
      to approximate group drug counseling that is consistent with treatment as usual within the
      community. The WRG is a manual-based group therapy for women heterogeneous with respect to
      their substance dependence, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, trauma history, and age and
      stage of life. The WRG is a 12-session structured relapse prevention group therapy that
      utilizes a cognitive-behavioral approach and includes gender-specific content and
      single-gender group composition. There are 14 specific session topics that can be flexibly
      implemented in any order for a 12-week sequence of groups. In the Stage I trial, women were
      randomized to WRG (n=16) or mixed-gender GDC (n =7). No significant differences in outcomes
      emerged between WRG and GDC during the 12 week group sequence. However, in the 6 months
      post-treatment, WRG participants showed a pattern of continued reductions in substance use
      while GDC participants did not. While the design of the Stage I trial was essential for
      treatment development and testing, the Stage I trial had a small sample size and used a
      semi-closed enrollment format. However, most treatment is delivered in an open enrollment
      format (i.e., rolling admission) in which patients enter at any time in the group sequence
      and exit the group after 12 weeks are completed. Because WRG is intended to be a manual-based
      treatment ready for dissemination into clinical practice if demonstrated to be effective, the
      Stage II trial was designed to be implemented in an open group format and to enroll a larger,
      more diverse sample at two clinical sites. The study was designed to investigate the
      effectiveness of the WRG relative to the GDC in (1) reducing days of use of any substance
      from baseline in a sample of women with heterogeneity with regard to their substance
      dependence, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, and other demographic characteristics, and
      (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the WRG in an open-enrollment group
      format.

    <measure>Therapist Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>In treatment (weeks 1-12)</time_frame>
    <description>All therapists were female to eliminate any therapist-patient gender matching effects. There were eight therapists in total: 4 who led WRG groups and 4 who led GDC groups. All group sessions were videotaped each week so that we could measure therapist adherence to the treatment they were assigned to. Two independent raters completed adherence scales for a random selection of 20% of WRG and 10%of GDC sessions. For both groups, the extensiveness to which the therapist engaged in a behavior during the session was rated with a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all; 4 = extensively). Adherence scores were calculated by averaging all scores for each question (25 questions for WRG; 18 for GDC) on the measure. The scores reported here represent the average of all WRG therapists scores from all session, and all GDC therapist scores from all sessions. Scores range from 0 to 4.</description>

    <measure>Group Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>In treatment (weeks 1-12)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment group stability was calculated using the Percentage of Group Change Index which captures change in group membership composition from session to session separately for each individual within each group (specific to the calendar period that each person was in the group). The value can range from 0 (i.e., the exact same membership from one session to the next) to 1 (i.e., complete turnover in membership). The average values across all sessions were taken to get an overall sense of the amount of turnover each person experienced in the group during the period in calendar time they were in treatment.</description>

          <title>Women's Recovery Group</title>
          <description>The Women's Recovery Group (WRG) is a manual-based group therapy for women heterogeneous with respect to their substance use disorder, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, trauma history, age, and stage of life. The WRG is a 12-session, structured relapse-prevention group therapy that utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach and includes gender-specific content and single-gender group composition. Individual session content was derived from research on gender-specific substance use disorder antecedents, consequences, and treatment outcomes. The overall goals of the treatment are to (1) promote abstinence from all substances including alcohol; (2) improve understanding of specific aspects of SUDs, recovery, and relapse that are relevant to women, and (3) help participants with skills and strategies useful in preventing relapse and promoting recovery.</description>

          <title>Mixed-gender Group Drug Counseling</title>
          <description>Group Drug Counseling (GDC) is a standard 12-week, 90-minute mixed-gender group therapy. The overall goals of GDC are to 1) help patients to achieve abstinence from all substances including alcohol; 2) educate patients regarding recovery from substance use disorders; 3) increase patients’ self-awareness of the problems that their substance use disorder has caused; 4) encourage patients to give mutual support; and 5) help patients learn new ways to cope with problems in order to prevent relapse. The GDC was chosen as the comparison group to approximate group drug counseling that is consistent with treatment as usual within the community.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Mean Days of Any Substance Use for Women</title>
        <description>This represents the percent change from baseline in the mean number of days per month of any substance use (i.e. drug and/or alcohol) for women. Days of substance use was assessed using the Timeline Follow-Back at baseline and then monthly for 9 months. The In-Treatment phase includes months 1-3, the 3 Month Post-Treatment phase includes months 4-6, and the 6 Month Post-Treatment phase includes months 7-9. The in-treatment and 2 post-treatment phases were compared to baseline data of mean days of any substance use. Outcomes were analyzed using loglinear (negative binomial) regression models with estimation via generalized estimating equations (GEE). The models included the effects of treatment group, phase (3 levels), and the treatment group by phase interaction.</description>

            <description>The Women's Recovery Group (WRG) is a manual-based group therapy for women heterogeneous with respect to their substance use disorder, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, trauma history, age, and stage of life. The WRG is a 12-session, structured relapse-prevention group therapy that utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach and includes gender-specific content and single-gender group composition. Individual session content was derived from research on gender-specific substance use disorder antecedents, consequences, and treatment outcomes. The overall goals of the treatment are to (1) promote abstinence from all substances including alcohol; (2) improve understanding of specific aspects of SUDs, recovery, and relapse that are relevant to women, and (3) help participants with skills and strategies useful in preventing relapse and promoting recovery.</description>

The overall goals of GDC are to 1) help patients to achieve abstinence from all substances including alcohol; 2) educate patients regarding recovery from substance use disorders; 3) increase patients’ self-awareness of the problems that their substance use disorder has caused; 4) encourage patients to give mutual support; and 5) help patients learn new ways to cope with problems in order to prevent relapse. The GDC was chosen as the comparison group to approximate group drug counseling that is consistent with treatment as usual within the community.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean ASI Alcohol Composite Score for Women</title>
        <description>This represents the change from baseline in mean ASI Alcohol composite scores. The ASI was administered at baseline, at months 1-6, and then at month 9. The In-Treatment phase includes months 1-3, the 3 Month Post-Treatment phase includes months 4-6, and the 6 Month Post-Treatment phase includes months 7-9. The in-treatment and 2 post-treatment phases were compared to baseline ASI data. Outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed effect models. These models included the effects of treatment group, phase (3 levels), and the treatment group by phase interaction.
The ASI is a multidimensional assessment of substance-related problems which yields composite scores for alcohol use, drug use, psychiatric status, medical status, legal status, family/social relationships, and employment status. Composite scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating more significant problems.</description>

The WRG is a 12-session, structured relapse-prevention group therapy that utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach and includes gender-specific content and single-gender group composition. Individual session content was derived from research on gender-specific substance use disorder antecedents, consequences, and treatment outcomes. The overall goals of the treatment are to (1) promote abstinence from all substances including alcohol; (2) improve understanding of specific aspects of SUDs, recovery, and relapse that are relevant to women, and (3) help participants with skills and strategies useful in preventing relapse and promoting recovery.</description>

        <description>All therapists were female to eliminate any therapist-patient gender matching effects. There were eight therapists in total: 4 who led WRG groups and 4 who led GDC groups. All group sessions were videotaped each week so that we could measure therapist adherence to the treatment they were assigned to. Two independent raters completed adherence scales for a random selection of 20% of WRG and 10%of GDC sessions. For both groups, the extensiveness to which the therapist engaged in a behavior during the session was rated with a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all; 4 = extensively). Adherence scores were calculated by averaging all scores for each question (25 questions for WRG; 18 for GDC) on the measure. The scores reported here represent the average of all WRG therapists scores from all session, and all GDC therapist scores from all sessions. Scores range from 0 to 4.</description>

            <description>Group Drug Counseling (GDC) is a standard 12-week, 90-minute mixed-gender group therapy. The overall goals of GDC are to 1) help patients to achieve abstinence from all substances including alcohol; 2) educate patients regarding recovery from substance use disorders; 3) increase patients’ self-awareness of the problems that their substance use disorder has caused; 4) encourage patients to give mutual support; and 5) help patients learn new ways to cope with problems in order to prevent relapse. The GDC was chosen as the comparison group to approximate group drug counseling that is consistent with treatment as usual within the community.</description>

        <title>Group Stability</title>
        <description>Treatment group stability was calculated using the Percentage of Group Change Index which captures change in group membership composition from session to session separately for each individual within each group (specific to the calendar period that each person was in the group). The value can range from 0 (i.e., the exact same membership from one session to the next) to 1 (i.e., complete turnover in membership). The average values across all sessions were taken to get an overall sense of the amount of turnover each person experienced in the group during the period in calendar time they were in treatment.</description>

        <description>This represents the percent change from baseline in the mean number of drug use days (excluding alcohol) for women. Days of drug use was assessed using the Timeline Follow-Back at baseline and then monthly for 9 months. The In-Treatment phase includes months 1-3, the 3 Month Post-Treatment phase includes months 4-6, and the 6 Month Post-Treatment phase includes months 7-9. The in-treatment and 2 post-treatment phases were compared to baseline data of mean drug use days. Outcomes were analyzed using loglinear (negative binomial) regression models with estimation via generalized estimating equations (GEE). The models included the effects of treatment group, phase (3 levels), and the treatment group by phase interaction.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Drinks Per Drinking Day for Women</title>
        <description>This represents the change from baseline in the mean number of drinks per drinking day. Drinks per drinking day was assessed using the Timeline Follow-Back at baseline and then monthly for 9 months. The In-Treatment phase includes months 1-3, the 3 Month Post-Treatment phase includes months 4-6, and the 6 Month Post-Treatment phase includes months 7-9. The in-treatment and 2 post-treatment phases were compared to baseline data of mean drinks per drinking day. Outcomes were analyzed using loglinear (negative binomial) regression models with estimation via generalized estimating equations (GEE). The models included the effects of treatment group, phase (3 levels), and the treatment group by phase interaction.</description>

            <description>The Women's Recovery Group (WRG) is a manual-based group therapy for women heterogeneous with respect to their substance use disorder, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, trauma history, age, and stage of life. The WRG is a 12-session, structured relapse-prevention group therapy that utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach and includes gender-specific content and single-gender group composition. Individual session content was derived from research on gender-specific substance use disorder antecedents, consequences, and treatment outcomes. The overall goals of the treatment are to (1) promote abstinence from all substances including alcohol; (2) improve understanding of specific aspects of SUDs, recovery, and relapse that are relevant to women, and (3) help participants with skills and strategies useful in preventing relapse and promoting recovery.</description>

            <description>Group Drug Counseling (GDC) is a standard 12-week, 90-minute mixed-gender group therapy. The overall goals of GDC are to 1) help patients to achieve abstinence from all substances including alcohol; 2) educate patients regarding recovery from substance use disorders; 3) increase patients’ self-awareness of the problems that their substance use disorder has caused; 4) encourage patients to give mutual support; and 5) help patients learn new ways to cope with problems in order to prevent relapse. The GDC was chosen as the comparison group to approximate group drug counseling that is consistent with treatment as usual within the community.</description>
