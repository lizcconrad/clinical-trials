      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To assess the pharmacokinetics of the hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablet in
           subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and in subjects with normal hepatic function.

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of the hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release
           tablet in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and in subjects with normal hepatic
           function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All subjects:

               -  Written informed consent is obtained

          2. Subjects with normal hepatic function:

               -  The subject is in generally good health (age-appropriate) as determined by
                  medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, ECG, serum chemistry,
                  hematology, coagulation, urinalysis, and serology.

          3. Subjects with hepatic impairment:

               -  The subject's health is otherwise clinically stable as determined by medical
                  history, physical examination, ECG, serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation
                  parameters (PT, activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], and international
                  normalized ratio [INR]), urinalysis, and serology except for those signs and
                  symptoms attributable to liver disease.

               -  The subject has case record notes demonstrating physical signs consistent with 1
                  or more of the following characteristic clinical manifestations of liver
                  cirrhosis: liver firmness to palpation, splenic enlargement, spider angiomas,
                  palmar erythema, parotid hypertrophy, testicular atrophy, ascites (accumulation
                  of fluid in the abdominal cavity), or gynecomastia.

               -  The subject has a Child-Pugh Classification score of 7-9 points (moderate).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. All subjects:

               -  The subject has any clinically significant, uncontrolled medical condition.

               -  The subject is a poor metabolizer of CYP2D6 substrates based on genotyping
                  performed at screening.

               -  The subject has previously participated in a study with CEP-33237.

               -  The subject has a known sensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to hydrocodone or
                  hydromorphone, related compounds, or to any metabolites, or any compound listed
                  as being present in a study formulation.

          2. Subjects with normal hepatic function:

               -  The subject has a positive test result for HBsAg or antibodies to hepatitis C.

               -  The subject has a history of alcohol, narcotic, or any other substance abuse.

          3. Subjects with hepatic impairment:

               -  The subject has severe ascites.

               -  The subject has an acute exacerbation of liver disease as indicated by worsening
                  clinical signs of hepatic impairment.
