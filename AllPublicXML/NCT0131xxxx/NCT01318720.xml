  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck pain continues to be a prevalent condition in our society. Manual therapy (hands on
      techniques for the treatment of neck pain is an intervention commonly implemented in clinical
      practice. Recently researchers and clinicians have implemented manual therapy techniques to
      the thoracic spine (midback) to treat patients with neck pain. To date no studies have
      examined the short-term combined effects of thoracic spine manual therapy and cervical spine
      manual therapy in the treatment of patients with mechanical neck pain. The purpose this study
      is to assess the combined effects of thoracic spine thrust manipulation with cervical spine
      non-thrust manipulation in patients with neck pain.
