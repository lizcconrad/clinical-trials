      Major Objective Through clinical practice, to explore if the application of Fluorouracil
      implant could effectively delay the local tumor recurrence and improvement the postoperative
      survival time in patients with gallbladder cancer and bile duct cancer.

      Secondary objective

      1) If Fluorouracil implants application in clinical surgery could lead to the incidence of
      complications increased in biliary-enteric anastomosis.

      2）Assess drug safety according to drug-related clinical and / or laboratory adverse events.

      3）Observe the postoperative complication rate of Fluorouracil implants. 4）Observe the quality
      of life of patients used Fluorouracil implants.
