  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients undergoing coronary angiography are found to have no significant coronary
      artery disease (CAD) despite angina equivalent symptoms and/or electrocardiographic
      abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischemia. The aim of this study is to systematically
      assess patients with angina equivalent symptoms despite normal coronary angiograms and to
      evaluate their symptoms according to a defined algorithm.

      All consecutive patients who had coronary angiography at the Luzerner Kantonsspital between
      July 1st 1996 and July 31st 2008 and who had no significant coronary stenoses (no coronary
      stenoses ≥ 50%) were recruited for this study. Patients are extensively examined during
      angiography using acetylcholine infusion and fast atrial pacing. According to the result of
      the additional invasive examination (vasospasm, vasoconstriction, vasodilation; symptoms
      during examination) a distinct diagnosis is attributed to the patients (small vessel disease,
      vasospastic disease, hypertensive heart disease, rhythm disorder, or extracardiac thoracic
      pain including pulmonary hypertension). Patients are followed-up after 10 years and prognosis
      of these patients is assessed (including mortality, cardiovascular events, re-angiography,
      functional status after 10 years).
