      The purpose of this study is to determine whether green tea extract is safe for
      extensive-stage small lung cancer who achieved objective tumor response after first-line
      therapy.

    <textblock>
      Small-cell lung cancer accounts for 13 to 15% of all lung cancer and more than 60 to 70% of
      patients present with extensive disease (ED). Although etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) regimen
      has been the mainstay of ED-SCLC treatment, median overall survival is about 9 months, with 5
      to 10% surviving two years and only 1% of patients achieving a long-term disease-free
      survival. To improve this outcome further, various attempts have been made, which included
      dose intensification with stem cell supports, maintenance therapy, and also searches for a
      better chemotherapy regimen.

      Significant anticarcinogenic effects of green tea extract on various organs, such as skin,
      stomach, duodenum, colon, liver, pancreas, and lung in rodent models have been confirmed.
      Recent scientific investigations have identified the active chemical compounds in green tea
      designated tea polyphenols or catechins. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the major
      catechin in tea.An investigation about the effects of EGCG on human SCLC cells revealed that
      EGCG had similar anti-tumor effects on drug-sensitive (H69) and drug-resistant (H69VP) SCLC
      cells. Thus, the investigators conduct this phase I trial, the objectives of this trial were
      to study the side effects and best dose of of EGCG in treating patients with small-cell lung
      cancer who achieved objective tumor response after first-line therapy.
