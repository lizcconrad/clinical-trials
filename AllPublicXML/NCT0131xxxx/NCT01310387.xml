    <textblock>
      This study is:

        -  A single-center, randomized, prospective controlled trial.

        -  To prove superiority of active pain management group compared to control group by the
           percent of pain intensity difference of outpatients with lung cancer pain.

        -  204 patients will be recruited.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The recruited patients in both group will be provided the education about pain-killer,
           and received medicines including opioids according to their numeric rating scale (NRS)

        -  Active management group will be provided additional telephone counseling and dosage
           modification by specialized nurse for cancer pain.

        -  The percent of pain intensity difference (%PID)

             -  PID = (NRS of visit 1 - NRS of visit 3)/NRS of visit 1
