  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EV71 has caused large epidemics with lots of fatal cases and cases with sequelae. However,
      the clinical syndromes and severity of the same EV71 strain are very diverse, ranging from
      asymptomatic (71%) to fatal (0.05%) disease, and the pathogenesis remains unknown. In
      addition, the severe or fatal case incidence varies significantly differently in different
      areas of Taiwan. Although some viral virulence studies were performed, no clear viral
      virulence factor has been found. Therefore, host factors may be important to the clinical
      outcomes of EV71 infections. In addition, there were significantly different incidences of
      severe or fatal cases in different areas of Taiwan, for example, significantly more fatal or
      severe cases occurred in the central or southern Taiwan in comparison with in northern
      Taiwan. Whether this is related to host factors, social, behavioral or environmental factors
      remains unanswered. To find the most important factors associated with EV71 susceptibility, a
      thorough study involving genetics, social, behavioral or environmental factors among
      different areas of Taiwan is warranted and the findings will provide future prevention of
      EV71 and give help on early precaution and treatment of EV71.

      The specific aims are to find factors associated with different severe/fatal incidences in
      different areas of Taiwan. We will do

        1. Comparison of gene variants in EV71 cases with different severity and normal children in
           different areas of Taiwan to find susceptible genes and genetic polymorphism related to
           the clinical outcomes

        2. Social, behavioral and environmental factors related to EV71 infections in different
           areas of Taiwan
