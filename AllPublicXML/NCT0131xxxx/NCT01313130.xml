  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury can cause permanent problems with thinking, memory, control of
      emotions, organization and planning. Thousands of soldiers, marines, and other military
      personnel have had injuries to the brain due the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Very large
      numbers of civilians, up to perhaps 1.5 million people per year, in the United States also
      have traumatic brain injuries caused by car accidents, falls, sports-related injuries or
      assault.

      We don't know very much about traumatic brain injuries right now, but there are some
      important new advances in technology that may help us learn a lot more about these injuries.
      One such advance involves new types of MRI scans that we think will be able to show what has
      happened to the brain after trauma more clearly that regular scans can. The first new scan is
      called diffusion tensor imaging, which shows injury to the axons (the wiring of the brain).
      The second new scan is called resting-state functional MRI correlation analysis, which shows
      how well various parts of the brain are connected to each other. Importantly, the new types
      of scans can be done using regular scanners that we already have in every major hospital. The
      innovation is entirely in how the scanners are used and how the resulting pictures are
      analyzed on a computer after they have been taken. We have already tested these scans on some
      military and civilian patients with brain injury and found them to be very helpful so far.
      Our overall goal is to see whether these new MRI scans will be useful for active duty
      military personnel who have had recent traumatic brain injuries. The most important goal will
      be to see if the amount of injury shown on the scans be used to predict how well the patients
      will do overall over the next 6-12 months. A related goal will be to see whether injuries to
      specific parts of the brain seen by these new scans can be used to predict whether patients
      will be likely to have specific problems like memory loss, attention deficit, depression, or
      post-traumatic stress disorder. We would also like to see whether the scans could be even
      more useful when combined with information about genetic factors (inherited from the parents)
      that can be tested in the blood. Another important goal is to compare the effects of
      traumatic brain injuries caused by blasts or explosions with injuries from other causes, to
      find out what is unique about blast injury. A final goal will be to repeat the scans 6-12
      months later to see whether the new MRI scans can show whether the injuries to the brain have
      healed, gotten worse, or stayed the same. These new scans could help with decisions about
      whether military personnel can return to duty, what sort of rehabilitation and treatment
      would benefit them most, and what family members should watch for and expect.

             screening team, based on clinical history, examination, and/or clinical imaging
             performed as part of standard care (CT, conventional MRI). This includes participants
             with both primary blast and additional mechanisms of injury (&quot;blast-plus&quot; injury)
