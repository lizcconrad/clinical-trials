  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the occurrence of multiple symptoms in cancer patients of 5 German
      university hospitals. Primary goal of the study is to assess the prevalence of multiple
      symptoms and related symptom clusters (e.g. pain, fatigue and sleep disorder).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oncology patients experience a variety of symptoms as a result of disease and/or treatment.
      They often report co-occurrence of symptoms and functional impairments (Miaskowski 2007). To
      evaluate the prevalence of symptoms and identify symptom clusters and the influence of
      multiple symptoms on HRQoL, in and out patients of 5 German university hospitals currently
      undergoing cancer treatment are recruited. These patients are asked to complete the following
      instruments: Distress thermometer, health related quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ
      C30) and MD. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI (German version). In a subgroup of two
      participating hospitals patients, that score ≥ 3/10 (MDASI-subscales for pain, fatigue and/or
      sleep disorder) are asked to complete additional questionnaires: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI),
      Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The
      information gained will not be accessible for doctors in charge of the treatment and
      therefore not influence or alter the participants' treatment regimes.

      Primary endpoint of the study is to assess the prevalence of multiple symptoms and related
      symptom clusters (e.g. pain, fatigue and sleep disorder). Secondary endpoints are: symptom
      burden (intensity of symptoms and functional impairments), impact of symptom burden on HRQoL.

      The investigators aim to approve the value of standardized assessment of symptoms in clinical
      cancer care settings as an important precondition of early treatment and supportive care.
