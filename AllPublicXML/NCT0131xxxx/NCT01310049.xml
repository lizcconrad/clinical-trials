      The purpose of this first-in-man trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      ascending single and multiple doses of LEO 32731 in healthy male subjects. The trial will be
      performed in three parts. In Part 1, single doses of LEO 32731 will be administered to
      healthy male subjects. In Part 2, the effect of food on the single oral dose pharmacokinetic
      will be investigated. In Part 3, multiple doses of LEO 32731 will be administered to healthy
      male subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will, prior to any study related activities, have given their written
             informed consent to participate in the study and to abide by the study restrictions.

          2. Subjects will be Caucasian males between 18 and 55 years of age and with a body mass
             index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2 inclusive.

          3. Subjects must be in good health, as determined by a medical history, physical
             examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory evaluations
             (congenital non haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia is NOT acceptable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are not, or whose partners are not willing to use appropriate
             contraception (such as condom) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository from
             the time of the first dose until 3 months after the final dosing occasion. Male
             subjects whose partners are of child-bearing potential must also agree to use an
             additional highly effective method of contraception

          2. Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14
             days of the first dose administration unless in the opinion of the Investigator the
             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.

          3. Subjects who have used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including
             herbal remedies) within 7 days of the first dose administration unless in the opinion
             of the Investigator the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise safety.

          4. Subjects who have received any medications, including St John's Wort, known to
             chronically alter drug absorption or elimination processes within 30 days of the first
             dose administration unless in the opinion of the Investigator the medication will not
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.

          5. Subjects who are still participating in a clinical study (e.g. attending follow-up
             visits) or who have participated in a clinical study involving administration of an
             investigational drug (new chemical entity), or a marketed drug within the past 3
             months prior to the first dosing occasion.

          6. Subjects who have donated any blood, plasma or platelets in 3 months prior to
             screening or who have made donations on more than two occasions within the 12 months
             preceding the first dose administration.

          7. Subjects with a significant history of drug allergy as determined by the Investigator.

          8. Subjects who have any clinically significant allergic disease (excluding non-active
             hayfever) as determined by the Investigator.

          9. Subjects who have a supine blood pressure and supine pulse rate at screening higher
             than 140/90 mmHg and 100 beats per minute (bpm), respectively, or lower than 90/50
             mmHg and 50 bpm, respectively

         10. Subjects who consume more than 28 units of alcohol per week or who have a significant
             history of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse as determined by the Investigator (one
             unit of alcohol equals Â½ pint [285 mL] of beer or lager, one glass [125 mL] of wine,
             or 1/6 gill [25 mL] of spirits).

         11. Subjects with a positive urine drug screen or alcohol breath test result at screening
             or first admission.

         12. Subjects who smoke or who have smoked in the 3 months prior to first dose
             administration.

             the Investigator.

         14. Subjects who have had a clinically significant illness within 4 weeks of the start of
             dose administration as determined by the Investigator.

         15. Subjects who are known to have serum hepatitis, or who are carriers of the hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody, or who have a positive result to the

             of not being able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

         18. Subjects who have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the risk of participating in the study; such as QTcB interval
             &gt;450 msec, 2nd or 3rd degree Atrioventricular block, complete left bundle branch
             block, complete right bundle branch block or Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome defined as
             PR&lt;110 msec, confirmed by a repeat ECG.
