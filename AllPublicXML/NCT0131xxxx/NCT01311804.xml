      Primary Research Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine efficacy of periarticular parecoxib
      sodium in a multimodal cocktail versus intravenous parecoxib injections for pain management
      in total knee arthroplasty

      Secondary Research Objective:

        -  To determine if perioperative use of parecoxib sodium was associated with improved
           clinical outcomes

        -  To evaluate the safety, in terms of adverse events; serious adverse events and
           tolerability of parecoxib sodium in periarticular injections in a multimodal cocktail

      This is a multi-center, open label, parallel randomized trial designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of periarticular parecoxib sodium compared to intravenous parecoxib
      sodium.

      125 patients with primary knee osteoarthritis from 4 participating sites who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial. After initial screening,
      patients will attend clinic for baseline examination. Subjects will then randomly allocated
      to periarticular parecoxib sodium or intravenous sodium in ratio of 1:1. patients are
      observed at post-operative 6, 12, 24 hours, subsequently daily for 4 days and finally at 2
      week follow-up
