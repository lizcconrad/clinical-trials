  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving carboplatin, paclitaxel, cetuximab, and
      erlotinib hydrochloride together works in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent
      squamous cell head and neck cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block
      tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.
      Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving combination chemotherapy together with cetuximab and erlotinib
      hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate when erlotinib is added to combination
      carboplatin/paclitaxel/cetuximab systemic therapy in metastatic/recurrent head and neck
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Secondary endpoints will be toxicity, overall survival, and laboratory correlates to
      determine if epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is more effectively inhibited
      after the addition of erlotinib than it is after chemotherapy/cetuximab without erlotinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour, and
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive
      erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

             advanced disease

          -  No prior erlotinib, gefitinib or lapatinib therapy is permitted; nor is prior exposure
             to any investigational EGFR or panErbB reversible or irreversible inhibitor or any
             prior panitumumab or investigational EGFR-directed monoclonal antibody permitted

          -  No other malignancy within 3 years

          -  No chronic diarrheal condition

          -  Females should not be pregnant or breast feeding because chemotherapy may be harmful
             to the fetus or the nursing infant; also, the effects of erlotinib and cetuximab on

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients receiving combination
