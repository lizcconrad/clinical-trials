      The purpose of this study is to acquire the clinical data required by the United States Food
      and Drug Administration (USFDA) for 510(k) submission, for approval of a new high resolution
      imaging system for fluoroscopy/radiography. It is expected that the new KALARE
      (DREX-KL80)high resolution imaging system will meet the design specifications. A minimum of
      30 cases will be submitted for evaluation of claims for intended clinical applications.
