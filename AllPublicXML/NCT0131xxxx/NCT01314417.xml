      BACKGROUND:

      Uveitis comprises of a group of diseases associated with inflammation of the eye that can
      lead to vision loss. Some people with uveitis also have macular edema (swelling of the retina
      at the back of the eye). Uveitis and macular edema are treated with medications and sometimes
      surgery, but treatment does not always prevent vision loss. Previous research has shown that
      injections of methotrexate into the eye of people with eye disease other than uveitis can
      help relieve the inflammation, or swelling, that causes macular edema and can slow visual
      loss. However, it has not yet been approved as a treatment for macular edema associated with
      uveitis.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of methotrexate injections as a treatment for
      macular edema associated with uveitis.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with uveitis and macular edema
      in at least one eye.

      DESIGN:

        -  This study requires at least nine visits to the National Eye Institute study clinic over
           a period of 6 months (24 weeks).

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical and ophthalmic examination, medical
           history, blood and urine tests, and additional eye and other tests as needed.

        -  Participants will receive a methotrexate injection in a selected treatment eye. After
           the injection, participants will receive antibiotic eye drops to place in the eye three
           times a day for the 3 days following the injection, leucovorin (folic acid) drops to
           place in the eye four times a day for 1 week following the injection, and a dose of
           folic acid to be taken by mouth the day after the injection.

        -  Participants who tolerate the initial injection may continue to receive injections in
           their study eye every month for 6 months. After 6 months, participants who show
           improvement from the injections may be evaluated to receive additional injections every
           4 to 8 weeks until researchers end the study.

      OBJECTIVE:

      The study objective is to investigate the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of
      intravitreal injections of methotrexate as a possible treatment for chronic macular edema
      secondary to panuveitis, posterior or intermediate uveitis.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Five participants with chronic macular edema associated with panuveitis, posterior or
      intermediate uveitis will be initially enrolled. However, up to an additional two
      participants may be enrolled to account for participants who withdraw from the study prior to
      reaching Week 12. Eligibility criteria include macular edema in the study eye, which has not
      been responsive to conventional immunosuppressive therapy in the past three months, or the
      participant experienced a recurrence of macular edema while on conventional immunosuppressive
      therapy.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      In this single-center, prospective, uncontrolled, unmasked, Phase I/II clinical trial,
      intravitreal injections of methotrexate at a dose of 400 μg per 100 μL will be administered.
      There will be an induction phase and a pro re nata (PRN) phase. During the induction phase,
      participants will receive injections at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 in their study
      eye unless contraindicated. Additional safety visits will occur at Weeks 1 and 2. Beginning
      at Week 24, participants who agree to remain in the study will undergo evaluation for
      injection in the study eye PRN every 4-8 weeks. These participants will be followed for 4-8
      weeks after the last enrolled participant completes his/her Week 24 visit.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary outcome is the number of participants who meet the definition of treatment
      success within 12 weeks from baseline. Treatment success is defined as achieving at least a
      1-step decrease in the LogScore scale for central macular thickness. Secondary outcomes
      include changes in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) best-corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA), changes in excess retinal thickening, changes in macular thickness, changes in
      intraocular inflammation on clinical exam, changes in leakage as seen on fluorescein
      angiography (FA), changes in autofluorescence patterns seen on fundus autofluorescence (FAF)
      imaging and observation of dose reductions of systemic immunosuppression or steroids. Safety
      outcomes include the number and severity of adverse events, systemic and ocular toxicities,
      electrophysiologic changes assessed by full-field electroretinography (ERG) and number of
      withdrawals.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment success is defined as achieving at least a 1-step decrease in the LogScore scale for central macular thickness.
A decrease of at least 1-step on the logOCT scale, where Change in logOCT=log(follow-up thickness/200) - log(baseline thickness/200) is considered clinically significant. A 1-step decrease is equivalent to at least a 20% improvement of central macular thickness and represents greater than twice the variability of retinal thickness measurements (approximately 25-30 µ).
Examples of OCT measurements with their corresponding LogScore, where LogScore=10xlogOCT are as follows:
LogScore 0 = OCT 200 µm, LogScore 1 = OCT 250 µm, LogScore 2 = OCT 320 µm, LogScore 3 = OCT 400 µm, LogScore 4 = OCT 500 µm, LogScore 5 = OCT 640 µm, LogScore 6 = OCT 800 µm, LogScore 7 = OCT 1000 µm</description>

             serum pregnancy tests throughout the study.

          8. Both female participants of childbearing potential (see Appendix 1 for definition) and
             male participants able to father children must have (or have a partner who has) had a
             hysterectomy or vasectomy, be completely abstinent from intercourse or must agree to
             practice two acceptable methods of contraception throughout the course of the study
             and for six months after the last study medication injection. Acceptable methods of
             contraception include:

               -  hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal
                  patch or vaginal ring),

               -  intrauterine device,

               -  barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or

               -  surgical sterilization (tubal ligation).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Participant is in another investigational study and actively receiving investigational
             therapy for macular edema.

          2. Participant has evidence of infectious panuveitis, posterior or intermediate uveitis
             in either eye.

          3. Participant is expected to need ocular surgery in the study eye during the course of
             the trial.

          4. Participant had intraocular surgery in the study eye within the past 90 days.

          5. Participant had an injection of bevacizumab or ranibizumab within the past four weeks
             in the study eye.

          6. Participant had an injection of triamcinolone within the past six weeks in the study
             eye.

          7. Participant has a systemic condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             preclude participation in the study.

          8. Participant has significant cataract or media opacity in the study eye that makes
             posterior segment visualization difficult as determined by investigator.

          9. Participant has a confirmed positive serologic and/or molecular test for HIV-1/2.

        <title>Number of Participants Who Meet the Definition of Treatment Success Within 12 Weeks From Baseline.</title>
        <description>Treatment success is defined as achieving at least a 1-step decrease in the LogScore scale for central macular thickness.
A decrease of at least 1-step on the logOCT scale, where Change in logOCT=log(follow-up thickness/200) - log(baseline thickness/200) is considered clinically significant. A 1-step decrease is equivalent to at least a 20% improvement of central macular thickness and represents greater than twice the variability of retinal thickness measurements (approximately 25-30 µ).
Examples of OCT measurements with their corresponding LogScore, where LogScore=10xlogOCT are as follows:
LogScore 0 = OCT 200 µm, LogScore 1 = OCT 250 µm, LogScore 2 = OCT 320 µm, LogScore 3 = OCT 400 µm, LogScore 4 = OCT 500 µm, LogScore 5 = OCT 640 µm, LogScore 6 = OCT 800 µm, LogScore 7 = OCT 1000 µm</description>

        <description>Excess retinal thickening was assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA), a non-invasive imaging technique that uses long-wavelength light to capture micrometer-resolution cross-sectional images from biological tissue.
The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye. For cases in which both eyes met the study eye eligibility criteria, the study eye was selected according to the &quot;choice of study eye in cases of bilateral disease&quot; selection criteria outlined in the eligibility criteria.</description>

The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye. For cases in which both eyes met the study eye eligibility criteria, the study eye was selected according to the &quot;choice of study eye in cases of bilateral disease&quot; selection criteria outlined in the eligibility criteria.</description>

        <title>Changes in Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye at 16 Weeks Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.
The participant's eye that met the study eye eligibility criteria was selected as the study eye. For cases in which both eyes met the study eye eligibility criteria, the study eye was selected according to the &quot;choice of study eye in cases of bilateral disease&quot; selection criteria outlined in the eligibility criteria.</description>
