    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studies how well Akt inhibitor MK2206 works in treating patients with
      stage I-III breast cancer that can be removed by surgery. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for a decrease in phosphorylated (phospho)-protein kinase B (Akt) (Ser^473)
      levels in tissue after a pre-surgical trial of weekly MK2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) (2 doses)
      in patients with operable invasive breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of MK2206 on the immunohistochemical expression of other
      phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway biomarkers on pre-and post-MK2206 tumor
      tissue, such as phospho-S6 kinase.

      II. To assess modulation of PI3K/AKT signaling following MK2206 use with reverse-phase
      protein microarray analysis.

      III. To explore whether phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit
      alpha (PIK3CA) mutations demonstrate different modulation of PI3K/Akt-pathway signaling as
      compared to tumors with loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).

      IV. To explore whether MK2206 alters PI3K/Akt pathway signaling differently in hormone
      receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2-negative tumors, as compared
      to triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancers.

      V. To evaluate whether tumor proliferation, as measured by Ki-67 staining of breast tumor
      cells, is reduced in patients taking MK2206 pre-surgically and correlate Ki-67 modulation
      with changes in PI3K/AKT signaling.

      VI. To determine safety and tolerability of MK2206 in patients with early-stage breast
      cancer.

      VII. To collect fasting blood for evaluation of predictive markers of drug effect, such as
      markers in the insulin growth-factor receptor pathway (i.e., fasting insulin, c-peptide,
      insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-1, and IGF binding protein [BP]-1 and 3), as well as
      modulation of phospho-markers in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days -9 and -2, and undergo segmental
      resection or total mastectomy on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
