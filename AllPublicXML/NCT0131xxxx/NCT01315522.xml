  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) is now widely accepted as the standard
      intervention for the relief of obstructive jaundice in patients with unresectable malignant
      biliary obstruction. Although plastic stents (PSs) were developed earlier, self-expandable
      metal stents (SEMSs) are now used widely as the initial choice for ERBD in this setting, as
      SEMSs offer longer patency.However, SEMSs do become occluded in some patients. There are a
      limited number of reports on the management of occluded SEMS with various results. The aim of
      this study is to compare the efficacy of ComVi stents SEMSs with uncovered SEMS in subsequent
      ERBD after the occlusion of initial SEMSs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic placement of self-expandable metallic stents (SEMSs) is the mainstay of palliative
      measures for alleviating obstructive jaundice secondary to advanced cholangiocarcinoma.
      Previous meta-analysis showed no significant difference in stent patency between covered and
      uncovered SEMS, which are currently available. However, information on secondary SEMS
      insertion is still scarce, and there has been no prospective trial comparing efficacy of
      secondary stenting between covered and uncovered SEMS for the management of occluded metal
      stent in malignant biliary obstruction. Previously, only two small retrospective studies
      addressed this issue. Given the absence of prospective trial on re-intervention for occluded
      SEMS in malignant biliary obstruction, we aimed to prospectively compare the efficacies and
      complication rates of secondary ComVi stent (cSEMS) and uSEMS for the management of such
      condition.
