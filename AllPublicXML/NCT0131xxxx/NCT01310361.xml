    <description>It is mentioned underlined in page 10 in research. (Once the throat swab was taken and cultured on plate at the place where the child was examined, hygiene teacher was trained about how to prepare the oral amoxicillin suspension and how to give it to the child. 750 milligrams of amoxicillin was thereafter given to the patient and in order not to infect other school children, the patient was sent home. The following morning, the patient would come to school and was given the second dose of amoxicillin by the hygiene teacher. All oral drugs were bought from a creditable company. In the injection group, 600000 units of penicillin was administered to children who weigh less than 27 kilograms and 1200000 units of penicillin was administered to children who weigh more. After 48 hours, patients were examined again when the result of first culture was ready)</description>
