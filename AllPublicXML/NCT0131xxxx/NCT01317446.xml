  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rinsing with an amine fluoride/stannous
      flouride mouthrinse in addition to daily tooth brushing is more effective than tooth brushing
      alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingivitis prevalence is 100% among the population. This is mostly due to an inadequate
      mechanical cleaning of the teeth. However, remaining dental biofilm can be approached by
      antibacterial mouthrinses. As a consequence of regular use of these mouthrinses, gingivitis
      can be reduced. Amine fluoride/stannous flouride mouthrinse (ASF)has proved its efficacy in
      several studies. In the previous years, a new formulation that does not contain ethanol
      anymore was introduced in the market. Therefore, it is the aim of the study to proof whether
      rinsing with ASF adjunctive to mechanical oral hygiene is more effective on gingivitis
      reduction than mechanical oral hygiene alone. In addition, effects on dental plaque,
      discoloration of teeth and bacterial colonization should be studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female adults aged ≥18 years.

          -  Participants who have gingivitis/mild chronic periodontitis (approximal probing depth
             ≤ 3.5 mm at ≥ 80 % of the sites and at ≤ 20 % of the sites &gt; 3.5 mm and &lt; 5 mm).

          -  Participants must have read, understood and signed the informed consent form.

          -  Participants who have a GI ≥ 1.3 at baseline.

          -  Participants who have at least 20 own teeth excluding the wisdom teeth (incl. 16
             natural crowns).

          -  Participants who have an acceptable compliance according to the investigators'
             assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have systemic diseases that require regular systemic medication
             intake that may affect the gingival condition (e. g. phenytoin, nifedipine,
             cyclosporine, antibiotics, steroids, antiphlogistics).

          -  Participants who require antibiotic treatments for dental appointments (endocarditis
             prophylaxis).

             the course of the study.

          -  Participants who were treated with any antibacterial mouthrinse 6 weeks before
             recruitment.

          -  Participants who use other than the recommended mouthrinse or toothpaste during the
             study period.

          -  Participants who have moderate and severe chronic or aggressive periodontitis.

          -  Participants who have irregularities of the gingival tissues, e. g. hyperplastic
             gingiva, mucosal diseases.

          -  Participants who have rampant caries.

          -  Participants under guardianship or without freedom by administrative or legal award.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial or receipt of an investigational
             compound/treatment at the same time and 4 weeks prior to inclusion.
