  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate in patients with overactive bladder syndrome
      (OABS) whether a combination treatment of solifenacin with pelvic floor muscle training and
      whole body vibration training achieves a better treatment outcome than a treatment with
      solifenacin alone.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of patients with OAB in clinical practice often consists of drug therapy in
      combination with bladder training and/or behavioural therapies such as whole body vibration
      training (WBVT) and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT). However, very little data exist on
      the benefits of such combinations. In particular, there are not data on the association of
      antimuscarinic agents with both WBVT and PFMT. In order to optimize the treatment of OAB it
      is of great importance to conduct studies which compare pharmacotherapy alone with a
      combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioural techniques.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate in patients with OABS whether a combination
      treatment of solifenacin with pelvic floor muscle training and whole body vibration training
      achieves a better treatment outcome than a treatment with solifenacin alone.

      At the baseline visit subjects will be randomised into 2 treatment arms. Patients randomized
      to group A will receive solifenacin 5mg tablet once daily and a training programme for PFMT
      and WBVT once a week. Subjects randomised to group B will receive solifenacin 5mg tablet once
      daily. Efficacy evaluation will take place at week 8 and 16. Safety evaluations will take
      place at each visit. At week 8, after discussion with the investigator, the patient will have
      an option to continue with the original dose or request a dose increase based on their
      satisfaction of efficacy and tolerability.

    <description>The primary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline in mean score of patient perception of bladder condition (PPBC). Between-treatment differences in changes from baseline to endpoint will formally be tested using an analysis of variance (ANOVA).
For the primary efficacy parameter, statistically significant superiority of solifenacin combined with pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and whole body vibration training (WBVT) to solifenacin alone must be obtained.</description>
