  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we propose 1) to develop a new multisensor monitoring system associating a
      tri-axial accelerometer and a magnetometer to measure physical activity in free-living
      adults, 2) to perform its calibration and assess its validity in a series of activity tasks
      in comparison with the measure of energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry as the criterion
      measure, and with existing physical activity monitors (cardiofrequencemetry and
      accelerometers used either alone or in combination). Briefly the subjects will perform a
      series of standardized activity tasks of different intensities and a 30-min free physical
      activity period while wearing 6 MOTIONPOD(TM) and different commercial activity monitors.
      Physical activity energy expenditure will be measured using a metabolic gas analyser.

      Data of the 30 first subjects will be used to develop new algorithms to identify the
      different activity tasks and to estimate the related energy expenditures. Data of the
      following 30 subjects will be used to validate the MotionPOD(TM) against indirect calorimetry
      and existing physical activity monitors

    <description>It is a study with a single arm. The MOTIONPOD TM measures are compared with simultaneous estimations obtained with the criteria measure (indirect calorimeter) and with existing activity monitors (heart rate monitor POLAR; different accelerometers - rT3 et Actigraph GT3X-, Actiheart, Sensewear Pro2 Armband) After physical fitness evaluation, different activity monitors are set up and the subjects perform a series of standardised activity tasks of different intensities, and well as a 30-min free activity period. Physical activity energy expenditure is measured at the end of each task using a metabolic gas analyser</description>
