      The purpose of this study is, in a phase II randomized trial, to test a newly developed
      machine perfusion technique of human liver allografts before transplantation.

      Ischemia-reperfusion injury is universal in organ transplantation and leads to varying
      degrees of graft dysfunction. Despite this fact, the preservation method in organ
      transplantation has been left unchanged for many years and remains simple static cold
      storage. Given the scarce donor supply, an increasing number of so called marginal or
      extended criteria donor organs have been used for liver transplantation, grafts which were
      previously rarely considered. In addition, allocation policy has changed in many countries,
      and livers are currently often distributed by the severity of the recipient's disease. As a
      result, transplant candidates present sicker, with higher MELD (Model for end stage liver
      disease) scores, at the time of transplant,and the risk of graft dysfunction or even failure
      due to reperfusion injury is high after the use of marginal livers in sick recipients.

      Machine liver perfusion techniques have been significantly improved during the past decade to
      decrease reperfusion injury, and a number of promising results show beneficial effects in
      various animal transplant models by either normothermic or hypothermic oxygenated continuous
      liver perfusion. These techniques generally require machine liver perfusion immediately after
      organ procurement. However, continuous perfusion has several drawbacks, including major
      logistic efforts and risk of organ damage during perfusion and transport.

      Our group, therefore, focused on the practicability of machine liver perfusion. We developed
      an endischemic hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) concept through the portal vein only.
      This technique can be easily applied in the operation room shortly before transplantation of
      the recipient, thus after organ transport and back table preparation.

      Recently, the beneficial effect of a similar approach has been confirmed in human liver
      grafts by a phase I non randomized trial. These results prove feasibility and safety of an
      endischemic hypothermic machine perfusion approach and warrant further randomized studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists on two groups, a perfusion group and a control group. Patients on the
      waiting list for liver transplantation with proven written consent will be recruited and
      randomized during organ procurement. Randomization will be performed by computer
      (www.randomizer.at). Perfusion will be started in the operation room after regular organ
      procurement, transport and back table preparation. The perfusion procedure will not delay the
      implantation due to the fact that recipient hepatectomy usually takes 2 hours. During this
      procedure, hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE group) for one hour will be performed vs
      continued cold storage (Control group).

      We will use commercially available and approved IGL solution (Institut George Lopez) as
      perfusate for machine perfusion.

      Subjects will be followed for one year after transplantation.

      Interim Analysis:

      Interim analysis will take be performed for safety and ethical purposes. As soon as we reach
      20 patients per randomized group, data will be analyzed by an independent Data Monitoring
      Committee. The trial will be immediately stopped if one of the following is satisfied:

        1. Efficacy: If the mean ALT levels are statistically significantly higher (p&lt;0.001,
           Student's T-test) in the HOPE group when compared to the Control group.

        2. Safety: If the proportion of complications (Grade ≥ III) is statistically significantly
           higher (p&lt;0.05, Fischer's Exact 2-sided Test) in the HOPE group when compared to the
           Control group.

      Subgroup analysis:

      A subgroup analysis will be performed in terms of adjusting to extended criteria donor
      grafts.
