  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral mucositis can be a significant problem for cancer patients. It is typically associated
      with pain and increased risk of infection and can lead to impaired nutritional status and
      inadequate hydration.it can be seen in the patient population receiving high-dose head and
      neck radiation therapy (85%-100%). Topical dexpanthenol acts like a moisturizer, improving
      stratum corneum hydration, reducing transepidermal water loss and maintaining skin softness
      and elasticity. The stimulation of epithelization, granulation and mitigation of itching were
      the most prominent effects of formulations containing dexpanthenol. The investigators suppose
      that dexpanthenol mouth wash may improve oral mucositis.

      Patients will be given a bottle of 5% Dexpanthenol mouthwash and they are asked to rinse 10
      ml of it three times a day. At the onset of mucositis and then for 4 subsequent weeks they
      will be examined to evaluate the condition of their oral mucosa.By the advent of mucositis
      stage 4 ,at any time during the 4 weeks of study,the patient would be out.if any patient
      shows allergic reaction to dexpanthenol,he/she would be out of study too.
