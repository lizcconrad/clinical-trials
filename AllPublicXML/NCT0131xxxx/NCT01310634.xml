  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents of hospitalized neonates experience high stress levels and feelings of helplessness
      in the neonatal ward and often concern for the health and well being of their fragile infant.
      Parental stress associated with admission to the neonatal ward of infants has been
      extensively studied in developed countries for many years, but rarely have epidemiological
      and intervention studies been reported in Chinese parents of hospitalized neonates. The aim
      of the present study was to elucidate the epidemiology of anxiety and depression in parents
      of hospitalized neonates and test a comprehensive intervention program to prevent anxiety and
      depression in parents in a Chinese hospital.
