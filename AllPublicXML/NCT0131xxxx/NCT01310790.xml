  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of lactate guided therapy on septic shock has not been extensively investigated,
      however the goal directed therapy has been used for years. The investigators aim was to test
      the hypothesis that lactate directed hemodynamic therapy is associated with improving the
      outcome of patients with septic shock by comparing different goal directed strategies which
      have been commonly recommended clinically.

      In this multicenter, randomized trial, the investigators assigned patients with septic shock
      to three groups: Patients were treated with hemodynamic therapy directed either by
      conventional parameters treatment (control group), or central venous oxygen saturation
      (ScvO2), or blood lactate respectively in each group. The primary outcome was the rate of
      death at 28 days after randomization and in-hospital mortality; secondary end points include
      hemodynamic states, time to goal-achievement.

      This prospective, randomized, controlled and multi-center study was performed in 6 closed
      intensive care units (ICU) of academic tertiary hospitals. Adult patients with septic shock
      admitted to the hospitals from 2005 to 2008 were assigned to the study eligibility. Eligible
      patients were centrally randomized using sealed envelopes into one of the three groups which
      included lactate, ScvO2, and control groups. The criteria of septic shock included two of
      four criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and systolic blood pressure
      lower than 90 mmHg or decrease of systolic blood pressure more than 40 mmHg after fluid
      challenge and the clinical signs of tissue hypoperfusion, including oliguria, blood lactate
      concentration of 4 mmol/L or more and consciousness alteration. The patients were excluded if
      they meet any one of follows: an age of less than 18 years, pregnancy, an acute cerebral
      vascular event (Glasgow coma score &lt; 5), acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary
      syndrome, massive pulmonary embolism, status asthmaticus, a primary diagnosed cardiac
      dysrhythmias, contraindication to central venous catheterization, active gastrointestinal
      hemorrhage, massive intraabdominal infective focus without drainage, severe bronchopleural
      fistula, seizure, during chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, or end stage of the
      diseases.

      The protocol was approved by Institutional Ethics Committee. The informed consents were
      obtained from all patients or their legally authorized next of kin. The patients or their
      legal surrogate decision makers were informed of their right to refuse the study procedures
      at any time during the protocols were performed.

      The case report forms (CRF) were sent to each site from the principal investigator with the
      protocols, which were randomly sealed in a serial of envelopes. After patients' enrollment,
      the CRFs were filled by the attending physicians at each site according to the protocol of
      each group. End points were 28-day mortality and in-hospital mortality until 90 days. The
      demographic data, acute physiological and chronic evaluation score (APACHE) II and other data
      from patients' basic condition were recorded at enrollment day. The protocol related data
      were collected at baseline and each hour for 6 hours and then at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72
      hours. The ICU and hospital length of stay were also noted and patients were followed up to
      day 28 and discharge from hospital for mortality. The protocol implementation and data
      collection stopped when patients or their families wished to withdraw from the program or
      refuse further treatment or a patient's death.

    <description>Patients assigned to lactate group started with the resuscitation to achieve a CVP of 8 to 12 mmHg and MAP 65 to 90 mmHg. Then if ScvO2 was less than 70 percent, red cells were transfused to achieve a hematocrit of at least 30 percent. After the CVP, MAP, and hematocrit achieved the goals, dobutamine was given until the ScvO2 was 70 percent or higher. Arterial blood lactate concentration was obtained at 6 hours and try to achieve lactate clearance was &gt;30%.
Patients in the ScvO2 group received the treatment as ScvO2 directed therapy protocol for at least 6 hours and maintained for 72 hours. The protocol was the same as that of lactated directed therapy with the exception of blood lactate concentration testing.
Patients in the control group received the treatment as the same protocol for maintaining CVP and MAP in that of lactated directed therapy. ScvO2 and arterial blood lactated concentration were not necessary to obtain.</description>
