  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-grade gliomas are the commonest primary malignant brain tumours in adults, affecting
      approximately 5000 people per year in the UK. Standard treatment comprises a combination of
      surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy; however this condition remains incurable and the
      average survival is approximately 18 months from diagnosis. There are a number of reasons for
      this. Firstly these tumours are highly invasive and involve important areas of brain making
      it impossible to remove them surgically or cure them with radiotherapy. In the majority of
      cases the tumour recurs within 2 to 3cm of the original site of tumour removal. Secondly, due
      to the presence of a barrier between the bloodstream and the brain, when drugs designed to
      kill tumour cells (chemotherapy) are given intravenously or orally, they frequently do not
      reach the tumour at a sufficient dose to have a beneficial effect. As the chemotherapy dose
      has to be very high for a sufficient dose to reach the tumour, drug-related side-effects are
      common.

      Laboratory studies demonstrate that glioma tumour cells are sensitive to a number of
      different chemotherapies, including carboplatin. When given intravenously however,
      carboplatin does not reach a sufficient concentration in the tumour to have a beneficial
      effect. However, studies have shown that carboplatin can be infused directly into the brain
      at a concentration that is highly toxic to tumour cells, but not to normal brain tissue.
      Using very small tubes implanted around the tumour, the investigators are able to infuse
      carboplatin reliably and repeatedly into the area where tumours typical recur. In this study,
      the investigators intend to evaluate the safety of this approach and determine the optimal
      dose of carboplatin to administer. It is hoped that this study will also provide evidence of
      improved survival for patients with high-grade glioma.

          -  Life expectancy greater than 3 months

          -  Capacity to give informed consent

          -  Histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme. Patients with a previous history of
             a lower grade gliomas are eligible if histology at relapse confirms glioblastoma
