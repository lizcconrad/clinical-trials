  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motion style acupuncture treatment(MSAT) is a treatment method in which the patient is
      exposed to active or passive movement and exercise during acupuncture, as opposed to
      conventional acupuncture. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of MSAT in
      the treating pain and severe functional disability in acute LBP patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      58 patients with acute LBP and severe disability with an Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) of
      60% or higher were randomly allocated and divided into 2 groups. The experimental group was
      treated with MSAT and the control group was treated with intramuscular injections of
      diclofenac(NSAID). All administrations were limited to 1 session, and comparisons were made
      of measurements before and after treatment. Primary outcomes were measured by the
      NRS(numerical rating scale) of back pain in active movement. Secondary outcomes were measured
      by the NRS of radiating pain, ODI scores, and the patient's global impression of change(PGIC)
      etc. Post-treatment follow-up will be performed to measure primary and secondary outcomes
      with the exception of ROM and SLR at 2, 4, and 24 weeks after treatment.
