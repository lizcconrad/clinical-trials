  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if adding hippotherapy treatment will improve
      balance for children ages 5-17 who have disabilities such as cerebral palsy and down
      syndrome. We also want to find out if by improving their balance the children increase their
      participation in age appropriate activities.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effects of hippotherapy on the balance
      of children with developmental disorders that cause mild to moderate balance problems. The
      secondary purpose is to determine if the use of hippotherapy also improves perceived
      functional abilities and thus quality of life as measured by the pediatric balance scale and
      Activities Scale for Kids (respectively)

    <description>The Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS) is a standardized 14 item test of various component activities related to balance. It is a modified child version of the adult Berg Balance Scale. The PBS has high total score test-retest reliability of ICC (3,1) =0.998, as well as good interrater reliability (ICC(3,1) = 0.997).1</description>

    <description>Activities Scale for Kids - Participation (ASKp) is a self-administered 30 item questionaire that measures the impact of children's disability to overall function and participation within relevant environments. It correlates well with parent reports on the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (r=0.81, p&lt;0.000) and clinician observations of children's function (ICC=0.92, p&lt;0.000).</description>

    <description>Children will receive treatment by a licensed physical therapist using hippotherapy as the treatment strategy. This includes sitting on a horse who's movement is controlled by a horse leader, with the PT directing the movements required of the horse, as well as supplying supplemental cues to the participant. Alternative positions (such as sitting backward and sideways) may also be used during the treatment session.</description>
