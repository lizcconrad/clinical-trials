  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both of bortezomib and vorinostat have identified Phase II doses for pediatric and adult
      patients of which no grade 4 dose limiting toxicities have been observed in prior studies.
      The pre-clinical synergy of these 2 agents when used in combination along with the lack of
      over-riding toxicities and different mechanisms of action provide strong rationale for a
      clinical trial investigating bortezomib and vorinostat in combination. This trial will use
      the identified Phase II dose which is at or below the maximum tolerated dose for both agents
      which have very acceptable toxicity profiles and such should prove feasible and tolerable in
      this relapsed/refractory ALL population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m^2 by intravenous pyelogram (IVP) on days 1,
      4, 8, and 11, vorinostat 180 mg/m^2 by mouth (PO) per day (not to exceed 400 mg per day) days
      1-14, and dexamethasone 6 mg/m^2 PO days 4-15 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). No more than 3 treatment courses may be given.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating. The agents used in this study are known to be teratogenic to a
             fetus and there is no information on the excretion of agents into breast milk.
             Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during
             screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for surgically sterilized women.

             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (appendix VI), uncontrolled angina,
             severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute
             ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG
             abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically
             relevant.

          -  Serious concomitant medical or psychiatric disorders (e.g., active infection,
             uncontrolled diabetes) that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the
             safety of the patient or likely to interfere with participation in this clinical
             study.

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, with the
             exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after curative therapy.

          -  Patient has received investigational drugs within the 14 days before study
             registration.

          -  Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before registration. Enrollment of patients who
             require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size) should be

             date of therapy.
