      An observational clinical study will be performed in subjects aged 12-60 years old to
      describe the dynamic changes of humoral immune/cellular immunity after vaccination of
      influenza vaccine, and to discuss the role of different antibodies against influenza virus
      infection, and to look for possible factors related to side effects with the vaccine.

      A randomized clinical trial will be conducted to describe immune response of seasonal
      influenza virus vaccine in a single center in China. 200 subjects aged 18-60 years will be
      enrolled under the premise of informed consent and receive one dose of vaccine. All
      vaccinations will be done by specific study personnel, who do not take part in the assessment
      of safety or immunogenicity. Adverse events will be recorded after vaccination and blood
      samples were collected at 0,7,14,28 days for antibody detection and split vaccine
      neutralizing antibody detection, determination of cellular immune function in the same time.

      The clinical program approved by the ethics committee will be performed by the researchers
      independently. Inspectors designated by the sponsor will take meticulous on-site audits to
      ensure the safety specifications during the whole process of research.
