  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b open-label, randomized, parallel-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of 10 monthly intravesical administrations of maintenance therapy with
      valrubicin following induction with valrubicin as compared to induction with valrubicin only
      in subjects with CIS of the bladder. The randomization will be 1:1 and subjects will be
      stratified by tumor type (CIS plus papillary disease vs. CIS only) and time from last
      bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) failure (&gt;1 year vs. &lt;1 year).

                  valrubicin induction

               -  Valrubicin induction is defined as having received at least 3 of 6 weekly
                  instillations
