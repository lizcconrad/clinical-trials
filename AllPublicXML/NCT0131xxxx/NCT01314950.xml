  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a two-year randomized, controlled clinical trial to
      improve functioning among older adults with Alzheimer's disease by comparing a control group
      receiving best practices primary care with an intervention group receiving best practice
      primary care plus a home-based occupational therapy intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study builds on our findings from a previous clinical trial that demonstrated
      the effectiveness of collaborative care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease cared for
      in primary care practices. In the prior trial, we demonstrated that guideline-level medical
      care resulted in improved quality of care and improved behavioral and psychological symptoms
      over one year among patients and their caregivers. However, despite finding significant
      differences among study groups on Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores, we did not find a
      significant difference between groups in functional decline. Both study groups experienced a
      significant decline in function over 18 months. The current study proposes to test a
      home-based intervention specifically designed to slow the rate of functional decline among
      older adults with Alzheimer's disease.

      In addition to building on our past research, the study also builds from recently reported
      research which demonstrated the short-term efficacy of home-based occupational therapy
      interventions among older adults with dementia. These trials show that older adults with
      dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, can both participate in and benefit from
      occupational therapy-based interventions delivered in the home.

      The specific aim of this study is to conduct a two-year, randomized, controlled clinical
      trial to improve functioning among older adults with Alzheimer's disease by comparing a
      control group receiving best practices primary care with an intervention group receiving best
      practice primary care plus a home-based occupational therapy intervention. We will test the
      primary hypothesis that subjects with Alzheimer's disease in the intervention group will have
      improved function at two years compared with the best practice primary care control group.

    <description>An occupational therapist (OT) will deliver the home-based intervention. There are three cycles of intervention over two years, with each cycle delivering eight 60-90 minute home sessions. Cycle one takes place over 16 weeks, cycle two over 32 weeks, and cycle three over one year. Telephone calls take place in intervening weeks, with additional phone calls allowed to assist with problem solving and interval problems. At minimum, the OT will perform an assessment at the beginning of each cycle in order to tailor the home based component for individual dyads at each cycle. The OT will collaborate with the patients and caregivers to develop client centered goals with &quot;homework&quot; each week in order to encourage carryover of strategies, home environmental modifications, or home exercise programs.</description>

    <description>Collaborative care is provided by an advanced practice nurse working in collaborations with a family caregiver, the primary care physician, and geriatric medicine specialists. Caregivers complete a formal assessment of problematic behaviors to assess current symptoms and stressors, and the care manager makes recommendations based on these results and using standardized protocols. Protocols focus first on non-pharmacologic interventions. If these interventions fail, the care manager collaborates with the primary care physician and/or specialists to institute protocol-based drug therapy or other strategies. Patients and caregivers are also offered access to support groups.</description>
