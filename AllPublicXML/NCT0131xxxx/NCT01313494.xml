    <measure>Change From Baseline in COPD Symptom Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms of chronic bronchitis with respect to cough and sputum production were assessed daily by the patient and recorded in a diary. Symptoms were assessed on a 4-point scale as follows: Cough: 0: no cough; 1: mild cough (at some time during the day); 2: moderate cough (regularly during the day); 3: severe cough (never free of cough or feeling free of need to cough). Sputum production: 0: no sputum production (unnoticeable); 1: mild sputum production (noticeable as a problem); 2: moderate sputum production (frequent inconvenience); 3: severe sputum production (constant problem). Change from Baseline is reported for cough and sputum separately, and for the sum of the 2 scores (range 0 - 6).

Transitions or changes from baseline are rated from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), and summed to give a total score ranging from -9 to +9. Least squares means (LSM) are from a repeated measures ANCOVA model with treatment, baseline value, time and a treatment-by-time interaction as independent variables.</description>

    <measure>Time to Onset of Second Moderate or Severe COPD Exacerbation</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of a COPD exacerbation is defined as onset date of COPD exacerbation - date of first intake of study drug + 1 day. At least 10 days between the stop date of an exacerbation and the start date of the following exacerbation was required for these to be be considered as two separate COPD exacerbations. COPD exacerbations were categorized as follows: - Severe: Requiring hospitalization and/or leading to death; - Moderate: Requiring oral or parenteral glucocorticosteroid therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant regardless of causal relationship to study drug and regardless whether study drug has been administered. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria. A non-serious AE is any AE that does not meet the criteria above. Each AE was assessed by the Investigator as either 'related' or 'not related' to study drug.</description>

          <description>Vital capacity is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Pulmonary function testing was performed using centralized spirometry prior to taking study medication. Change from baseline over 24 weeks of treatment was calculated from a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, baseline value, time and a treatment-by-time interaction as independent variables.</description>

        <description>Vital capacity is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Pulmonary function testing was performed using centralized spirometry prior to taking study medication. Post-bronchodilator measurements were taken 30 minutes after four inhalations of 100 μg salbutamol. Change from baseline over 24 weeks of treatment was calculated from a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, baseline value, time and a treatment-by-time interaction as independent variables.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Post-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in First Six Seconds (FEV6)</title>
        <description>FEV6 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first three seconds of a forced exhalation. Pulmonary function testing was performed using centralized spirometry prior to taking study medication. Post-bronchodilator measurements were taken 30 minutes after four inhalations of 100 μg salbutamol. Change from baseline over 24 weeks of treatment was calculated from a repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, baseline value of post-bronchodilator FEV6, time and a treatment-by-time interaction as independent variables.</description>

          <description>The FEV1/FEV6 ratio represents the percentage of the volume of air expired in the first six seconds that is expelled from the lungs during the first second of a forced exhalation. Pulmonary function testing was performed using centralized spirometry prior to taking study medication. Post-bronchodilator measurements were taken 30 minutes after four inhalations of 100 μg salbutamol.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in COPD Symptom Scores</title>
        <description>Symptoms of chronic bronchitis with respect to cough and sputum production were assessed daily by the patient and recorded in a diary. Symptoms were assessed on a 4-point scale as follows: Cough: 0: no cough; 1: mild cough (at some time during the day); 2: moderate cough (regularly during the day); 3: severe cough (never free of cough or feeling free of need to cough). Sputum production: 0: no sputum production (unnoticeable); 1: mild sputum production (noticeable as a problem); 2: moderate sputum production (frequent inconvenience); 3: severe sputum production (constant problem). Change from Baseline is reported for cough and sputum separately, and for the sum of the 2 scores (range 0 - 6). Least squares means (LSM) are from a repeated measures ANCOVA model with treatment, baseline value, time and a treatment-by-time interaction as independent variables.</description>

        <description>The TDI is a recognized questionnaire to measure dyspnoea (shortness of breath) in patients with COPD. Questions from the TDI were used to assess the 3 components: &quot;change in functional impairment&quot;, &quot;change in magnitude of task&quot; and &quot;change in magnitude of effort&quot;. Transitions or changes from baseline are rated from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), and summed to give a total score ranging from -9 to +9. Least squares means (LSM) are from a repeated measures ANCOVA model with treatment, baseline value, time and a treatment-by-time interaction as independent variables.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant regardless of causal relationship to study drug and regardless whether study drug has been administered. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, is a congenital anomaly / birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria. A non-serious AE is any AE that does not meet the criteria above. Each AE was assessed by the Investigator as either 'related' or 'not related' to study drug.</description>
