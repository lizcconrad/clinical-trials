  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - African Americans have one of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes in the United States,
      and often have other medical problems related to obesity and cardiovascular disease. These
      conditions have various risk factors, including high blood sugar levels, high cholesterol
      levels, and insulin resistance. However, these risk factors have not been studied very
      closely in individuals with African ancestry, including Afro-Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa
      migrant populations. Researchers are interested in conducting a genetic study on obesity,
      adult-onset diabetes, heart disease, and other common health conditions in individuals with
      African ancestry.

      Objectives:

      - To collect genetic and non-genetic information from individuals with African ancestry to
      study common health conditions related to obesity, adult-onset diabetes, and heart disease.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who self-identify as African American, Afro-Caribbean,
      or migrants from sub Saharan Africa.

      Design:

        -  Participants will undergo a physical examination and will provide a blood sample for
           study.

        -  Participants will also answer questions about personal and family medical history and
           current lifestyle behaviors.

        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol....

      This research protocol is designed to study the genetic basis of the clustering of several
      metabolic disorders including Type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, cardiovascular diseases
      (CVD), obesity, and other related conditions in populations of the African Diaspora. This
      project takes advantage of the well-established infrastructure and success of Dr. Anne Sumner
      s NIDDK clinical protocols. The project will aim to enroll subjects from her cohorts which
      include whites, African Americans and Africans living in the United States with the goal of
      performing quantitative trait analysis using a candidate gene approach to understand the
      genetic basis of serum lipid levels, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and other metabolic
      parameters. For aim 2, we propose to perform whole exome sequencing in a subset of cases
      (n=48, 96 chromosomes) to identify both rare and common variants for multiple metabolic
      parameters. Variants identified by the exome sequencing effort and by a current sequencing
      project of six candidate lipid genes will be genotyped in the entire cohort. Overall, these
      studies will further efforts to understand if black-white differences as well as differences
      within black populations exist in the genetic basis of T2D, CVD, and obesity. Given past
      activities, it is also anticipated that this resource will form the basis of multiple
      collaborations between Dr. Rotimi s lab, several NIH intramural researchers, and non-NIH
      scientists.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will include unrelated persons who self-identify as white or African American,
        Afro-Caribbean or migrant from sub-Saharan Africa. Adults of African ancestry are
        prioritized for this study because of the paucity of genetics studies investigating the
        association of risk alleles contributing to the prevalence of T2D, CVD, obesity and other
        common conditions in this population. A small proportion of whites (less than 10%) will be
        included in this study, as they are in Dr. Sumner s ongoing projects; they will have the
        same clinical measurements obtained in the same laboratory to serve as a comparison group.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Children are excluded as these phenotypes present more commonly in adults. Attempts will be
        made to enroll an equal number of men and women. No prisoners, pregnant women or fetuses
        will be included in this study.
