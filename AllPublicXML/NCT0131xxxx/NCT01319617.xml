    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to study the safety and tolerability of SENSIMED
      Triggerfish, a soft contact lens-based device intended to continuously record relative
      changes in intraocular pressure (IOP). The investigation enrols glaucoma patients and
      glaucoma suspects. All subjects receive two 24-hour recording sessions with the device in an
      ambulatory setting and at weekly interval. The level of discomfort in the study eye after 24
      hours and side effects are the main endpoints of the investigation.

    <description>Ocular discomfort in the study eye is reported by patients on a 100-mm visual analog scale (left end 0 mm, no discomfort; right end 100 mm, very severe discomfort) as the distance from the left end to the patient's mark after wearing the device for 24 hours at two occasions separated by one week. Values for both sessions were averaged.</description>
