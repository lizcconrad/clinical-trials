    <textblock>
      Approximately 3 million individuals suffer from epilepsy in America alone and about 200,000
      new cases of epilepsy in America are diagnosed each year (Epilepsy Foundation, 2005).
      Epilepsy can be defined as a condition in which a person has recurrent, unprovoked seizures.
      Prolonged or back-to-back repetitive seizures, known as &quot;acute repetitive seizures&quot; (ARS),
      are medical emergencies. ARS can occur unexpectedly, a circumstance for which quick and
      efficient antiepileptic drugs are needed for household and prehospital use. Currently,
      benzodiazepines are the antiepileptic drug of choice when dealing with ARS because they are
      proven to be efficient and take little time to work. Benzodiazepines can be administered by
      mouth, by vein via a needle (intravenously; IV), rectally, between the cheek and gum
      (buccally), or in the nose (intranasally; IN). The nasal formulation is not yet FDA-approved.
      The rectal treatment route has been commonly used for acute seizure treatment in past years,
      but recent studies propose that the nasal route for benzodiazepines may be better overall for
      home treatment and easier to administer (see Wermeling, 2009). For many &quot;out of hospital&quot;
      situations, nasal benzodiazepines can be more convenient and more comfortable than rectal
      treatment. In addition to the above benefits, nasal benzodiazepines are rapidly absorbed by
      the blood vessels in the nose and the time of drug administration and cessation of seizures
      may thus be reduced using nasal routes. This study sets out to characterize how fast buccal
      and nasal treatments begin to work on the brain by monitoring brain waves during
      administration of the drug, and to determine whether nasal or buccal administration is best.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past out-of-hospital treatments for acute epileptic seizures have met with limited
      effectiveness, convenience, speed, and safety. The only FDA-approved treatment for acute
      repetitive seizures must be given rectally, but nasal or buccal midazolam have been shown to
      be at least as effective. The purpose of this study is to characterize the time to effect on
      brain activity of intranasal (or nasal) midazolam and compare it with buccal midazolam. This
      research will recruit patients with epilepsy who are undergoing EEG recordings for clinical
      purposes, including those with intracranial EEG. EEG will be evaluated during administration
      of buccal or nasal midazolam for augmentation of beta waves signifying action of midazolam on
      the brain, and the time to effect will be compared between buccal and nasal formulations.
      Subjects will be given a brief survey after the administration to evaluate sedation,
      discomfort and other adverse effects of the medication. This study will help characterize the
      action of nasal and buccal benzodiazepines and to determine the most effective method of
      administration.

    <description>3 mg of the standard IV solution of midazolam (5 mg/mL) was given via a metered-dose nasal sprayer (6 sprays × 0.1 ml/spray, or 6 × 0.5 mg/spray) divided between the two nostrils within 1-2 min. During the EEG, vital signs (blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate) were monitored and a nurse and a physician were available at all times. Subjects were monitored for 2 hours after administration of midazolam to ensure adequate recovery from sedation.</description>
