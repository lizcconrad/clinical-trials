  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IFN-gamma is a central player in the development of psoriasis lesions, which can be involved
      a variety of cellular processes in the skin. Dendritic cells are important cells in driving
      inflammation in psoriasis through the induction of T cells that produce IL-17 in psoriasis.
      Injecting IFN-g into the skin can increase the numbers of T cells and also inflammatory DCs
      that produce cytokines involved in IL-17 production. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that
      the dendritic cells present in the skin after IFN-g injection polarize IL-17-producing T
      cells.

    <description>All subjects will receive one intradermal injections of 0.25ml of IFN-g (Actimmune TM 100 micrograms/0.5ml), in normal appearing skin of both normal volunteers and psoriasis patients.
Blood will be taken at baseline and day 1. A skin biopsy (6mm punch) will be taken at the injection site 24 hours later.
Patients will return at one to two weeks for suture removal.
Clinical assessments done at every visit.
Patients will also be evaluated at each visit for any adverse events.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Normal volunteers with no evidence of skin disease OR diagnosis of plaque type
             psoriasis for at least 6 months

          -  18 years of age or greater

          -  For women of childbearing potential or in men whose partners may become pregnant,
             willingness to use an acceptable method of contraception to prevent pregnancy for the
             duration of the study. Acceptable methods of contraception include use of a condom;
             abstinence; use by sexual partner of oral implantable or injectable contraceptives,
             IUD, female condom, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap; or a sterile sexual
             partner

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Guttate, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis as sole or predominant form of psoriasis

          -  Clinically significant psoriasis flare during screening or on the first treatment day

          -  Hypersensitivity to IFN-g or E. coli derivatives

          -  Pre-existing, uncontrolled myelosuppression, cardiac disease, seizure disorders,
             compromised central nervous system function or multiple sclerosis

          -  History of malignancy, clinically significant renal insufficiency, poorly controlled
             medical conditions that would increase the risks

          -  Presence of malignancy within the past 5 years, including lymphoproliferative
             disorders. Subjects with a history of fully resolved basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer may be enrolled.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation. As the risk of IFN-g in pregnancy is unknown, pregnant women
             will be excluded from the study.

          -  Any medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, would jeopardize the
             subject's safety following exposure to study drug
