    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine that there is no difference in final diagnosis of
      FNA specimens without a stylet, compared to using a stylet, when examined by a skilled
      cytopathologist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a highly accurate method
      for cytologic diagnosis of malignancy and is routinely performed to diagnose and stage
      pancreatobiliary, esophageal, gastric, rectal malignancies and subepithelial gastrointestinal
      lesions. There are variations in EUS-FNA technique including the use of suction, the area of
      the lesion to target (center versus periphery), gauge of needle, and use of a stylet.

      The stylet is a metal wire which is included in the needle assembly. The use of a stylet is
      used purely for mechanical purposes, not for the protection or safety of the patients. It is
      thought that the stylet prevents the needle from becoming clogged with gastrointestinal
      epithelial cells or mucus. To our knowledge, comparing the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA
      with a stylet to the accuracy without a stylet has not been studied.

      The optimal technique for EUS-FNA has not been established. The reported accuracy rate of
      EUS-FNA (which contains heterogeneous sampling techniques, including with and without a
      stylet) is 71-98% for pancreatic masses, 90% for lymph nodes, and 67-92% for submucosal
      gastrointestinal lesions. Typically, FNA is performed with or without a stylet using a 22
      gauge or 25 gauge needle with similar diagnostic accuracy.

      When the target lesion is identified, the needle is advanced through the gastrointestinal
      wall into the lesion under ultrasound guidance. If a stylet is being used, it is removed at
      this point. A 10 cc syringe under suction is then placed on the end of the needle assembly
      and the needle is moved back and forth within the lesion to gather cells. The assembly is
      then removed and the needle contents are expelled onto slides and into preservative media.
      The stylet is then reinserted and the needle assembly is advanced through the scope for
      another pass. In the absence of on-site cytopathology, 7 passes with or without a stylet of a
      solid lesion and 5 passes of lymph nodes with or without a stylet are recommended to achieve
      high diagnostic accuracy.

      EUS-FNA is time consuming, mainly because the stylet needs to be carefully reinserted through
      the needle prior to each pass. Theoretically, the use of a stylet prevents clogging of the
      needle with gastrointestinal epithelial cells and mucus which can affect the adequacy of the
      specimen. However, there are no data to support this. As such there is a variation in
      practice patterns, with some endosonographers who routinely use a stylet and those that do
      not. Additionally, those who perform percutaneous FNA frequently do so using needles that do
      not have a stylet. A recent study suggests that the use of a stylet improves diagnostic
      accuracy in percutaneous FNA of thyroid lesions. To our knowledge, there have been no studies
      assessing the use of a stylet on tissue adequacy in EUS-guided FNA.

      If the practice of using a stylet during EUS-guided FNA is found to yield the same number of
      adequate tissue samples as those done without a stylet, then the use of a stylet would be an
      unnecessary. As stylet replacement is the most time consuming step in FNA, the time of the
      procedure could be shortened significantly if the stylet is not required.

      We propose a randomized controlled trial of EUS guided FNA with and without stylet which will
      help determine whether the use of a stylet is integral in obtaining adequate tissue aspirates
      in the diagnosis of solid lesions. To our knowledge, there have been no prospective,
      randomized studies addressing the effect of the presence or absence of a stylet on specimen
      adequacy during EUS-guided FNA.

    <description>The number of passes was determined by the lesion site and mirrored clinical practice (6 passes for pancreatic/other lesions and 4 passes for lymph nodes). The order of these passes was determined by a preprinted randomization sequence kept in an opaque sealed envelope that was opened by the research coordinator or EUS technologist after enrollment. Each participant had an equal number of passes with stylet and without stylet.
There was no communication between the endosonographer and the cytopathologist regarding the adequacy of the specimen or diagnosis until all passes had been completed. The on-site evaluation of smears was performed to assess cellular adequacy and to assess the need for any additional passes. Additional passes were made at the discretion of the endosonographer as clinically indicated but were not included in the final analysis. The cytology slides were evaluated by 3 experienced cytopathologists who were all blinded to the stylet status of the passes.</description>

    <description>There will only be one arm in this study. This arm will undergo EUS-guided FNA with the use of a stylet for half of their FNA passes and without a stylet for the other half. Patients will be exposed to an equal number of passes with and without a stylet. Each pass will be individually assessed by a skilled cytopathologist who is blinded to the technique used. We will compare the adequacy of both techniques to determine whether or not a stylet leads to a higher diagnostic accuracy rate in patients with solid lesions.</description>

    <description>If the patient agrees to enrollment in the study, the initial stage of the EUS exam will be performed in the usual manner. If a solid lesion that requires FNA is identified, an envelope will be opened which contains a computer generated randomization sequence for all passes. These sequences will be generated by a web-based program at http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm. Passes will be made based on the randomization, either with or without a stylet. Six passes (three with a stylet and three without a stylet) will be performed on solid lesions and four passes (two with and two without a stylet) will be performed on lymph nodes. Additional passes will be made at the discretion of the endosonographer as clinically indicated but will not be included in the data.</description>

        <title>Compare Adequacy of Diagnoses in Passes With and Without a Stylet</title>
        <description>The number of passes was determined by the lesion site and mirrored clinical practice (6 passes for pancreatic/other lesions and 4 passes for lymph nodes). The order of these passes was determined by a preprinted randomization sequence kept in an opaque sealed envelope that was opened by the research coordinator or EUS technologist after enrollment. Each participant had an equal number of passes with stylet and without stylet.
There was no communication between the endosonographer and the cytopathologist regarding the adequacy of the specimen or diagnosis until all passes had been completed. The on-site evaluation of smears was performed to assess cellular adequacy and to assess the need for any additional passes. Additional passes were made at the discretion of the endosonographer as clinically indicated but were not included in the final analysis. The cytology slides were evaluated by 3 experienced cytopathologists who were all blinded to the stylet status of the passes.</description>
