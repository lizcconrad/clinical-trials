  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this access protocol is to allow patients with brain tumors who had previously
      received 125I-MAB 425 to receive additional course(s) of 125I-MAB 425 until their brain tumor
      begins to grow, they develop side effects to the treatment, or their medical condition
      changes (e.g., you become pregnant, become infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      or develop another cancer).
