        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities. (Trial-related
             activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during normal
             management of the subject)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 20.0 and 27.0 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial products or related products

          -  Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as randomised

          -  Previous participation in any other clinical trial involving other investigational
             products within the last 3 months before dosing in this trial

             month preceding screening (trial start) or surgery or trauma with more than 500 mL
             blood loss within the 3 month preceding screening

          -  History of or presence of cancer, or any clinically significant cardiovascular,
             respiratory,metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, endocrine, diabetes,

             major disorders that might have impact on the trial, as judged by the Investigator
             (Trial Physician)

          -  Clinically significant abnormal haematology, biochemistry, lipids, urinalysis or
             coagulation screening tests, as judged by the Investigator (Trial Physician)

          -  Known hepatitis or known carrier of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or
             hepatitis C antibodies, or a positive result to the test for HIV (human
             immunodeficiency virus) antibodies and antigen

          -  Supine blood pressure at screening, after resting for 5 min, outside the range of
             90-140 mmHg systolic or 50-90 mmHg diastolic (excluding white-coat hypertension;
             therefore, if a repeated measurement on a second screening visit shows values within
             the range, the subject can be included in the trial) or resting heart rate outside the
             range of 40-90 bpm

          -  Clinically significant abnormal ECG (Electrocardiogram) at screening (trial start)

             urine drug screen or alcohol breath test, or consuming more than 21 units of alcohol
             per week (one unit of alcohol equals about 250 mL of beer or lager, one glass of wine,
             or 20 mL spirits)

          -  Any condition that would interfere with trial participation or evaluation of results,
             as judged by the Investigator (trial physician)

          -  Subjects with a history of deep leg vein thrombosis or with frequent appearance of
             deep leg vein thrombosis in 1st degree relatives as judged by the Investigator (trial
