    <textblock>
      Viagra (Sildenafil citrate) is an orally active selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is used for the treatment
      of erectile dysfunction (ED). Objectives:

        -  To test the efficacy of Viagra 100mg on demand vs. Viagra 100mg daily (taken either at
           bedtime or 1 hour prior to sexual intercourse) in restoring erectile function following
           radical prostatectomy.

        -  To test the safety and tolerability of Viagra 100 mg on demand vs. Viagra 100 mg daily
           after radical prostatectomy.
