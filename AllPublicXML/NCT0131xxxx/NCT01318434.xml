    <textblock>
      The main research hypothesis for this study is that, among patients with Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD) who have responded inadequately to treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs, the degree
      of improvement, as measured by the change from baseline of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale (MADRS)will be significantly greater among patients treated with EB-1010 (at the
      dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) than among those treated with placebo using the sequential
      parallel comparison design. The secondary research hypothesis for this study is that, among
      patients with MDD who have responded inadequately to treatment with SSRIs or SNRIs, the
      degree of improvement in depressive symptoms, as assessed by the MGH Cognitive and Physical
      Functioning Questionnaire (MGH CPFQ) will be significantly greater among those treated with
      EB-1010 (50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) than those treated with the SSRI paroxetine.

             initiation of any protocol required procedures.

          -  Patients must be able to understand the nature of the study, agree to comply with the
             prescribed dosage regimens, report for regularly scheduled office visits, and
             communicate to study personnel about adverse events and concomitant medication use.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode as defined by DSM-IV-TR
             criteria, based on the SCID-CT29; their major depressive episode must be deemed

          -  Patients who have reported a history for the current depressive episode of an
             inadequate response to 1 and no more than 1 adequate SSRI or SNRI treatment. An
             inadequate response is defined as less than a 50% reduction in depressive symptom
             severity, as assessed by the MGH ATRQ administered by remote, independent raters. An
             adequate trial is defined as an antidepressant treatment for at least 8 weeks duration
             at least at the minimum dose as specified in the MGH ATRQ.

          -  Patients must have a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) (whose
             score is derived from the HAM-D-28)20 score ≥ 18 during the screening phase to qualify
             for inclusion. The HAM-D-28 will be administered by the study clinicians at the
             screening and baseline visits, and by remote, independent raters during the screening
             phase at the time of the SAFER interview.

          -  Placebo non-responders are defined as those patients who failed to achieve at least a
             50% decrease in their MADRS score at visit 8 (Week 6), AND have a MADRS score of = or

             the current episode for at least 8 weeks, with the same, adequate dose over the last 4
             weeks.

          -  Between the screen and baseline visits, patients must be documented to have less than

             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 4 weeks after the
             last dose of investigational product in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is
             minimized. Adequate methods are defined as those which result in a low failure rate
             (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants,
             injectable or patch hormonal contraception, oral contraceptives, an IUD,
