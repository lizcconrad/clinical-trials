    <textblock>
      The aim of the randomized controlled trial was to test two behavioral interventions among
      job-seekers with risky drinking. The interventions differed in their theoretical background:
      Intervention A was tailored to the stage of change, and Intervention B was
      non-stage-tailored. Over 12 months, job-seekers were pro-actively screened for risky drinking
      at three job-agencies. Job-seekers with risky drinking were asked to participate in the
      study. All three groups were assessed at baseline, and 3, 6 and 15 months later. The baseline
      assessment was self-administered using handheld computers. The follow-up assessments by
      interviews on the phone, primarily. Both intervention groups received individualized computer
      generated feedback letters at baseline and 3 months later.

    <description>Based on the Trans-Theoretical Model of intentional behavior change (TTM). According to their stage of change, participants received two computer generated feedback letters on their risky drinking, stage of change, processes of change, self-efficacy, and decisional balance. The first letter included normative feedback (interpersonal comparison with other individuals in the same stage), and was sent out by mail after baseline. The second letter included normative and ipsative feedback (intrapersonal comparisons: baseline vs. 3 months later), and was sent out by mail three months later.</description>

    <description>Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Participants received two computer generated feedback letters on their risky drinking, beliefs (behavioral, normative, control), attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, intention, and they were asked to fill in a where-when-how to change plan. The first letter included normative feedback (interpersonal comparison with other women/ men), and was sent out by mail after baseline. The second letter included normative and ipsative feedback, and was sent out by mail three months later.</description>
