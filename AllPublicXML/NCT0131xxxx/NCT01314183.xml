    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the project is to examine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of utilizing
      booster sessions(periodic face-to-face follow-up appointments that take place several weeks
      or months following discharge from the supervised therapy program designed to review the
      patient's current rehabilitation program, troubleshoot any problems with the program, and
      make recommendations for program progression or modification) in the delivery of exercise
      therapy, and supplementing exercise therapy with manual therapy techniques(manually applied
      treatment techniques such as joint mobilization/manipulation, manual traction, soft tissue
      manipulations, passive stretching and range of motion). The investigators will do this in a
      randomized, multi-center, clinical trial. The investigators hypothesize that adding manual
      therapy techniques will be more clinically effective than exercise alone and that using
      booster sessions will maintain longer term clinical effects and be more cost-effective than
      not using booster sessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy (ET) is effective as the first line of treatment for reducing pain and
      disability in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), but studies show its effects diminish
      considerably over time. 'Booster' intervention sessions (periodic face-to-face follow-up
      appointments following discharge from supervised therapy designed to review and progress the
      patient's home program, troubleshoot problems with the program, etc.) have been recommended
      to make beneficial effects endure however this recommendation has not been adequately tested.
      There are also indications that manual therapy (MT), manually applied treatment techniques
      such as joint mobilization/manipulation, manual traction, soft tissue manipulations, and
      passive stretching, when combined with ET, may improve the overall effectiveness of
      rehabilitation for reducing pain and disability, and, may significantly delay or reduce the
      need for total knee arthroplastic surgery and reduce medication intake in people with knee
      OA. However, current published evidence-based treatment guidelines indicate there is not
      enough data to make a definitive recommendation regarding the use of MT with ET in
      rehabilitation programs. Therefore, the overall aim of the project is to examine the clinical
      and cost-effectiveness of utilizing booster sessions in the delivery of ET, and supplementing
      ET with MT techniques.The study will be a multi-center,randomized clinical trial, using a 2 x
      2 factorial design (factor 1 = booster vs no booster, factor 2 = ET alone vs ET + MT). Three
      hundred subjects (100 per study site) with knee OA will be randomized to one of the following
      groups: 1) ET - no booster, 2) ET - with booster, 3) MT + ET - no booster sessions, 4) MT +
      ET - with booster sessions. Clinical outcome measures (WOMAC, knee pain, global rating of
      change and performance-based measures of function) will be taken at baseline (prior to
      randomization), at the completion of the initial therapy sessions (9 weeks) and at 1 year
      follow-up. The primary endpoint for clinical outcome will be the WOMAC at 1 year.For the cost
      effectiveness analysis, the primary cost outcome will be osteoarthritis treatment costs from
      the societal perspective, which will include health system costs for implementing each
      intervention, medical/surgical costs (primary, secondary, and tertiary care costs), and
      personal costs to participants (travel, non-funded medications, time off work, and
      quality-of-life burdens). The primary effectiveness outcome measure will be quality-adjusted
      life-years (QALYs), derived using quality of life utilities from EQ-5D scores. Cost and
      effectiveness values between interventions will be compared via incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratios, yielding incremental costs per QALY gained when a given
      intervention is chosen. Secondary analyses will examine cost-effectiveness from health system
      and from patient perspectives. Cost and effectiveness data will be obtained at 1 year and 2
      year follow-ups. The 2 year follow-up will be the primary endpoint for the cost-effectiveness
      analysis.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>In the analysis, the effectiveness term will be quality adjusted life years, which is the product of the quality of life utility associated with a health state and the length of time lived in that state, summed over time. Utilities are a measure of preference for a health state and range from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). In this analysis, utilities will be derived from EQ-5D scores. The cost-effectiveness ratio (or, in this analysis, the cost-utility ratio) is the difference in cost divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life-years between intervention groups.</description>

    <description>The program starts with a 10 minute aerobic exercise warm-up (treadmill walking or stationary cycling). Subjects then perform a series of strengthening, stretching, and neuromuscular control activities which are core exercises for the program and mandatory. In addition to the above core exercises, therapists have the option to select additional optional exercise activities, based on the initial examination findings. These exercises will address strength or flexibility in the hip, and ankle if impairments are identified in the initial examination.</description>

    <description>The manual therapy (MT)techniques are maneuvers that are applied with manual force from the treating therapist. The MT techniques will include a series of accessory motion techniques, manual stretching , and soft tissue manipulation (deep massage to muscles and connective tissues associated with knee function). Core techniques include anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior tibiofemoral translations, superior-inferior and medial-lateral patellofemoral mobilizations, knee flexion and extension mobilizations that may be combined with varus-valgus stresses,medial-lateral tibial rotations, manual stretching of the quadriceps, rectus femoris, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscles, and soft tissue manipulations of the quadriceps, peri-patellar tissues, hamstring, hip adductors, and gastroc-soleus muscle groups. There are optional MT techniques for the hip, and foot and ankle joints that can be selected by the therapist based on initial examination findings.</description>

          -  exhibit uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. individuals not currently taking medication
             for hypertension whose systolic blood pressure is greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg at rest),

          -  have complaints of low back pain or other lower extremity joint pain that affects
             function at the time of recruitment,

          -  have a history of neurological disorders that would affect lower extremity function
             (stroke, peripheral neuropathy, parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, etc.),
