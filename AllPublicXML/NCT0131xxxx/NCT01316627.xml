  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a disabling condition that until recently has been largely
      ignored. Sufferers of BDD worry excessively and unreasonably about some flaw in their
      appearance that may be minimal or even nonexistent. These internalized body image distortions
      prompt sufferers to constantly check the perceived defects in mirrors, seek reassurance of
      their images from others, obtain unnecessary cosmetic and/or dermatological procedures, and
      even conduct self-surgeries. These obsessive concerns and compulsive behaviors cause
      significant emotional distress and often significantly interfere with global functioning.
      Currently, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in conjunction with psychopharmacology is the
      preferred treatment for BDD. In addition, two relatively new exposure techniques (&quot;mirror
      retraining method&quot; and &quot;crooked mirror externalization therapy&quot;) that utilize mirrors to
      exaggerate the patient's imagined defect appear to increase the benefits of CBT. However, the
      treatment efficacies of these relatively novel methods have not been rigorously tested or
      methodologically compared. Although six out of seven patients treated with crooked mirror
      externalization therapy at the Westwood Institute for Anxiety Disorders, Inc. demonstrated
      significant gains, the small sample size does not allow for any significant generalizations.
      Thus, the goals of this project are: 1) to determine the efficacy of exposure therapy that
      utilizes mirrors in the treatment of BDD, and 2) to evaluate the level of effectiveness of
      the mirror retraining method versus the crooked mirror externalization therapy. To accomplish
      these goals, each subject taking part in the study will do the following. They will go
      through an in-depth interview with the study physician, Dr. Kagan, and complete several
      clinical assessment questionnaires to confirm that they have BDD according to the Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). They will be assessed
      by the study independent evaluator and complete several paper-and-pencil tests to determine
      the severity of the BDD and if they have any cognitive difficulties. The subject will
      participate in 3 weeks of CBT with either the mirror retraining method or the crooked mirror
      externalization therapy. After the CBT, we will repeat the clinical assessment questionnaires
      and neurocognitive testing. From the difference between the before and after scores on all
      these tests, we will determine if there has been any change in the subject's BDD symptoms,
      and if so, the level of effectiveness between the mirror retraining method and the crooked
      mirror externalization therapy.

      Screening: Potential subjects who call the Westwood Institute for Anxiety Disorders, Inc.
      requesting treatment will be given details about the study by a trained research assistant.
      Any questions that potential subjects have will be addressed. If subjects are interested,
      they will be invited to be screened to determine whether they meet initial criteria for the
      study. Potential subjects will be told that all information gathered during screening is
      confidential. If a potential subject does not meet inclusion criteria, or decides not to
      participate, the screening information will be destroyed. This information is then passed to
      the study physician, Dr. Kagan, who will contact potential subjects to make an appointment
      for further evaluation. Potential subjects are encouraged to discuss their possible
      participation in this study with their physician, therapist, and/or family members. They are
      also encouraged to write down questions they would like to ask the study physician upon
      further evaluation. This screening process is done as part of the research process.

      Further Evaluation: After the initial telephone screening, potential subjects will meet with
      the principal investigator, Dr. Eda Gorbis, who will ask the subject to sign an informed
      consent form (ICF). The research procedures and treatment will be described in detail to the
      subject and any questions will be answered by the principal investigator. The ICF will be
      signed by the subject and the principal investigator, agreeing to those procedures in the
      study that are considered research, acknowledging that their participation is voluntary, and
      that they have been informed of the risks and benefits of the study. Research procedures
      include cognitive testing, standardized rating scales, and clinical assessment questionnaires
      discussed below.

      When the ICF is signed, the potential subjects will meet with the study physician, Dr. Kagan,
      for a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and physical assessment to confirm a primary
      diagnosis of BDD according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), and identify any confounding comorbidity, physical
      health, or medication issues which may or may not preclude their participation in treatment.
      According to subjects' self-report, those who are currently on medication for their BDD must
      have a regular prescribing physician who can continue prescribing their medication.

      Upon confirmation of inclusion into the study, subjects will then be given appointments for
      cognitive testing and further clinical assessments by the study independent evaluator. The
      Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for DSM-IV (M.I.N.I.; Sheehan &amp; Lecrubier et
      al., 1998) will be used to determine comorbid disorders that are excluded from the study,
      which will take approximately 45 minutes to complete. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -
      Third Edition (WAIS-III; Wechsler 1997), which is an instrument that assesses verbal and
      nonverbal intellectual functioning, will be used to determine subjects' cognitive capacity,
      and will take approximately 90-120 minutes to complete.

      Assessment Instruments: One week prior to treatment, subjects will be administered a battery
      of clinical rating scales and questionnaires to determine the severity of their BDD and any
      secondary symptoms. This same assessment battery will be given immediately following
      treatment to determine the level of efficacy of each of the two treatment groups. These
      scales include the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS), Body
      Dysmorphic Disorder Examination-Self Report (BDDE-SR), BDD Diagnostic Module (BDDDM), Y-BOCS
      Symptom Checklist, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Hamilton Rating Scale for
      Depression (Ham-D), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS), Fixity of Beliefs Questionnaire,
      Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), NIMH Global Obsessive-compulsive Scale, Brown
      Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS), Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (OCI),
      Obsessive-Compulsive Rating Scale (OCON), Fear Survey Schedule (FSS), and the Revised
      Willoughby Questionnaire. These will take approximately 90-120 minutes to complete.

      Randomization: Following assessment, subjects will be pseudo-randomized into either the
      mirror retraining treatment group or the crooked mirror treatment group. Pseudo-randomization
      means that subjects will first be assigned to one of the two groups randomly, then group
      membership will be remixed if needed to assure that there is no significant between-group
      difference in pretreatment BDD-YBOCS scores. If possible, groups will also be matched for age
      and gender.

      Intensive Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: After subjects complete the pre-treatment
      assessments, the study therapist will meet with participants to design their treatment
      program. Treatment will be conducted every day for 15 days, Monday through Friday, for
      90-minute sessions. In addition, as a part of therapy, subjects will complete homework
      assignments daily. Intensive CBT for BDD is done in the form of Exposure and Response
      Prevention (ERP) with either the mirror retraining method or the crooked mirror
      externalization therapy. This involves prolonged and repeated exposures to images of the
      perceived defects, and prevention of ritualistic behavior (e.g., camouflaging with cosmetics,
      skin-picking, etc.).

    <description>Of recent, the &quot;crooked mirror&quot; externalization therapy, developed by Dr. Eda Gorbis, has been put to use with much success (Gorbis 2004). This method involves the use of crooked or &quot;fun house&quot; mirrors made from highly reflective surfaces that can be bent in different directions, which distort and exaggerate the patient's perceived defects (Gorbis 2005). In turn, this process externalizes or reverses the patient's internalized distorted body image, and allows the patient to habituate to the reflection of the imagined defect that is even more distorted than the internalized image (Rosen et al. 1995).</description>

    <description>In treating BDD, the cognitive-behavioral technique, &quot;mirror retraining,&quot; uses ordinary and/or magnifying mirrors to amplify the supposed defect, which teaches patients to see their appearance in a more holistic way. Since BDD patients tend to only focus on their perceived flaws when looking in the mirror, and tend to think about their flaws in negative terms, in mirror retraining, patients learn how to change their negative evaluations of their appearance into more objective and nonjudgmental descriptions. Generally, this method is designed to intentionally exaggerate anxiety regarding appearance concerns through exposures with mirrors. However, using exclusively ordinary and/or magnifying mirrors does not address the internal distorted image that many patients with BDD experience (Rosen et al. 1995, Osman et al. 2004, Veale 2004).</description>
