    <description>Liposomal amikacin for inhalation is provided as a sterile aqueous liposomal dispersion for inhalation via nebulization.
590 mg of liposomal amikacin for inhalation is administered once daily using the PARI Investigational eFlow® Nebulizer.
Administration time is approximately 13 minutes.
Liposomal amikacin for inhalation will be administered for 84 days in the double-blind, randomized portion of the study.
Subjects can continue with 84 additional days of dosing in the open label extension.</description>

             positive cultures in the prior 2 years, of which at least one was obtained in the 6
             months prior to screening).

          3. Positive sputum culture obtained at screening visit with either Mycobacterium avium
             complex or Mycobacterium abscessus or mixed infection with one dominant species.

          4. Receiving ATS/IDSA guidelines-based treatment regimen defined as: adherent to a

             mycobacterial cultures.

          5. Ability to produce at least 3 mL of sputum or be willing to undergo an induction that
             produces at least 3 mL of sputum for clinical evaluation.

          6. Female of childbearing potential agrees to practice an acceptable method of birth
             control (e.g., abstinence, hormonal or barrier methods, partner sterilization, or
             IUD).

             The QTc criteria for Exclusion is QTc&gt; 450 msec for males or QTc&gt; 470 msec for
             females.

          3. Subjects with hemoptysis of ≥60 mL in a 24 hour period within 4 weeks prior to
             screening.

          4. Active pulmonary malignancy (primary or metastatic) or any malignancy requiring
             chemotherapy or radiation therapy within one year prior to screening or anticipated
             during the study period.

          5. Active allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis or any other condition requiring systemic
             steroids at a dose ≥ equivalent of 10 mg/day of prednisone within 3 months prior to
             screening or anticipated during the study period.

          6. Pulmonary tuberculosis requiring treatment or treated within 2 years prior to
             screening.

          7. History of lung transplantation.

          8. Hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides.

          9. Any change in chronic NTM multi-drug regimen within 28 days prior to Study Day 1.

         10. Evidence of biliary cirrhosis with portal hypertension.

         11. History of daily, continuous oxygen supplementation.

         12. Smoking tobacco or any substance within 6 months prior to screening or anticipated
             inability to refrain from smoking throughout the study.
