  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical teaching suggests allopurinol should not be initiated in the setting of an acute
      attack of gout, as rapid lowering of serum urate may exacerbate the attack. This study tests
      the hypothesis that there is no difference in patient reported daily pain or flair
      occurrences with early versus delayed institution of allopurinol during an acute gout attack.

      Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Setting: Outpatient clinics,
      White River Junction Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

      Patients: 57 men with crystal proven acute gout attack, at first medical contact, and within
      7 days onset.

      Intervention: Subjects were randomized to receive allopurinol 300mg daily or matching placebo
      for 10 days. All patients received indomethacin 50mg TID for 10 days, prophylactic dose
      colchicine 0.6mg BID for 90 days, and open-label allopurinol starting at day 11.

      Measurements: Primary outcomes were patient reported pain on visual analogue scale (VAS) for
      the primary joint, and self reported flares in any joint days 1-30. Secondary endpoints
      included urate, sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein levels.
