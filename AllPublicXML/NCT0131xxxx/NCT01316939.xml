  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      two doses (500 mg once daily and 500 mg twice daily) of GSK1605786A in maintaining remission
      over 52 weeks in adult subjects with Crohn's disease. Efficacy will be assessed by the
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score. Eligible subjects will have achieved response
      (CDAI decrease of at least 100 points) and/or remission (CDAI less than 150) in a prior GSK
      sponsored induction study. The primary endpoint will be proportion of subjects in remission
      at both Weeks 28 and 52. Safety will be assessed by recording of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory parameters including liver function tests, vital signs and electrocardiogram.
      Population pharmacokinetics will evaluate the two doses of GSK1605786A. Health outcomes
      assessments will include changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), SF-36v2,
      EQ-5D, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment - Crohn's Disease (WPAI-CD) and disability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel group study in
      adult subjects with Crohn's disease who previously achieved clinical response (CDAI decrease
      of at least 100 points) and/or remission (CDAI less than 150) in a prior Phase III induction
      study (Study CCX114151 or another GSK sponsored induction study). Subjects will be randomised
      to 52 weeks of oral treatment with GSK1605786A 500 mg once daily or 500 mg twice daily or
      placebo. Subjects who are receiving concomitant corticosteroids at entry will undergo dose
      tapering following a defined schedule. Subjects who complete the treatment period may be
      eligible to enter an open-label extension study. Subjects who experience disease worsening
      and require additional (rescue) treatment will be withdrawn and may be eligible to enter the
      open-label study. Subjects who do not enter the open-label study must complete a follow-up
      assessment 4 weeks after completion of treatment. Approximately 756 subjects will be
      enrolled.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response (CDAI Decrease &gt;=100 Points) at Both Weeks 28 and 52 of the 52-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Clinical response is defined as a reduction from the induction study baseline CDAI score of &gt;=100 points. The percentage of participants with a clinical response at both Weeks 28 and 52 of the 52-week maintenance treatment period in the ITT population using the no effect imputation for missing data were to be compared between each GSK1605786A dose group and placebo using Fisher’s exact test. Participants with missing CDAI scores were to be considered non-responders according to the missing=no effect imputation. The limited data resulting from early termination of Study CCX114157 did not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of GSK1605786A in the maintenance of clinical remission in participants with Crohn’s disease.</description>

          <description>Vital sign assessments included SBP and DBP collected in supine position following 5 minutes of rest. Assessments were carried out at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52 and Week 56. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at the time of assessment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vital Sign Heart Rate Upto Week 56</title>
        <description>Vital sign assessment included heart rate collected in supine position following 5 minutes of rest. Assessments were carried out at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52 and 56. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at the time of assessment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form – 36 Version 2 (SF-36 v2) at Weeks 28 and 52</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 health survey is a self-administered, generic, 36-item questionnaire designed to measure 8 domains of functional health status and well-being: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each domain is scored from 0 (poorer health) to 100 (better health). SF-36 v2 items are scored such that a higher score indicates a better health state and better functioning. Data for change from Baseline in SF-36 v2 at Weeks 28 and 52 was not collected following early termination of this study. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at the time of assessment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity &amp; Activity Impairment – Crohn’s Disease (WPAI-CD) at Weeks 28 and 52</title>
        <description>WPAI measures the effect of your CD on your ability to work and perform regular activities. 6-items assess impairment in work productivity and daily activity during the 7 days before the assessment. It measures the percentage of overall impairment in work productivity and daily activity due to CD. A WPAI score of 0% = no impairment and a score of 100% = total loss of work productivity or activity. An absolute change in WPAI score of 7% is considered the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Data for change from Baseline in WPAI-CD at Weeks 28 and 52 was not collected following early termination of this study. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at the time of assessment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health-related Resource Utilization at Weeks 28 and 52</title>
        <description>Healthcare related resource utilization was to include: Hospitalizations (all cause and Crohn’s disease related), Length of stay, Surgical procedures (all cause and Crohn’s disease related), Outpatient visits (all cause and Crohn’s disease related ). The frequency of hospitalizations, surgical procedures and hospital out-patient visits were to be recorded at Weeks 28 and 52. The number and percentage of participants reporting all cause and Crohn’s disease -related hospitalizations, surgeries, and hospital out-patient visits were to be summarized and compared between each GSK1605786A dose group and placebo using Fisher’s exact test. Data for Change from Baseline in health-related resource utilization at Weeks 28 and 52 was not collected following early termination of this study. Baseline was defined as value at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-randomization value at the time of assessment.</description>
