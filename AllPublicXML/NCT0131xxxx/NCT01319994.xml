  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to current estimates, nearly 1% of the general population is treated with long-term
      glucocorticoids. Chronic hypercortisolism leads to a phenotype that resembles the metabolic
      syndrome. The investigators have shown that inhibition of adenosine-monophosphate-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK) activity in adipose tissue plays a role in corticosteroid-mediated
      insulin resistance. Metformin, one of the mainstay therapies for type 2 diabetes, is a known
      activator of AMPK, which mediates its beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. The
      investigators have shown in an animal model that metformin - via altering AMPK activity -
      prevents the development of the metabolic complications of glucocorticoid excess, and the
      investigators wish to confirm this in a human study. The aim of this prospective, randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to investigate the effect of metformin treatment on
      metabolic parameters in patients on long-term high-dose glucocorticoids. The study is part of
      the investigators translational project and could rapidly lead to immediate patient benefit,
      improving quality of life and reducing health care costs for the NHS.

      2 Study Aims and Objectives To investigate the effect of metformin treatment on metabolic
      parameters in patients with long-term high dose GCs.

      3 Study Design 3.1 General Design We will recruit patients (18-75y) with excess
      glucocorticoids either because they have Cushing's syndrome or they have inflammatory
      conditions requiring GC treatment (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell
      arteritis/polymyalgia rheumatica) into a pilot, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial. These patients will be treated with metformin to prevent or reverse their metabolic
      complications. Prevention algorithm: Patients who are about to start GC treatment predictably
      for ≥12w at a ≥10mg/d prednisolone (or equivalent) dose who consent to participate in this
      study will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo (20 patients/group, see power
      calculations) or metformin at the maximum tolerated dose with a minimum of 850 mg bd for 12w.
      Treatment algorithm: Consenting patients already on long-term GC treatment (≥4w, ≥20mg/d) who
      are expected to continue for at least 12w at ≥10mg/d prednisolone will be randomly assigned
      to receive either placebo or metformin for 12w. In both algorithms, metformin treatment will
      be started gradually (as standard practice) to avoid gastrointestinal side effects and the
      full dose will be reached by day 10. Patients will have a full clinical assessment before the
      start of the metformin treatment and at the end of the 12w treatment period. Anthropometric
      and biochemical parameters and questionnaires will be repeated at 4 and 8 weeks.

      Patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome will be randomly assigned to receive either
      placebo (10 patients/group) or metformin at the maximum tolerated dose with a minimum of 850
      mg bd for 4 weeks. Patients will have a full clinical assessment before the start of the
      metformin treatment and at the end of the 4w treatment period.
