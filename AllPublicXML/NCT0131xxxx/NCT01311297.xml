  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single- center prospective observational study. This study evaluates different aspects of
      endothelial function. It investigates the endothelial leakage with the venous occlusion
      plethysmography and the flow-mediated vasodilatation by ischaemia reperfusion testing.
