    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a serious health problem that has increased dramatically
      worldwide due to the high and increasing prevalence of obesity. Medical management of T2DM is
      of limited success. Because not well controlled T2DM patients are in high risk of blindness,
      cardiovascular accident and end staged disease, T2DM has become a major health burden for
      society. Recent data on the relative effectiveness of gastrointestinal metabolic surgery
      played as bariatric surgery in the remission of T2DM, suggests that it may be significantly
      more effective than current medical treatment. In considering that less than half of the T2DM
      patients can achieve satisfactory treatment goal under current medical treatment,
      gastrointestinal metabolic surgery shall play an important role in T2DM treatment in the
      future. However, the indication for metabolic surgery and clinical predictors of success are
      not clear now. These clinical predictors can help us to choose appropriate not-well
      controlled T2DM patients to receive metabolic surgery and reduce dverse health outcomes in
      those patients.

      The present research proposal is designed to assess the clinical predictors of success in
      T2DM patients who receive metabolic surgery for the treatment of their diabetes. This study
      will recruit 200 obese T2DM patients who receive gastrointestinal metabolic surgery in our
      center and follow up them for one year. The Inclusion criteria are those with T2DM more than
      6 months, age between 18 to 65 and HbA1C &gt; 8%. All the pre-operative clinical parameters will
      be collected prospectively, including C-peptide and stimulated C-peptide. The genetic
      polymorphism of these patients will also be analyzed and collected. The success of T2DM
      remission will be assessed at 12 months after metabolic surgery will be composite endpoint of
      CVD risk factor resolution; specifically, the proportion of patients with HbA1c &lt; 6.5%. The
      clinical predictors will be analyzed by uni-vriate and muti-variate analysis. In the first
      year project, we will included 100 patients and will include another 100 patients at the
      second year. This project will apply for the budget of 1st year.
