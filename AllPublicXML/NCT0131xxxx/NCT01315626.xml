      A study of an educational intervention of primary care practice physicians to assist in the
      identification of patients who have Bronchiectasis and to assess the effectiveness of the
      specific didactic educational intervention targeting primary care physicians in the
      recognition of Bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study will be conducted for the purpose of evaluating an educational intervention
      (Description in Appendix A). As part of the educational intervention, primary care
      physician(s) will be trained in the use of an algorithm to guide assessment of patients seen
      with a respiratory chief complaint, and who have not previously been identified as having a
      diagnosis of BE. We propose an evaluation of three primary care practice(s) to compare the
      number of patients identified in three three-month periods as having a diagnosis of BE.

      The evaluation periods will be as follows: Period 1) the three-month period immediately
      following the intervention, Period 2) the three-month period immediately preceding the
      intervention, Period 3) the three month period starting one year prior to the intervention.

    <description>3 months immediately before the education event. Charts of patients with a primary respiratory complaint will be reviewed so evaluate if they 1) have experienced 3 or more suppurative respiratory infections and 2) have required 3 or more courses of antibiotic therapy for respiratory infection over the period of one year. 4) Whether or not they underwent a HRCT, and if so, and 5) Were the patients diagnosed with BE.</description>

    <description>3 months immediately after the education event. An active assessment will be preformed as per the proposed diagnostic algorithm (attachment B) Patients that meet all criteria in the algorithm are considered at risk for bronchiectasis and based on these criteria, physicians will be encouraged to order HRCT, and the number/ proportion of patients identified with BE will be noted and compared to the other time periods.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Seasonal prior year</arm_group_label>
    <description>As respiratory illnesses are commonly seasonal, an assessment of rate of Bronchiectasis diagnosis during the months of Period 2 in the year prior to the educational intervention will also be assessed as described in Period 1</description>

    <description>The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of primary care physicians in diagnosing BE and evaluate the impact of an educational intervention targeting those primary care physicians and providing instruction in the recognition and treatment of BE. The hope is that a better understanding of the disease will result in more accurate diagnoses and ultimately in more appropriate care for these patients. In addition to better care for patients, earlier recognition of bronchiectasis may result in a decrease in health care costs.</description>
