  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensoril - Extracts of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha in Ayurvedic Medicine) have shown
      potent anti-stress, cortisol lowering, GABAergic, serotonergic and antioxidant properties in
      animal and human studies. Furthermore, controlled, single site human studies have shown the
      anxiolytic potential of WS extracts.The present study is a Phase II Double-Blind, Parallel
      Group, Randomized, Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial of Sensoril® for Patients with
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy
      and safety of Sensoril® for patients with moderate or greater severity of symptoms associated
      with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

      The Primary Efficacy endpoint in this study will be determined by a statistically
      significantly greater improvement from baseline to endpoint in total Hamilton Anxiety Scale
      scores in the Sensoril® treated group versus those receiving placebo.

      The secondary endpoints in this study will assess if Sensoril® treatment rather than placebo
      results in:

        1. Greater response rates (≥ 50% improvement in HAM-A total scores from baseline to last
           value)

        2. Greater remission rates (HAM-A total scores ≤ 7) at week 8

        3. Greater improvement from baseline to week 8 in HAM -A psychic and somatic anxiety
           cluster scores.

        4. Greater improvements on CGI - severity scores from baseline to last value.

        5. A higher percentage of subjects rated as &quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; on the
           CGI - Improvement subscale at the last value.

        6. Serum cortisol and DHEA-S levels will be assessed between the two treatment groups.
           These biomarkers are indices of stress and it is hypothesized that improvement in levels
           of these stress indices will favor the Sensoril® treated group.

      Exploratory Endpoint

      1. Patient reported outcomes for sleep and calmness will be assessed between the two
      treatments.

      Safety Endpoint

      The safety endpoints will be determined by assessments of adverse and serious adverse events,
      physical examination, vital signs, EKG, and clinical laboratory measures. Clinical measures
      with laboratory defined reference ranges and vital signs will be assessed.
