    <textblock>
      This study will include patients with previously treated systemic relapsed or refractory
      light-chain (AL) amyloidosis who require further therapy and will be aimed at determining the
      safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose of IXAZOMIB
      administered orally.

    <description>Patients will receive escalating doses of MLN9708 orally on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. If there is no hematologic response after completion of 3 cycles, dexamethasone will be added on Days 1 to 4 of every cycle beginning with Cycle 4. If there is no hematologic response after the completion of 6 cycles, patients will discontinue therapy.</description>
