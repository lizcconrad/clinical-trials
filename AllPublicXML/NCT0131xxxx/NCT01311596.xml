    <textblock>
      This cohort observation, randomized controlled trial is intended to provide data that icons
      and non-verbal communication improve communication and cooperation with children with
      Autism/communication delay and aid in the transition to an unfamiliar environment. It would
      lay the foundation for future studies and practices of using icons and pictures for the whole
      office visit to enhance communication between the patient and physician/nurse/medical staff
      and cooperation of the patient.

        1. Use icons during triage/check in process to decrease time and increase patient
           compliance. Compare typical children to those with Autism/communication delay.

        2. Use icons during blood draw to improve communication with patients, to help with patient
           understanding, and increase patient cooperation and decrease noise and length of
           procedure.

        Children who are established patients, 4-18 years old, and present to the
        NeuroDevelopmental Science Center for a follow-up office visit during the study period,
        since a diagnosis will be available at the time of the study (patients in the lab study may
        be new patients if they have a diagnosis at the time their lab work is prescribed). The
        NeuroDevelopmental Science Center at Akron Children's Hospital provides nearly 25,000
        visits annually to children and youth affected by neurological, developmental, and
        behavioral disorders. This includes children with autism, intellectual disabilities,
        physical disabilities, learning disabilities, epilepsy and other neurological conditions.
