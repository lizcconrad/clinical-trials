      The goal of this study is to address the effectiveness of a modified cavity prevention
      protocol for 5-9 year-old children which emphasizes better diet modification, more frequent
      professional fluoride applications, and xylitol product usage based on individual risk status
      in a 1-year randomized controlled clinical trial in the University of California, San
      Francisco (UCSF) Tenderloin Community Pediatric Dental Clinic. The investigators hypothesize
      that the regimen will help to reduce new cavities in children who are at risk for dental
      cavities.
