  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the factors that are associated with improved
      cardiovascular function with the use of CPAP therapy on subjects diagnosed with moderate to
      severe obstructive sleep apnea.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will monitor non-invasively changes in arterial stiffness, cardiac mass, pulmonary
      pressures, endothelial function, etc. We will also assess the reversibility of these changes
      after only 5-7 days of not using the CPAP mask. In a subgroup of subjects we will explore
      changes in coronary flow response after 12 weeks of CPAP use compared with baseline.

    <measure>Changes in coronary artery flow under a cold pressor test</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A subset of subjects with abnormal endothelial function determined during the baseline scan and good echocardiographic images will be invited to participate on this portion of the test. We will record the response to a cold pressor test (submerging their hand in ice water for 1.5 minutes) on left anterior descending coronary artery velocities with transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and after 12 weeks of CPAP therapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects na√Øve of CPAP therapy just recently diagnosed with moderate to severe
             obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The degree of OSA is defined by results of a
             comprehensive polysomnogram requiring an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) &gt;15 events/hour
             and Epworth score &gt;10, or an AHI &gt;20 events/hour

          -  either sex

          -  any race

          -  between 21-50 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg

          -  Changes in antihypertensive medications in the last 6 weeks

          -  Restless leg syndrome

          -  Average overnight oxygen saturation below 80%

          -  Current use of beta-blockers

          -  History of coronary artery disease

          -  History of Stroke

          -  Atrial fibrillation

          -  Peripheral vascular disease

          -  Suspected cardiac valve abnormality

          -  Ejection fraction &lt;50%

          -  Type I and type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM)

          -  Asthma or confirmed Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

          -  Cigarette smoking in the last 6 months

          -  Raynaud's disease

          -  Pregnancy (the normal hormonal changes that occur in pregnancy affect greatly arterial
             stiffness parameters) If a subject becomes pregnant we will discontinue data
             collection.

          -  Physically incapable of resting on left lateral decubitus for 40 minutes.

          -  Mastectomy with lymph node removal that might preclude us to monitor blood pressures
             on both arms
