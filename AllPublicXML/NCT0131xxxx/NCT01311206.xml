    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to assess the efficacy of an eight-week, efficient
      and tolerable, low-intensity resistance-training program with concurrent application of
      partial blood flow restriction (PBFR) for improving quadriceps strength and volume in women
      with risk factors for incident symptomatic or progressive knee OA. This specific aim will be
      achieved through a randomized, controlled trial, comparing low intensity training with and
      without PBFR. There have been numerous reports of exercise interventions in people with knee
      osteoarthritis. However, this research is novel in that it will be the first to use a low
      intensity regimen that will minimize forces on the knee while still having the potential to
      lead to clinically meaningful strength gains in older adults with risk factors for incident
      symptomatic or progressive knee OA.

    <description>Partial Blood Flow Restriction (PBFR) Low-Intensity Exercise: using the Biodex 3 Dynamometer in isotonic mode at 10% (first 3 weeks), 15% (following 3 weeks) and 20% (final 3 weeks) of their 1RM for each side, while receiving PBFR in each exercising limb. The padded belts (65 mm in width and 650 mm in length) of the Kaatsu Master™ PBFR device (Sato Sports Plaza, Tokyo, Japan) will be applied to the proximal thigh as near to the hip joint as is comfortable. Before training each leg, subjects will be seated in a chair where an initial belt pressure of 37-40 mmHg will be applied. The belt then will be iteratively pressurized for 30 seconds and then relaxed for 10 seconds in increments of 20 mmHg from 100 mmHg to the final pressure of 160 mmHg. During exercise, the cuff pressure will be continuously controlled and monitored by the PBFR apparatus</description>
