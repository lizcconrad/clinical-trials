      Hypothesis: General anesthesia as compared to intrathecal (i.e. spinal anesthesia) anesthesia
      will result in shorter length of hospital stay for patients undergoing total knee
      arthroplasty.

      Primary endpoint: time from end of surgery until the patient is &quot;street ready&quot;

      Secondary endpoints: will general anesthesia produce less postoperative pain as compared to
      intrathecal anesthesia? Is there any difference in post operative &quot;dizziness&quot; between the
      groups.

      Hypothesis: General anaesthesia compared to intrathecal anaesthesia will give shorter length
      of hospital stay (LOS) for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

      Primary endpoint: time from end of surgery until the patient meets the discharge criteria.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Will general anesthesia produce less post operative pain?

        2. Is there any difference in post operative orthostatic function (dizziness) between the
           groups?

        3. Time until the patient meets the discharge criteria from PACU

        4. How many patients will need at least one urinary bladder catheterization?

    <description>Pain will be measured using a visual analogue scale. The patient's own evaluation (questionnaires about quality of life and knee function)
Time of post-op department, total time in hospital.
Evaluation of patient outcomes, clinical and radiographic evaluation will be done before surgery, after surgery, and after 3 months, after 1year
Data collection will be done through normal medical records and patient evaluations collected in a separate file in the clinic. Data is collected and processed by the Research Unit at the orthopedic clinic in Hässleholm.</description>
