  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study to assess if vibegron (MK-4618) reduces the number of daily urinations
      more effectively than placebo in participants with overactive bladder (OAB). The primary
      hypothesis of the base study is that administration of vibegron demonstrates a dose-related
      reduction, compared with placebo, in average number of daily micturitions in participants
      with OAB after 8 weeks of treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants received placebo (run-in) for 1 week prior to randomization to Parts 1 and
      2. Participants who complete the base study may be screened for a year-long, multicenter
      extension for assessment of long-term safety and efficacy.

    <measure>Base Study/Part 1: Change From Baseline in Average Daily Micturitions at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were required to keep a voiding diary, recording the occurrence of each micturition. The average daily number of micturitions was calculated as the total number of micturitions that occurred over a week (4 to 10 days) during the Base Study, divided by the total number of days of voiding kept in the participant's diary. Baseline was defined as the average daily number of daily micturitions that occurred during the week of placebo run-in prior to Week 0 visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were required to keep a voiding diary, recording the occurrence of each total incontinence episode. The average daily number of total incontinence episodes was calculated as the total number of times a participant experienced such an episode over a week (4 to 10 days) during the Base Study, divided by the total number of days of voiding kept in the participant's diary.

        <title>Base Study/Part 1: Change From Baseline in Number of Urge Incontinence Episodes at Week 8</title>
        <description>Participants were required to keep a voiding diary, recording the occurrence of each total incontinence episode. The average daily number of total incontinence episodes was calculated as the total number of times a participant experienced such an episode over a week (4 to 10 days) during the Base Study, divided by the total number of days of voiding kept in the participant's diary. Baseline was defined as the average daily number of total incontinence episodes that occurred during the week of placebo run-in prior to Week 0 visit.</description>

        <title>Base Study/Part 1: Change From Baseline in Average Daily Number of Strong Urge Episodes at Week 8</title>
        <description>Participants were required to keep a voiding diary, recording the occurrence of each strong urge episode. The average daily number of strong urge episodes was calculated as the total number of times a participant experienced such an episode over a week (4 to 10 days) during the Base Study, divided by the total number of days of voiding kept in the participant's diary. Baseline was defined as the average daily number of strong urge episodes that occurred during the week of placebo run-in prior to Week 0 visit.</description>

        <title>Extension Study: Change From Baseline in Average Daily Number of Urge Incontinence Episodes at Week 52</title>
        <description>Participants were required to keep a voiding diary, recording the occurrence of each urge incontinence episode. The average daily number of urge incontinence episodes was calculated as the total number of times a participant experienced such an episode during 52-week Extension Study, divided by the total number of days of voiding kept in the participant's diary. Baseline was defined as the value at Week 0 of the Base Study.</description>
