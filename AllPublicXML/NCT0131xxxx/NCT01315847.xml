  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the receptor occupancy (RO) associated with
      telcagepant (MK-0974) administration based on displacement of [11C]MK-4232 from the CGRP
      receptors in the brain using PET. The study enrolled healthy participants (Part I) and
      migraine patients (Part III). Due to a protocol amendment, study Part II was not conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the 1120 mg (i.e., maximal) telcagepant dose, [11C]MK-4232 was administered and PET scan
      was started ~3 hours post telcagepant to coincide with the Tmax of the 1120 mg dose. For the
      140 mg (i.e., therapeutic) telcagepant dose, [11C]MK-4232 was administered and PET scan was
      started ~2 hours post telcagepant to correspond with the timing of clinical efficacy
      measurements of telcagepant for migraine treatment in Phase III studies.

    <description>Any AEs occurring among participants (all were healthy subjects) in Part I of study were recorded. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated with study drug administration, whether or not considered related to the study drug.

    <measure>Brain Calcitonin Gene-related Peptide (CGRP) Receptor Occupancy (RO) Post Telcagepant Obtained by PET Imaging Using [11C]MK-4232 Tracer at Baseline and After a Maximum Dose of Telcagepant (1120 mg) in Healthy Participants (Part I, Period 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Part I Baseline, at ~0-90 minutes after [11C]MK-4232 dose; and Part I, Period 1 post telcagepant, at ~0-90 minutes after [11C]MK-4232 dose</time_frame>
    <description>Brain CGRP RO post telcagepant was determined by change in [11C]MK-4232 PET tracer biokinetics at baseline and post telcagepant administration. Using PET brain images acquired over ~0-90 minutes after [11C]MK-4232 dose, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn throughout cerebral cortex and white matter, striatum, thalamus, cerebellum and pons. The ROIs were projected onto all frames of the dynamic PET scans in order to generate [11C]MK-4232 tissue time-activity curves (TACs). Serial arterial blood samples for measurement of plasma radioactivity and [11C]MK-4232 concentrations were collected during the PET scans. These samples provided the arterial input function for a two-tissue compartmental model of [11C]MK-4232 tracer biokinetics. Total volume of distribution (VT), an index of receptor density, was estimated by fitting the two-tissue compartmental model to the PET [11C]MK-4232 TACs. Change in VT between baseline and post telcagepant PET studies was used to quantify the brain CGRP RO.</description>

          <description>Baseline positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain using [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 megabecquerel [MBq]) was performed in healthy participants; this PET data served as the baseline for both Period 1 and 2 of Part I. Subsequently in study Part I, Period 1 the healthy participants received a single 1120 mg dose of telcagepant followed by PET imaging of brain with [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) beginning ~3 hours post telcagepant dose. In Part I, Period 2 the healthy participants received a single 140 mg dose of telcagepant followed by PET imaging of brain with [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) beginning ~2 hours post telcagepant dose.</description>

          <description>In study Part III, Period 1 baseline PET imaging of the brain using [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) was performed in participants with migraine during a migraine attack (ictal phase). Later in Part III, Period 1 the participants with an ongoing migraine attack (ictal phase) received a single 140 mg dose of telcagepant followed by PET imaging of brain with [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) beginning ~2 hours post telcagepant dose. In Part III, Period 2 baseline PET imaging of the brain using [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) was performed in participants with migraine, however, without a migraine attack ongoing (interictal phase). Later in Part III, Period 2 participants with migraine without a migraine attack ongoing (interictal phase) received a single 140 mg dose of telcagepant followed by PET imaging of brain with [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) beginning ~2 hours post telcagepant dose.</description>

            <description>In study Part III, Period 1 baseline PET imaging of the brain using [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) was performed in participants with migraine during a migraine attack (ictal phase). Later in Part III, Period 1 the participants with an ongoing migraine attack (ictal phase) received a single 140 mg dose of telcagepant followed by PET imaging of brain with [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) beginning ~2 hours post telcagepant dose. In Part III, Period 2 baseline PET imaging of the brain using [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) was performed in participants with migraine, however, without a migraine attack ongoing (interictal phase). Later in Part III, Period 2 participants with migraine without a migraine attack ongoing (interictal phase) received a single 140 mg dose of telcagepant followed by PET imaging of brain with [11C]MK-4232 tracer (~300 MBq) beginning ~2 hours post telcagepant dose.</description>

          <description>Any AEs occurring among participants (all were migraine patients) in Part III of study were recorded. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated with study drug administration, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the administration of the study drug, was also an AE.</description>

        <title>Brain Calcitonin Gene-related Peptide (CGRP) Receptor Occupancy (RO) Post Telcagepant Obtained by PET Imaging Using [11C]MK-4232 Tracer at Baseline and After a Maximum Dose of Telcagepant (1120 mg) in Healthy Participants (Part I, Period 1)</title>
        <description>Brain CGRP RO post telcagepant was determined by change in [11C]MK-4232 PET tracer biokinetics at baseline and post telcagepant administration. Using PET brain images acquired over ~0-90 minutes after [11C]MK-4232 dose, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn throughout cerebral cortex and white matter, striatum, thalamus, cerebellum and pons. The ROIs were projected onto all frames of the dynamic PET scans in order to generate [11C]MK-4232 tissue time-activity curves (TACs). Serial arterial blood samples for measurement of plasma radioactivity and [11C]MK-4232 concentrations were collected during the PET scans. These samples provided the arterial input function for a two-tissue compartmental model of [11C]MK-4232 tracer biokinetics. Total volume of distribution (VT), an index of receptor density, was estimated by fitting the two-tissue compartmental model to the PET [11C]MK-4232 TACs. Change in VT between baseline and post telcagepant PET studies was used to quantify the brain CGRP RO.</description>

        <title>Brain CGRP RO Post Telcagepant Obtained by PET Imaging Using [11C]MK-4232 Tracer at Baseline and After a Therapeutic Dose of Telcagepant (140 mg) in Participants With Migraine During a Migraine Attack (Ictal Phase)(Part III, Period 1)</title>
        <description>Brain CGRP RO post telcagepant was determined by change in [11C]MK-4232 PET tracer biokinetics at baseline and post telcagepant administration. Using PET brain images acquired over ~0-90 minutes after [11C]MK-4232 dose, ROIs were drawn throughout the cerebral cortex and white matter, striatum, thalamus, cerebellum and pons. The ROIs were projected onto all frames of the dynamic PET scans in order to generate [11C]MK-4232 tissue TACs. Serial arterial blood samples for measurement of plasma radioactivity and [11C]MK-4232 concentrations were collected during the PET scans. These samples provided the arterial input function for a two-tissue compartmental model of [11C]MK-4232 tracer biokinetics. VT, an index of receptor density, was estimated by fitting the two-tissue compartmental model to the PET [11C]MK-4232 TACs. The change in VT between the baseline and post telcagepant PET studies was used to quantify the brain CGRP RO.</description>
        <time_frame>Part III, Period 1 Baseline, at ~0-90 minutes after [11C]MK-4232 dose; and Part III, Period 1 post telcagepant, at ~0-90 minutes after [11C]MK-4232 dose</time_frame>
        <population>Results could not be obtained for this measure. For Part III data, the curve fits were unsatisfactory (model curves did not pass through the TAC data points) precluding the quantification of the VT and RO</population>
