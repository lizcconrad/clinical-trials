  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been found to have low bone
      density by the end of treatment. This can lead to long-term suffering in survivors due to
      poor bone health. Vitamin D is known to be associated with bone health and previous research
      has established that Vitamin D insufficiency is very common at diagnosis of ALL and worsens
      over the course of treatment. Researchers have also learned that a relationship exists
      between both Vitamin D and fat tissue and ALL and fat tissue.

      In adolescents being treated for ALL as well as in early survivors, this randomized study
      will therefore examine the effect of Vitamin D and calcium supplementation on correcting
      Vitamin D insufficiency and on improving bone density in the context of changes in body
      composition and body fat. Bone density will be measured by a radiology exam called a
      quantitative computed tomography (or &quot;qCT&quot;) while body composition and body fat will be
      measured by a different radiology exam called a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (or &quot;DEXA&quot;
      scan). The study will also examine in depth the relationship between these three elements -
      Vitamin D insufficiency, obesity, and ALL - and their impact on bone density.
