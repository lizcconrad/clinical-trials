  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous work has shown that increasing fruit and vegetable intake in patients with high
      blood pressure improves cardiovascular function. Research indicates that this may be partly
      owing to compounds called polyphenols, which are found in abundance in fruits and vegetables
      and other foods such as wine, tea and dark chocolate. The investigators now wish to test if
      consuming fruits and vegetables (including berries which are very rich in polyphenols), as
      well as dark chocolate, has further benefits for cardiovascular function. A total of 110
      subjects with high blood pressure will be recruited and asked to follow a low polyphenol diet
      (2 portions of fruit and vegetables daily and no berries or dark chocolate) for four weeks (a
      washout period). They will then be randomised to continue this diet or to consume 6 portions
      of fruits and vegetables (to include 1 portion berries) and 1 portion of dark chocolate daily
      for 8 weeks. The fruit, vegetables and dark chocolate will be provided free of charge and
      delivered to the homes of the participants who are randomised to the high fruit and vegetable
      arm of the study.

      Assessment of microvascular and platelet function will be undertaken before and after
      consuming this diet. Improvements in these tests of cardiovascular function have previously
      been linked to reduced risks of heart disease in people with high blood pressure. This study
      will provide evidence as to whether or not a polyphenol rich diet can reduce the risk of
      developing heart disease.
