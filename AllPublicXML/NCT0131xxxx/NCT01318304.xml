  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The innate immunity of the vaginal tract provides first-line defense from abnormal
      microorganisms or overgrowth of common organisms, such as Candida species or Gardnerella
      vaginalis. It is unclear from the current available literature whether the rate of vaginal
      infection increases or decreases in frequency during pregnancy when compared to the
      non-pregnant state, but this may be predicted by shifts in vaginal innate immunity. Vaginal
      infections are important players in HIV disease, potentially increasing the risk of viral
      transmission. In addition, these infections may activate inflammatory markers in the
      reproductive tract and increase the risk of premature delivery or other negative pregnancy
      outcomes. The vaginal innate immune system has not been well characterized in pregnant women,
      or in women with HIV infection. The study of how this system changes in pregnancy and HIV
      infection will provide essential knowledge for further study of vaginal mucosal protection.

      The investigators study is an observational study designed to compare levels of vaginal
      innate immunity markers in women based on a) pregnancy status and b) HIV infection status.
      Comparisons will be made between pregnant and non- pregnant women and between HIV positive
      and HIV negative women. The investigators hypothesize that there will be significant
      differences in levels of innate immunity between the groups.

    <description>Investigators will quantify the major vaginal innate immunity markers, including type 1 (alpha and beta) interferons, defensins, cathelicidins, lysozyme and lactoferrin, and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). These antimicrobial host defense peptides are produced by genital tract mucosal epithelial cells and associated immune cells, and have a wide range of antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and antiparasitic activities and modes of action. We hypothesize that changes in innate immunity markers take place during pregnancy, thereby changing native vaginal immunity.</description>

    <description>Investigators will quantify the major vaginal innate immunity markers, including type 1 (alpha and beta) interferons, defensins, cathelicidins, lysozyme and lactoferrin, and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). Women who have HIV may express different innate immunity marker profiles in vaginal secretions when pregnant as compared to non-pregnant HIV positive women. Timing of specimen collection: In pregnancy: Weeks 13 - 30. Non-pregnant: 3 weeks between menstrual bleeding cycles</description>

Women with HIV may express different innate immunity marker profiles in vaginal secretions when pregnant as compared to pregnant, HIV-negative women. This may provide some explanation for differences in vaginal infection rates between the groups. Timing of specimen collection: In pregnancy: Weeks 13 - 30.</description>
