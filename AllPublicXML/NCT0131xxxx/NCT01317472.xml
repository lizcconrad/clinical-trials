  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with throat-related reflux often require twice
      daily proton pump inhibitor therapy to attain significant symptomatic improvement, with once
      daily therapy offering little relief. As dexlansoprazole is a twice-daily release proton pump
      inhibitor requiring only once-daily dosing, it may provide LPR symptomatic relief comparable
      to that of twice daily dosing, yet be more readily approved by third party payers because of
      its once daily dosing requirements. It is hypothesized that, in patients with
      pharyngeal-probe proven throat reflux, there will be significantly greater improvement in
      symptoms and pharyngeal probe findings in those patients receiving dexlansoprazole than those
      receiving placebo alone.

      The aim of the study is to compare outcomes, based on RSI-based symptomatic improvement and
      pharyngeal probe results, after LPR patients are treated for two months with once-daily (QAM)
      Kapidex versus placebo.Forty patients with pharyngeal pH probe-documented LPR and an elevated
      reflux symptom index (RSI) (≥14) will be enrolled into a double-blinded placebo controlled
      study. Twenty patients will receive Kapidex once daily, while twenty receive placebo.
      Patients will return at two months for evaluation with repeat RSI documentation and repeat
      pharyngeal pH probe testing. Student t-test will be used to determine if the change in RSI
      and pH-probe results differs between the study and placebo group.
