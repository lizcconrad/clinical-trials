      The aim of this study is to investigate the potential disease preventive effects of β-glucans
      from oat and barley.

      Objective:

      The primary aim is to examine whether consumption of oat and two different barley β-glucans
      exhibits hypocholesterolemic effects and to understand the underlying mechanisms.

      Secondary aims are to investigate whether there are also effects on blood pressure, appetite
      regulation, insulin sensitivity, hemostasis, low-grade inflammation and the metabolic profile
      of different biological materials.

      Intervention:

      In each of the 4 intervention periods the participants drink a milk drink together with their
      three main meals for 21 days. This way they consume 5g β-glucan/d form either oat or barley
      in the three treatment periods, otherwise they maintain their habitual diet. They are not,
      however, allowed to eat any oat- or barley-containing products during the trial.

      At the beginning and at the end of each intervention period the participants' blood pressure
      is measured and a fasting blood sample is drawn.

      Further they collect feces for 72 hours and urine for 24 hours before and at the end of each
      intervention period.

      Before and at the end of each intervention period a 4-hour meal test is undertaken to measure
      their subject appetite sensation. Here at first a fasting blood samples drawn and thereafter
      the milk drink is served. Appetite sensation is assessed every 30 min for 4 hours. Also blood
      samples are drawn at 2 hours and 4 hours at the meal tests which takes place before each
      intervention period.

      At the subsequent &quot;ad libitum&quot; lunch meal the food intake is measured and then a final
      appetite registration is made.

      Furthermore participants make 4-d food records before and at the end of each intervention
      period.
