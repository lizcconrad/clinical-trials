  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis is characterized by an inflammatory storm which regulatory pathways are
      not well known. The IL-1 cytokine family is activated early during acute pancreatitis and
      secretion of alarmins is speculated during pancreatic necrosis. IL-33 is a member of the IL-1
      family, it can act as an alarmin and its receptor, ST2, is known to sequester MyD88 which
      might regulate the acute pancreatitis inflammatory storm. The aim of this study is to
      investigate ST2 pathway in human acute pancreatitis and in murine experimental models of
      acute pancreatitis.
