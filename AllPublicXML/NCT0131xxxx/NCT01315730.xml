      The purpose of this research project is to test the effects of exposure of different forms of
      tactile speech feedback on overt stuttering frequency.

    <textblock>
      A new medical grade device (FDA - category exempt) has been newly designed and built at the
      University of Mississippi within the departments of Communication Sciences &amp; Disorders,
      Exercise Science, and Computer and Electrical Engineering. The device records either sound
      waves (via a small standard microphone) or three dimensional accelerometer data from the
      throat of a stuttering subject. This data is digitally signal processed, and &quot;fed back&quot; to
      the user in the form of a small vibrating disk/film that can be held between the fingers or
      mounted on the skin. This feedback data does not require the subject to attend to the
      incoming signal.

    <description>Speech fluency was defined by either reading or saying a set syllable sentence in a book which is normally 8th grade reading level or lower. Pauses or stutters are considered positive indicators of dis-fluent speech.</description>
