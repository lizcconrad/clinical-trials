  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed wound closure is considered by many to be the standard of care for the treatment of
      an open fracture. This study was conducted to determine the feasibility of a large
      multi-center prospective randomized clinical trial and collect the pilot data needed to
      compete for the funding for such a trial. The study was designed to compare immediate and
      delayed closure of Gustilo type II and IIIa tibia diaphyseal fractures. The primary outcomes
      were the infection rates and fracture related complications in patients treated with
      immediate or delayed wound closure strategies.
