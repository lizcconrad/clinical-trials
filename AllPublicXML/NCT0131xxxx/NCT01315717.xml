      The purpose of this study is to examine and to compare gait characteristics under single- and
      dual-task conditions among healthy subjects together with AD patients at different stages of
      disease (i.e., pre-dementia, mild and moderate dementia stages).

    <textblock>
      Although gait disorders are frequently associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), few studies
      have focused on their characterization and mechanism. Exploring the associations of the gait
      characteristics - more particularly the gait variability - with the cognitive performance of
      AD patients on one hand, and with the morphological brain abnormalities on the other hand,
      could be useful to understanding the mechanisms of gait disorders in AD.

      The main objective of this study is to examine and to compare gait characteristics under
      single- and dual-task conditions among healthy subjects together with AD patients at
      different stages of disease (i.e., pre-dementia, mild and moderate dementia stages).
