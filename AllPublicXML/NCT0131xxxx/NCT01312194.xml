  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is the prevention and repair of apical periodontitis in
      lower molars with pulp necrosis after the execution of endodontic treatment in one or two
      visits in adolescent patients. Moreover, it is also observed the frequency of postoperative
      pain in endodontic treatment.

      This project is developed in adolescent patients who have need of endodontic treatment in
      necrotic molars. The patients were randomly divided into two groups of treatment: one and two
      visits. The treatment protocol is the same for both groups, except the number of visits and
      the use of intra canal medication in the group treated in two visits. Patients will be
      followed clinically and radiographically for a minimum period of two years. The data was
      collected by the evaluation of postoperative pain and to determine the healing of periapical
      lesions, characterizing the success of the treatment.

    <description>Following the completion of endodontic treatment in one or two visits, patients receive a clinical record for home monitoring of postoperative pain and return to clinic to conduct a follow-up clinical and radiographic. Pain is assessed using a numerical scale for pain.</description>

    <description>All patients included in this treatment group will receive treatment in two visits. The first will be done chemo mechanical root canal preparation, the placement of the intracanal medication the basis of calcium hydroxide and coronal sealing. Ten to twelve days later, this medication is removed and the root canal will be permanently filled.</description>

    <description>Patient was anesthetized with local anesthetic solutions, and the caries was removed. The tooth was isolated with rubber dam and access to pulp chamber was completed. Cleaning and shaping preparation was achieved with manual and rotatory endodontic instruments.The ideal working length was determined by an electronic apex locator and periapical radiography. Irrigation was performed with 5.25%NaOCl solution. The smear layer was removed by 10% citric acid. The cases were obturated with guta-percha cones using a lateral compaction filling technique as well as zinc oxide-eugenol-based root canal sealer. The teeth filled with a light-cured resin.</description>

    <description>The treatment protocol was the same as described for one visit group. In the first visit, after cleaning, shaping and smear layer removal, the root canals were medicated with a calcium hydroxide paste and sterile distilled water (1:1) and the pulp chamber was sealed with a minimum 3mm thickness temporary filling restoration. After 10-12 days, during the second visit, the medication was removed, and the cases were obturated with guta-percha cones using a lateral compaction filling technique as well as zinc oxide-eugenol-based root canal sealer. The teeth filled with a light-cured resin.</description>
