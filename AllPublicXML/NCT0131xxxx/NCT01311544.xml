  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Magnetic Resonance angiography (MRA) of supraaortic vessels is essential for the
      etiologic of stroke. However, the techniques usually used provide only static evaluation
      (degree of stenosis, occlusion) but not dynamic. An ultra-fast 3D MRA originally developed
      for the cardiac imaging, k-t blast (Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique) could be
      used to review the supraaortic vessels. This MRA offers the following advantages: short
      acquisition time, wide spatial coverage (of the thoracic aorta to the distal encephalic
      arteries), 3D spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. These qualities are even more
      optimal with a high magnetic field (3T). The high temporal resolution is interesting because
      it provides to repeat a volume every eight seconds and thus to have a dynamic evaluation of
      vascular filling and to assess the vascular supply of the infarcted territory. This sequence
      is classified as a 4D MRA.
