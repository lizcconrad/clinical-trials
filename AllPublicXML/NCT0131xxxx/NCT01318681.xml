  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of Allergic Rhinitis (AR) on driving ability and memory
      functions. Our group has previously shown that patients suffering from AR symptoms perform
      less well on tasks requiring sustained attention compared to non symptomatic controls. Car
      driving is a typical behavior that is susceptible for changes in sustained attention and
      might therefore become worse under conditions when patients suffer from AR symptoms. We will
      compare the driving performance of untreated, symptomatic AR patients with the performance of
      symptomatic patients that have been treated with either a systemic AR medication (a pill) or
      a topical medication (nasal spray)

    <time_frame>2:00 - 3:00 hrs post dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) is the amount of &quot;weaving&quot; that occurs when a person is driving in a straight line on the highway and instructed to maintain a steady speed and position within the lane he/she is driving</description>

    <measure>Word Learning Test (WLT-15) verbal memory score</measure>
    <time_frame>2:30 hrs post dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are presented with a list of 15 words at a rate of one word/second with a pause between words of one second. Immediately following the presentation subjects are asked to recall and name as many words as possible. The total number of words recalled after three repeated presentations of the same list of words is the outcome variable</description>
