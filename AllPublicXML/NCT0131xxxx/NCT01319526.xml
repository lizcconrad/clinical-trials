      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients undergoing treatment
      with HIV infection and Hodgkin lymphoma may help doctors learn more about the effects of
      therapy on HIV.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in blood samples from patients with HIV
      infection and stage III or stage IV Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To quantify HIV-1 persistence in prospectively collected samples from patients on
           suppressive antiretroviral therapy undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood samples are collected before, during, and after treatment for lymphoma for HIV-1 RNA
      levels using standard and single copy assays and HIV-1 DNA quantification (peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells).

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  HIV-1 infection, as documented by a rapid HIV test or any FDA-approved HIV-1 enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit and confirmed by western blot at any
             time prior to study entry

               -  Documentation may be serologic (positive ELISA and positive western blot), or
                  other federally approved licensed HIV diagnostic test

               -  Prior documentation of HIV seropositivity is acceptable

          -  Diagnosis of untreated Hodgkin lymphoma and participation in the parent protocol
             SWOG-S0816, &quot;A Phase II Trial of Response Adapted Therapy of Stage III-IV Hodgkin
             Lymphoma Using Early Interim FDG-PET Imaging.&quot;

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  No psychosocial conditions that would prevent study compliance and follow-up, as
             determined by the principal investigator

          -  Willing to provide serial blood samples
