    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to establish the accuracy of the perfusion MRI parameters and the
      availability of the VEGFR2 signaling assay using phosphospecific flow cytometry in predicting
      the response of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer to treatment with antiangiogenic
      agent.

      The purpose of our study is to establish the accuracy of the perfusion MRI parameters and the
      availability of the VEGFR2 signaling assay using phosphospecific flow cytometry in predicting
      the response of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer to treatment with antiangiogenic
      agent.

      IRB approval will be obtained to enroll 60 na√Øve patients (30 patients who will get
      antiangiogenic agent (Avastin) combined chemotherapy and 30 patients who will get
      chemotherapy without antiangiogenic agent) with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. MRI
      and blood test (VEGFR2 signaling assay) will be undergoing at three time points in the
      patients with Avastin chemotherapy; at baseline (pretreatment), 3 days after Avastin alone
      treatment, 3 days after Avastin combined chemotherapy (about 10 days after initial Avastin
      alone treatment). MRI and blood test (VEGFR2 signaling assay) will be undergoing at two time
      points in the patients who will get chemotherapy without antiangiogenic agent; at baseline
      (pretreatment), 3 days after chemotherapy.
