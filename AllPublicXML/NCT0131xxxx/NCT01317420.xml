  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of a new drug BI 836845 which blocks the insulin growth factor (IGF) pathway
      believed to be involved in cancer growth. BI 836845 will be administered for the very first
      time into cancer patients.

      The study will also look at the overall safety of the drug, and examine the drug levels in
      the body at specific timepoints during the trial (pharmacokinetic profile); the effect the
      drug may have on tumours will also be examined (pharmacodynamics).
