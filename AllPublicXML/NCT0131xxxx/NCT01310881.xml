      This is a subject single blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, single dose,
      first-time-in-human study with three or more ascending cohorts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will undergo Screening (Day -28 to Day -2). Subjects will return to the clinical
      site on Day -1, be admitted to the unit, and eligibility will be reconfirmed. Eligible
      subjects will receive a single dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP, NSI-189
      Phosphate or Placebo) on Day 1 and will be followed for safety and PK until discharge on Day
      3. Subjects who are experiencing any significant AEs that are considered possibly related to
      study drug will be kept at the unit for an additional day (or longer) until the event
      resolves or it is considered medically safe for the subject to be discharged. Subjects will
      have a telephone Follow-up on Day 4 and return to the unit on Day 7 (± 1) for End-of-study.
      Participation of an individual subject may last up to 36 days from the time of Screening
      until the End-of-study.
