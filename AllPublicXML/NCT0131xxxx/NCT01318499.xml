    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of Nepafenac Ophthalmic
      Suspension, 0.3% for the prevention and treatment of inflammation (swelling and redness) and
      pain in the eye after cataract extraction.

    <time_frame>Day 14 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular inflammation was assessed by the investigator during slit lamp examination. Aqueous cells were scored on a 5-unit scale from 0 (none) to 4 (&gt; 30 cells), and aqueous flare (protein escaping from dilated vessels) was scored on a 4-unit scale from 0 (no visible flare when compared with the normal eye) to 3 (severe - very dense flare). To be considered cured, the patient must have had a score of 0 for both aqueous cells and aqueous flare.</description>

    <description>Ocular inflammation was assessed by the investigator during slit lamp examination. Aqueous cells were scored on a 5-unit scale from 0 (none) to 4 (&gt; 30 cells), and aqueous flare (protein escaping from dilated vessels) was scored on a 4-unit scale from 0 (no visible flare when compared with the normal eye) to 3 (severe - very dense flare).

    <description>Ocular inflammation was assessed by the investigator during slit lamp examination. Aqueous cells were scored on a 5-unit scale from 0 (none) to 4 (&gt; 30 cells), and aqueous flare (protein escaping from dilated vessels) was scored on a 4-unit scale from 0 (no visible flare when compared with the normal eye) to 3 (severe - very dense flare). To be considered cured, the patient must have had a score of 0 for both aqueous cells and aqueous flare. To be included in the cumulative summary at a visit, a patient must have been declared cured at the visit and remained cured at all subsequent visits.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Percentage of Patients Pain Free by Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular pain was assessed by the patient on a 6-unit scale from 0 (none; absence of positive sensation), to 5 (severe; intense ocular, periocular or radiating pain requiring prescription analgesic). Pain free was defined as an ocular pain assessment score of 0. To be included in the cumulative summary at a visit, a patient must have been declared pain free at the visit and remained pain free at all subsequent visits.</description>
