  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, open-label, multi-center study in advanced (Stage IVA and IVB
      subjects per the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 2009 Lung
      cancer staging schema) non-squamous NSCLC subjects comparing pazopanib relative to pemetrexed
      in the maintenance setting. Subjects should have completed 4-6 cycles of induction therapy
      with carboplatin + pemetrexed or cisplatin + pemetrexed and have had Stable Disease (SD),
      Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) as the best response to be enrolled into the
      study. The primary objective is to estimate the hazard ratio of progression free survival
      (PFS) in advanced NSCLC subjects given maintenance therapy of pazopanib (Arm A) relative to
      pemetrexed (Arm B). The secondary objectives are: overall survival, response rates, safety
      and tolerability. A total of approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a
      1:1 ratio. Safety and efficacy assessments will be regularly performed on all subjects.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the first documented sign of investigator-assessed disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (average of 10 study weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the first documented sign of investigator-assessed (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) disease progression (PD) or death, whichever occurs first. The date of documented PD is the date of lesion evaluation in the case of radiological PD and the date of symptomatic cancer progression in the case of symptomatic progression (radiological confirmation is required). PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started. If the participant received subsequent anti-cancer therapy prior to the date of documented progression or death, PFS was to be censored at the last adequate assessment (LAA) prior to the initiation of therapy. Otherwise, if the participant did not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS was to be censored at the date of the LAA.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants (Par.) With the Indicated Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the time of the first documented evidence of a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (average of 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A par. was defined as a responder if s/he sustained a CR (The disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph node must be less than 10 millimeters [mm] in the short axis) or PR (At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the baseline sum of the diameters) that was confirmed after &gt;=28 days. Response was evaluated by an investigator per RECIST, version 1.1. A par. without a post-Baseline assessment was considered a non-responder. Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started). To qualify as a best response of SD, a response of SD had to be observed &gt;=12 weeks after randomization. A par. who was not evaluable had no scans at all or did not have a confirmatory scan.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</title>
        <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the first documented sign of investigator-assessed (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1) disease progression (PD) or death, whichever occurs first. The date of documented PD is the date of lesion evaluation in the case of radiological PD and the date of symptomatic cancer progression in the case of symptomatic progression (radiological confirmation is required). PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started. If the participant received subsequent anti-cancer therapy prior to the date of documented progression or death, PFS was to be censored at the last adequate assessment (LAA) prior to the initiation of therapy. Otherwise, if the participant did not have a documented date of progression or death, PFS was to be censored at the date of the LAA.</description>

An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. In addition, all Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities and other medically important events that require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously are considered to be SAEs.

In addition, all Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities and other medically important events that require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously are considered to be SAEs. Refer to the general Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs/SAEs. Management of AEs may require DRs/interruptions in study treatment. If necessary, the pazopanib dose should be reduced stepwise by 200 mg at each step. DRs for pemetrexed were 50-75% of prior dose based on the toxicity leading to DR.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Grade Changes From Baseline Grade in Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Alkaline Phosphatase (Alk. Phos.), and Total Bilirubin (TB)</title>
          <description>The laboratory parameters AST, ALT, Alk. Phos., and TB were summarized according to NCI CTCAE grade, version 4.0. Grade 1, Mild; Grade 2, Moderate; Grade 3, Severe; Grade 4, Life-threatening or disabling; Grade 5, Death. Data are presented for any grade increase, increase to Grade 3, and increase to Grade 4. Participants with missing Baseline grades were assumed to have a Baseline grade of 0. AST/ALT: Grade 1, &gt;upper limit of normal (ULN) - 3.0x ULN; Grade 2, &gt;3.0 to 5.0x ULN; Grade 3, &gt;5.0 - 20.0x ULN; Grade 4, &gt;20.0x ULN; Grade 5, not available (NA). Alk. Phos.: Grade 1, &gt;ULN - 2.5x ULN; Grade 2, &gt;2.5 - 5.0x ULN; Grade 3, &gt;5.0 - 20.0x ULN; Grade 4, &gt;20.0x ULN; Grade 5, NA. TB: Grade 1, &gt;ULN - &gt;1.5x ULN; Grade 2, &gt;1.5 - 3.0x ULN; Grade 3, &gt;3.0 - 10.0x ULN; Grade 4, &gt;10.0x ULN; Grade 5, NA.</description>
