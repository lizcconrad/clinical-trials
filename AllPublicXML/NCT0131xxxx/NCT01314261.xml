    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and 4-week rapid
      virologic response (RVR) of 3 different doses of ABT-267 (also known as ombitasvir) in
      combination with pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) compared with pegIFN/RBV alone
      (ABT-267 placebo) in treatment naïve, hepatitis C virus (HCV), genotype 1-infected
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study consisting of 2
      substudies. In substudy 1, participants received 1 of 3 doses of ABT-267 or placebo +
      pegIFN/RBV for 12 weeks. In substudy 2, participants received pegIFN/RBV for 36 weeks.
      Participants were followed for 48 weeks post ABT-267 treatment for evaluation of efficacy and
      safety.

    <description>Plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels (measured in IU/mL) were determined for each sample using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Rapid virologic response was defined as HCV RNA levels &lt; the lower limit of detection (&lt; 15 IU/mL) at Week 4. Data are reported as percentage of participants with RVR.</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately prior to morning dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and prior to dose on Day 2 (24 hours after Day 1 dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected immediately prior to morning dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and prior to dose on Day 2 (24 hours after Day 1 dose). The samples were analyzed for the concentration of ABT-267 using validated analytical methods. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax; measured in ng/mL) is the highest concentration that a drug achieves in the plasma after administration in a dosing interval. The Cmax of ABT-267 was estimated using non-compartmental methods and data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

The samples were analyzed for the concentration of pegIFN (measured in ng/mL) using validated analytical methods and pegIFN concentrations in serum were summarized at each visit. Data are reported as the median (range).</description>
        <time_frame>At each study visit from Week 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>Participants received at least 1 dose of study drug and had sufficient concentrations to characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters. When a different number of participants at a specific time point was used to analyze the data in the outcome measure, the n (number of participants) for each arm is denoted in the Category Title.</population>
