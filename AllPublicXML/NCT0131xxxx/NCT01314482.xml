  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In about half the patients who have an open chest surgery there is persistent severe pain in
      the chest. The investigators are examining whether minocycline, a commonly used antibiotic,
      will prevent pain. Minocycline blocks the activity of immune cells which the investigators
      believe are responsible for prolonging the pain.

      The study is of double-blind placebo controlled parallel groups design in up to 116 patients
      undergoing elective open thoracotomy. Minocycline 200mg twice daily or matching placebo are
      given three days before surgery.
