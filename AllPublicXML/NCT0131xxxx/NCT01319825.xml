  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label pilot study to determine whether milnacipran can reduce headache
      frequency in episodic and chronic migraine sufferers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with episodic migraine with and/or without aura and chronic migraine will be treated
      with 100 or 200 mg of milnacipran for a total of 4 months including a one month titration
      phase and a 3 month maintenance phase. Baseline (pre-treatment) and end-of-maintenance phase
      headache frequencies will be recorded. There is no placebo treatment in this study. In
      addition to headache frequencies, other parameters being measured include safety and
      tolerability.
