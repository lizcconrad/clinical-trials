    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the time to recolonization intraoperatively after
      preoperative disinfection with chlorhexidine solution in ethanol and to determine evidence of
      differential bacterial growth with or without plastic adhesive drape on the chest as well as
      with or without microbial sealant on the leg.

      The purpose of this study is to measure the time to recolonization intraoperative after
      preoperative disinfection with chlorhexidine solution in ethanol and to determine evidence of
      differential bacterial growth with or without plastic adhesive drape as well as with or
      without microbial sealant on the leg. A RCT study of 140 patients undergoing coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG) and/or aortic valve replacement (AVR) are included. The investigators
      test the hypothesis that patients randomized to no plastic adhesive drape intraoperatively
      will have a reduced recolonisation compared to patients with plastic adhesive drape.
