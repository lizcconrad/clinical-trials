      In chronic kidney disease calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) metabolism disorders are very common
      and also they are one of the leading causes of morbidity in these population. FGF23 is a
      novel factor that contributes Ca-P disorders. It has been hypothesized that FGF 23 increase
      is mediated by asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). The aim of the study is to evaluate this
      hypothesis.
