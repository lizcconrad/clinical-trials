    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the whether an automated telephone-based system is
      useful and helpful for opioid dependent patients receiving buprenorphine in primary care. The
      Recovery Line support system is a Therapeutic Interactive Voice Response system based on
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The Recovery Line support system includes a variety of
      modules presenting the basic principles and strategies of CBT. Each module includes learning
      sections and activities sections to provide direct guidance in using skills. The Recovery
      Line support system is interactive and also includes a questionnaire to help patients
      identify problems and recommend modules for use, as well as an inspiration section, an
      introduction, and an immediate assistance menu. Following development of an initial system
      the current trial will recruit 40 patients receiving buprenorphine maintenance from a
      physician provider in the local community. Patients will be randomly (flip of a coin) to
      receive the Recover Line Support system or to treatment as usual with their physician.
      Patients assigned to TIVR will be trained on the system and provided 24-hr access to the TIVR
      system for a four week period. Primary outcome variables will be how long patients remain in
      treatment, self-reported abstinence from opioids and other drugs, and abstinence as measured
      by weekly drug screens. It is expected that patients assigned to TIVR will better treatment
      outcomes than patients assigned to TAU.
