  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is considered to be one of the most
      prevalent sleep-related breathing disorders, with an enormous effect on public health.
      Approximately 2-4% of the general adult population experiences some degree of this syndrome.
      This percentage increases even more with obesity, up to 20-40%, especially in individuals
      with an excessive body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m2. OSAHS is associated with significant
      systemic consequences, including cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the risk
      increases with the severity of the syndrome. The pathophysiology underlying the link between
      OSAHS and the cardiovascular system is attributed largely to systemic inflammation and
      oxidative stress, which are both contributors to endothelial dysfunction. The treatment
      modalities of OSAHS include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), weight loss, upper
      airway surgery, and medication. CPAP is the first line therapy, as a means of maintaining
      upper airway patency, and it is well known that this intervention reduces morbidity and
      mortality. In severe cases of OSAHS the weight loss strategy is essential and must accompany
      CPAP treatment. A growing body of evidence in OSAHS supports the beneficial role of weight
      reduction, induced by diet alone or in combination with exercise, leading to a reduction in
      apnoeas and hypopnoeas.We aim to evaluate the effect of the Mediterranean diet compared with
      that of a prudent diet on obese OSAHS patients who were treated with CPAP while receiving
      counselling to increase their physical activity.
