  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial comparing two different uncemented femoral stems and two
      different uncemented sockets using Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, Radiostereometry and
      clinical evaluation.

      Hypothesis:

        1. A short uncemented stem gives less periprosthetic bone resorption in the proximal femur
           than a conventional uncemented stem.

        2. An uncemented acetabular component with a backside of three-dimensional Titanium porous
           construct gives less periprosthetic bone resorption than a backside covered with a
           conventional porous coating with Titanium-beads and a hydroxy-apatite layer.

    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients 40-70 years old who are being planned for Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)
      will be eligible for inclusion in the study.

      Periprosthetic bone remodeling, migration of the components and clinical scores will be
      recorded prospectively.
