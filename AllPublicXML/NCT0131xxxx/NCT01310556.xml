      This study aimed to examine the prevalence of glucose metabolism disorders (GMD)in the
      patients with coronary artery disease and the relationship between different GMDs and
      coronary artery disease (CAD).

      Context: There are more than 220 million people diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) in the
      world. DM is a serious risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aimed to
      examine the prevalence of glucose metabolism disorders (GMD) in te patients with coronary
      artery disease and the relationship between different GMDs and CAD.

      Settings: 230 patients with coronary artery disease and without any known GMDs were included
      the study. Coronary angiography was used to diagnose CAD. Patients were administered the 75 g
      Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Results: While GMDs were detected in 58.26% (n=134 patients) of CAD patients, 41.74% of them (n=96 patients) were found to have normal glucose metabolism.</description>

    <measure>Fasting and 120 minute glucose levels have relation with vessels' stenosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting glucose level was found to have a significant correlation with the total number of stenotic coronary vessels (p=0.0001) and the stenosis rate of all vessels . OGTT 120-minute glucose levels were found to have a significant correlation with the total number of stenotic coronary vessels and the stenosis rate of vessels with the exception of LAD.</description>
