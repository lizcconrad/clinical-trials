  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective case series will essentially examine the influence of reduction quality on
      the primary functional outcome (as assessed using the FAAM) of patients with pilon fractures
      treated with plate fixation.

      The plates used in this trial can be chosen according to the preferences of the surgeon.

      A prospective case series to examine the influence of reduction quality on the primary
      functional outcome (as assessed using the FAAM) of patients with pilon fractures treated with
      plate fixation. Radiological parameters including single/combined alignment and various
      articular measurements will also be validated according to their reliability. The sensitivity
      of the effects of reduction quality on functional outcome, and an extended evaluation of
      patient-rated functional and social outcomes as well as their outcome expectations will also
      be assessed as part of the secondary study aims.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The most important predictors of functional outcome after pilon fracture will be identified by evaluating the influence of radiologically assessed parameters of reduction quality and other factors (age, high/low energy trauma, AO fracture type, open/closed fracture, delay between trauma and definitive fracture fixation) on the FAAM. In parallel, the radiological parameters will also be validated with respect to their reliability.</description>
