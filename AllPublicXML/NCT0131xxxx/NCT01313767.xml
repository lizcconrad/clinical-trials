  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double blind, multi-center, active drug controlled, phase III
      clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of MEDITOXIN® versus BOTOX® in treatment of
      post stroke upper limb(wrist, finger, thumb) spasticity

      Approximately 196 subjects(1:1 group ratio)will be enrolled. Subjects will receive a single
      treatment of intramuscular Investigational product up to 360U. The subjects will be observed
      every 4 weeks until 12 weeks post injection. Outcome measures include Modified Ashworth Scale
      (MAS), Disability Assessment Scale (DAS), Global Assessment Scale(patient or
      caregiver/investigator) and Carer burden scale. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change
      from baseline at week 4 for wrist flexor muscle tone as measured on the Modified Ashworth
      Scale. Safety parameters will also be measured including adverse events, vital signs and
      clinical laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry and urinanalysis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each completed subject will attend 4~5 clinic visits. The maximum study duration is 15 weeks.
      Only one upper limb (eligible inclusion/exclusion criteria) will be injected and evaluated in
      the study. Maximun injection dose is 360U.
