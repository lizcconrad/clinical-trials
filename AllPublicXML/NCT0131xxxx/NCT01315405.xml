  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After few years of evolution, patients with Parkinson's disease may develop apathy, with
      different degrees of severity. Apathy is characterized by a loss of interest for the others
      and for activities. The lack of social interactions in these patients may be due to an
      impairment in decoding emotional facial expression. Indeed, facial expression recognition,
      which is necessary to understand other's emotional state, requires a subclinical facial
      mimicking of the expression observed. Yet, one of the clinical signs of PD is amimia.

      This study aims to determinate if there is a facial mimicry disorder in PD ( Parkinson's
      disease )patients with emotional facial expression (EFE) recognition impairment, compared to
      healthy control subjects. We also want to know if this facial mimicry disorder is primary
      (subtended by facial mobility impairment, that is to say amimia) or secondary (related to the
      mirror neuron systems that allows us to activate similar neural networks when observing and
      feeling a specific emotion)

      20 patients with an Idiopathic Parkinson's disease

      + 20 paired healthy volunteers (on sex, age, and education)

      After inclusion, patients are evaluated two times: they are studied without medication (MED
      OFF) and with medication (STIM ON) in a randomized order. The 2 evaluations should be spaced
      out 15 days to one month (J0 and J+15d)

      Healthy subjects have only one visit J0 (inclusion and emotional facial expression
      recognition tests are made at the same time)
