  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) is a disorder of the digital blood vessels resulting in episodic
      impairment of blood flow. During an attack of RP which commonly affects the hands and feet
      these arteries contract briefly which limits the blood flow (this is called a vasospasm) and
      deprived of blood the skin turns white then blue. The aim of this study is to prove the
      concept that ORM-12741 can prevent these blood vessel spasms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent obtained

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 10-30 kg/m2 (inclusive)

          -  Male or female patients with a diagnosis of active Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) secondary
             to systemic sclerosis. Active RP will be defined as a history of cold sensitivity
             associated with colour changes of cyanosis or pallor, as well as of at least 6 attacks
             weekly during the winter months. Diagnosis of systemic sclerosis will be defined by
             the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria.

          -  Stable symptoms for RP and medication requirements within 2 months prior to screening

          -  Negative pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with nitrates

          -  Treatment with calcium channel blockers (CCBs)for indications other than the relief of
             RP symptoms

          -  Treatment with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for the relief of RP symptoms that in
             the opinion of the investigator cannot be stopped from the screening visit until end
             of the last experimental session

          -  Changes in dosing of other vasoactive medications within 1 month prior to screening or
             during the study

          -  Smoking or smoking cessation using nicotine products within 3 months prior to
             screening

          -  Current active ischemic digital ulcer and/or tissue gangrene

          -  History of sympathectomy

          -  Upper extremity deep vein thrombosis or lymphoedema within 3 months prior to
             screening.

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal,
             neurological, psychiatric or malignant disorder or any other major concurrent illness
             that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the interpretation of the
             study results or constitute a health risk for the subject if he/she takes part in the
             study

          -  Supine Heart rate (HR) &gt;100 beats per minute (bpm) after a 10 minute rest at screening

             screening visit

             the investigator interfere with the interpretation of the study results or cause a
             health risk for the subject if he/she takes part into the study.
