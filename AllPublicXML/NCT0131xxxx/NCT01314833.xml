  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the increasing number of breast cancer patients shows the fact breast cancer
      is one of the most common cancers in women in China. However, the mortality rate has seen a
      dramatic decline mainly due to early detection of breast cancer and the use of effective
      multimodel treatment. Recent studies suggest breast cancers are heterogeneous and recognized
      by biological subtypes, which lead to markedly different clinical outcome.

      Adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used in the treatment for primary breast cancer patients.
      Different types of breast cancer cells are sensitive to different types of drugs.There is no
      data to support the information about the adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for different
      subtypes breast cancer patients， especially for Chinese women.

      The investigators hypothesized to confirm the possibility of finding the adjuvant
      chemotherapy aimed to different subtypes of breast cancer.

      Eligibility Female adults(&gt; 18 years old) are eligible if they had histologically confirmed
      primary breast cancer. Patients also had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) Performance
      status of 0 or 1, absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&gt; 1500/mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 8.0g/dL, and
      platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3, creatinine &lt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal(ULN)）,
      transaminases &lt; 2.5 times ULN or alkaline phosphatase &lt; 4 times ULN if transaminases was
      normal, and total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 times ULN. Exclusion criteria were active infection,
      pregnancy, other primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of cervix or adequately treated
      nonmelanomatous carcinoma of the skin), any documented distant metastasis and uncontrolled
      systemic diseases.
