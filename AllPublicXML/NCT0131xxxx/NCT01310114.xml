    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A Treatment-emergent AE was any AE that began or worsened in grade after the start of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug or end of study whichever is later. Treatment related toxicity was one considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug. AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 on the following scale: Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life-threatening, Grade 5 = death. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that: results in death; is fatal or life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient; and constitutes an important medical event.</description>

    <measure>Clinical response defined by a ≥ 1 point decrease from baseline in the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at Day 91 post treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 91 days</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of participants who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability, and it has become the most widely used clinical outcome measure for stroke clinical trials. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death. 0 - No symptoms. 1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms. 2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities. 3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted. 4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted. 5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent. 6 - Dead.</description>

    <measure>Clinical response defined as a ≥ 4 point decrease from baseline in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used by healthcare providers to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between a 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment.[1] The individual scores from each item are summed in order to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The maximum possible score is 42, with the minimum score being a 0.
Score Stroke Severity:
0 No Stroke Symptoms 1-4 Minor Stroke 5-15 Moderate Stroke 16-20 Moderate to Severe Stroke 21-42 Severe Stroke</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical response defined as a clinically significant improvement (at least 20-point increase from baseline) in the Barthel Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index (BI) measures the extent to which a person can function independently and has mobility in their activities of daily living (ADL) ie feeding, bathing, groomig, dressing, bowel control, bladder control, toileting, chair transfer, ambulation and stair climbing. The index also indicates the need for assistance in care. Total possible scores range from 0 - 20, with lower scores indicating increased disability. If used to measure improvement after rehabilitation, changes of more than two points in the total score reflect a probable genuine change, and change on one item from fully dependent to independent is also likely to be reliable.</description>

             of contraception methods simultaneously such as: oral, injectable or implantable
             hormonal contraception; tubal ligation; intrauterine device; barrier contraceptive
             with spermicide; or vasectomized partner for the duration of the study and the
             follow-up period. Males (including those who have had a vasectomy) must agree to use
             barrier contraception (latex condoms) when engaging in reproductive sexual activity
             with FCBP for the duration of the study and the follow-up period.

          5. Diagnosis of stroke involving the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory (cortical and
             subcortical) or posterior cerebral artery (PCA) (PCA is limited to 3 subjects per
             cohort) ischemic stroke confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/ computerized
             tomography (CT). An ischemic stroke is death of an area of brain tissue (cerebral
             infarction) resulting from an inadequate supply of blood and oxygen to the brain.

          6. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≥ 6 but &lt; 20 at the time of
             screening and infusion. Subject should not have shown rapid improvement (≥ 8 point
             decrease) or deterioration (≥ 4 point increase) in the score from time of initial
             evaluation to pre-infusion. To the extent possible, the time from initial screening
             evaluation to reevaluation will be at least 24 hours.

          7. Subject must have had a normal neurologic status prior to ischemic episode defined as
             the absence of focal or global central neurological or psychiatric deficits of
             sufficient magnitude that it could not reasonably be expected that the subject could
             recover to the normal range based on the instruments used to assess the subject's
             response to treatment. The pre-stroke modified Rankin score should be between 0 and 2
             inclusive.

          8. Treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or Food and Drug Administration
             (FDA)-approved devices used to restore circulation are allowed but treatment must be

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject or subject's legal representative from signing the informed
             consent form.

          2. Pregnant or lactating females.

          3. Any condition, including any medical or neuropsychiatric condition, including the
             presence of laboratory abnormalities, which in the judgment of the investigator places
             the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study including (but not limited to):
