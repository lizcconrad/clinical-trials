  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is distinctive in studying known carriers of resistant Enterobacteriaceae.
      It examines both phenotypic and genotypic expansion in the AMR bacterial population as a
      function of antibiotic treatment, and examines the effect of antibiotics on the dissemination
      of resistance genes from species to species. It will examine CRE, important emerging
      pathogens, which are a significant threat to public health, but yet not well studied. The
      proposed study will use an interdisciplinary approach, combining PK/PD, phenotypic, and
      genetic data to understand the effect of antibiotics on the likelihood of spread of AMR. Most
      previous studies have focused on the effect of antibiotic agents on clinical detection,
      infection or acquisition of AMR among non-carriers67,68. Other studies have looked at the
      effects on colonisation-resistance mostly among healthy volunteers69. Very few studies have
      examined the effects of various antibiotic agents on carriers of ARB and those focused
      primarily on vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE)70. No similar studies have been conducted
      with regard to ESBL or to CRE. Correlation with clinical factors and environmental
      contamination has not been determined in previously published studies. The proposed study
      also extends the analysis to the effect of antibiotic treatment on dissemination of
      resistance genes which may be of great importance as these events may lead to emergence of
      new AMR strains and species. The proposed study not only examines the effects of various
      antibiotic agents and classes, but also the effects of duration of treatment and PK/PD
      indices on amplification of ARB. The study will also examine the effect of antibiotics on the
      epidemicity and fitness of colonising strains

      We will conduct an observational longitudinal prospective study in 3 hospitals in units with
      high prevalence of resistant organisms. Consenting patients will be screened for carriage of
      AMR organisms at admission, and those found to be carriers of the target ARB will be included
      in the longitudinal study. To improve the yield of screening we may use risk stratification
      based on risk factors identified at each center. Patients included in the longitudinal study
      will be asked to provide serial stool samples every 2-3 days during hospitalisation (rectal
      swab will be allowed as replacement for stool specimen, after developing appropriate
      methodology to correlate between stool samples and rectal swabs).

      These samples will be analysed using quantitative cultures for the number of resistant
      organisms, and samples will be subject to quantitative real time PCR to quantify resistant
      genes (CTX-M, TEM, SHV, KPC, VIM as required). In parallel, environmental contamination will
      be examined and quantified using similar methods. Data will be collected daily regarding
      antibiotic treatment, other medications, clinical parameters, bowel movements and presence of
      diarrhoea, and various PK/PD indices. The target antibiotic for this study include commonly
      use agents in the hospital setting including quinolones, cephalosporins,
      piperacillin/tazobactam, ertapenem, imipenem, doripenem, metronidazole, clindamycin and
      aminoglycosides. The duration, the sequential order of treatment and PK/PD indices will be
      examined. The effects of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis will be examined as an important end
      point. The effects of the target antibiotic agents/classes on selection, enrichment, and
      spread of the target AMR organisms. Analyses will be conducted to compare: 1. the effects of
      various antibiotics 2. the effect of duration of therapy 3. the durability of the effect
      (posttreatment). 4. The effects of PK/PD indices.

      Secondary analysis will examine the risk of developing infections as function of various
      factors including time and load of carriage of resistant organisms and of exposure to
      antibiotics will be performed. Correlation with clinical isolates will be performed including
      typing, gene and plasmid analyses to determine correlation between colonising and infecting
      strains. Experiment simulating patient contact will be conducted to examine contamination of
      hands, gloves and gowns after contact in order to correlate between environmental
      contamination and contamination of healthcare workers. Additional work will be conducted on
      profiling bacterial communities by DNA fingerprinting techniques using length hetrogeneity
      (LH-PCR) and automated ribososmal internal spacer analysis (ARISA) on a sample of the
      patients studied.
