      The aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled iloprost can be used to prevent and
      treat PH and PHC while in children after operation of CHD

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a significant contributor to the postoperative morbidity and
      mortality of congenital heart disease. Inhaled iloprost has been approved for the treatment
      of adults with PH, but little is known about the effects in children with PH.

      Iloprost is a prostacyclin analogue. When applied by inhalation, it selectively dilates
      pulmonary vessels without side affecting the systemic circulation. There is no RCTs of
      iloprost have previously been performed in this indication.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary end point is a composite variable (incidence rate of any events) consisting of reactive PH, PHC and death requiring additional pharmacological or other support administered within the first 48 hours after receiving study drug.</measure>
    <time_frame>The pulmonary heamodynamic variable is measured before, after ilkoprost inhalation instantly and 30-min later.</time_frame>
    <description>Reactive PH is defined as Pp/Ps greater than 0.5 for more than 30min.
End point of observation: in case of Pp/Ps greater than 0.5 for more than 30min or Pp/Ps greater than 1 for any time period, drug inhalation will be immediately stopped and other therapies such as NO inhalation and/or iloprost 80 ng/kg/min inhalation will be resorted to treat pulmonary hypertension.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Before corrective procedure for CHD, two of bellow ten criteria should be met

          1. Pulse SaO2 smaller than 93% in left-right shunt CHD case (in room air)

          2. EKG: right ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial dilatation

          3. Chest X-ray: enhanced vascular signs in trans-hilar, loss of blood vessal in bilateral
             lung fields, pulmonary arterial trunk dilatation, right ventricular enlargement

          4. Cardiac echocardiography: fast tricuspid or pulmonary valve regurgitant velocity,
             ventricular and aortic level bidirectional shunt, or even right-to-left shunt

          5. Under-filling of pulmonary capillary, 'pruning' of the peripheral blood vessels

          6. Pp/Ps greater than 0.75

          9. Rp/Rs graeter than 0.5

        Exclusion Criteria:

        After corrective procedure for CHD:

          1. Deficient anatomy associated with remained intracardiac shunts and severe
             artrio-ventricular regurgitation

          2. Severe arrhythmia led to low cardiac output
