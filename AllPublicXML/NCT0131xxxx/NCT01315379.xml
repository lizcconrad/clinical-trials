  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE)is effective
      in the treatment of post-traumatic stress symptoms in children and adolescents with mild
      traumatic brain injury (m-TBI) due to motor vehicle accident.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor vehicle accidents account for a majority of TBI cases and are a leading cause for Post
      Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among children. The vast majority of these cases involve
      mild TBI (mTBI) with persistent post concussion syndromes. However, the empirical data on
      treatment in this field is scarce. Few studies demonstrated that cognitive behavioral
      therapies can be effective for adults with mild TBI suffering from Acute Stress Disorder, but
      no research, to date, addressed this question in pediatric population. In the current
      research we intend to examine the effectiveness of PE in reducing post-traumatic stress
      symptoms in children and adolescents with m-TBI caused by motor vehicle accident, in
      comparison to children and adolescents without brain injury.

      Sixty children age 6 to 18 attending the Anxiety clinic in Schneider Children's Medical
      Center of Israel will be included. All subjects will be treated with a manualized 12-18 week
      Prolonged Exposure protocol. Participants will undergo assessments, which will include
      interviews, questionnaires and neuropsychological tests concerning symptoms of PTSD,
      emotional and cognitive functioning. Ratings and neuropsychological testing will be made at
      baseline and following completion of treatment. Follow up will include questionnaires ratings
      at 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after completion of treatment.
