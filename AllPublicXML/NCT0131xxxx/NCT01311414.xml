  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During clamping of one internal carotid artery for endarterectomy, blood flow through this
      vessel has to be compensated by collateral arteries including the contralateral internal
      artery and vertebral arteries. In 7 % of all patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy this
      collateral flow is not sufficient to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion during clamping and
      ischemic brain damage is likely to emerge. To maximize cerebral blood flow during clamping,
      increase of blood pressure is a common procedure and routine at our institution. Increasing
      blood pressure can be enabled by tapering a mixture of Cafedrine und Theodrenalin (AkrinorÂ®)
      until the designated blood pressure is reached. After declamping, the blood pressure has to
      be reduced to normal values to avoid postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome. This is enabled
      by tapering urapidil until normal blood pressure is achieved.

      It has been shown that cerebral oxygenation measured by near infrared spectroscopy is reduced
      by intravenous application of norepinephrine. Otherwise, intravenous nitroglycerine increases
      cerebral oxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass. Hence, cafedrine/theodrenalin and
      urapidil may also have an effect on cerebral perfusion. In this prospective randomized study
      the effect of cafedrine/theodrenalin and urapidil on cerebral oxygenation measured by near
      infrared spectroscopy is investigated.
