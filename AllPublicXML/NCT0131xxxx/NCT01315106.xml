    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well a new MRI technique called &quot;High
      resolution 3D diffusion-weighted breast MRI&quot; detects breast cancer.

      The objective of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a new non-contrast MRI
      method for breast cancer detection. The study design is a single arm observational study. The
      new technique will be added on to the standard sequences that a women undergoes during a
      breast MRI. The resulting images will be compared with her standard breast MRI images, and
      with results of subsequent pathology.

        Inclusion Criteria:1. Patient scheduled for contrast-enhanced breast MRI to image possible
        breast cancer.

        2. Female

        3. Age &gt;18

        Exclusion Criteria:1. Lactation

        2. Pregnancy

        3. Patient undergoing chemotherapy. These patients are excluded because chemotherapy
        changes the biology of breast cancers. Since the ultimate objective of the research is to
        develop a new imaging method for breast MRI screening (detection of previously unknown
        tumors), results in treated tumors would not be relevant. Including treated tumors could
        yield a misleading assessment of the performance of the new method since treated tumors
        have different imaging characteristics than de novo tumors.

        4. Patient scheduled for pre-operative chemotherapy. These patients are excluded if they
        are going to be treated only on the basis of fine needle aspiration. The project seeks to
        correlate all tumors detected with standard histopathology of their untreated neoplasm.
        This exclusion criteria will be very unusual because most patients planning neoadjuvant
        chemotherapy do so on the basis of a pre-chemo core needle biopsy, which provide adequate
        histopathologic proof necessary for enrollment.
