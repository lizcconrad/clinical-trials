      Background:

      - Gastrointestinal cancers can occur in the throat, stomach, gallbladder, liver, pancreas,
      and colon. Researchers are interested in evaluating how active the immune system is in trying
      to fight the cancer by studying blood and tumor tissue donated from individuals who have been
      diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancers.

      Objectives:

      - To collect blood and tumor samples from individuals who have been diagnosed with
      gastrointestinal cancers in order to study the immune system s response to the cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with throat, stomach,
      gallbladder, liver, pancreatic, or colon cancer, and are scheduled to be treated at the
      National Institutes of Health.

      Design:

        -  The study will require at least one but no more than four visits to the National
           Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, and will
           provide a baseline blood sample for study.

        -  Participants will provide additional blood samples 2 and 4 months after the baseline
           sample, as well as a final sample at the completion of the treatment protocol.

        -  Participants will provide tumor tissue samples only if they undergo a surgical procedure
           related to the treatment for their gastrointestinal cancer.

        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Numerous recent therapeutic advances have changed standard treatment options for
           patients with GI cancer. These include newer chemotherapeutic agents in addition to
           established proof of principle for anti-angiogenic agents. The burden of GI cancers is
           reflected by the presence of three GI cancer types in the top five causes of cancer
           mortality. Over 58,000 deaths yearly can be attributed to GI cancer.

        -  While immune-based therapies in GI cancers are experimental at the current time, a
           gathering body of literature is suggestive of an enormous potential, either alone, or
           most likely in combination with standard chemotherapy.

        -  Before immunotherapy can be combined with non-immune based treatment options we first
           need to investigate the effects of non-immune based therapies on immune responses
           (especially immune-evasive mechanisms) with cancer.

        -  Commensal gut microbiota play an important role in colonic inflammation and colon
           cancer. The human gut flora consists of approximately 100 trillion microbial cells,
           which their disruption leads to many types of diseases including inflammatory bowel
           disease and colorectal cancer. Recent studies have shown that colon cancer patients as
           well other patients with gastrointestinal cancers have an altered gut flora when
           compared to healthy controls. As an example, intestinal microbiome has been shown to
           contribute to the start and progression of certain kinds of liver diseases such as NAFLD
           as well as end-stage liver diseases1-3 Therefore, it is important to investigate further
           as to how the gut affects the patient s response to chemotherapy, other types of cancer
           therapy and to tumor growth in general.

      OBJECTIVES:

      To serve as an umbrella protocol to allow collection, storage and investigation of samples
      from patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers in support of Thoracic and GI Oncology
      Branch translational trials to develop new therapeutic agents and novel treatment approaches
      as well as new prognostic and diagnostic models. Also, to collect samples from patients with
      non-GI cancers for comparison.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients undergoing evaluation for participation in NCI treatment protocols in the NCI
           intramural program with diagnosis of cancer.

        -  18 year of age or older.

      DESIGN:

        -  Blood and/or tumor samples may be collected from consenting subjects at the initial
           visit and/or at follow-up visits.

        -  Analysis of immune function will be performed both at baseline, and at subsequent
           visits, if they have follow up at NIH, at up to two additional time points when the
           patient returns for follow-up, and end of therapy.

        -  Blood will also be obtained from patients circulating tumor cells (CTC) analysis.

        -  Stool samples will be obtained to determine the intestinal microbiome.
