    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced cancer will receive
      investigational study drug ARRY-382. Patients will receive increasing doses of study drug in
      order to achieve the highest dose of the study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable
      side effects. Patients will be followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the study
      drug has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 50 patients from the US will be
      enrolled in this study.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic solid
             cancer refractory to standard treatment, for which no standard therapy is available or
             for which the patient refuses standard therapy.

          -  Measurable disease or evaluable, nonmeasurable disease.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL, ANC &gt; 1500/uL and platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL.

          -  AST/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and ALT/serum glutamic pyruvic
             transaminase (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Bilirubin ≤ ULN.

          -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN.

          -  Potassium, magnesium and calcium (corrected calcium when serum albumin levels are
             abnormal) within the normal range.

          -  Additional criteria exist.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating a mean QTcF &gt; 450 msec (triplicate assessment) at the
             Screening Visit or history/evidence of long QT syndrome.

          -  History of acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina, coronary angioplasty,
             or stenting, within the past 24 weeks.

          -  Use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval, as assessed by the
             Investigator, within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Use of concomitant medication that is a strong CYP3A inhibitor or inducer within 14
             days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Class II, III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             functional classification system.

          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases (if a patient has brain metastases and is
             on steroids, the steroid dose must have been stable for at least 30 days).

          -  Active refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases (e.g.,
             inflammatory bowel disease) or significant bowel resection that, in the judgment of
             the Investigator, would preclude adequate absorption (a previous Whipple procedure is
             allowed).

          -  Additional criteria exist.
