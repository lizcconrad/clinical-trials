      Patients with the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) are at increased risk for cardiovascular
      mortality and morbidity.This increased cardiovascular risk is attributed to metabolic
      dysregulations like impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia,
      abdominal obesity and arterial hypertension, which promote oxidative stress and inflammation
      with consecutive endothelial dysfunction causing an atherogenic environment.

      Aldosterone promoted end organ damage is mainly found in the cardiovascular system and the
      kidney. Inflammation and activation of different factors promotes fibroblast growth and
      matrix production resulting in myocardial fibrosis, vascular remodelling and renal fibrosis.

      MetSyn and aldosterone are cardiovascular risk factors and it is of crucial importance to
      note that there is a connection between MetSyn and aldosterone. Other cross sectional studies
      show a direct correlation of aldosterone levels and impaired glucose metabolism in patients
      with and without the MetSyn. Taken together, aldosterone influences essential parameters of
      the MetSyn. Coincidentally parameters of the MetSyn are stimulus for an increased aldosterone
      synthesis, i.e. visceral adipocytes.

      In large scale clinical trials - RALES, EPHESUS, 4E - inhibition of MR has proven to be
      beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure and post myocardial infarction and this
      result has been confirmed for diabetic patients, who are known to have an increased
      cardiovascular risk.

      There is only very limited data on the impact of MR inhibition on metabolic, endocrine, and
      inflammatory parameters in patients with MetSyn, who have not yet suffered from
      cardiovascular events.

      Patients with the metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) are at increased risk for cardiovascular
      mortality and morbidity.

      This increased cardiovascular risk is attributed to metabolic dysregulations like impaired
      glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity and arterial
      hypertension, which promote oxidative stress and inflammation and together cause an
      atherogenic environment. MetSyn is now a well established cardiovascular risk factor and
      prevalence and incidence of MetSyn in the western world are constantly rising with 19.8
      percent prevalence in Germany 4.

      Aldosterone is predominantly synthesized in the adrenal glands. In addition, local
      aldosterone synthesis has been found in the heart and vasculature and aldosterone synthesis
      in adipocytes is discussed. Aldosterone exerts its effects via the mineralocorticoid receptor
      (MR). Besides the well described MR in the distal tubule of the kidney MR have also been
      detected in other organs such as the vasculature and a paracrine mode of action is discussed.
      Recently it has been described, that MR can be activated independent of aldosterone in
      hypertensive and obese rats 1. Aldosterone promoted end organ damage is mainly found in the
      cardiovascular system and the kidney. Inflammation and activation of different factors
      promotes fibroblast growth and matrix production resulting in myocardial fibrosis, vascular
      remodelling and renal fibrosis. Aldosterone appears to be involved in all steps of this
      process by synthesis of reactive oxygen species, induction of inflammation and growth factors
      like TGF-Beta and connective tissue growth factor. Taken together aldosterone - as the
      MetSyn- is an independent cardiovascular risk factor 5.

      MetSyn and aldosterone are cardiovascular risk factors and it is of crucial importance to
      note that there is a connection between MetSyn and aldosterone. In clinical studies it was
      clearly demonstrated that Renin and Aldosterone in patients with MetSyn are elevated 6.
      Similar results have been obtained in animal studies where obesity induced arterial
      hypertension increased renin and aldosterone levels 7-9. In a cross sectional study with 397
      participants the impact of aldosterone on the onset of arterial hypertension and MetSyn was
      analysed. In this study blood pressure was associated with aldosterone levels and aldosterone
      was correlated with waist circumference, insulin, HOMA index and an unfavourable lipid
      profile 10.

      Other cross sectional studies show a direct correlation of aldosterone levels and impaired
      glucose metabolism in patients with and without the MetSyn 10;11. Taken together, aldosterone
      influences essential parameters of the MetSyn. Coincidentally parameters of the MetSyn are
      stimulus for an increased aldosterone synthesis, i.e. visceral adipocytes 12.

      In large scale clinical trials - RALES, EPHESUS, 4E 2;3;13 - inhibition of MR has proven to
      be beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure and post myocardial infarction and
      this result has been confirmed for diabetic patients, who are known to have an increased
      cardiovascular risk. In addition, these diabetic patients had significant less hypoglycaemic
      episodes, indicating an association of MR inhibition and glucose metabolism. Despite the
      promising data of MR inhibition on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity there is only very
      limited data on the impact of MR inhibition on metabolic, endocrine, and inflammatory
      parameters in patients with MetSyn, who have not yet suffered from cardiovascular events.
