      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bevacizumab eye drop is effective in the
      treatment of recurrent pterygium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pterygium is a degenerative and proliferative fibrovascular disorder of the ocular surface.
      Patients may be asymptomatic, irritation, decreased vision, diplopia or limit ocular
      movement. The mainstay treatment is surgical removal of the head, neck and body of the
      pterygium. However, if there is no adjunctive treatment, the recurrence is unacceptably high
      which is 63% in general. Various adjunctive measures are applied to prevent recurrence
      including use of mitomycin C, beta-irradiation and surgical methods such as conjunctival and
      amniotic membrane graft. However, each method has its advantages and disadvantages.

      The histologic finding of recurrent pterygium often has aggressive fibrovascular growth.
      Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF)has been detected in increased amounts in pterygium
      tissue, compared with normal conjunctiva and it is also correlated with post-operative
      recurrence. Bevacizumab, an Anti-VEGF, binds to VEGF and prevents the interaction of VEGF to
      its receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. Administration of bevacizumab
      leads to inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation. Even
      though there are reported the efficacy of topical bevacizumab in inhibiting the impending
      recurrent pterygium, there is no study for preventing recurrence after primary pterygium
      removal.

      We conduct a prospective, randomized, double-masked, controlled trial to evaluate the
      efficacy of topical bevacizumab 0.05% eye drops for preventing recurrence in primary
      pterygium.
