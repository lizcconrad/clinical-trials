      This study is being performed to confirm the safety of tesetaxel 27 mg/m2 (Day 1) in
      combination with capecitabine 2000/mg/m2/day (in 2 equally divided doses on Days 1 through
      14) in a 21-day cycle.

    <description>Study medication, which will include tesetaxel capsules and capecitabine tablets, will be administered orally for two 21-day cycles. In each cycle, tesetaxel will be administered at a dose of 27 mg/m2 on Day 1, and capecitabine will be administered in Cohort 1 at a dose of 2000 mg/m2/day and in Cohort 2 at a dose of 1750 mg/m2/day (in 2 equally divided doses) on Day 1 through Day 14.
At the conclusion of Cycle 2, patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, appear to have benefitted from protocol therapy may receive up to 6 additional cycles under a separate protocol.</description>
