      This is a clinical study to comparatively evaluate the impact of Drawtex wound dressing
      against wound bioburden in moderately to highly exuding venous leg ulcers.

    <textblock>
      Each subject is expected to participate in this study for a period of four weeks or until
      reepithelialization, whichever occurs first. Subjects may participate for an additional
      period of four weeks or until reepithelialization, whichever occurs first: this it to be
      decided by the investigator and will be determined by the accessibility of the patient
      (physical location) and the suitability of the wound to further treatment. The maximum time
      period for the study is 8 weeks. The minimum time frame is at least 4 week, or until
      reepithelialization occurs.
