      This study will evaluate whether the addition of sitagliptin treatment provides additional
      decrease in HbA1C levels and increase in goal attainment in patients with inadequate glycemic
      control on their current oral anti-glycemic therapy in real world practice.

      To explore the change of glycemic control (HbA1c or FPG) before and after 24 weeks of
      Sitagliptin treatment in Type 2 Diabetic patients who have started Sitagliptin as add on
      therapy during the index period and received Sitagliptin continuously* for at least 24 weeks.

        Subjects with ICD-9 diagnostic codes of T2DM plus any prescription record of the
        anti-glycemic drugs included in the hospital formulary during the study period will be
        extracted from the hospital outpatient electronic database. Sitagliptin users who stayed
        with Sitagliptin for at least 24 weeks will then further identified from this diabetes
        cohort for efficacy analysis.
