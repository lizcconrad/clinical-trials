        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type I or Type II diabetes with painful, distal, symmetrical, sensory-motor neuropathy
             attributed to diabetes, of at least 6 months duration.

          -  Score of ≥3 on Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument

          -  The patient is able to satisfactorily complete, in the Investigator's judgment, the
             Cognitive Battery.

          -  Based on patient diary information collected during the Screening/Baseline period, the
             patient has completed at least 5 of 7 daily diary entries and has an average weekly
             pain rating of at least 4 on the 11-point pain rating scale, in the week immediately
             prior to randomization (Baseline Visit).

          -  Male or female, 18-85 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of complete lack of response to Pregabalin (at least 300 mg qd for 4 weeks) or
             Gabapentin (at least 1800 mg qd for 4 weeks).

          -  Other severe pain that may potentially confound pain assessment.

          -  Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 9%

          -  Hemoglobin ≤ 9 g/dL

             meds, nicotine replacements, or any other smoking cessation meds for &lt;4 weeks prior to
             randomization. Patients who are on stable doses for ≥ 4 weeks prior to randomization
             are allowed, however, there should be no adjustments to the dose of these medications
             during study.

          -  Patients currently on more than one drug for treatment of neuropathic pain (low dose
             opioids or antidepressants). Patients are allowed to participate if on a stable dose
             of for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization (Day1) and should remain stable during
             study.
