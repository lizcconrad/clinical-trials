  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized multicenter Phase III
      study of 2 multiple-dose intravenous NewGam regimens (every 3 weeks or every 4 weeks,
      continuing the patient's infusion interval in the main study NCT01012323 [NGAM-01]) for 3
      months. The primary objective of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of high
      infusion rates of NewGam.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients received NewGam via an infusion pump to control precise infusion rates. All NewGam
      infusions started at a rate of 0.01 mL/kg/min (60 mg/kg/h) for the first 30 minutes followed
      by 0.03 mL/kg/min (180 mg/kg/h) for the next 15 minutes. If tolerated, further increments
      were made at predefined patterns with the following maximum rates: 0.10 mL/kg/min (600
      mg/kg/h) in the first infusion; if this was tolerated, 0.12 mL/kg/min (720 mg/kg/h) in the
      second infusion; if this was tolerated, 0.14 mL/kg/min (840 mg/kg/h) in all subsequent
      infusions.

      If an adverse event occurred during an infusion, the rate was reduced to half the rate at
      which the event occurred or the infusion was interrupted until symptoms subsided. The
      infusion was then resumed at a rate tolerated by the patient.

    <description>QoL was assessed with the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form (CHQ-PF50), completed by a parent or guardian, in participants &lt; 14 years of age at the start of the previous study NGAM-01 and with the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36-HS) in participants â‰¥ 14 years of age. The CHQ-PF50 consists of 50 items organized into 15 subscales.The 15 subscales could be combined into 2 summary scores, physical and psychosocial. The calculated scores were transformed so that each scale had a range of 0-100. A higher score indicates better health. The SF-36-HS is composed of 36 items. Responses to the 36 items were combined to create 8 scales. The 8 scales could be further combined into 2 scores: Physical component summary and mental component summary. The item and scale scores were transformed to a range of 0-100 with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the general US population. A higher score indicates better health. For both instruments, a positive change indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>The initial dose and dosing interval for each participant was the dose and dosing interval the participant received at the end of the NGAM-01 study. The dose of NewGam, solvent/detergent treated human normal immunoglobulin 10%, remained the same throughout the study, as long as the minimum trough level of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) was above 5 g/L. If the serum IgG trough level dropped to 5 g/L or less, the dose was to be adjusted at the investigator's discretion. NewGam was supplied as a solution for infusion.</description>
