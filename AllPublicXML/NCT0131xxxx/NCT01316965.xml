  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is common in the elderly and is associated with a significant increase
      in mortality, complications, length of hospital stay and admission in long care facility.
      Several interventions have proved their effectiveness to prevent it but their combination
      within a multifaceted intervention needs to be assessed using rigorous methodology based on
      randomized study design. CONFUCIUS trial aims to measure the impact of a multifaceted program
      on the prevention of postoperative delirium in elderly.

    <description>A. Structured geriatric consultation will be performed by geriatricians of the MGT(Mobile Geriatric Teams) before surgery, including clinical examination and geriatric assessment
B. All members of medical and nursing staffs will attend a two hours training session performed by the MGTs and HELP(Hospital Elder Life Program) will be implemented in the surgical wards
C. On a quarterly basis, all members of medical and nursing staffs and MGTs will gathered to analyze medical records of patients having experienced a postoperative delirium.</description>
