      To research the effect of Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) for neonatal respiratory
      failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure(BiPAP) is similar to Non Invasive Positive Pressure
      Ventilation (NIPPV), but also gives some breaths, or extra support, to newborn infants
      through a small tube in the nose. BiPAP is safe and effective. Nevertheless, BiPAP has never
      been used in Chinese babies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newborn infants with birth weight &gt; 500 gm.

          2. Gestational age &gt; 24 completed weeks.

          3. Intention to manage the infant with non-invasive respiratory support (i.e. no
             endotracheal tube), where either: the infant is within the first 7 days of life and
             has never been intubated or has received less than 24 hours of total cumulative
             intubated respiratory support the infant is within the first 28 days of life, has been
             managed with intubated respiratory support for 24 hours or more and is a candidate for
             extubation followed by non-invasive respiratory support.

          4. No known lethal congenital anomaly or genetic syndromes.

          5. Signed parental informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Considered non-viable by clinician (decision not to administer effective therapies)

          2. Life-threatening congenital abnormalities including congenital heart disease
             (excluding patent ductus arteriosis)

          3. Infants known to require surgical treatment

          4. Abnormalities of the upper and lower airways

          5. Neuromuscular disorders

          6. Infants who are &gt; 28 days old and continue to require mechanical ventilation with an
             endotracheal tube
