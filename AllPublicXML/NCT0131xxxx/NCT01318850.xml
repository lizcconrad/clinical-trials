  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) can enhance cognitive performance in patients with
      schizophrenia improving clinical outcome. However, the neurobiological mechanism underlying
      cognitive improvement is not well understood. The aim of this study is to investigate
      functional connectivity patterns before and after the neurocognitive rehabilitation therapy,
      especially in fronto-temporal circuitry.

      A controlled randomized study will be carry out with three different groups: patients
      receiving cognitive rehabilitation treatment (CRT), patients receiving another psychological
      intervention of control and a healthy control group. A descriptive study of cases will be
      also carried out. The functional MRI (fRMI) techniques as well as voxel-based morphometry
      allow individual analysis of cases.

      The independent variable is the cognitive rehabilitation treatment. The CRT will be applied
      according to the manual of Wykes &amp; Reeder (2005) Cognitive Remediation Therapy: Theory and
      Practice, Ed: Routledge. The program has a duration of 40 sessions (one hour of duration),
      with two sessions for week during four months. It is carried out individually and utilizes
      paper and pencil tasks. The main technique utilized is the scaffolding (to provide strategies
      when the patient cannot carry out the task and to withdraw him when he is yet able of doing
      it alone) in a context of learning without errors.

      The main dependent variable is the functional connectivity cerebral pattern obtained by means
      of functional magnetic resonance. Other secondary dependent variables are neurocognitive
      functioning, the symptomatic pattern and the psychosocial functioning obtained from the
      psychometric evaluation.

      All the participants will be evaluated before and after the experimental intervention in
      neurocognitive areas (Battery will be composed by WAIS-III, RAVLT, Trail Making Test, STROOP
      color word, WCST, FAS-COWAT), symptomatic area (PANSS) and in social functioning (Social
      Functioning Scale SFS; Birchwood et al. 1990). The evaluations will be carried out by expert
      evaluators that will be blind to the experimental distribution. The statistics results
      analysis will be carry out by means of the statistical package SPSS 15.
