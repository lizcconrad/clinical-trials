  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the use of the mobile phone-based self-help system FTA, and with the
      patients as active players, will improve diabetes self-management reflected by improved
      glycemic control and lipids, self-care behaviours and lifestyle changes such as improved
      dietary habits and increased physical activity, compared with usual care. Following this; it
      is also hypothesized that this will also lead to a reduction in overall risk for diabetes
      complications (expressed by reduction in e.g., 5 year absolute risk for coronary artery
      disease as calculated using the Swedish National Diabetes Register's risk calculator) and in
      the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (e.g., as defined by the International Diabetes
      Federation). It also hypothesized that health counselling based on TTM and CBT by a diabetes
      nurse, and with individualized feedback via sms from the diabetes nurse, may have an
      important function as a supplement to the self-help system (FTA). In addition, it is
      hypothesized that the patients' health status and diabetes-related quality of life (HRQL)
      will improve. The results of this study may show that a commonly used tool like the mobile
      phone, and also mobile phone together with health counselling, fitted into the patients'
      daily life, is more effective and cost-effective than standard care.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mobile phone-based lifestyle
      tools, and health counseling using tailored SMS and individual phone-calls to the patients,
      for self-management of T2DM. Maintaining daily symptom diaries (described below) by an easy
      way of self-monitoring appear to offer a valid and reliable way of assessing behaviours. In
      addition, the patients are able to view their own registrations on the Smartphone, i.e. a
      programmable mobile phone with a touch sensitive screen. The self-help system, called the
      &quot;Few Touch application&quot;, recently tested on 12 people with T2DM at NST, University Hospital
      of North Norway (UNN), will form the basis for the patients' mobile interaction system.

    <description>The users will receive a Smartphone with the diabetes diary application (&quot;the Few Touch application&quot;), a self-help tool that consists of five main elements accessible to the user. The five elements are the food habits registration, blood glucose data management system, physical activity registration, personal goals setting and general information. While blood glucose data is automatically transferred to the phone from the blood glucose meter when the user has performed a measurement, activity data and food habits have to be entered manually by the user.</description>

    <description>The users will additionally receive health counseling based on TTM and CBT by a diabetes nurse with individualized feedback via SMS from the diabetes nurse which is based on the patient's initiative (via SMS). In addition, the diabetes nurse will call the patients three times during this period and discuss progress. Both the SMS-messages and the calls will be based on CBT according to the TTM-level. The intervention allows information to be given both in an individualized and tailored manner for each particular patient by the nurse, but also in a general way via SMS. The patients need to understand the relationship between areas such as glucose levels, diet, exercises and medicine, in the context of their own lifestyle needs.</description>
