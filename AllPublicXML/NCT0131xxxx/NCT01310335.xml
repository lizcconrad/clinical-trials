  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate effect of whole-body vibration on plasma sclerostin
      level in healthy young adult women.

      Fifteen healthy young adult women are planned to include in this study. All cases will be
      trained on a whole-body vibration (WBV) platform (Power Plate) 5 times a week for one week
      period. Training duration will be short at the beginning but progressed slowly.

      The amplitude of vibration will be 2 mm and the frequency of the vibration will be 40 Hz. The
      subjects will be asked to report negative side effects or adverse reactions in their training
      diary.

      Previbration and postvibration (just after, 10.minute and 30.minute) levels of plasma
      sclerostin will be measured on first, second and fifth day of experiment. Sclerostin levels
      will be measured by human sclerostin ELISA kit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole-body vibration has a strong osteogenic effect. The cyclic mechanical loading to the
      bone stimulates the osteocytes.

      Sclerostin, the protein product of the SOST gene, is an osteocyte-specific cysteine
      knot-secreted glycoprotein that is a potent inhibitor of bone formation. Sost/sclerostin
      levels have been reported to be reduced by mechanical stimulation.

      The aim of this study is to investigate effect of whole-body vibration on plasma sclerostin
      level in healthy young adult women.
