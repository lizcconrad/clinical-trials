      The FACT model (ACT + legal leverage in the form of judicial monitoring) will be compared to
      enhanced outpatient treatment (close outpatient follow-up without judicial monitoring).
      Seventy adults with psychotic disorders in Monroe County who are convicted of a misdemeanor
      will be randomly assigned to each treatment group and followed for 12 months. Primary
      outcomes will include criminal justice and mental health service utilization rates, treatment
      adherence, psychiatric symptoms, substance abuse, homelessness, perceived coercion, and
      consumer satisfaction. Service utilization outcomes will be tracked using established mental
      health and criminal justice databases.

      Hypotheses are:

        1. FACT (ACT plus judicial monitoring) will have a greater effect than enhanced TAU in
           promoting treatment adherence among high-risk adults with psychotic disorders.

        2. FACT (ACT plus judicial monitoring) will have a greater effect than enhanced TAU in
           preventing arrest, incarceration, emergency department and inpatient hospital use among
           high-risk adults with psychotic disorders.

      FACT (Forensic Assertive Community Treatment) is an adaptation of the Assertive Community
      Treatment (ACT) model that addresses a significant gap in our service delivery systems by
      targeting the interface between mental health and criminal justice services. ACT was
      originally developed to engage severely mentally ill adults in outpatient psychiatric
      treatment through the use of assertive outreach and comprehensive services. FACT adds legal
      leverage in the form of judicial monitoring to ACT, which is comprehensive, high intensity,
      mobile, psychiatric treatment.
