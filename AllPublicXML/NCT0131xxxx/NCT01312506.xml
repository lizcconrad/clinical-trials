    <textblock>
      This study has two ultimate goals:

        1. Understand how the original melanoma from the skin spreads to the CNS. In order to study
           this we need to collect (and compare) the original skin melanoma, the CNS melanoma, as
           well as any other melanoma that has not metastasized to the CNS.

        2. Develop a diagnostic blood test that will early identify subjects at high risk for
           developing CNS metastasis or patients who may already have CNS metastasis but the MRI or
           the CAT scan cannot yet detect it. Thus, the investigators plan to collect CSF from
           subjects like you who have melanoma CNS metastases in order to confirm the presence of
           this biomarker.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Regarding patients with distant metastatic melanoma and established melanoma CNS
             metastases who are scheduled for craniotomy:

               -  Histologically confirmed, primary cutaneous melanoma, metastatic to the CNS
                  (brain OR spinal cord OR carcinomatous meningitis) based on:

                    -  Pathologic confirmation (i.e. prior craniotomy) OR

                    -  Radiography (brain MRI or CT scan with intravenous contrast)

               -  Patients must have no contraindications for and be able to undergo lumbar
                  puncture for CSF collection

               -  Hemoglobin level of 8g/dL or higher. This can be drawn on the day of consent, or
                  will be acceptable if documented from a previous visit within the prior 30 days

               -  Subjects must have provided written, informed consent (ICF) prior to any study
                  procedures

               -  Subjects must provide a FFPE tissue block containing a biopsy from the primary
                  site

          2. Regarding patients with distant metastatic melanoma and established melanoma CNS
             metastases who are not having a craniotomy and before they undergo external beam
             irradiation or stereotactic radiosurgery (patient's and/or neurosurgeon's preference):

               -  Histologically confirmed melanoma (unknown primary, mucosal, ocular are allowed),
                  metastatic to the CNS (brain OR spinal cord OR carcinomatous meningitis) based on

                    -  Pathologic confirmation (i.e. prior craniotomy) and/or

                    -  Radiography (brain MRI or CT scan with intravenous contrast)

               -  Patients must have no contraindications for and be able to undergo lumbar
                  puncture for CSF collection

               -  Hemoglobin level of 8g/dL or higher. This can be drawn on the day of consent, or
                  will be acceptable if documented from a previous visit within the prior 30 days

               -  Subjects must have provided written ICF prior to any study procedures

          3. Regarding patients who have distant metastatic melanoma without radiographically
             detectable melanoma CNS metastases but are willing to undergo lumbar puncture:

               -  Histologically confirmed melanoma (unknown primary, mucosal, ocular are allowed),

               -  Patients must have no contraindications to lumbar puncture

               -  Hemoglobin level of 8g/dL or higher. This can be drawn on the day of consent, or
                  will be acceptable, if documented from a previous visit within the prior 30 days

               -  Subjects must have provided written ICF prior to any study procedures

          4. Regarding healthy volunteers

               -  Patients must have no contraindications to lumbar puncture (see Table 1)

               -  Patient must answer NO to all questions listed in Appendix B

               -  Hemoglobin level of 8g/dL or higher. This can be drawn on the day of consent or
                  will be acceptable if documented from a previous visit within the prior 30 days

               -  Subjects must have provided written, ICF prior to any study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For study subjects, patients with extradural lesions, i.e. those that originate from
             the bone (calvarium or vertebrae), will not be considered.

          -  Any significant psychiatric disease, medical intervention, or other conditions, which
             in the opinion of the Investigators, could impair proper discussion of the informed
             consent or compromise participation to the clinical trial.

          -  Active systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma within 2 days from the collection of
             specimens (brain tumor tissue, peripheral blood, CSF). Corticosteroids, other
             immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory and anti-epileptic medications are allowed.

          -  Patients who have undergone whole brain irradiation therapy within the last 30 days.
             Therefore neither CNS lesions nor CSF are considered suitable for collection.

          -  Patients with growing CNS lesions at an area that has previously undergone
             radiosurgery within 3 months prior to enrollment in this study. Therefore CNS tumors
             from previously irradiated areas using radiosurgery are not considered suitable for
             collection although CSF is allowed for collection.

          -  Brain abscess.

          -  Patients with new focal findings on neurological examination.

          -  Infected skin over the lumbar puncture needle entry site.

          -  Other conditions that at the opinion of the investigator are contraindicated.
