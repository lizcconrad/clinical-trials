    <textblock>
      Introduction: Dientamoeba fragilis (DF) is a commonly occurring intestinal protozoan that is
      considered a possible cause of infectious gastrointestinal disease in adults and children. DF
      has a particular high prevalence in children, and it is suspected that children present more
      symptoms in infection than adults. However, evidence of causality is lacking, treatment
      regimens are largely untested in controlled trials, and the most commonly used antibiotic
      against DF in Denmark, metronidazole, has never been tested against placebo.

      Main objective: To determine the clinical effect of metronidazole in DF-infected children
      with gastrointestinal complaints, where no other aetiology is known and no other
      gastrointestinal pathogens could be shown.

    <description>All participants receive 10 days of treatment with study drug (placebo or active). Primary outcome measure is registered on day 14 after end of treatment, using a questionnaire for the parents of the study participant.
Measuring will be done using a VAS-score scale, addressing overall level of gastrointestinal symptoms in the previous 14 days. Results will be noted as a value from 0 to 10.</description>

    <description>Secondary outcome measure will be registered using a specific realtime PCR for D. fragilis, performed on faecal samples collected from study-participant.
Results will be noted as either positive or negative.</description>
