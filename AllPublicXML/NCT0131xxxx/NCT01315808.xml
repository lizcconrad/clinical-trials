  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the HbA1c shows a rising trend in pre-diabetics and normal
      population with risk factors of developing type 2 DM. There is no known diabetes model for
      predicting incident diabetes in an individual which takes into account the rate of change of
      HbA1c (dx/dt). In such cases, the rate of change of HbA1c may give the physicians lead time
      needed to implement the Diabetes Prevention Program measures.
