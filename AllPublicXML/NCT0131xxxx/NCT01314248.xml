  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The air-QÂ® intubating laryngeal airway (ILA) is an supraglottic device used for both airway
      maintenance during routine anesthesia and as a conduit for tracheal intubation for patients
      with a difficult airway. The investigators goal for this study is to compare the performance
      of the ILA with the current standard of care the standard LMA during routine anesthesia.

      The goal for this randomized, crossover investigation is to compare a disposable version of
      the standard LMA, LMA Unique TM,with the air-Q ILA in pediatric patients. Oropharyngeal leak
      pressure is commonly used as an indicator of airway seal adequacy. Similarly, flexible
      fiberoptic bronchoscope examination is often employed to assess proper placement of airway
      devices. Our hypothesis is that the air-Q ILA is superior to the standard LMA in both these
      regards:

        1. We hypothesize that airway leak pressures will be higher with the ILA. Airway leak
           pressures will be measured by recording the circuit pressure at which an equilibrium is
           reached.

        2. We hypothesize that flexible fiberoptic view of the airway will be superior with the
           ILA. The airway view will be assessed using a previously used and published grading
           scale.
