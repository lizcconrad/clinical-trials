  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - An experimental treatment for metastatic melanoma involves cell therapy, in which
      researchers take white blood cells (lymphocytes) from the tumor tissue, grow them in the
      laboratory in large numbers, and then use the cells to attack the tumor tissue. Before
      receiving the cells, chemotherapy is needed to temporarily suppress the immune system to
      improve the chances that the tumor-fighting cells will be able to survive in the body. In
      some studies of cell therapy, individuals who have received total body irradiation (TBI) in
      addition to the chemotherapy (in order to increase the length of time that they do not
      produce white blood cells) seem to have a slightly better response to the treatment, but it
      is not known if adding radiation to the cell therapy will cause a better response for all
      individuals. Researchers are interested in comparing cell therapy given with the usual
      chemotherapy to cell therapy given with the usual chemotherapy and TBI.

      Objectives:

      - To compare the effectiveness of cell therapy given with chemotherapy to cell therapy given
      with chemotherapy and total body irradiation in individuals with metastatic melanoma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests,
           and tumor imaging studies.

        -  Participants will be divided into two groups: cell therapy with chemotherapy alone
           (group 1) or cell therapy with chemotherapy plus TBI (group 2).

        -  All participants will provide a tumor sample from either surgery or a tumor biopsy for
           white blood cell collection.

        -  Participants will have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood cells for cell
           growth and future testing, and TBI group participants will also provide stem cells to
           help them recover after radiation. (TBI participants who cannot provide enough stem
           cells will be moved to the non-radiation treatment group.)

        -  Participants will have chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (two treatments over 2 days)
           and fludarabine (five treatments over 5 days) starting 7 days before the cell therapy.
           Participants in the TBI group will also have TBI for the 3 days immediately before the
           cell therapy.

        -  All participants will receive the white blood cells, followed by high-dose aldesleukin
           every 8 hours for up to 5 days after the cell infusion to help keep the therapy cells
           alive and active. Participants will also have injections of filgrastim to stimulate
           blood cell production, and participants in the TBI group will also receive their stem
           cells.

        -  Participants will take an antibiotic for at least 6 months after treatment to prevent
           pneumonia, and will be asked to return for regular monitoring and followup visits for at
           least 5 years to evaluate the tumor s response to treatment.

      Background:

        -  Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can mediate
           the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered along with high-dose
           aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy
           preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  In a series of consecutive trials using this chemotherapy preparative regimen alone or
           with 2 Gy or 12 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) objective response rates using RECIST
           criteria were 49%, 52%, and 72%, respectively. Complete regression rates in these three
           consecutive trials were 12%, 20%, and 40%, respectively strongly suggesting that the
           addition of TBI could improve the complete regression rate. Of the 20 complete
           regressions seen in this trial, 19 are on-going at 37 to 82 months.

        -  Because of the complexity of developing selected TIL for use in adoptive transfer, we
           have recently developed a simplified method for producing TIL that is more applicable to
           use in outside institutions. Utilizing young TIL cells (sometimes with CD8 purification)
           in 105 patients, the objective response rate was 34% with a 6.6 % incidence of complete
           regressions. All patients in this trial received the cyclophosphamide fludarabine
           regimen alone.

        -  Because of the strong suggestion that the addition of TBI to the chemotherapy regimen
           could increase durable, complete regression rates in patients with metastatic melanoma,
           we are now attempting to definitively determine whether the addition of TBI to the
           chemotherapy preparative regimen can improve complete response rates, and overall
           survival in patients receiving young TIL .

      Objectives:

      -To determine, in a prospective randomized trial, the complete response rate and survival of
      patients with metastatic melanoma receiving ACT using young TIL plus aldesleukin treatment
      following either a chemotherapy preparative regimen alone, or the same chemotherapy
      preparative regimen plus TBI.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients who are 18 years or older must have:

        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma;

        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL;

        -  No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration or total body irradiation;

        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency

      Design:

      -Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected and after TIL growth is
      established patients with will be prospectively randomized to receive ACT with young TIL plus
      aldesleukin following either a non-myeloablative chemotherapy preparative regimen or this
      same regimen plus TBI.

               1. Measurable metastatic melanoma with at least one lesion that is resectable for
                  TIL generation. The lesion must be of at least 1cm in diameter that can be
                  surgically removed with minimal morbidity (defined as any operation for which
                  expected hospitalization less than or equal to 7 days).

               2. Patients with 3 or less brain metastases are eligible. Note: If lesions are
