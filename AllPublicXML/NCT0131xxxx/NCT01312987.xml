  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess what impact an integrated educational and
      feeding intervention delivered to infants and children has on growth (weight and height),
      development (cognitive and gross motor), nutrition (dietary behaviors, food insecurity, and
      micronutrient status - folate, iron, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin D), and morbidity (respiratory
      and diarrheal) outcomes. A randomized community trial was used to implement a nutrition
      intervention program consisting of monthly education sessions, a lipid-based nutrition
      supplement, and food vouchers for local staples.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All healthy children between the ages of 5-18 months old and their mothers who are
             residents of the municipalities of Santa Lucia, Magdalena and San Antonio who do not
             present any of the medical conditions listed in the exclusion criteria.

          -  Mothers have understood and signed consent forms to enable their children to
             participate in the study. They were willing to have their child participate in one or
             more blood draws, bi-monthly sessions: 1) nutrition classes and food voucher and
             lipid-based nutritional supplement and 2) height/weight monitoring, dietary intake
             questionnaire, and health outcome information. As well as the additional data
             assessments necessary to be considered active participants in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with congenital anomalies, mental retardation, severe physical handicap,
             under-nutrition caused by medical conditions that contribute to under-nutrition such
             as heart disease, kidney failure, face and throat problems that interfere with
             swallowing, medical problems interfering with the absorption of food, chronic diseases
             such as tuberculosis, etc.

          -  Children with a known allergy to peanuts and eggs will also be excluded from the
             study, 30% of children with known allergies to nuts also have an allergy to eggs.

          -  Plans to move or change their place of residence outside of the study region in the
             next 2 months would make them ineligible.

          -  Mothers who are younger than 16 years of age will be excluded from the study. Women
             younger than 16 might not understand the consent process and the importance of
             following the guidelines established in the research, therefore we chose not to
             include this group as &quot;eligible&quot; participants.

          -  Children who are &lt;= -2 standard deviations below the norm for z score for weight for
             age. These children are severely malnourished and need to be carefully followed under
             the supervision of a qualified health care provider.
