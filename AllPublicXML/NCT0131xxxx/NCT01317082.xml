  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that the use of the Pressure Right device in
      combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone would result in a lower incidence of
      postoperative vomiting (emesis) than the combination of antiemetic therapy alone.

      The study design is a randomized, double-blinded and sham-controlled evaluation of the
      adjunctive Acupressure on the P6 point with Pressure Right to reduce the incidence of PONV
      and the need for rescue antiemetics leading to an improve quality of recovery after
      laparoscopic and ENT surgery. The two proposed study groups are: Group 1 (Sham-Control) 50
      patients, will receive the sham Pressure Right (without acupressure button)30-45 min before
      induction of anesthesia and will be kept in place for 24h after discharge, and Group 2
      (Pressure Right) 50 patients, will receive the Pressure Right device 30-45 min before
      induction of anesthesia and will be kept in place for 24h after discharge. In addition, all
      100 study patients will receive a combination of antiemetics (ondansetron and dexamethasone)
      during the surgery.
