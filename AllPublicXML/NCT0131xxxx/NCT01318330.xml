      Official Title: Five-Week, Multi-center, Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate Safety of
      Homeo-GH after Intra Venus Administration for the Treatment of Graft versus Host Disease
      Patients

      Sponsor: HomeoTherapy Co.,Ltd

      Study Design: Single Group, Open Label, 5 Week, Safety Study

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of ex-vivo cultured adult human clonal
      mesenchymal stem cells (cMSC) derived from human bone marrow in subjects experiencing acute
      or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      Study Type: Interventional

    <textblock>
      Allogeneic MSCs being used in current human clinical trials are nonclonal, i.e., such MSCs
      may have other types of cells in the final stem cell product. Some concerns exist about the
      heterogeneity of these nonclonal MSCs that are isolated and expanded by the conventional
      density-gradient centrifugation method. Recently, we developed a new protocol, called the
      subfractionation culturing method (SCM), to generate single-cell-derived clonal MSC (cMSC)
      lines from whole bone marrow aspirate without employing any centrifugation step for
      mononuclear cells and enzyme treatment process. This method allowed us to rapidly establish
      single-cell-derived human clonal MSC (hcMSC) lines from raw bone marrow aspirates and to
      establish a library of these hcMSC lines (Song et al., 2008).

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of allogeneic cMSCs established by the SCM
      and manufactured in GMP facility. This phase I clinical trial is a multicenter, single dose
      study of cMSC (1 x 10e6 cMSCs/Kg recipient's bodyweight). Clonal MSCs will be infused to
      acute or chronic GVHD patients via an intravenous injection. Every patients will receive the
      same treatment
