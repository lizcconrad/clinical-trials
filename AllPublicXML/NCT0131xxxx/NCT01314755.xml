      Study Hypothesis: The peri-operative enteral administration of a proprietary immune-enhancing
      feed (IMPACT) will not reduce post-operative infective complications in patients undergoing
      major surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the Head and neck (SCCHN).

      Patients who present with SCCHN for whom surgery is the recommended treatment will, assuming
      they fulfill the eligibility criteria, be block randomised into a two-group, double-blind
      randomised controlled trial. One group will receive IMPACT, the other an iso-caloric,
      iso-nitrogenous control feed for 5 days pre and 7 days post-operatively. In both groups
      patients will be fed enterally. The feeds will be prepared in identical bottles to facilitate
      blinding. Primary outcome measures include major systemic infection, whilst secondary outcome
      measures include local infection and length of hospital stay. Follow-up will be for 30 days
      postsurgery.
