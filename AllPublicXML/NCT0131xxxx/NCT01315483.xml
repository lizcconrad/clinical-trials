    <textblock>
      In the United States, overweight (BMI &gt; 25 but &lt; 30 Kg/m2) and obesity (BMI &gt; 30Kg/m2) are
      increasing at epidemic rates. A significant association exists between being overweight or
      obese and breast cancer recurrence and survival. However, evidence continues to accumulate
      indicating that achieving or maintaining a healthy weight for height (Body Mass Index, BMI,
      18.5-25Kg/m2) is associated with a reduced risk for breast cancer and with a decrease in
      breast cancer associated mortality. Despite this, there is a lack of randomized controlled
      trials exploring this association and how the process of fat loss or being successful in
      actually reaching a healthy weight for height differentially affects biomarkers for cancer
      recurrence.

      Many dietary approaches for weight loss are currently available to the public, and each
      purports to offer advantages. However, there is little scientific evidence to indicate how
      these dietary approaches, some of which vary markedly in the foods that they limit or
      exclude, affect biomarkers for breast cancer risk. In particular, it is not know whether the
      critical factor in relation to weight and breast cancer is simply weight loss (negative
      energy balance), irrespective of the manner in which it is achieved, or if certain dietary
      approaches affect breast cancer risk biomarkers more favorably than others. Published data
      from our laboratory suggest that dietary pattern does matter, and therefore the goal of this
      study is to investigate the effects of two popular weight loss dietary approaches that differ
      in the extent to which they limit carbohydrate or fat consumption (with effects on dietary
      glycemic load) compared to a usual care group on prognostic markers for cancer recurrence in
      postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. The investigators hypothesize that in addition to the
      anticipated effects of fat loss on circulating levels of bioavailable sex steroid hormones,
      that the effects of excess fat on breast cancer prognosis can be attributed to three
      interrelated metabolic processes that affect cancer progression: altered glucose metabolism,
      chronic inflammation and excessive cellular oxidation.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to answer questions about how a dietary pattern either high or low in
      dietary carbohydrate and fat availability and fat loss influence metabolic and hormonal
      processes that may affect breast cancer recurrence. The investigators hypothesize that in
      addition to the anticipated effects of fat loss on circulating levels of bioavailable sex
      steroids, that the effects of excess fat on breast cancer prognosis can be attributed to
      three interrelated metabolic processes: altered glucose metabolism (IGF-1, IGFBP-3, glycated
      proteins), chronic inflammation (C-reactive protein, IL-6, TNF-alpha) and excessive cellular
      oxidation (8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and 8-isoprostane F-2 alpha).

      A 6 month intervention study involving 370 post menopausal women who have been treated for
      breast cancer is proposed. Randomized women, stratified by resected stage, systemic adjuvant
      therapy and body mass index (&gt; 25 and &lt; 35 Kg/m2), will serve as either a non-intervention
      control group or will follow a tailored diet-physical activity program designed to create a
      weekly negative energy balance equivalent to 3500 kcal. The intervention groups will receive
      the same physical activity protocol, but one of two diets that differ in dietary pattern.

      The specific aims are: Aim 1. Does a dietary pattern either high or low in available
      carbohydrate and fat alter the pattern of change observed in circulating factors involved in
      glucose homeostasis, chronic inflammation, cellular oxidation, and steroid hormone metabolism
      during progressive loss of body fat? The investigators will also examine how observed changes
      in these circulating factors related to changes indicators of breast cancer recurrence. Aim
      2. Do circulating factors associated with glucose homeostasis, chronic inflammation, and
      cellular oxidation display the same pattern of change in response to progressive fat loss as
      circulating analytes associated with sex steroid metabolism? Analytes of interest will be
      measured monthly throughout the study. Aim 3. Does dietary glycemic load affect the magnitude
      or rate of fat loss? Plasma adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin and plasma ghrelin will
      be measured to provide biological determinants that may help explain differences in response.

      The work proposed in this application should provide quantitative data about the importance
      of the magnitude of fat loss on metabolic and hormonal processes involved in cancer
      recurrence and provide guidance about effective dietary approaches that maximize weight loss
      benefits on breast cancer prognosis.

    <description>Diet-physical activity program creating a weekly negative energy balance equivalent to 3500 kcal. Intervention groups receive PA protocol promoting the Physical Activity Guidelines and translated in step recommendations, but one of two diets with divergent dietary patterns (opposing fat and CHO content) that do not overlap &gt;+5% in CHO and fat content. Macronutrient values reflect a 'pattern' or ratio within (LC 3:2 ratio for F:CHO; HC 1:4 ratio for F:CHO ) and between diets (LC:HC 3:1 for fat; LC:HC 1:2 for CHO). Six-week meal plans for five calorie levels available and incorporate educational material, supporting program components (e.g. self monitoring tools) and core competencies reinforcing weight loss behaviors in order to promote high levels of dietary adherence.</description>
