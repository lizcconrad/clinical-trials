  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of two treatment strategies for fatigue
      and disabilities in QFS: long term treatment with doxycycline or cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Q fever fatigue syndrome (QFS) is one of the most frequent sequelae of Q fever, and
      constitutes a significant problem in the current outbreak of Q fever. QFS leads to
      substantial morbidity and has a high socio-economic burden, related to increased use of
      healthcare facilities and absence from work. It is envisaged that over 750 patients will
      become chronically fatigued due to Q fever in The Netherlands (20% of 4000 patients from 2007
      until now). Although the outbreak appears to diminish, it is expected that Q fever will
      remain an endemic disease, and therefore this number will continue to grow. A vast medical
      consumption can be anticipated, stressing the need for an accessible and effective
      intervention and clear treatment guidelines.

      The study will contribute to a better understanding of effective treatment of QFS, providing
      evidence-based guidelines for general practitioners and medical specialists.

    <description>The total score of the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL90) measures the level of psychological distress. The SCL90 consists of 90 items scored on a 5-point scale. Scores range from 90 to 450. A low total score reflects high psychological well-being. The SCL-90 is a reliable and valid instrument.</description>

    <description>Serology consists of the antibodies IgG and IgM fase I and II and reflects the immunological respons to Coxiella burnetii of an individual subject. This will be compared to the antibody immunofluorescence titer measured at baseline.</description>

    <description>CBT will consist of a protocolized intervention of 12 sessions during a period of 24 weeks. It starts with goal setting and psycho-education on the possible role of cognitions and behavior in maintaining the fatigue. The maintaining factors will subsequently be addressed (regulation of sleep-wake cycle, gradual increasing activity, reformulating fatigue related cognitions).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females who are 18 years or older

          -  Laboratory-proven acute Q fever since the year 2007 and/or positive serology fitting a
             past infection with Coxiella burnetii;

          -  AND being severely fatigued, defined by scoring 35 or higher on the subscale fatigue
             severity of the CIS;

          -  AND being fatigued for at least 6 months;

          -  AND disabled because of the fatigue, defined by scoring 450 or higher on the SIP

          -  Subjects must sign a written informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fulfilling criteria for chronic Q fever, namely:

               -  IFA IgG fase I ≥ 1024, ≥ 3 months after acute Q fever and/or

               -  Positive Coxiella burnetii PCR on serum or tissue, 1 month after acute Q fever

          -  Acute Q fever in the setting of a prosthetic cardiac valve or aneurysm surgery or
             stenting necessitating prophylactic use of doxycycline;

          -  Pregnancy or unwillingness to use effective contraceptives during the entire study
             period;

          -  Imminent death;

          -  Inability to give informed consent;

          -  Subjects who are receiving and cannot discontinue barbiturates, phenytoin, or
             carbamazepine (these drugs may increase the metabolism of doxycycline and therefore
             reducing half-life of doxycycline);
