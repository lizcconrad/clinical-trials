  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low blood pressure or hypotension is a very important problem that is often seen in premature
      babies, especially those with low birth weight. Severe hypotension leads to significant
      problems including brain bleeds, developmental delays, kidney and liver problems, and other
      issues that can affect babies for the rest of their lives. An important aspect in the
      management of infants with hypotension is the decision of when to treat and with what agent.
      Research is being conducted to try to find the best medication to use in these situations.
      Dopamine is often used first, but it does not always prove to be effective, and it has
      several concerning side effects. This study will look at vasopressin, which has fewer side
      effects, as a first-line medication for low blood pressure in extremely low birth weight
      infants.

      Hypotheses and Specific Aims: This study will show superiority of vasopressin to dopamine in
      preterm, extremely low birth weight infants who have hypotension within the first 24 hours of
      life. We will specifically look at its ability to raise blood pressure values, improve
      clinical symptoms seen, any adverse effects, and clinical outcomes of babies being treated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension in the low birth weight (LBW) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infant is
      often encountered in the postnatal adaptation phase. Severe, prolonged hypotension
      contributes to cellular dysfunction and cell death. Systemic hypotension affects close to
      half of all ELBW infants and a significant portion of LBW infants. The true definition of
      hypotension remains to be a question. There is a linear association between birth weight,
      gestational age, and mean blood pressure but blood pressure can vary significantly in the
      first day of life. The critical period tends to be the first 24-36 hours of life as blood
      pressure tends to rise significantly in the first 72 hours of life regardless of gestational
      age. Preterm infants suffering from hypotension have a higher incidence and increased
      severity of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and
      long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae compared to normotensive preterm infants. Effects on
      other organ systems can result in renal injury, hepatic injury, and the development of
      necrotizing enterocolitis among other complications. An important aspect in the management of
      infants with hypotension is the decision of when to treat and with what agent. Dopamine is
      commonly used as first-line therapy, but issues with efficacy and its side effect profile
      have lessened its favorability over the years. Few studies compare dopamine to other agents
      as a first -line treatment. This study hopes to contribute to the literature information on
      vasopressin as a potential first-line agent for treatment of neonatal hypotension in low
      birth weight infants.

    <description>All subjects were followed by an ophthalmologist with initial exam at 4-6 weeks of age. The Stages describe the ophthalmoscopic findings at the junction between the vascularized and avascular retina. Each subject is followed until cleared by ophthalmology. For this outcome measure, the most severe stage of disease was used in analysis.
Stage 1 is a faint demarcation line. Stage 2 is an elevated ridge. Stage 3 is extraretinal fibrovascular proliferation (neovascularization). Stage 4 is sub-total retinal detachment. Stage 5 is total retinal detachment. Stages 1 and 2 do not lead to blindness. However, they can progress to the more severe stages.</description>

        <title>Retinopathy of Prematurity Stage 3 or Higher</title>
        <description>All subjects were followed by an ophthalmologist with initial exam at 4-6 weeks of age. The Stages describe the ophthalmoscopic findings at the junction between the vascularized and avascular retina. Each subject is followed until cleared by ophthalmology. For this outcome measure, the most severe stage of disease was used in analysis.
Stage 1 is a faint demarcation line. Stage 2 is an elevated ridge. Stage 3 is extraretinal fibrovascular proliferation (neovascularization). Stage 4 is sub-total retinal detachment. Stage 5 is total retinal detachment. Stages 1 and 2 do not lead to blindness. However, they can progress to the more severe stages.</description>
