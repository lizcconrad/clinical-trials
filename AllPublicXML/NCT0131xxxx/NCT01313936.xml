      This is a pilot study to determine whether doses of 15 mCi/kg and 18 mCi/kg of 131I-MIBG are
      tolerable when given with irinotecan/vincristine on a one week schedule to children and young
      adults with high-risk refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) is an active therapy in patients with widely
      metastatic, treatment-resistant neuroblastoma, where response rates are 20-40% at doses (&gt;
      15mCi/kg) requiring stem cell rescue. Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor with
      single-agent chemotherapeutic activity against neuroblastoma and other pediatric solid tumors
      in phase I and II clinical trials. With more protracted schedules (e.g. daily for 5 days/week
      x 2 weeks), the major dose-limiting toxicity is diarrhea. With shorter schedules,
      myelosuppression becomes dose-limiting. In adult solid tumors, irinotecan has been an
      effective radiosensitizer and is currently being evaluated by the Children's Oncology Group
      for this purpose in rhabdomyosarcoma protocols incorporating external beam radiotherapy.

      Compared to single-agent 131I-MIBG, the combination of topotecan (a related camptothecin) and
      131I-MIBG demonstrated superior pre-clinical activity in mouse xenograft models of
      neuroblastoma. This combination had no unexpected toxicities in a pilot clinical study. We
      have completed a clinical trial of vincristine, irinotecan, 131I-MIBG that utilized
      irinotecan on a protracted schedule (5 days per week x 2 weeks). The rationale for this
      schedule was to provide a greater degree of overlap between the radiation sensitizer
      (irinotecan) and the radiation exposure provided following 131I-MIBG infusion. This
      combination was shown to be tolerable at doses up to 18 mCi/kg 131I-MIBG. However, more
      patients experienced grade 2 and 3 diarrhea than would be customary with the dose and
      schedule of irinotecan used in that trial. It is therefore of interest to determine whether
      this combination of irinotecan, vincristine, and 131I-MIBG will be better tolerated using
      irinotecan at higher doses in a shorter schedule. The current standard schedule in Children's
      Oncology Group protocols for the combination of vincristine, irinotecan is now a higher dose
      in five, rather than 10 days. In the current pilot study, we will evaluate the tolerability
      and anti-tumor activity of this combination using irinotecan given once daily for 5 days
      only. Two 131I-MIBG dose levels will be evaluated. This study will provide the basis for a
      future randomized trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: Patients must be &gt;1 year and &lt; 30 years of age when registered on study.

          -  Diagnosis: Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic
             verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow
             with increased urinary catecholamines.

          -  Disease status: Patients must have high-risk neuroblastoma with at least ONE of the
             following:

               1. Recurrent/progressive disease at any time. Biopsy not required, even if partial
                  response to intervening therapy except in patients with only one site of
                  MIBG-avid disease that has been radiated within the preceding two months. Such
                  patients require biopsy confirmation of residual active disease, with positive
                  bone marrow biopsy being adequate confirmation of residual active disease.

               2. Refractory disease (i.e. less than a partial response to frontline therapy,
                  including a minimum of 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy). No biopsy is required
                  for eligibility for this study.

               3. Persistent disease after at least a partial response to frontline therapy (i.e.
                  patient has had at least a partial response to frontline therapy but still has
                  residual disease by MIBG scan, CT/MRI, or bone marrow). Patients in this category
                  are REQUIRED to have a biopsy (bone marrow biopsy included) of at least one
                  residual site demonstrating viable neuroblastoma.

          -  131I-MIBG Uptake: Patients must have evidence of MIBG uptake into tumor at â‰¥ one site
             within 4 weeks prior to entry on study and subsequent to any intervening therapy.

          -  Hematopoietic stem cells: Patients must have an adequate unpurged peripheral blood
             hematopoietic stem cell product, with a minimum of 2 X 106 CD34+ cells/kg available.
             Having a back-up of 2.0 x 106 viable CD34+ cells/kg unpurged PBSC is recommended but
             not required. The use of purged stem cells or autologous bone marrow as donor source
             is not allowed. The use of PBSC from an identical twin is allowed.

          -  Performance and life expectancy: Must have a life expectancy of at least 6 weeks and a
             Lansky or Karnofsky score of at least 60.

          -  Prior therapy: Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all
             prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

               1. Myelosuppressive chemotherapy and/or biologics: Patients are not required to
                  complete re-induction chemotherapy prior to study entry following relapse. Last
                  dose of any myelosuppressive or biologic therapy was given at least 2 weeks
                  before the start date for irinotecan on this protocol.

               2. Radiation: Patients must not have received radiation for a minimum of two weeks
                  prior to study entry. Patients who received radiation to the only site of
                  MIBG-avid disease within two months of study entry require biopsy confirmation of
                  residual active disease, with positive bone marrow biopsy being adequate
                  confirmation of residual active disease. A minimum of 3 months is required
                  following prior large field radiation therapy (i.e. craniospinal therapy, total
                  lung, &gt; 50% marrow space). Patients are excluded if they have received whole
                  abdominal radiation or TBI (total body irradiation).

               3. Stem Cell Transplant (SCT): Patients are eligible three months after autologous
                  stem cell transplant. Patients status post-allogeneic stem cell transplant are
                  excluded. Must meet adequate bone marrow function definition (see organ function
                  requirements, below) post-myeloablative therapy.

               4. Prior 131I-MIBG therapy: Patients may have received prior MIBG therapy, though
                  cumulative lifetime dose should not exceed 18 mCi/kg prior to study entry.
                  Patients must not have received MIBG in combination with irinotecan. For patients
                  previously treated with MIBG, at least 6 months must have elapsed since last MIBG
                  therapy.

               5. Growth factor(s): All cytokines or hematopoietic growth factors must be
                  discontinued a minimum of 7 days prior to the start date for irinotecan on this
                  protocol.

               6. Prior irinotecan and vincristine therapy: are allowed, subject to recovery of
                  adequate bone marrow function as specified in the protocol.

          -  Concomitant Therapy Restrictions: Patients must not be receiving any other anti-cancer
             agents or radiotherapy at the time of study entry or while on study. Enzyme-inducing
             anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) must not be used as these
             may interfere with irinotecan metabolism. Non-enzyme inducing anticonvulsants (Keppra,
             etc.) can be used after discussion with study chair. The use of high dose
             dexamethasone and the use of aprepitant as antiemetics is not recommended due to
             effects on irinotecan metabolism.

          -  Hematologic function: a. ANC: &gt; 750/uL (no hematopoietic growth factors within 7 days
             of the start date for irinotecan on this protocol) b. Platelet count: &gt; 50,000/Âµl,
             transfusion independent (defined as no platelet transfusion for one week).

             c. These criteria must be met by all patients, regardless of bone marrow involvement
             with tumor.

          -  Renal function: a. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) or 12-24hr Creatinine Clearance &gt;=
             60 ml/min/1.73 mÂ², OR b. Age-adjusted serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x normal for age (see
             below):
