      Primary objective:

      To compare the change in liver fat content and visceral fat mass (cm2) assessed by MRS
      (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Image), after 26 weeks of
      treatment with insulin detemir once daily or insulin NPH once daily both with metformin in
      overweight and obese type 2 diabetic subjects.

      Secondary objectives:

      To compare the two treatments with respect to:

        1. Efficacy:

             -  MRI: abdominal subcutaneous fat mass(cm2), Calculated Visceral/Subcutaneous Adipose
                Tissue Ratio.

             -  Change in HbA1c from baseline at 12 and 26 weeks of treatment.

             -  Change in Fasting plasma glucose from baseline at 12 and 26 weeks of treatment.

             -  Weight

             -  Waist and hip circumference

        2. Safety:

             -  Incidence of hypoglycaemia in the 26 weeks of treatment with insulin detemir versus
                NPH

             -  Lipid profile at the start and after 26 weeks of treatment

             -  Incidence of Adverse events during the trial

             -  Safety profile as measured by laboratory safety parameters (haematology,
                biochemistry) and physical examination/vital signs before and at the end of
                treatment

             mg daily may be included in the trial. The dose should have remained unchanged for a
             period of one month prior to randomisation and should be expected to remain unchanged
             throughout the trial period).

          -  Use of approved weight lowering pharmacotherapy (e.g. orlistat, sibutramine,
             rimonabant) or obesity induced by drug treatment (e.g. corticosteroids, NSAIDs,
             tricyclic anti-depressants, atypical anti-psychotics).

             last six months.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (treated or untreated) as judged by the Investigator

          -  Known or suspected allergy to trial product(s) or related products.

          -  Receipt of any investigational drug (NPH or insulin detemir) within 1 month prior to
             this trial.

          -  Cardiac disease defined according to NYHA class III or IV, unstable angina pectoris
             and/or myocardial infarction within the last 6 months previous to the selection.
