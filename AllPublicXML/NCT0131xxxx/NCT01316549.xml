  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fludarabine is a chemotherapy drug used extensively in bone marrow transplantation. The goal
      of this study is to determine what causes some children to have different drug concentrations
      of fludarabine in their bodies and if drug levels are related to whether or not a child
      experiences severe side-effects during their bone marrow transplant. The hypothesis is that
      clinical and genetic factors cause changes in fludarabine drug levels in pediatric bone
      marrow transplant patients and that high levels may cause severe side-effects.

    <textblock>
      Fludarabine is a nucleoside analog with potent antitumor and immunosuppressive properties
      used in conditioning regimens of pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (alloHCT) to promote stem cell engraftment.

      This is a single-center, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) study investigating the
      clinical pharmacology of fludarabine in 45 children undergoing alloHCT at UCSF Benioff
      Children's Hospital.

      Patients would receive fludarabine regardless of whether or not they decide to consent to PK
      sampling.

      Fludarabine doses will not be adjusted based on PK data.

      We will apply the combination of a D-optimality-based limited sampling strategy and
      population PK methodologies to determine specific factors influencing fludarabine exposure in
      pediatric alloHCT recipients and identify exposure-response relationships.

      Subjects will undergo PK sampling of plasma (f-ara-a) and intracellular (f-ara-ATP) drug
      concentrations over the duration of fludarabine therapy (3 to 5 days).

      To evaluate sources of variability impacting fludarabine exposure clinical data will be
      obtained from the patient's medical chart on each day of PK sampling.

      A single blood draw for the collection of DNA and genotyping of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms of genes involved in fludarabine activation, transport or elimination will
      occur in all patients.

      To assess exposure-response relationships neutrophil engraftment, treatment-related toxicity,
      and survival data will be collected through day 100 post-transplant.

        The target population for the proposed study includes children 0-17 years of age undergoing
        alloHCT for the treatment of malignant and nonmalignant disorders.

        Patients receiving fludarabine over 3 to 5 days are eligible to participate.

        All patients enrolled in this study will undergo PK sampling on the inpatient pediatric BMT
        unit at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. The proposed research will not study any patients
        receiving fludarabine in a clinic or any other out-patient setting.
