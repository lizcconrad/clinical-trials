  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the effect on functional balance of Otago exercise performed as home
      exercise versus group exercise. The investigators hypothesize that Otago exercise is more
      effective performed as group exercise than home exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study sample is drawn from persons referred to a falls outpatient clinic. Group exercise
      and home exercise are delivered by trained physiotherapists. Home exercise follows the
      original Otago exercise protocol. Group exercise is performed twice a week. The length of the
      intervention period is 3 months. The main outcome measure is the Berg Balance Scale.
