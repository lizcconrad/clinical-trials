  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of inhaled antibiotic regimens is a pilot study examining clinical and
      laboratory endpoints of patients on inhaled antibiotic treatments. We hypothesize that
      alternation therapy utilizing Cayston and Tobi will inhibit antibiotic resistance and that
      alternation therapy will result in a decreased incidence of antibiotic resistance to Cystic
      Fibrosis (CF) microbial isolates. The long term strategic goal is to develop a model
      biometric system for selecting a patient's optimal inhaled antibiotic regimen by utilizing
      clinical and microbiological parameters.
