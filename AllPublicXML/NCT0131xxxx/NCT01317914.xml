      Direct benefits to the participants, who are diagnosed with celiac disease may be substantial
      and could include lessening or prevention of GI symptoms, correction of biochemical
      abnormalities and reduction in risk for malignancies or bone disease which are most common in
      untreated celiac disease. However, the precise benefit is unknown and the motivation for this
      proposed study. If these individuals have a positive celiac serology test at the present time
      there is a high likelihood that they may have celiac disease.

    <description>To understanding the impact of undiagnosed celiac disease and the potential benefits, detection and treatment may have a substantial impact on the health of these subjects and the large numbers of Americans with undiagnosed celiac disease. The outcome measures we will be looking at are Quality of Life, GI Symptoms including diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, Tissue Transglutaminase level improvement after 12 weeks on a gluten free diet, bone density, understanding of a gluten free diet.</description>
