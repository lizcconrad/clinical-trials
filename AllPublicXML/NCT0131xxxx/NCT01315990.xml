  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this interventional study is to assess the progression free survival (one
      year) of patients with treatment of FOLFIRI and cetuximab, combined with an optional dermal
      prophylaxis.

      Further Objectives:

        1. Development of acneiforme follicular exanthema &gt;= grade 2

        2. Duration until development of acneiforme follicular exanthema &gt;= grade 2

        3. Development of paronychia

        4. Development skin fissure (hand and foot)

        5. Objective remission according RECIST 1.1

        6. Rate of secondary resections of liver metastasis with a curative approach

        7. Assessment of safety and tolerability

        8. Overall survival

        9. Progression free survival

      Subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer and confirmed KRAS-wildtype status in 1st line
      therapy will be included in this phase IV-study. Subject will receive a regimen of FOLFIRI in
      combination with Cetuximab every two weeks during study treatment phase. Treatment continues
      until

        -  disease progression

        -  complete response

        -  development of status of operability

        -  an uncontrollable exanthema grade 3 or 4 or

        -  intolerable toxicity is diagnosed. After study discontinuation or end of treatment,
           respectively, patients will be followed up until the the last patient was treated for 12
           months and has completed the 36-months follow up phase. Tumor response will be evaluated
           (according to RECIST 1.1) every 12 weeks and at the end of study treatment
