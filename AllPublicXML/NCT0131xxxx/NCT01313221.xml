  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the difference in effectiveness between treatment with etanercept 50 mg twice
      weekly (BIW) and treatment with etanercept 50 mg once weekly (QW) plus an as needed (PRN)
      topical agent for 12 weeks in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recommended starting dose of etanercept for adult plaque psoriasis patients is a 50 mg
      dose given twice a week (BIW) for 3 months followed by a reduction to a maintenance dose of
      50 mg once weekly (QW). While most patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis are
      managed satisfactorily on etanercept monotherapy, a proportion may require a modified or
      alternative treatment regimen (eg, to handle flares or loss of effect) at some point during
      their chronic management. Despite the clinical need, no published data from randomized
      controlled studies are currently available that demonstrate efficacy and safety of combined
      etanercept-based regimens in patients with plaque psoriasis.

      The addition of an as-needed topical medication to the step-down dose of etanercept 50 mg
      once weekly administered after the initial 12 week period of 50 mg twice weekly may be a
      potential option for patients who may require adjunctive therapy. This study aimed to provide
      data on this treatment option by estimating the difference in mean percent change in
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores between step-down etanercept 50 mg once
      weekly supplemented with as-needed topical medication and continuous treatment with
      etanercept 50 mg twice weekly.

      Eligible patients will be enrolled in the study and will receive etanercept 50 mg twice
      weekly for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of etanercept treatment, participants will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

    <measure>Percent Change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) From Week 12 to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or very severe (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease. Change from Week 12 to Week 24 is presented as a percentage of the Week 12 value: Week 12 value - Week 24 value / Week 12 value * 100 so that a positive change indicates improvement. Change was adjusted for treatment using a mixed model.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) From Week 12 to Week 24</title>
        <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or very severe (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease. Change from Week 12 to Week 24 is presented as a percentage of the Week 12 value: Week 12 value - Week 24 value / Week 12 value * 100 so that a positive change indicates improvement. Change was adjusted for treatment using a mixed model.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in PASI From Baseline to Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24</title>
        <description>The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is a combination of the intensity of psoriasis, assessed by the erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness) and desquamation (scaling) on a scale from none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3) or very severe (4), together with the percentage of the area affected, rated on a scale from 0 to 6. PASI scoring is performed at four body areas, the head, arms, trunk, and legs. The total PASI score ranges from 0 to 72. The higher the total score, the more severe the disease. Change from Baseline is presented as a percentage of the Baseline value: Baseline value - postbaseline value / Baseline value * 100, so that a positive change indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 12 to Week 24 in Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DQLI) Total Score</title>
        <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all. Change from Week 12 to Week 24 is calculated as: Week 12 value - Week 24 value so that a positive change indicates improvement. Change was adjusted for treatment using a mixed model.</description>

          <description>The DLQI questionnaire asks participants to evaluate the degree that psoriasis has affected their quality of life in the last week, and includes the following parameters: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure activities, work or school activities, personal relationships and treatment related feelings. Participants answer 10 questions on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); the range of the total score is 0 to 30. A score of 21 to 30 means an extremely large effect on the participant's life whereas 0-1 means that the disease has no effect at all. Change from Week 12 to Week 24 is calculated as: Week 12 value - Week 24 value so that a positive change indicates improvement. Change was adjusted for treatment using a mixed model.</description>

How many times have you seen a nurse practitioner, a physician assistant, a psychologist, a naturopath, an acupuncturist, a chiropractor, or other healthcare professional (HCP)? The number of participants with one or more visits is reported.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results aftercompletion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
