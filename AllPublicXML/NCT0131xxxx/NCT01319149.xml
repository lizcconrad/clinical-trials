  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective molecular diagnostic review on wound care outcomes. The time periods include
      March, April, May of 2010.The retrospective review would analyze the days of healing during
      the timeframe, upon the introduction of molecular diagnostic testing

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The null hypothesis would be that the introduction of molecular methods did not statistically
      affect patient outcomes. To study this hypothesis, our chief information technologist would
      query the database for any patients who are admitted during that time period. This period of
      time designated is March, April and May 2010.
