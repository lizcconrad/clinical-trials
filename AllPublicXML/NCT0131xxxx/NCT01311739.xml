    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      cyanocobalamin after the oral administration of Eligen® B12 (cyanocobalamin/SNAC), oral
      cyanocobalamin alone (commercially-available formulation) and cyanocobalamin administered
      intravenously (IV) (also a commercially-available formulation) to healthy male subjects under
      fasting conditions. The safety and tolerability of oral Eligen® B12 (cyanocobalamin/SNAC)
      versus oral cyanocobalamin alone and versus IV cyanocobalamin are also assessed.

    <measure>Serum Cobalamin Pharmacokinetics (PK)</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-dose to 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Serum cobalamin evaluated via collection and processing of blood samples from predose through 24 hours. Pharmacokinetics to be determined by non-compartmental analysis using predose to 24 hour serum cyanocobalamin non-baseline-adjusted and baseline-adjusted concentration data. Serum cobalamin PK parameters to include: Cmax, tmax, AUClast, AUC∞, t1/2, and Kel and bioavailability (% F) of oral formulations.</description>

          -  Normal organ function including renal and hepatic function.

          -  Normal hematological function.

          -  Body weight between 60 and 100 kg and within 18 - 30 kg/m2 for body mass index (BMI).

          -  Normal ranges in vital signs, ECG, and laboratory tests.

          -  Normal ranges of serum B12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use (within 14 days) of acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDs) (i.e., aspirin or ibuprofen)

             accumulation, or impairment of metabolism or excretion of the study product.

          -  History or current diagnosis of any clinically significant hematological,
             immunological, metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological, or GI abnormalities which that

             test at screening or having participated in a high-risk activity for contracting HIV;
             producing a positive HBsAg test at screening; producing a positive hepatitis C
             antibody test at screening.

             days of study entry.

          -  Significant loss or donation of blood within 56 days or plasma within 30 days prior to
             the initial dose in this study.

          -  Unsuitable for any reason to receive study product in the opinion of the Investigator.
