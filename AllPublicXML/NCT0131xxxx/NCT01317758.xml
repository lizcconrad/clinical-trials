    <textblock>
      Approximately 216, and up to 240, healthy males and non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old,
      inclusive, will be enrolled over a 5-month period into this multicenter, randomized,
      double-blinded, controlled Phase I study. Subjects who meet the entry criteria for the study
      and provide informed consent will be randomized 2:1 between adjuvanted and unadjuvanted
      vaccine and placed into one of 6 groups (see table) to receive two doses of an intramuscular
      subvirion inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine at 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mcg given
      with the adjuvant AS03 or diluent (N=216, up to 240). All eligible subjects will receive 2
      doses separated by approximately 21 days.

             first vaccination, or planned medication with analgesic or antipyretic in the week
             following first vaccination. This criterion should not preclude subjects receiving
             such medication if the need arises. However, pre-medication is to be discouraged.

             within 2 weeks prior to the first vaccination or plan receipt of such vaccines within
             42 days following the first vaccination. This is inclusive of licensed seasonal
             influenza vaccines.

          -  Have an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the site principal
             investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, would render vaccination unsafe, would

             healthy subjects&quot;.

          -  Have a history of severe reactions following previous immunization with contemporary
             influenza virus vaccines.

          -  Diastolic blood pressure is less than 60 mm Hg or greater than 90 mmHg.

          -  Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or
             medication) within 1 month prior to the first vaccination or expects to receive an

             study period.

          -  Are participating or plan to participate in another clinical trial with a licensed
             product during the 13-month study period.

          -  Have any condition that would, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or
             appropriate sub-investigator, place them at an unacceptable risk of injury or render
             them unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Participated in an influenza A/H5 vaccine study in the past in a group receiving
             vaccine (does not apply to documented placebo recipients) or have a history of A/H5

             vaccination until 30 days after the last vaccination.

          -  Other than from participation in this study, received an experimental agent (vaccine,
             drug, biologic, device, blood product, or medication), since receipt of Dose 1, or
             expects to receive an experimental agent during the 13-month study period.

          -  Are participating/have participated, since receipt of Dose 1, or plan to participate
             in another clinical trial with a licensed product during the 13-month study period.

          -  Use of anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic), new diagnosis of an

             administration of the second dose of vaccine - see Section 10.3.3. Under 6 days of
             steroids, no deferral of the second dose of vaccine is needed.

          -  Received immunoglobulin or other blood products (with exception of Rho D immune
             globulin) since receipt of Dose 1.

          -  Received any live licensed vaccines within 4 weeks or inactivated licensed vaccines
             within 2 weeks prior to the second vaccination or plan receipt of such vaccines within
             21 days following the second vaccination. This is inclusive of licensed seasonal
             influenza vaccines.

          -  Have new diagnosis of chronic medical disease or chronic medical condition since
             receipt of Dose 1 that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or
             appropriate sub-investigator, would render vaccination unsafe, would interfere with
             the evaluation of responses or is not generally seen in &quot;normal, healthy subjects&quot;.

          -  Received systemic, prescription medications for the treatment of chronic medical
             conditions, unless such use is on a PRN (as needed) basis only since receipt of Dose
             1. Non-PRN use of systemic, over-the-counter medications and PRN systemic,
             prescription medication may be allowed if, in the opinion of the investigator, they
             pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of
             immunogenicity/reactogenicity. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications;
             vitamins; and contraceptives are also permitted.

          -  Received pre-medication with analgesic or antipyretic agents in the 6 hours prior to
             second vaccination, or planned medication with analgesic or antipyretic in the week
             following second vaccination. This criterion should not preclude subjects receiving
             such medication if the need arises. However, pre-medication is to be discouraged.

          -  Hospitalized for psychiatric illness, history of suicide attempt, or confinement for
             danger to self or others since receipt of Dose 1.

          -  New occurrence or new awareness of Guillain-Barré Syndrome since receipt of Dose 1.

          -  Any unresolved or continuing solicited or unsolicited Grade 2 or greater severity
             adverse events, including reactogenicity events, that have occurred since receipt of
             Dose 1 without a clear, alternative etiology. Unresolved or continuing Grade 1 adverse
             events are permissible unless, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or
             appropriate sub-investigator, they would render vaccination unsafe, would interfere
             with the evaluation of responses or are not generally seen in &quot;normal, healthy
             subjects&quot;.

          -  Grade 2 or greater severity clinical safety lab values (according to the toxicity
             table, Section 11.1.1.2) that do not return to Grade 1 or less prior to the second
             vaccination. If the clinical safety lab values return to Grade 1 or less, vaccination
             should be rescheduled within the acceptable window for the second vaccination - see
             Section 10.3.3. Subjects who experienced a Grade 3 or above clinical safety laboratory
             adverse event since receipt of Dose 1 should be excluded from receipt of second
             vaccination. Subjects who had a Grade 3 or above clinical safety laboratory adverse
             event prior to first vaccination will be evaluated by the site principal investigator
             and DMID Medical Monitor to determine receipt of second vaccination.

          -  Have an acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than or equal to 100.4
             degrees F, within 3 days prior to the second vaccination. Vaccination of subjects
             should be deferred until acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than or
             equal to 100.4 degrees F, has resolved. If resolution occurs, vaccination should be
             rescheduled within the acceptable window for the second vaccination - see Section
             10.3.3.

          -  Emergence of Grade 2 or greater severity signs or symptoms since receipt of Dose 1
             that could confound or confuse assessment of vaccine reactogenicity.

          -  Any new clinical findings since receipt of Dose 1, which in the opinion of the site
             principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, would compromise the safety of
             the subject or would interfere with the evaluation of responses or successful
             completion of the study.

          -  Plan to travel outside the U.S. in the time between the second vaccination and 21 days
             following the second vaccination.

          -  Subject refuses further vaccination. Subjects who do not receive the second
             vaccination will be asked to return for safety assessments and for scheduled venous
             blood sample collections for clinical safety laboratory and immunogenicity evaluations
             and will be followed for the duration of the study - see the protocol-specific Manual
             of Procedures (MOP) for further details.

          -  Subject withdraws consent. The subject may withdraw their consent for study
             participation at any time and for any reason, without penalty.
