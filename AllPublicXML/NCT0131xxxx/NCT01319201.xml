      Part I: Survey of Coronary Artery Calcification and Stenosis in Participants with Different
      Glycaemic Status

      Aims:

      To evaluate coronary artery calcification and stenosis in community-dwelling adults with
      different glycaemic status, using dual-source CT angiography (CTA)

      Study Subjects and Methods:

      200 adults with normal glucose regulation (NGR), 200 with impaired glucose regulation (IGR)
      and 200 with type 2 diabetes were recruited from an urban community of Shanghai, who then
      underwent a comprehensive examination including questionnaire, anthropometric measurements,
      biochemical analysis and CTA.

      Part II: Follow-up of Cardiovascular Events and Re-evaluation of Coronary Artery
      Calcification and Stenosis

      Aims and Methods:

      To investigate the development of cardiovascular diseases in subjects recruited in part I and
      re-evaluate coronary artery calcification and stenosis using CTA after 3-year follow-up

      To identify the predictive value of coronary artery calcification and stenosis with future
      risks of cardiovascular diseases and the possible development of coronary artery disorders
      among participants with different glycaemic status
