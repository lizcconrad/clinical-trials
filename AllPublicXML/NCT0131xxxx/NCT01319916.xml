        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Healthy, non-smoking males and nonpregnant, nonlactating females who are 18 to 65
             years of age, inclusive, on Day 1A.

             2. Body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to ≤ 30.0 at within 28 days before the dose of study
             material.

             3. Stable weight (e.g., approximately ± 10 lbs), in the judgment of the investigator,
             for at least 3 months before Day 1A.

             4. Sufficient abdominal tissue surface for which 50 injections spaced on 1 cm grid (4
             cm x 9 cm square) can be safely administered into fat tissue.

             5. Fasting glucose within normal limits (i.e., 75-100 mg/dL) at within 28 days before
             the dose of study material.

             6. Fasting hemoglobin A1c within normal limits for the laboratory designated for this
             trial (e.g., 4 - 5.9%) at within 28 days before the dose of study material.

             7. Fasting triglycerides within normal limits for the laboratory designated for this
             trial (e.g., &lt; 150m/dL) at within 28 days before the dose of study material.

             8. Fasting cholesterol within normal limits for the laboratory designated for this
             trial (e.g., &lt; 200 mg/dL) at within 28 days before the dose of study material.

             9. Females must have a negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test result
             from a sample obtained within 28 days before the beginning of the confinement period
             and again after admission to the research facility for the confinement period, but
             before the dose of study material. Females must agree to practice adequate
             contraception, in the judgment of the investigator, during the course of the trial.

             10. Negative hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV test results. 11. The subject is
             expected to comply with and understand the visit schedule and all of the
             protocol-specified tests and procedures.

             12. The subject is medically able to undergo the administration of study material as
             determined by clinical and laboratory evaluations obtained within 28 days before Day
             1A for which the investigator identifies no clinically significant abnormality.

             13. Signed informed consent obtained before any study-specific procedure is conducted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. History of any intervention (e.g., liposuction) or trauma associated with the
             abdominal area, which in the judgment of the investigator, may affect subject's safety
             or other evaluations of treatment.

             2. Subjects who, for any reason, are on active diet, calorie restriction, or
             attempting to lose weight.

             3. Blood donation of 500 mL or blood transfusion within 60 days before Day 1A, or
             plasma donation within 7 days before Day 1A.

             4. Diagnosis of lipodosis (e.g., Gaucher, Niemann-Pick, or Fabry disease) or other
             confounding metabolic diseases.

             5. History of hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides &gt; 200 mg/dL), hypercholesterolemia
             (cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dL), or hyperlipidemia.

             6. Use of statins (e.g., Vitorin, Lipitor, Lopid) or other lipid-lowering agent (e.g.,
             nicotinic acid) within 28 days or five (5) half-lives, whichever is greater, before
             Day 1A.

             7. History of diabetes or screening results indicative of diabetes. 8. Use of
             antiglycemic agents at any time before screening. 9. Use of any medication that
             results in systemic exposure beginning during the screening period.

             10. Any medical condition (e.g., respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic,
             neurological disease, uncontrolled hypertension, thyroid dysfunction) that would
             interfere with laboratory or safety assessments, compromise the ability of the subject
             to undergo study procedures, or compromise the subject's ability to give informed
             consent.

             11. Treatment with oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin) within 10 days before
             Day 1A; anticipated need for agents with anticoagulative effects during the course of
             the trial.

             12. History of sensitivity to any components of the study material or topical
             anesthetics (e.g., lidocaine, benzocaine, novocaine).

             13. Previous enrollment into this trial or treatment with ATX-101 or agents containing
             deoxycholate.

             14. Treatment with an investigational agent within 28 days before Day 1A.
