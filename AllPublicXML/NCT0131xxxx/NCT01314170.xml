        Inclusion Criteria:

        Neovascular glaucoma group:

          1. Patient with neovascular glaucoma whose intraocular pressures which must be above 21
             in at least three measurements, at different times in at least two different days
             during one month, despite maximum tolerated medical therapy.

          2. Visual acuity better than hand movements in the study eye.

          3. Patients 18 years or more.

          4. Patients with fixed residence in the health district where the surgery will be
             performed.

          5. Patients who fit the term of consent.

        Group post-trabeculectomy failure:

          1. Patients diagnosed with primary open angle glaucoma, pseudoesfoliação, pigmented or
             primary angle closure who underwent surgery with trabeculectomy procedure after
             failure of at least two months of surgery. The pressure must be above 21 in at least
             three measurements, at different times in at least two different days during one
             month, despite maximum tolerated medical therapy.

          2. Patients diagnosed with primary open angle glaucoma, pseudoesfoliação, pigmented or
             primary angle closure who underwent surgery with trabeculectomy procedure after
             failure of at least two months for surgery and who can not afford the expenses of
             medical treatment. The pressure must be above 21 in at least three measurements, at
             different times in at least two different days during one month.

          3. Visual acuity better than hand movements in the study eye.

          4. Patients 18 years or more.

          5. Patients with fixed residence in the health district where the surgery will be
             performed.

          6. Patients who fit the term of consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Group post-trabeculectomy failure:

          1. Presence of staphyloma that does not allow the procedure.

          2. Presence of history of scleritis

          3. Presence of psychiatric disorder that has required hospitalization.

          4. Presence of retinal detachment surgery with placement of a buckle or track.

          5. Presence of corneal opacity that could prevent the adequate view of the anterior
             chamber.

          6. Presence of shallow anterior chamber that would prevent the placement of the implant.

          7. Presence of vitreous in aphakia or anterior chamber.

          8. Presence of psychiatric disorder that has required hospitalization.

        Neovascular glaucoma group:

          1. Presence of staphyloma that does not allow the procedure.

          2. Presence of history of scleritis.

          3. Presence of corneal opacity that could prevent the adequate view of the anterior
             chamber.

          4. Presence of shallow anterior chamber that would prevent the placement of the implant.

          5. Presence of vitreous in aphakia or anterior chamber.

          6. Presence of retinal detachment surgery with placement of a buckle or track.
