    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study alternative treatments for the skin disease
      pemphigus (a rare autoimmune blistering disorder of the skin) by using sirolimus, an
      immunosuppressive drug. Immunosuppressive drugs inhibit or prevent the activity of the immune
      system and are commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, and organ
      transplantation rejection.

      The purpose of this study is to explore a new medication for the skin disease termed
      pemphigus. Our specific aim is to determine whether the use of sirolimus will allow for a
      decrease in the dosage or possibly eliminate the need for corticosteroids, which so far is
      the only type of drug that can control this disease.

      Pemphigus is an autoimmune disease characterized by blistering, caused by autoantibodies
      against certain cells in the skin. This disease most commonly occurs in individuals ages 50
      and older, and it presents as painful shallow erosions and/or blisters in the mouth and/or
      skin. Pemphigus is very painful and uncomfortable, associated with impaired quality of life
      and significant morbidity. Severe or untreated cases of pemphigus can become fatal if the
      involved surface area becomes large enough to cause dehydration and/or infection. The first
      line of therapy, and the standard of care, for pemphigus remain to be systemic
      corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids have many known side effects, especially when used
      for a long time. Many cases of pemphigus are insufficiently controlled with corticosteroids
      alone and require the addition of other immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine,
      cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or a variety of other therapies used off-label. All
      of these treatments are not always successful and have undesirable side effects, including
      increased risk of malignancy and infections. Although these treatments can offer some relief
      from the disease, they are also often the cause of many side effects.

      Sirolimus (formerly known as rapamycin) is a drug commonly used after renal transplants to
      prevent organ rejection. In this study, pemphigus subjects with active disease will begin
      taking sirolimus in conjunction with corticosteroids, using a similar regimen used for organ
      transplantation to treat pemphigus. While increasing sirolimus and decreasing the
      corticosteroids, subjects will be monitored over a 12 month period to evaluate their disease
      response. The purpose of this study is to observe data trends.

      Our specific aim is to determine whether the use of sirolimus will allow for a decrease in
      the dosage of the corticosteroid prednisone, which so far is the only type of drugs that can
      control these diseases, without making the pemphigus worse.

    <description>Measurement of disease severity will be quantified using ABSIS (Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score). Improvement in disease control is quantified by the maintenance or improvement of ABSIS score while reducing steroid dosage.

    <time_frame>Study early termination by investigator - no participant completed any visits of the study - no measurements taken</time_frame>
    <description>The statistical goal is to observe &quot;success,&quot; an improvement in disease control while up-titrating sirolimus dosage. As there will be no control group, the subject or progress at the end of the study will be compared to their baseline at the beginning of the study. The subject and disease severity at the beginning of the study will be compared to the disease severity at each visit and be correlated with the dosage of sirolimus and corticosteroid. However, since no patient completed the study, the outcome and any data collected was not assessed.</description>

    <description>For low to moderate immunologic risk, the loading dose is 6mg immediately after transplantation, followed by 2mg PO Qday in conjunction with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. After 2-4 months, cyclosporine should be discontinued over 4-8 weeks while titrating sirolimus drug concentrations within the target-range with whole blood trough concentrations every 1-2 weeks. Monitoring is needed because cyclosporine inhibits the metabolism of sirolimus, and discontinuation of cyclosporine can lead to lower levels of sirolimus. In high immunologic risk patients, the loading dose is 15mg after transplantation, followed by 5mg PO Qday in conjunction with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for 12 months. A whole blood trough level is recommended between days 5 and 7 with adjustment to the daily dose.</description>

        <title>Improvement of ABSIS Score While Reducing Steroid Dosage</title>
        <description>Measurement of disease severity will be quantified using ABSIS (Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score). Improvement in disease control is quantified by the maintenance or improvement of ABSIS score while reducing steroid dosage.
No results as study has been terminated early by the investigator.</description>

        <title>Statistical Measures</title>
        <description>The statistical goal is to observe &quot;success,&quot; an improvement in disease control while up-titrating sirolimus dosage. As there will be no control group, the subject or progress at the end of the study will be compared to their baseline at the beginning of the study. The subject and disease severity at the beginning of the study will be compared to the disease severity at each visit and be correlated with the dosage of sirolimus and corticosteroid. However, since no patient completed the study, the outcome and any data collected was not assessed.</description>
