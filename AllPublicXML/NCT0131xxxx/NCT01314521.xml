    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine clinical characteristics of Korean adolescents with
      depression who have suicidal ideation and behavior. We formulate those hypotheses.

        1. Being bullied in peer relationships, excessive use of internet, excessive
           extra-curricular tutoring, sexual abuse in childhood, physical abuse and emotional
           neglect are risk factors of suicide in adolescents.

        2. Depression of parents and negative child-rearing attitude are risk factors of suicidal
           ideation and behavior in adolescents.

        3. Emotional quotient (EQ) and resilience of adolescent are protective factors of suicide.

      Korea has reported the highest suicide rate among OECD members and according to the data from
      the Korea national statistical office, suicide is the second major cause of death in
      adolescents and is increasing. Depression, one of the well-known risk factors of suicide in
      adolescents, can cause maladjustments to school and family life, problems of interpersonal
      relationship and drug abuse so that work to trigger the suicidal ideation and behavior. In
      his study, we planned to examine the relationship between suicidal ideation and behavior and
      several risk factors by using the standardized diagnostic clinical interview, especially an
      objective suicide evaluating method which has recently developed.
