  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare different estimates of calculating creatinine
      clearance by mathematical formula and compare them to creatinine clearance based on a timed
      urine collection in patients who received high-dose methotrexate for the treatment of primary
      CNS lymphoma or CNS involvement of systemic lymphoma.

      We intend to perform a retrospective chart review to identify a serum creatinine-based
      equation that gives the best estimate of CrCl as compared with an equation derived from a
      24-hour urine collection.

      Study subjects will be identified using the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Dana-Farber
      Cancer Institute's Adult Pharmacy systems to identify patients who received high-dose
      methotrexate. Data will be collected starting with December 31, 2010 and proceeding
      chronologically backwards until the target enrollment of 40 patients is reached.
