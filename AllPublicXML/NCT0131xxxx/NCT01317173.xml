    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is a progressive disorder that has been influenced with many factors.
      Most of the patients has altered Ca P metabolism and these dis orders are the contributing
      factors of the disease progression. It has been recently documented that FGF23 and Klotho are
      the key factors of PTH secretion Ca-P metabolism. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of
      Klotho and FGF23 on the progression of stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease.
