      and serological markers in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The focus will be on
      L-arginine metabolism and to clarify its influence on endothelial function.

      The objectives of the current study are to identify and evaluate new prognostic non-invasive
      and serological markers in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The focus will be on
      L-arginine metabolism and to clarify its influence on endothelial function. The investigators
      also want to evaluate differences in plasma concentrations of L-arginine/NO metabolites and
      non-invasively assessed endothelial function based on specific PH-therapy.

      Furthermore, the investigators aim to transfer the results gained from the investigators
      study population to in-vitro systems in order to carefully characterize the involved signal
      transduction pathways. Thereby the investigators hope to identify potentially new therapeutic
      targets in PH or patient subgroups preferably benefitting from established therapeutic
      options.

    <description>This group consists of patients with a newly diagnosed PH (Class I or IV). First blood sampling takes place before initiation of PH therapy (0 months), the following measurements will be performed after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months under specific therapy.
Initiation of standard therapy is performed directly after baseline visit / study inclusion. No special study medication will be used.
Intervention: a) Device: EndoPAT measurement and b) Biological/Vaccine: Blood Test</description>

    <description>This group consists of patients under ERA monotherapy at timepoint of inclusion. Observation period is one year to detect intraindividual changes in endothelial dysfunction measured by L-arginine/NO-metabolites after 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months under investigation.
Specific PAH therapy has been started prior to the study for medical reasons and will be continued throughout.

    <description>EndoPAT (Itamar Medical Ltd, Ceasarea, Isreal) quantifies the endothelium-mediated changes in vascular tone, elicited by a 5-minute occlusion of the brachial artery (using a standard blood pressure cuff). When the cuff is released, the surge of blood flow causes an endothelium-dependent Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD). The dilatation, manifested as Reactive Hyperemia, is captured by EndoPAT as an increase in the PAT Signal amplitude. A post-occlusion to pre-occlusion ratio is calculated by the EndoPAT software, providing the EndoPAT index. EndoPAT is FDA-cleared and CE-marked.</description>

    <description>It is hypothesized that L-arginine/NO-metabolites are altered in pulmonary hypertension depending on disease severity. Moreover, polymorphisms in L-arginine/NO-metabolism modifying factors may influence disease severity. Analysis will be performed following established/published protocols after isolation from whole blood.</description>
