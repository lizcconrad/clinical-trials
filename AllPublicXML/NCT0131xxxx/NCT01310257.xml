  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to improve understanding of the assessment of pain experience in patients with
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The current study will be divided into two parts. In Study
      1, the investigators will analyse existing questionnaires relevant to the mechanisms and
      therapeutic targets of knee OA to establish discrete dimensions that discriminate between the
      different mechanisms of pain. On the basis of this analysis, the investigators will refine
      the questionnaires to maximise their sensitivity to knee OA. In Study 2, the investigators
      will seek to confirm the factor structure identified in the questionnaires in Study 1 and
      explore potential mediator and moderator variables between pain and quality of life using the
      refined measures. The investigators will also evaluate Quantitative Sensory Testing as a
      predictor of OA knee pain.

    <measure>Questionnaire set assessing physical symptoms, cognitive and emotional factors, and quality of life in knee OA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be assessed after diagnosis of OA of the knee. There is no specific time point after diagnosis, because we are interested in a broad spectrum of patients with OA of the knee. All patients will be assessed at enrollment into the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be given a questionnaire set assessing pain (nociceptive and neuropathic), anxiety, depression, fatigue, illness belief, pain self-efficacy, coping, helplessness and quality of life, associated with OA of the knee. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire set will be reported, including results from Rasch Analysis, Cronbach's Alpha and results from Factor Analysis.</description>

        We aim to recruit a cross section of participants covering a broad spectrum of people with
        OA of the knee. Community participants will be identified from a cohort of patients who
        have already agreed to be contacted about future research studies. Additional participants
        will be identified from clinics at Nottingham University Hospitals and Sherwood Forest
        Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, GP surgeries in the local area and patients on a knee OA
        pathway from Nottingham Healthcare partnership. These sources of recruitment will include
        those attended rheumatology and orthopaedic specialist clinics for knee OA and rheumatology
        outpatients at the Queens Medical Centre (QMC)
