      This is a non-randomized phase II trial of targeted radiotherapy (RT) administered
      concurrently with panitumumab in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of
      the head and neck. This protocol addresses patients with medical comorbidities that make them
      poor candidates for concurrent chemotherapy. Radiotherapy treatment will be directed at
      disease visible on diagnostic imaging modalities and the ipsilateral hemi-neck, sparing
      elective regions in the contralateral N0 hemi-neck with less than 20% chance of microscopic
      involvement. We explore the following hypothesis: Can acceptable locoregional disease control
      be obtained with less treatment-related morbidity by focusing RT on regions of gross disease,
      sparing regions with a low risk of harboring subclinical disease from elective RT?

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven primary squamous cell carcinoma arising in the oral cavity,
             oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx.

          -  Stage III, IVA, or IVB disease (locally advanced with no systemic metastases and
             without bilateral nodal disease, i.e., N2c).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â‰¤2 with a life expectancy
             &gt;12 months.

          -  Patients are eligible if they have concurrent medical conditions that render them poor
             candidates for chemotherapy. Patients are considered to be in this group if any of the
             following criteria is met: Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl (or estimated creatinine
             clearance &lt;50mL/min); Insulin dependent diabetes; SGOT, SGPT, or alkaline phosphatase
             &gt;2.5 x upper limit of normal; History of significant CAD (myocardial infarction [MI],
             coronary artery bypass graft [CABG], coronary stents, symptomatic angina); Congestive
             heart failure [CHF] (LVEF &lt;40% by echocardiogram or MUGA); nephropathy; Prior history
             of malignancy treated with chemotherapy; Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
             [COPD], defined as FEV1 &lt;1L; In the opinion of the treating physician, patient would
             not tolerate the administration of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  The patient is medically fit to tolerate a course of definitive RT.

             &gt;1000/ml, hematocrit &gt;24%, and platelet count &gt;50,000/ml. Patients with hematocrit
             between 20% and 24% should undergo transfusion, and may be enrolled provided their
             hematocrit reaches &gt;24%.

          -  The patient may have had a prior malignancy but must be disease-free for three years
             prior to study entry. A history of superficial non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix less than three years will be allowed.

             excisional neck biopsy will not be eligible.

          -  Spindle cell squamous carcinoma or mixed carcinoma/sarcoma.

          -  Scleroderma or active connective tissue disorder (Lupus).
