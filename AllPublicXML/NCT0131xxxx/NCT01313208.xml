    <measure>Percentage of Participants With RAPID3 Remission or Low Severity at Each Time Point</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) is adapted from the standard HAQ and is used for the computation of the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3). The RAPID 3 includes the 3 Core Data Set measures of physical function, pain, and patient global estimate. The score for physical function ranges from 0 to 10 and is calculated by adding the ten activities of daily living, each scored from 0 to 3 by the patient (0=&quot;without any difficulty&quot;, 1=&quot;with some difficulty&quot;, 2=&quot;with much difficulty&quot;, and 3=&quot;unable to do&quot;) and dividing the total raw score by 3. Pain and global estimate of health are measured on a likert scale from 0 to 10, both scored 0 (best) to 10 (worst). The three 0-10 scores for physical function, pain, and global assesment of health are added together for a composite score of 0 to 30. The RAPID3 composite score includes 4 categories: High Severity &gt; 12, Moderate Severity = 6.1 - 12, Low severity = 3.1 - 6, and Remission ≤ 3.</description>

These domains are Sleep Disturbance (4 items), Sleep Adequacy (2 items), Sleep Quantity (1 item), Daytime Somnolence (3 items), Snoring (1 item), and Shortness of Breath (1 item). Sleep Disturbance measures the ability to fall asleep and to maintain restful sleep. In MOS Sleep norm-based scoring, all scales are scored on the same metric, where 50 is the mean for the general U.S. population and 10 is the standard deviation. Higher scores indicate more severe sleep problems. Least Squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

    <description>The MOS-Sleep comprises 12 items and measures key sleep structures across 6 domains. These domains are Sleep Disturbance (4 items), Sleep Adequacy (2 items), Sleep Quantity (1 item), Daytime Somnolence (3 items), Snoring (1 item), and Awakening short of breath or with a headache, (1 item). Sleep Adequacy measures sleep sufficiency in terms of whether the participant sleeps enough to provide restoration of wakefulness. In MOS Sleep norm-based scoring, all scales are scored on the same metric, where 50 is the mean for the general U.S. population and 10 is the standard deviation. For sleep adequacy a higher score indicates better sleep quality. Least Squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

These domains are Sleep Disturbance (4 items), Sleep Adequacy (2 items), Sleep Quantity (1 item), Daytime Somnolence (3 items), Snoring (1 item), and Awakening short of breath or with a headache, (1 item). The scale also produces two indices. The Sleep Problems Index-I is drawn from 6 items in the four domains including Sleep Disturbance (2 items), Sleep Adequacy (2 items), Shortness of Breath (1 item), and Daytime Somnolence (1 item). In MOS Sleep norm-based scoring, all scales are scored on the same metric, where 50 is the mean for the general U.S. population and 10 is the standard deviation.

             lack of effect. The use of the biologic must not have occurred within 2 months of the
             first dose of investigational product. Acceptable prior use of biologics include the
             following examples:

          -  No more than 4 injections of adalimumab

          -  No more than 8 (50 mg) injections of etanercept

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving DAS28 Low Disease Activity at Week 12</title>
        <description>Low disease activity is defined by a disease activity score (28 joint) calculated using the C-reactive protein formula (DAS28-CRP) of less than 3.2. The DAS28 is a composite score to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, derived from the following variables: • The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count; • C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level • Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a likert scale from 0 (no activity at all) to 10 (worst activity).
The DAS28 score ranges from zero up to approximately ten. DAS28 scores above 5.1 indicate high disease activity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving DAS28 Remission at All Other Timepoints</title>
        <description>Remission is defined by a DAS28 score less than 2.6. The DAS28 is a composite score to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, derived from the following variables:
The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count;
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a likert scale from 0 (no activity at all) to 10 (worst activity).
The DAS28 score ranges from zero to ten. A DAS28 above 5.1 indicates high disease activity.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With RAPID3 Remission or Low Severity at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>The Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) is adapted from the standard HAQ and is used for the computation of the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3). The RAPID 3 includes the 3 Core Data Set measures of physical function, pain, and patient global estimate. The score for physical function ranges from 0 to 10 and is calculated by adding the ten activities of daily living, each scored from 0 to 3 by the patient (0=&quot;without any difficulty&quot;, 1=&quot;with some difficulty&quot;, 2=&quot;with much difficulty&quot;, and 3=&quot;unable to do&quot;) and dividing the total raw score by 3. Pain and global estimate of health are measured on a likert scale from 0 to 10, both scored 0 (best) to 10 (worst). The three 0-10 scores for physical function, pain, and global assesment of health are added together for a composite score of 0 to 30. The RAPID3 composite score includes 4 categories: High Severity &gt; 12, Moderate Severity = 6.1 - 12, Low severity = 3.1 - 6, and Remission ≤ 3.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the:
28 tender joint count (TJC),
28 swollen joint count (SJC),
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = lowest disease activity and 10 = highest;
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = lowest disease activity and 10 = highest.
The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. CDAI remission is defined as a score ≤ 2.8.</description>

        <title>Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the:
28 tender joint count (TJC),
28 swollen joint count (SJC),
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10 where 0 = lowest disease activity and 10 = highest;
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10 where 0 = lowest disease activity and 10 = highest).
The CDAI score ranges from 0 to 76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity.</description>

        <description>The simplified disease activity index (SDAI) is a composite measure that sums the total number of:
28 tender joint counts,
28 swollen joint counts,
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10 where 0= lowest disease activity and 10 = highest;
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = lowest disease activity and 10 = highest, and
C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/dL.
The SDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 86 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. SDAI remission is defined as a score ≤ 3.3.</description>

        <title>Simplified Clinical Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Score at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>The simplified disease activity index (SDAI) is a composite measure that sums the total number of:
28 tender joint counts,
28 swollen joint counts,
Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = lowest disease activity and 10 = highest;
Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = lowest disease activity and 10 = highest, and
C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/dL.
The SDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 86 where lower scores indicate less disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI asks about the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and errands and chores). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 indicating no difficulty to 3 indicating inability to perform a task in that area. The overall score is the average of each of the 8 category scores and ranges from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability.</description>

        <title>Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Functioning Domain Score at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>The SF-36 measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The individual domain scores are calculated and transformed to range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better level of functioning. The physical functioning subscale assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. Least Squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

          <title>Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Role-Physical Domain Score at Each Time Point</title>
          <description>The SF-36 measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The individual domain scores are calculated and transformed to range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better level of functioning. The role-physical subscale assesses limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems. Least squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Role-Emotional Domain Score at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>The SF-36 measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). The individual domain scores are calculated and transformed to range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life. The role-emotional subscale assesses limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems. Least squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <description>This self-administered questionnaire is designed to address impairment to the work productivity and activity of participants due to rheumatoid arthritis in the past 7 days. Percent of work time missed is derived from the number of hours of work missed due to rheumatoid arthritis symptoms as a percentage of total hours that should have been worked. A higher percentage indicates more hours missed. Least squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI): Percent Activity Impairment at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>This self-administered questionnaire is designed to address impairment to the work productivity and activity of participants due to rheumatoid arthritis. Percent activity impairment is derived from the patient’s assessment of the degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affected their regular daily activities. A higher percentage indicates greater impairment and less productivity. Least squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <description>This self-administered questionnaire is designed to address impairment to the work productivity and activity of participants due to rheumatoid arthritis in the past 7 days. Percent overall work impairment takes into account both hours missed due to rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and the participant’s assessment of the degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affected their productivity while working. A higher percentage indicates greater impairment and less productivity. Least squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Participant Assessment of Fatigue at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>The participant's assessment of fatigue was collected using a single-item 100 mm visual analogue scale. The participant was asked to draw a vertical line through a horizontal line to indicate the degree of fatigue they experienced because of their condition over the past week. The horizontal line is 100 mm in length with ‘0’ and ‘no fatigue’ on the left end of the line and ‘100’ and ‘extreme fatigue’ on the right end of the line. Least squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Disturbance Scale at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>The MOS-Sleep comprises 12 items and measures key sleep structures across 6 domains. These domains are Sleep Disturbance (4 items), Sleep Adequacy (2 items), Sleep Quantity (1 item), Daytime Somnolence (3 items), Snoring (1 item), and Shortness of Breath (1 item). Sleep Disturbance measures the ability to fall asleep and to maintain restful sleep. In MOS Sleep norm-based scoring, all scales are scored on the same metric, where 50 is the mean for the general U.S. population and 10 is the standard deviation. Higher scores indicate more severe sleep problems. Least Squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <description>The MOS-Sleep comprises 12 items and measures key sleep structures across 6 domains. These domains are Sleep Disturbance (4 items), Sleep Adequacy (2 items), Sleep Quantity (1 item), Daytime Somnolence (3 items), Snoring (1 item), and Awakening short of breath or with a headache, (1 item). Sleep Adequacy measures sleep sufficiency in terms of whether the participant sleeps enough to provide restoration of wakefulness. In MOS Sleep norm-based scoring, all scales are scored on the same metric, where 50 is the mean for the general U.S. population and 10 is the standard deviation. For sleep adequacy a higher score indicates better sleep quality. Least Squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

          <title>Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Adequacy Scale at Each Time Point</title>
          <description>The MOS-Sleep comprises 12 items and measures key sleep structures across 6 domains. These domains are Sleep Disturbance (4 items), Sleep Adequacy (2 items), Sleep Quantity (1 item), Daytime Somnolence (3 items), Snoring (1 item), and Awakening short of breath or with a headache, (1 item). Sleep Adequacy measures sleep sufficiency in terms of whether the participant sleeps enough to provide restoration of wakefulness. In MOS Sleep norm-based scoring, all scales are scored on the same metric, where 50 is the mean for the general U.S. population and 10 is the standard deviation. For sleep adequacy a higher score indicates better sleep quality. Least Squares means are from a mixed-effect model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results aftercompletion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
