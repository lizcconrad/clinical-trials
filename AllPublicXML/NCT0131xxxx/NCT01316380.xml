  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2.5 and 5 mcg tiotropium
      compared to placebo over 12 week treatment period. Tiotropium inhalation solution will be
      delivered via Respimat inhaler and will be examined on top of maintenance inhaled
      corticosteroid treatment in patients with mild persistent asthma. Efficacy and safety will be
      assessed by measuring the effects on lung functions, effects on lung exacerbations, effects
      on asthma control and numbers of adverse events.
