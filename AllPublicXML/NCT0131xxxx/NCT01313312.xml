    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 for Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Angle of Spasticity (X) in Extrinsic Finger Flexors as PTMG</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Tardieu Scale (TS) was used to measure spasticity in extrinsic finger flexors. The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. Mean changes in Angles XV1, XV3 and X from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

    <description>The MFS was used to measure upper limb active function. Each subject was video taped while performing specific tasks. The videos were sent to a central provider and were read and scored by two independent readers blinded to the timing of the video and to treatment. These central assessments were used for the analysis of efficacy endpoints. The MFS consists of 10 tasks asking the subject to reach, grasp, carry and release different objects of different sizes which subjects are likely to use in their daily life. Each of these tasks was rated on a 10 point scale ranging from no movement to normal movement; for each task, the score 5 is used to rate a task barely accomplished. Mean change in MFS from baseline to Week 4 was reported.</description>

The SF-36 is a generic non-preference based health status measure. This instrument assessed subject health across 8 variable dimensions, which are specific health domains such as physical functioning, social functioning and vitality. Each variable item score is coded and turned into a 0-100 scale where 0 indicates the worst and 100 indicates the best possible health state for both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the questionnaire. Baseline results and the change from baseline to end of study/early withdrawal for the PCS and MCS are reported.</description>

    <description>Subjects were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L QoL questionnaires prior to the study treatment at baseline and at the end of study/early withdrawal visit. The EQ-5D-5L index is a generic preference based measure of health related QoL producing utility scores that represent subject preferences for particular health states. This instrument rated subject health state looking at 5 specific dimensions such as mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and scored their general health state. Each dimension has 5 levels of severity (no problems, slight problems,moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems). In addition, a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 was also included for the patients to summarize their overall health status, where 0 is the worst and 100 the best possible health state. The mean values for each dimension and the VAS scores at baseline and at the end of-study /early withdrawal are reported.</description>

    <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 intramuscular (i.m) injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 Units [U] or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject's safety and efficacy response. From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

          <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to End of Study/Early Withdrawal in 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)</title>
        <description>12-lead ECG tracing was performed at baseline, post treatment at Week 4 and at the end of study/early withdrawal visit. The 12-lead ECG recordings were performed at a paper speed of 25 mm/s, recorded with the subject in a supine position after 5 minutes rest. The ECG parameters reported were QRS duration, PR duration, QT duration, QTcB (QT interval corrected for HR according to Bazett), and QTcF (QT interval corrected for HR according to Fridericia) at baseline and the change to end of study/early withdrawal visit (EOS).</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
        <population>The ECG analysis was performed in the safety population among subjects who had at least one ECG measurement before injection and at least one ECG after injection. Only subjects with data available for analysis at the point of testing are reported.</population>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) in the Overall Primary Targeted Muscle Group (PTMG) for Upper Limb at Week 4</title>
        <description>The clinical assessment of muscle tone was performed using the MAS. The MAS consists of 6 grades: 0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, or 4 that can be applied to muscles of both the upper and lower limbs. The MAS was applied by the rater by stretching the joint through its full available range over 1 second. The mean changes from baseline to Week 4 in MAS in the overall PTMG (finger, wrist or elbow flexors) are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>At Week 4</time_frame>
        <population>The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population was all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection of study medication in this open label extension study. Too few subjects were treated in Cycle 5 to allow direct comparisons with other cycles and are not reported. Only subjects with data available for analysis at the point of testing are reported.</population>

            <title>Total Dysport®</title>
            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline MAS in the Extrinsic Finger Flexors at Week 4</title>
        <description>The clinical assessment of muscle tone was performed using the MAS. The MAS consists of 6 grades: 0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, or 4 that can be applied to muscles of both the upper and lower limbs. The MAS was applied by the rater by stretching the joint through its full available range over 1 second. The mean changes from baseline to Week 4 in MAS in the extrinsic finger flexors are reported.</description>

        <population>The ITT population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection of study medication in this open label extension study. Too few subjects were treated in Cycle 5 to allow direct comparisons with other cycles and are not reported.

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

The selected domain was required to have a rating of moderate or severe (≥2) at baseline. The DAS is a 4-point scale, the extent of functional impairment in 4 functional domains (dressing, hygiene, limb position and pain) was rated as follows: 0=no disability, 1=mild disability (noticeable but does not interfere significantly with normal activities), 2=moderate disability (normal activities require increased effort and/or assistance) and 3=severe disability (normal activities limited).

          <title>Percentage of Subjects With at Least 1 Grade Reduction in DAS for PTT at Week 4</title>
          <description>At baseline the subject and investigator together selected one of the four DAS domains as the PTT. The selected domain was required to have a rating of moderate or severe (≥2) at baseline. The DAS is a 4-point scale, the extent of functional impairment in 4 functional domains (dressing, hygiene, limb position and pain) was rated as follows: 0=no disability, 1=mild disability (noticeable but does not interfere significantly with normal activities), 2=moderate disability (normal activities require increased effort and/or assistance) and 3=severe disability (normal activities limited). The percentage of subjects with at least 1 grade reduction from baseline in DAS for PTT at Week 4 are reported.</description>

        <description>The DAS is a 4-point scale. The extent of functional impairment in 4 functional domains (dressing, hygiene, limb position and pain) was rated as follows: 0=no disability, 1=mild disability (noticeable but does not interfere significantly with normal activities), 2=moderate disability (normal activities require increased effort and/or assistance) and 3=severe disability (normal activities limited). The percentage of subjects with at least one grade reduction in DAS for each of the individual domains at Week 4 is reported.</description>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 for Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Angle of Spasticity (X) in Extrinsic Finger Flexors as PTMG</title>
        <description>The Tardieu Scale (TS) was used to measure spasticity in extrinsic finger flexors. The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. Mean changes in Angles XV1, XV3 and X from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

        <population>The ITT population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection of study medication in this open label extension study. Too few subjects were treated in Cycle 5 to allow direct comparisons with other cycles and are not reported. Only subjects with data available for analysis at the point of testing are reported.</population>

            <title>Total Dysport®</title>
            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 for Spasticity Grade (Y) in Extrinsic Finger Flexors as PTMG</title>
        <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in extrinsic finger flexors. The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group. The spasticity grade (Y) assesses quality of muscle reaction on a 5-point scale (measured at fast speed): 0 =No resistance throughout passive movement, 1=slight resistance throughout passive movement, 2=clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release, 3=fatigable clonus (less than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release. 4=unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at precise angle. Mean changes in spasticity grade (Y) from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>At Week 4</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection of study medication in this open label extension study. Too few subjects were treated in Cycle 5 to allow direct comparisons with other cycles and are not reported. Only subjects with data available for analysis at the point of testing are reported.</population>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 for Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Angle of Spasticity (X) in Elbow Flexors as PTMG</title>
        <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in elbow flexors. The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. Mean changes in Angles XV1, XV3 and X from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

        <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in elbow flexors.The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group. The spasticity grade (Y) assesses quality of muscle reaction on a 5-point scale (measured at fast speed): 0 =No resistance throughout passive movement, 1=slight resistance throughout passive movement, 2=clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release, 3=fatigable clonus (less than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release. 4=unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at precise angle. Mean changes in spasticity grade (Y) from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 for Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Angle of Spasticity (X) in Wrist Flexors as PTMG</title>
        <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in wrist flexors. The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. Mean changes in Angles XV1, XV3 and X from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 for Spasticity Grade (Y) in Wrist Flexors as PTMG</title>
        <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in wrist flexors. The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group. The spasticity grade (Y) assesses quality of muscle reaction on a 5-point scale (measured at fast speed): 0 =No resistance throughout passive movement, 1=slight resistance throughout passive movement, 2=clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release, 3=fatigable clonus (less than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release. 4=unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at precise angle. Mean changes in spasticity grade (Y) from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 for Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Angle of Spasticity (X) in Shoulder Extensors</title>
        <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in shoulder extensors. The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. Mean changes in Angles XV1, XV3 and X from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 for Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Angle of Spasticity (X) in Shoulder Extensors</title>
          <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in shoulder extensors. The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. Mean changes in Angles XV1, XV3 and X from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Active Range of Motion (AROM) at Week 4 in the 3 Possible PTMGs</title>
        <description>The AROM was assessed by the range of extension achieved by the subject moving each joint in the PTMGs (extrinsic finger flexors, elbow flexors and wrist flexors) without assistance. A goniometer was used for measurements in the elbow and wrist flexors but not for measurements in the extrinsic finger flexors. Mean changes in AROM in the 3 possible PTMGs from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>At Week 4</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection of study medication in this open label extension study. Too few subjects were treated in Cycle 5 to allow direct comparisons with other cycles and are not reported. Only subjects with data available for analysis at the point of testing are reported.</population>

            <title>Total Dysport®</title>
            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

            <description>A total of 254 subjects in the open label study received between 1 and 5 i.m. injections of Dysport® according to their individual needs, for a period of up to 12 months.
All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1000 U or 500 U) on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. At each study visit from Week 12 onwards, subjects were assessed to determine whether a subsequent treatment cycle was required and treatment cycles were administered at intervals of a minimum of 12 weeks apart depending on the subject’s safety and efficacy response.
From Cycle 2 onwards, a total dose of 1500 U could be administered in subjects requiring treatment with Dysport® in their shoulder and other upper limb muscles. Subjects who showed improvement in their upper limb during the first two treatment cycles were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® 500 U into at least one calf muscle, from Cycle 3 onwards as long as the total dose did not exceed 1500 U.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Modified Frenchay Scale (MFS) at Week 4</title>
        <description>The MFS was used to measure upper limb active function. Each subject was video taped while performing specific tasks. The videos were sent to a central provider and were read and scored by two independent readers blinded to the timing of the video and to treatment. These central assessments were used for the analysis of efficacy endpoints. The MFS consists of 10 tasks asking the subject to reach, grasp, carry and release different objects of different sizes which subjects are likely to use in their daily life. Each of these tasks was rated on a 10 point scale ranging from no movement to normal movement; for each task, the score 5 is used to rate a task barely accomplished. Mean change in MFS from baseline to Week 4 was reported.</description>

        <description>Subjects were asked to complete the SF-36 questionnaires prior to the study treatment at baseline and at the end of study/early withdrawal visit. The SF-36 is a generic non-preference based health status measure. This instrument assessed subject health across 8 variable dimensions, which are specific health domains such as physical functioning, social functioning and vitality. Each variable item score is coded and turned into a 0–100 scale where 0 indicates the worst and 100 indicates the best possible health state for both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the questionnaire. Baseline results and the change from baseline to end of study/early withdrawal for the PCS and MCS are reported.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in European 5 Dimensions, 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) QoL at End of Study/Early Withdrawal Visit</title>
        <description>Subjects were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L QoL questionnaires prior to the study treatment at baseline and at the end of study/early withdrawal visit. The EQ-5D-5L index is a generic preference based measure of health related QoL producing utility scores that represent subject preferences for particular health states. This instrument rated subject health state looking at 5 specific dimensions such as mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and scored their general health state. Each dimension has 5 levels of severity (no problems, slight problems,moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems). In addition, a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 was also included for the patients to summarize their overall health status, where 0 is the worst and 100 the best possible health state. The mean values for each dimension and the VAS scores at baseline and at the end of-study /early withdrawal are reported.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
        <population>The ITT population was defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one injection of study medication in this open label extension study. Too few subjects were treated in Cycle 5 to allow direct comparisons with other cycles and are not reported. Only subjects with data available for analysis at the point of testing are reported.</population>
