    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Individual health education is considered to be essential in the overall care of
      patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2), although there is some uncertainty regarding its
      metabolic control benefits. There have been very few randomized studies on the effects of
      individual education on normal care in DM2 patients with a control group, and none of these
      have assessed the long-term results. Therefore, this study aims to use this design to assess
      the effectiveness of the PRECEDE (Predisposing, Reinforcing, Enabling, Causes in Educational
      Diagnosis, and Evaluation) education model in the metabolic control and the reduction of
      cardiovascular risk factors, in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      METHODS: An open community randomized clinical trial will be carried out in 8 urban community
      health centers in the Northeastern Madrid (Spain). Six hundred patients with DM2 will be
      randomized in two groups: PRECEDE or conventional model for health promotion education. The
      main outcome measures is glycated hemoglobin A1C, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure,
      lipids and control criteria during the 2-year follow-up period.

      Assignment to the Health Promotion Education (HPE) will be random, three centers will use
      conventional HPE (the control group) and the remaining five will use PRECEDE-type HPE.
      Eligible patients are selected from a list of DM2 patients by each professional using random
      sampling, until the predetermined sample size is attained.

      Conventional HPE is defined according to the recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of
      Health National Conference on Diabetes Mellitus, and was complemented by the criteria for
      good care of the Madrid Primary Healthcare Service for the promotion of healthy lifestyles
      among adults for 2004-2007

    <description>The CHPE model was defined according to the recommendations of the Spanish Ministry of Health National Conference on Diabetes Mellitus, which was complemented by criteria for good care of the Madrid Primary Healthcare Service for the promotion of healthy lifestyles among adults (2004-2007). The model is based on the following aspects: self-monitoring of glycaemic control, physical exercise, diet, weight management, and times of the day when the patient was most vulnerable to overeating, and given improved understanding of the relative effects of certain food choices on blood glucose control, medication adherence and smoking cessation.</description>

    <description>The model considers the influence of the following three factors on health-related behavior:
Predisposing: factors influencing the patient's motivation to undertake the behavior to be analyzed or encouraged.
Facilitators: factors influencing the level of easiness or difficulty the patient and his/her family have in undertaking a given behavior.
Reinforcing: factors arising after the patient has undertaken the behavior, and which reward or punish it.</description>
