  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether an intervention consisting of the
      implementation of guidelines about daily systematic pain assessment following a theory based
      education, targeting cancer-related pain and pain treatment, lead to a significantly positive
      improvement in RNs knowledge of, and attitudes towards their pain management. Furthermore
      will the interventions targeting the RNs influence the admitted patient's perception of their
      cancer-related pain?

    <description>BPI-SF is a pain-assessment instrument developed for cancer patient. The instrument consists of nine items, and a figure depicting a human body where the patient marks position and type of pain. BPI-SF includes items concerning the degree of pain right now, pain during the last day and pain on average as well as items concerning effect of pain treatment, walking ability, mood, work, relationships and if sleep are affected by pain.</description>
