      This study will determine the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of
      1.5 mg tivozanib in normal healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover PK food effect study of
      tivozanib administered orally at 1.5 mg. Subjects will be screened for eligibility up to 28
      days prior to entry into the study.

      For each of 2 study periods, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on
      the day before dosing and fast overnight (approximately 10 hours). On the morning of dosing
      for each of the 2 study periods, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 1.5 mg tivozanib
      in either the fasted or fed state. Subjects will remain at the CRU for at least 48 hours
      after administration of study drug for collection of serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic
      (PK) analysis and safety monitoring. Subjects will return to the CRU on an outpatient basis
      for collection of additional blood samples for up to 504 hours postdose.
