      Rationale: Proteins released from muscle during and shortly after exercise, often referred to
      as myokines, may be central to our understanding of the cross-talk during and after exercise
      between skeletal muscles and other organs, in particular the liver. So far only a few
      myokines are identified (e.g. IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, TNF-alpha). Taking into account the role of
      these several known myokines in developing insulin resistance, revealing new putative
      myokines might provide valuable information and a direction for future research on the
      pathogenesis and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Objective: The objective of the present study is to identify novel myokines, expression of
      which is altered in skeletal muscle after a single bout of exercise.

      Study design: experimental study. Study population: Ten healthy, male subjects between 40 and
      60 years of age and BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2, will participate in this study.

      Intervention: A single exercise bout that consists of one hour one-legged cycling on a
      adapted recumbent cycle ergometer at a submaximal rate. The non-exercising leg will serve as
      control for the exercising leg.

      Main study outcomes: Main study outcomes include upregulation of genes in skeletal muscle
      after exercise (with a focus on genes encoding myokines) and changes of blood plasma levels
      of selected proteins after exercise.

    <measure>Gene expression changes in skeletal muscle from baseline to after exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>T = 0 and T =1</time_frame>
    <description>Gene expression is measured using whole genome Affymatrix microarrays Muscle tissue will be collected at time points T = 0 (before exercise) and T = 1 (directly after exercise). Special focus is on the changes in genes coding for myokines. Up to 5 genes will be selected for follow-up analysis.</description>

    <measure>Changes in plasma levels of selected proteins</measure>
    <time_frame>T = 0, T =1 and T = 3</time_frame>
    <description>Selected proteins will be analyzed by ELISA assays or western blot analysis, depending on ELISA availability at T = 0, T = 1 and T = 3 (2 hours post-exercise). The selection of the proteins is based on significance, the robustness of induction (&gt;80% of subjects showing induction) and the magnitude of the induction ( mean fold change &gt; 2)</description>

    <time_frame>T = 0, T = 1 and T =3</time_frame>
    <description>Gene expression changes in the blood will be assessed using whole genome Affymetrix microarrays for the samples at T = 0, 1 and 3.</description>

    <description>At all three time point (T = 0, 1 and 3) plasma levels of glucose, insulin, fatty acids, triglycerides, cortisol, adrenalin and lactate will be determined.</description>
