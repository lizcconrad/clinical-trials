  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the effectiveness of a single intravenous (IV, through the vein) dose
      of the study drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), in preventing/reducing the development of Acute
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), in patients with severe sepsis, who are at high risk
      for developing ARDS. ARDS is a lung disease caused by a lung injury that leads to lung
      function impairment. The condition the patient has,severe sepsis, is a medical condition
      associated with an infection characterized as an immune system inflammatory response
      throughout your whole body that can lead to organ dysfunction, low blood pressure or
      insufficient blood flow to one or more of your organs.

    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most extreme form of acute lung injury
      (ALI) that results in a loss of lung function and structure. Vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF), a protein critical for lung development that is found in the thin layer of
      liquid lining the inner surface of the lung air sacs, is believed to play a key role in the
      development of ARDS. During ARDS/ALI, VEGF markedly increases the permeability of the cells
      lining the inner surface of blood vessels in the lungs, which leads to an accumulation of
      fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), a characteristic of ARDS/ALI. Thus, anti-VEGF therapies
      offer a unique approach to treat this potentially fatal disorder. Bevacizumab (Avastin Â®), an
      anti-VEGF medication, has been shown to be effective in inhibiting pulmonary edema caused by
      VEGF over-expression in an animal model.

      This study will establish the usefulness and effectiveness of a singe dose of Bevacizumab
      administered intravenously (through the vein) in reducing the incidence of ARDS in
      individuals with severe sepsis (a condition characterized by an inflammatory response by the
      immune system throughout the whole body caused by infection) who are at high risk for the
      development of ARDS. All study participants will be randomized to receive placebo,
      bevacizumab 5 mg/kg or bevacizumab 10 mg/kg as a single intravenous dose in a double-blinded
      fashion in addition to traditional sepsis treatment.
