  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, controlled multi-site feasibility trial to assess the potential
      role of the IMPELLA® 2.5 System in reducing infarct size in patients with ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the adjunctive use of the IMPELLA®
      2.5 System for 24 hours following primary PCI for STEMI has the potential to limit the
      infarction of at-risk myocardium compared to primary PCI with routine post-PCI care (standard
      of care). This study is a feasibility study. Therefore, the principal objective is to
      identify trends in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based efficacy outcomes between
      the randomized treatment arms (Impella arm compared to control).
