  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine (METH) is a debilitating and frequently abused substance that is often
      comorbid with HIV infection. HIV+ persons with current METH abuse or dependence (HIV+/METH+)
      have several characteristics, in addition to their substance use, that make them particularly
      susceptible to nonadherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) including elevated rates of
      neurocognitive impairment, co-occurrence of psychiatric disorders, and unstable living
      situations. The investigators propose an intervention development study designed to address
      these potential mechanisms of nonadherence with the following Specific Aims: 1) To further
      develop and refine a personalized, automated, real-time, mobile phone, text messaging
      intervention (iTAB) designed to improve adherence to ART medications among HIV+/METH+
      persons; 2) To evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a brief psychoeducation plus
      text messaging intervention (iTAB) as compared to psychoeducation alone (CTRL) for the
      improvement of objectively measured medication adherence among HIV+/METH+ persons; and 3) To
      examine predictors of within-person trajectories of nonadherence using the longitudinal data
      collected over the study. In order to realize these aims, the investigators will leverage the
      infrastructure of two unique UCSD resources increasing likelihood of study success, impact,
      and innovation: 1) the Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center (TMARC), which is a
      NIDA-funded center that focuses on the combined effects of METH and HIV infection, and 2) the
      California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), which
      conducts research on state-of-the-art wireless means of health promotion. Initially, the
      investigators will refine the iTAB intervention to ensure that it is user-centered and
      tailored to the needs of HIV+/METH+ persons via focus groups and rapid prototyping. Once
      refined, the proposed iTAB intervention will use text messages that are automated, scalable,
      personalized, interactive, flexible, and motivating. The investigators will assess the
      acceptability and effectiveness of iTAB in improving objectively measured adherence (i.e.,
      MEMS caps) over a 6-week period via a pilot RCT with 40 HIV+/METH+ assigned to the iTAB
      intervention and 20 HIV+/METH+ assigned to a psychoeducational control. Predictors of
      nonadherence including frequency of METH use, neuropsychological impairment, and mood will be
      examined to determine whether iTAB is better able to compensate for these factors associated
      with nonadherence as compared to CTRL. Further refinement to the iTAB intervention will be
      made in order to pursue a large-scale R01 using our tailored intervention.
