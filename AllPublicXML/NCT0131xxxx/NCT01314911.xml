  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are infected with the influenza virus may develop respiratory illnesses, such as
      pneumonia, or other life-threatening complications. Currently, there are four antiviral
      medications that are used to treat influenza. This study will examine one of these
      medications, oseltamivir, to examine how it affects the shedding of influenza virus in
      infected people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal influenza is responsible for excess hospitalizations and, despite effective
      antivirals, causes significant morbidity and mortality (about 24,000 deaths each year in the
      United States alone). The influenza virus that emerged in 2009 (A/California/07/2009 H1N1)
      caused fewer deaths (12,000 flu-related deaths in the U.S.) but in contrast to seasonal flu,
      nearly 90% of the deaths with the 2009 H1N1 occurred among people younger than 65 years of
      age. Although there are four currently licensed anti-influenza medications (amantadine and
      rimantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir), previous studies have not demonstrated conclusively
      to what extent these medications affect influenza viral shedding. This study will evaluate
      whether oseltamivir modifies the viral shedding during the treatment of uncomplicated
      influenza in an adult population and also assess methods to detect viral replication in the
      upper respiratory tract.

      Subjects who present with an influenza-like illness without any risk factors for severe
      disease will be screened for the study. Those with a confirmatory test for influenza (rapid
      antigen or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive a
      blinded study treatment consisting of either the oseltamivir or placebo for 5 days. Clinical,
      virologic, and laboratory assessments on Days 1, 3, 7, and 28 will be used for both safety
      and efficacy analysis.
