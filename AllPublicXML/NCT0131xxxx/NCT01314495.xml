    <textblock>
      Will Abatacept reduce priming of the hair follicle specific T cells and thereby reduce hair
      follicle associated infiltration and improve hair growth.

      This is a double blind placebo controlled study to test the safety and efficacy of Abatacept
      in the treatment of 64 subjects diagnosed with alopecia totalis or alopecia universalis.
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to the placebo or treatment arm and will receive 6 months of
      treatment with the study medication or placebo, followed by a 6 month observational period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia Areata is a common autoimmune disease, affecting 1% of the general population
      resulting from autoimmune attack on the hair follicles and usually presents with patchy hair
      loss. One third of these patients will experience spontaneous remissions within the first
      year. However many patients will develop waxing and waning disease with some progressing to
      alopecia totalis (total scalp hair loss) or alopecia universalis (loss of all body hair).
      This population that suffers from a disfiguring disease represents a significant unmet
      medical need. Alopecia totalis/universalis seldom, if ever, remits spontaneously or with
      current treatment and is classified by the FDA as an Orphan Indication.

      There is no FDA approved drug for alopecia areata. A recent Cochrane report concluded that
      there was no evidence based support for any intervention in this disease. Standard of care
      remains observation for mild disease and lesional/oral steroids for more advanced cases.

      Abatacept is a soluble human fusion protein that selectively modulates the costimulatory
      signal required for full T-cell activation. It is approved for the treatment of moderately to
      severely active rheumatoid arthritis. It is also approved for the treatment of moderately to
      severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children 6 years of age or
      older. Abatacept is a lyophilized powder administered as a 30 minute intravenous infusion.
      Dosage, as in rheumatoid arthritis, is weight based and is fixed throughout the course of
      treatment. Abatacept or placebo will be administered as a 30 minute intravenous infusion at
      baseline, weeks 2, 4, and every 4 weeks for 5 cycles (weeks 8, 12, 16, 20) for a total
      treatment period of 6 months. There will be a 6 month observational period following the
      treatment period.

    <description>The study's primary endpoint of this intent to treat trial will be the proportion of responders in the treated compared to the control group after 6 months of treatment, defined as 50% or greater hair re-growth from baseline as assessed by Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score at week 24. This is a relatively strict definition for defining responders and non-responders and was chosen to minimize responses in the 'vehicle' arm, in which fewer than 10% are expected to achieve this magnitude of hair re-growth spontaneously.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent hair regrowth from baseline determined by SALT at weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 during treatment phase and at weeks 30, 36, 42 and 48 during the observational phase.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks of treatment and 18 weeks observational phase</time_frame>
    <description>As secondary endpoints, efficacy will be measured by changes in hair re-growth as a continuous variable as determined by physical exam and photography, as well as subject and physician global evaluation scores. To assess the durability of responses, subjects will continue to be followed for an additional 6 months post treatment. All subjects will be assessed for safety at each study visit for incidence and severity of adverse effects (AE) and incidence of treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities.</description>
