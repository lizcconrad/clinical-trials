    <textblock>
      Low back and posterior pelvic pain are common in pregnant females. Previous studies have
      demonstrated disability and it is estimated that all women experience some degree of
      musculoskeletal discomfort during pregnancy. Borg-Stein et. al. found 25% of pregnant females
      have temporarily disabling symptoms.

      There is demonstrated controversy over the mechanism of low back pain in pregnancy. The
      biomechanical theory implies that the enlarging uterus causes the maternal center of gravity
      to move anteriorly causing stress on the low back. Jensen et. al. demonstrated that weight
      gain correlated with biomechanical changes. The changes were measured by weight gain in
      segmental regions of the body and in principal moments of inertia from the sit to stand
      movement. Literature does not demonstrate a specific correlation between weight gain and the
      biomechanical changes of sway rate, lumbosacral angle and center of gravity. These three
      measurements may have a correlating effect on the underlying cause of low back pain in
      pregnant women.

      This study aims to determine the correlation between weight gain of pregnant females and the
      biomechanical changes of sway rate, lumbosacral angle and center of gravity. The change in
      weight over the last two trimesters will be correlated with the sway rate, lumbosacral angle
      and center of gravity. The degree of symptomatic low back pain as measured by the Oswestry
      Low Back Pain Scale will also be correlated with the sway rate, lumbosacral angle and center
      of gravity.

      The principal investigator will recruit subjects at the yoga studio and one of the
      investigators and the research assistant will recruit subjects at the NSU clinic. Potential
      subjects will go through a short verbal pre-screening to ensure they fit the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Subjects that fit this criteria will read and sign the consent form. The
      PI and research assistant will answer any questions about the study prior to the subject
      giving consent.

      Then the subject's initial weight will be measured on the postural scale and documented.
      Change in weight is the dependent variable in this study. The following independent variables
      will be measured: lumbosacral angle, sway rate and shift of weight posteriorly. The
      lumbosacral angle will be measured by a digital inclinometer. The lumbosacral angle is
      measured between the plane of the superior surface of S1 to the horizontal plane. Saur et.
      al., demonstrated that the inclinometer technique for lumbosacral angle has established
      validity and reliability in comparison to radiographic x-rays. Comparison of radiographic and
      inclinometer technique is clinically suitable for measuring lumbar position. Keeley et. al.
      reported high correlation coefficients for interrater reliability with the inclinometer
      technique on patients with chronic low back pain.

      The additional measurements of sway rate and center of gravity will be measured by the
      postural analyzer. The quadruple scale that will be used in this study is based on four
      digital force plates with computer communication operated by software enabling test analysis.
      The quadruple scale will provide numeric and graphic data on total weight, weight
      distribution (kg. or lb.), percentage weight difference, sway rate and an estimate of the
      location and deviation of the subject's center of mass. All data will be recorded and saved.

      Following those measurements, the subject will be asked to complete the Oswestry Low Back
      Pain Scale. The Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale is a suitable questionnaire for an
      English-speaking population and to enquire about areas of functioning specifically relevant
      to low back pain sufferers, such as lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping and
      socializing. Fisher et. al. demonstrated that the Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale is an
      acceptable instrument for back pain patients with evidence of criterion-related validity,
      factorial validity and moderately high internal consistency. It has good face validity for
      the patients. According to Fisher et. al., the Oswestry Scale can be recommended as a
      relevant measure of disability with evidence of validity, reliability and sensitivity to
      change for both clinical and research purposes.

      The total amount of time needed to complete the measurements and the Oswestry Low Back Pain
      Scale should take 15 minutes. Biweekly, willing participants will be recruited and previous
      participants will be continually measured for weight, lumbosacral angle, sway rate and
      deviation of the subject's center of mass.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant patients in their second or third trimester who are patients at NSU Ob/Gyn
             clinic or prenatal yoga students at Red Pearl Yoga Studio who are willing to
             participate in the study and follow up with measurements for three months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include women who have a BMI of over 30 or whom are clinically
             obese.

          -  Abdominal obesity can cause low back pain and it increases the lumbosacral angle.

          -  Women will be excluded who have prior history of back surgery, acute disc herniation,
             arthritis, immunological disorder, acute fracture and osteoporosis.

          -  Additional exclusion criteria include high risk pregnancies such as gestational
             diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa and abruptio placentae.

          -  All of the following could be contributory for low back pain and may affect the
             biomechanics of the low back.

          -  If the patients at the NSU clinic have these exclusion criteria documented in their
             medical chart, they will not be approached for recruitment in the study. During the
             verbal pre-screening, the research assistant will ask the subject if they have any of
             the above conditions. If so, they will not be eligible to participate in the study.
             The same verbal pre-screening will be used at the yoga studio for recruitment. No data
             will be collected for subjects who are excluded during the pre-screening.
