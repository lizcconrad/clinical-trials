      This clinical trial studies fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in predicting chemoradiation therapy (CRT) failure in patients
      with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Diagnostic procedures, such as FDG
      PET/CT, may help predict CRT failure. Comparing diagnostic results during CRT may help
      doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether early response of the research positron emission tomography
      (PET)-computed tomography(CT) scan measured by change in Standard Uptake Value (SUV)max
      relative to baseline scan can predict induction chemoradiation therapy (CRT) failures sooner
      than post-treatment PET-CT scan.

      II. To determine the optimal timing for 18FDG PET-CT that best predicts for induction CRT
      failure.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate early 18 fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT response metrics with pathologic
      response, progression-free survival separately for: induction CRT failures vs. non-failures,
      or overall survival separately for induction CRT failures vs. non-failures.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 groups.

      Patients undergo a baseline FDG PET/CT scan and receive standard radiotherapy (RT) for 28
      fractions with concurrent chemotherapy.

      GROUP A: Patients undergo a FDG PET/CT scan between RT fractions 5-6 (before course 2 of
      chemotherapy).

      GROUP B: Patients undergo a FDG PET/CT scan between RT fractions 10-11 (before course 3 of
      chemotherapy).

      GROUP C: Patients undergo a FDG PET/CT scan between RT fractions 15-16 (before course 4 of
      chemotherapy).

      Approximately 6 weeks after completion of CRT, patients undergo a FDG PET/CT scan and undergo
      standard tumor resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
