  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single dose study with the inhaled anti-inflammatory agent PF-03715455 to establish if it
      has anti-inflammatory activity following a challenge with LPS. Inhaled LPS invokes an acute
      inflammatory response in the lung which can be seen in induced sputum. PH-0797804 is an
      internal control for the study.
