  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of AOP200704 infusion is compared to that
      of Esmolol by measurement of plasma concentrations of AOP200704, esmolol and their
      metabolites, by assessing the effect of both drugs on dobutamine-induced tachycardia, and by
      monitoring vital signs, ECG and adverse events.

      16 healthy volunteers of both sexes, age 18 to 45 years, will be enrolled. The mean dose
      necessary to suppress the Dobutamine induced heart rate increase of at least 30 bpm above
      baseline rate (maximum heart rate app. 110 bpm) by at least 20 bpm will be calculated for
      AOP200704 and Esmolol and the dose/efficacy relation of both agents to each other will be
      calculated for the steady state condition. For both drugs the time to reach a decrease of 10
      bpm, 20 bpm and the maximum effect will be calculated. In addition the mean time to increase
      in 10 and 20 bpm and the time to reach maximum heart rate (increase of 30 bpm above baseline
      or more) after termination of infusion will also be assessed for both drugs. Blood pressure
      values will be compared for all above mentioned time points where heart rate is assessed for
      pharmacodynamics.The study will consist of a screening, cross-over 1, cross-over 2 and
      end-of-study visit.
