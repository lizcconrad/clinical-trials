  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major factor in the respiratory health of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) subjects is the prevalence
      of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection rate in CF
      patients increases with age and by age 18 years approximately 85% of CF patients in the US
      are infected. Liposomal amikacin for inhalation (Arikayce™) was developed as a possible
      treatment for chronic infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF patients.

      The purpose of this European Registration study is to determine whether Arikayce™ is
      effective in treating chronic lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic
      Fibrosis subjects. The effectiveness, safety and tolerability of Arikayce™ will be compared
      to TOBI, an inhalation antibiotic already available for use. The study will enroll
      approximately 300 subjects in clinics in Europe and Canada. Subjects will be required to
      visit the clinic 9 times (including the Screening visit) over a period of approximately 6
      months. No overnight stays at the clinic will be required.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease resulting from mutations in the cystic fibrosis
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Patients with CF manifest pathological
      changes in a variety of organs that express CFTR. The lungs are frequently affected often
      resulting in chronic infections by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and airway
      inflammation. Treatment of chronic lung infections is one of the principal goals of CF
      therapy. Arikayce™ (liposomal amikacin for inhalation) is a sustained-release formulation of
      amikacin encapsulated inside nanoscale liposomal carriers designed for administration via
      inhalation. It is hypothesized that the sustained-release pulmonary targeting and biofilm
      penetration properties of this formulation will have several advantages over current
      therapies in treating CF patients with chronic lung infection caused by Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa.

      This Phase 3 European Registration study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety
      and tolerability of Arikayce™ in treating CF patients with chronic bronchopulmonary infection
      compared to a currently available antibiotic, TOBI® (tobramycin) Inhalation Solution.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 590 mg of Arikayce™ once daily via a PARI
      Investigational eFlow® Nebulizer or 300 mg TOBI® BID via a PARI LC® PLUS nebulizer. Subjects
      will receive 3 cycles of treatment with each cycle being comprised of 28 days on treatment
      followed by 28 days off-treatment. Total study duration is up to 186 days (~6 months)
      including an up to 18 day Screening period. Subjects will be evaluated for safety,
      tolerability and efficacy bi-weekly during the first 4 weeks of treatment, and thereafter
      every 4 weeks for the duration of the study. Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Arikayce™ in blood,
      sputum and 24-hour urine will be determined in a subgroup of study subjects who consent to PK
      evaluation.

      At the completion of the TR02-108 protocol, subjects who have consented and meet study safety
      criteria may enroll in the long-term, open-label, multi-cycle extension study of 590 mg of
      Arikayce™ (under a separate protocol TR02-110).
