  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective studies to date have identified that the levator ani muscle injuries occur in
      14-19% of women after vaginal delivery.

      In none of studies a vaginal examination was performed at the time of delivery. It has
      previously been shown that sonographic injuries of the anal sphincter that were believed to
      be occult were in fact clinically apparent but not recognised at the time of delivery. It is
      therefore important to correlate clinical findings to ultrasound images.

      3D endovaginal endosonography has not previously been used to identify levator injuries. This
      should potentially provide a better view of the pelvic floor muscles.

      The relationship between levator injury and symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction has not been
      previously established using validated questionnaires. In this study, we include validated
      questionnaires to evaluate urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence and vaginal symptoms. As
      symptoms may become apparent only in the long term it is prudent that the women are followed
      up in the long term.

      The principle objective is to establish the incidence of levator muscle defects during
      pregnancy and after childbirth. The levator muscle forms a major part of the pelvic floor and
      damage to this muscle can potentially cause urinary, bowel and sexual problems and pelvic
      organ prolapse.
