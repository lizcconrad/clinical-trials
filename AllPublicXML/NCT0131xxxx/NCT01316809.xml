      Background:

      - AZD8055 is an experimental cancer treatment drug that works by inhibiting a protein called
      mTOR, which is known to promote tumor cell and blood vessel growth and to control tumor s
      energy and nutrient levels. AZD8055 is the first drug that inhibits both types of mTOR
      protein and is expected to be more effective than prior mTOR inhibitors. However, more
      research is needed to determine its safety and effectiveness in treating brain tumors known
      as gliomas that have not responded to standard treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AZD8055 in individuals with gliomas that have
      not responded to standard treatments.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with gliomas that have not
      responded to standard chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood tests,
           and tumor imaging studies.

        -  Participants will be separated into two treatment groups: one group that will receive
           surgery to remove the glioma and one that will not have surgical treatment.

        -  Participants in the nonsurgical treatment group will take AZD8055 by mouth daily for a
           42-day cycle of treatment. Participants will keep a diary to record doses and keep track
           of any side effects.

        -  Participants in the surgical treatment group will take AZD8055 by mouth daily for 7
           days, and then will have tumor removal surgery. At least 3 weeks after surgery,
           participants will resume doses of AZD8055 and will continue to take the drug for as long
           as the tumor does not recur.

        -  During treatment, participants will have regular visits to the clinical center,
           involving frequent blood and urine tests and other examinations to monitor the effects
           of treatment. Participants will have imaging studies to study the cancer's response to
           the treatment.

        -  Participants will continue to have cycles of treatment for as long as the treatment
           continues to be effective and the side effects are not severe enough to stop
           participation in the study.

      Background:

        -  Recurrent glioma patients have very limited treatment options. A significant percentage
           of gliomas have increased activity of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, mostly due to loss of
           PTEN.

        -  AZD8055 is a first in-class inhibitor of the kinase activity of mTOR, specifically
           inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Preclinical data generated in the
           Neuro-Oncology Branch Laboratory of Dr. Howard Fine demonstrated that AZD8055 has
           significant anti-glioma activity in vivo and in vitro.

      Objectives:

        -  To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of continuous once daily AZD8055 in
           patients with recurrent malignant gliomas not on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs
           (EIAED).

        -  To generate pharmacokinetic data on continuous once daily AZD8055 dosing.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients with histologically proven glioma are eligible for this study. Patients should have
      failed prior standard treatment with radiotherapy.

      Design:

        -  This study will accrue up to 24 evaluable patients (non-surgical arm). Cohorts of 3 or 6
           patients will receive continuous AZD8055 once daily orally for 42 days. The MTD will be
           based on the tolerability observed during the first 6 weeks of treatment only. Up to
           three patients may be enrolled simultaneously at each dose level. The dose of AZD8055
           can be progressively escalated if only 0/3 or 1/6 patients experience a dose limiting
           toxicity at the prior dose level.

        -  A subset of patients in whom tumor re-resection is considered standard of care will
           receive 1-week treatment with AZD8055 and then undergo resection. Patients will be
           treated at the highest dose level shown to be safe at the time of enrollment. Once
           patients recover from surgery, they will restart treatment with AZD8055 and stay on
           treatment as long as there is no tumor progression or protocol-mandated removal
           criteria. Management of toxicity will be the same as non-surgical patients receiving
           their second and subsequent cycles of therapy as delineated in the protocol. Up to 12
           patients will enter the surgical arm of this trial.

        -  The accrual ceiling will be open to 42 patients to factor in replacing those who come
           off

      treatment prior to cycle 1.

      -At the end of Cycle 1, patients in both treatment arms (surgical and non-surgical) may
      choose to continue to receive AZD8055 until disease progression or until they experience
      unmanageable drug related toxicity, as long as they are continuing to derive clinical benefit
      and do not fulfill any of the criteria for removal from protocol therapy.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with histologically proven malignant primary gliomas who have progressive
             disease after radiotherapy will be eligible for this protocol. These include
             glioblastoma (GBM), gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic
             oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), and malignant
             glioma/astrocytoma NOS. Additionally, patients with progressive low-grade gliomas and
             patients with infiltrative brainstem gliomas, diagnosed radiographically rather than
             by biopsy, will be eligible.

          -  Patients must have an MRI scan performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a
             fixed dose of steroids for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between
             the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MRI is required.

          -  Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible for the non-surgical arm as long as all of the following conditions apply:

               1. Patients will be eligible four weeks after surgery if they have recovered from
                  the effects of surgery.

               2. Residual disease following resection of recurrent tumor is not mandated for
                  eligibility into the study. To best assess the extent of residual disease
                  postoperatively, an MRI should be done:

                    -  no later than 96 hours in the immediate post-operative period or

                    -  at least 4 weeks post-operatively, and

                    -  within 14 days of registration, and

                    -  on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

        If the 96 hour scan is more than 14 days before registration, the scan needs to be
        repeated. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and registration, a
        new baseline MRI is required on a stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.

          -  Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy.

          -  All patients or their previously designated DPA (if the patient is deemed by the
             treating physician to be cognitively impaired or questionably impaired in such a way
             that the ability of the patient to give informed consent is questionable) must sign an
             informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this
             study.

          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old, and must have a life
             expectancy &gt; 8 weeks.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of greater than or equal to 60.

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks from radiation therapy. Additionally, patients must
             be at least 6 weeks from nitrosoureas, 4 weeks from temozolomide, 3 weeks from
             procarbazine, 2 weeks from vincristine and 2 weeks from last bevacizumab
             administration. Patients must be at least 4 weeks from other cytotoxic therapies not
             listed above and 2 weeks for non-cytotoxic agents (e.g., interferon, tamoxifen)
             including investigative agents. With the exception of alopecia, all toxicities from
             prior therapies should be resolved to CTCAE less than or equal to grade 1.

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC greater than or equal to
             3,000/microL, ANC greater than or equal to 1,500/mm(3), platelet count of greater than
             or equal to 100,000/mm(3), and hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 gm/dl), adequate
             liver function (AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase 2.5 less than or equal to ULN and
             bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN), and adequate renal function
             (creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN and/or creatinine clearance greater
             than or equal to 50 cc/min calculated by Cockcroft-Gault) before starting therapy.
             Patients must also have serum potassium greater than or equal to 3.5 mmol/L, magnesium
             greater than or equal to 0.75 mmol/L and calcium levels within normal levels;
             supplementation is allowed. In cases where the serum calcium is below the normal
             range, 2 options would be available: 1) the calcium adjusted for albumin is to be
             obtained and substituted for the measured serum value. Exclusion is to then be based
             on the adjusted for albumin values falling below the normal limit. 2) Determine the
             ionized calcium levels. Exclusion is then to be based if these ionized calcium levels
             are out of normal range despite supplementation. These tests must be performed within
             14 days prior to registration. Eligibility level for hemoglobin may be reached by
             transfusion.

          -  Patients must either not be receiving steroids, or be on a stable dose of steroids for
             at least five days prior to registration.

          -  This study was designed to include women and minorities, but was not designed to
             measure differences of intervention effects. Males and females will be recruited with
             no preference to gender. No exclusion to this study will be based on race. Minorities
             will actively be recruited to participate.

          -  Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception (condoms).

          -  Female patients should be using adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breast
             feeding and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of
             child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-childbearing potential by
             fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:

               -  Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least
                  12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.

          -  Patients must have normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF greater than or
             equal to 55% or normal by NIH Clinical Center criteria).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who, in the view of the treating physician, have significant active hepatic,
             renal, pulmonary or psychiatric diseases are ineligible.

          -  Prior treatment with AZD8055 or AZD2014.

             be repeated twice (at least 24 hours apart). The average QTc from the three screening
             ECGs must be less than or equal to 470 msec in order for the subject to be eligible
             for the study. Patients who are receiving a drug that has a risk of QTc prolongation

          -  Any concurrent medication that may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades de
             Pointes Drugs, that in the investigator s opinion cannot be discontinued are allowed;
             however, must be monitored closely.
