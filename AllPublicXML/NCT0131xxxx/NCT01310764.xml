  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab as an
      adjunctive treatment to trabeculectomy in open angle glaucoma patients and to compare this
      new drug to the most commonly used anti-scarring agent, mitomycin C.

    <textblock>
      The most common surgical technique for controlling the intraocular pressure in glaucoma
      patients is trabeculectomy.In this surgery, internal cavity of the eye is connected by a
      fistula like openings to subconjunctival space. The main cause of failure in trabeculectomy
      is excessive postoperative conjunctival scarring at the site of fistula, which is related to
      severity of conjunctival vascularization, tortuousity of vessel, and fibroblast migration and
      proliferation. At the time of surgery most surgeons use mitomycin C, which is an antimitotic
      and antifibrotic agent, to improve the results of the procedure. Although this agent is very
      effective, but is not without complication. The most significant and sight threatening
      complications are low intraocular pressure and endophthalmitis. Therefore investigations are
      going on to find a much safer and effective agents. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody
      against vascular endothelial factor (VEGF). VEGF is an important vasculogenic and fibrogenic
      factor with a prominent role in wound healing.Bevacizumab is widely used in ophthalmology and
      has a promising effect in treatment of neovascularization in conjunctiva, cornea and retina.
      There are limited animal and human case series regarding the effect of this agent in
      trabeculectomy. In this study the investigators are trying, in addition to evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of this agent in result of trabeculectomy, compare this agent with
      mitomycin C.
