    <textblock>
      CEP-9722 is an inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase -1 and -2
      (PARP). The primary purpose of this study is to (Part 1) determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of CEP-9722 administered daily to patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors,
      (Part 2) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of that dose, and to investigate whether
      CEP-9722 has antitumor activity as a single agent.
