  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective analysis to identify factors influencing hepatitis B virus
      reactivation in patients treated with rituximab containing chemotherapy. Rituximab monoclonal
      antibody targeting CD20 induces B-cell depletion resulting in prolonged immune suppression.
      This leads to frequent reactivation of patients with a previous history of exposure to HBV or
      HBV carrier.

      We collect the clinical features and laboratory findings of patients satisfied the inclusion
      criteria as follows.

        1. Patients diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or \ follicular B-cell
           lymphoma (FL).

        2. Patients who had received at least two cycles of rituximab-CHOP or rituximab-CVP as a
           primary treatment

        3. Patients with a history of previous exposure to HBV

             -  HBV surface antigen (HBs Ag) positive Or

             -  HBV core antibody (IgG anti-HBc antibody) positive

      Then, we compare the HBV reactivation group with the control group (HBV reactivation does not
      happen) to find factors influencing HBV reactivation.

           serum LDH, serum β2-microglobulin, ECOG performance status, presence of B symptoms,
           International Prognostic Index, bone marrow invasion

        -  Laboratory parameters associated with hepatitis B virus:

      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti- HBs), hepatitis B e
      antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe),
      serum HBV DNA

        -  Lymphoma treatment history:

      Line of treatment (first line, second line), rituximab and chemotherapy administration (dose,
      schedule), start date, last treatment date

        -  Prophylaxis or treatment against HBV reactivation:

      antiviral drug (dose, schedule, duration)

        -  Hepatitis B virus reactivation:

      onset, serologic markers, outcome
