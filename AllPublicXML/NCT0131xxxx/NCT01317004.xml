  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in patient-reported treatment
      satisfaction after 6 months of treatment with fingolimod 0.5mg/day vs. DMT standard of care,
      using the global satisfaction subscale of the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for
      Medication (TSQM-9).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) is a psychometric measure of a patient's satisfaction with medication. It consists of 3 subscales: effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction. The scores were computed by adding items for each domain, i.e. 1 to 3 for effectiveness, 4 - 6 for convenience and 7 to 9 for global satisfaction. The lowest possible score (1 for each item and 3 for all 3 subscales) was subtracted from the composite score and divided by the greatest possible score range. The greatest range was (7-1) X 3 items = 18 for the effectiveness and convenience, and (5-1) x 3 items = 12 for global satisfaction. This provided a transformed score between 0 and 1 that was then multiplied by 100. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Activities of Daily Living (ADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PRIMUS activity measure is a 15-item assessment used to evaluate patient-reported activities of daily living. The PRIMUS activities score was calculated summing the 15 items, after recoding the responses from 1 - 3 to 0 - 2. Therefore, the total score ranged from 0 - 3-, where high scores were indicative of greater function limitation. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a 9-item scale used to assess fatigue. The FSS score was calculated summing the 9 items of the questionnaire and dividing by the number of non-missing items (each item is based on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree)). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen (BDI-FS) is a brief, multiple choice, self reported inventory designed to evaluate depression in patients with medical illness. The BDI-FS score was calculated summing the 7 items of the questionnaire. Each item ranged from 0 (not present) to 3 (severe). The total score ranges from 0-3 (minimal depression), 4-8 (mild depression), 9-12 (moderate depression) and 13-21 (severe depression). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Health Related Quality of Life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 is a validated health-related quality of life instrument used in numerous disease states, including MS. It is a self-administered survey that measures 8 domains of health including: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, pain, general health, energy/fatigue, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and emotional well-being. Additionally, two summary scale scores can be calculated: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). If half or more questions within a domain were answered, then a score was calculated for that domain. Otherwise, the patient score for that domain was set to missing. If the patient was missing any 1 of the 8 scale scores, then the physical and mental component scores were set to missing. An algorithm was used to create a score from 0 to 100 for each domain score and component score. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician-reported Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a rating scale allowing a physician-reported global evaluation of the subject's improvement over time. The Investigator assessed the subject's clinical change relative to the symptoms at baseline on the CGI-I, a seven-point scale, with rating as follows: 1=Very much improved, 2=Much improved, 3=Minimally improved, 4=No change, 5=Minimally worse, 6=Much worse, 7=Very much worse. A lower score and a negative change from baseline indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Treatment Satisfaction</title>
        <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) is a psychometric measure of a patient's satisfaction with medication. It consists of 3 subscales: effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction. The scores were computed by adding items for each domain, i.e. 1 to 3 for effectiveness, 4 - 6 for convenience and 7 to 9 for global satisfaction. The lowest possible score (1 for each item and 3 for all 3 subscales) was subtracted from the composite score and divided by the greatest possible score range. The greatest range was (7-1) X 3 items = 18 for the effectiveness and convenience, and (5-1) x 3 items = 12 for global satisfaction. This provided a transformed score between 0 and 1 that was then multiplied by 100. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Depression</title>
          <description>The Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen (BDI-FS) is a brief, multiple choice, self reported inventory designed to evaluate depression in patients with medical illness. The BDI-FS score was calculated summing the 7 items of the questionnaire. Each item ranged from 0 (not present) to 3 (severe). The total score ranges from 0-3 (minimal depression), 4-8 (mild depression), 9-12 (moderate depression) and 13-21 (severe depression). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
          <population>Participants from the safety set, who had values at both baseline and month 6, were included in the analysis. The safety set included randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient-reported Health Related Quality of Life (QOL)</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 is a validated health-related quality of life instrument used in numerous disease states, including MS. It is a self-administered survey that measures 8 domains of health including: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, pain, general health, energy/fatigue, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and emotional well-being. Additionally, two summary scale scores can be calculated: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). If half or more questions within a domain were answered, then a score was calculated for that domain. Otherwise, the patient score for that domain was set to missing. If the patient was missing any 1 of the 8 scale scores, then the physical and mental component scores were set to missing. An algorithm was used to create a score from 0 to 100 for each domain score and component score. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
