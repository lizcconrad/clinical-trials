    <textblock>
      Laying-on-of-hands is applied in many different situations; however, most reports published
      previously described its efficacy in a clinical setting, with its administration conducted by
      a few expert practitioners. This study aimed to determine the symptomatic changes after a
      single session of the Okada Purifying Therapy, a form of laying-on-of-hands, in various
      settings, and to analyze factors influencing the outcomes.
