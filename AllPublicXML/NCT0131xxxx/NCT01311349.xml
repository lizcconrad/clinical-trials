      Various bacterial organisms will be tested in order to compile information regarding the
      effectiveness of tigecycline against certain bacteria seen in local communities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, microbiologic in vitro evaluation which will study the susceptibility
      of tigecycline in disk diffusion on clinical bacterial isolates collected from inpatients and
      outpatients. Fourteen hospital centers participated in the program. In vitro efficacy of
      tigecycline will be determined through the in vitro disk diffusion activity, using FDA
      breakpoints.
