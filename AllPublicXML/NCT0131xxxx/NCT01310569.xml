  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to search whether whole body and subcutaneous adipose tissues increase in
      PCOS patients and whether these tissues are related to HOMA-IR and plasma adiponectin levels.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty-two patients with PCOS and fifty-tree healthy controls who were matched for body mass
      index (BMI) and age (p=0.430, p=0.112, respectively) were enrolled in the study. Biceps,
      triceps, subscapular and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses (SFT) of all cases were measured via
      caliper device; mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) via a tape; and body fat distributions via
      a bioelectrical impedance device. Insulin resistance was calculated via HOMA-IR while ELISA
      was used to measure plasma adiponectin.
