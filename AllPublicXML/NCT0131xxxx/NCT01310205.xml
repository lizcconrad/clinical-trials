    <textblock>
      This is an extension of ongoing study SCI-SCV-HCV-P2-001 in which subjects will be invited to
      participate in this extension study if they complete treatment in study SCI-SCV-HCV-P2-001
      and are eligible for retreatment with peg-IFN and RBV.

      In this extension study, subjects will be asked to give permission to share their HCV RNA
      viral load test results, obtained from local laboratories, at the different time points and
      will also be asked to give permission to share their SOC dosing information (peg-IFN and
      RBV). As no SCV-07 treatment, procedures, or assessments will be required during this
      extension study, no related safety information will be collected.

      The study will last up to 72 weeks after subjects complete treatment on study
      SCI-SCV-HCV-P2-001 and begin retreatment with peg-IFN and RBV.

        Subjects must be able to understand and sign an ICF approved by the investigator's
        institutional review board (IRB) for this study; must have completed treatment on study
        SCI-SCV-HCV-P2-001; and must, in the judgment of the investigators, be able to benefit from
        retreatment per current SOC (peg-IFN and RBV).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who satisfy any of the following criteria will not be enrolled into the
             study:
