  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many combat Veterans suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an anxiety disorder
      that develops after an extremely stressful event or events. PTSD is associated with problems
      falling asleep or staying asleep. Veterans with PTSD also commonly have nightmares from
      stressful experiences. These symptoms can cause problems in daily life. Behavioral treatments
      that do not involve taking medication have been shown to help improve problems related to
      sleep and nightmares. However, very few of these treatments address both sleep problems and
      nightmares at the same time, even though many people suffer from both problems. The purpose
      of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a combined treatment for sleep problems and
      nightmares in Veterans suffering from combat-related PTSD that is presented in a group
      format. The investigators hypothesize that the completion of this treatment will lead to
      increases in sleep quality and decreases in the frequency and severity of nightmares as
      measured by standard questionnaires.
