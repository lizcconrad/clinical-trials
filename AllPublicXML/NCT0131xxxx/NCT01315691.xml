  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major factor in the respiratory health of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) subjects is the prevalence
      of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection rate in CF
      patients increases with age and by age 18 years approximately 85% of CF patients in the US
      are infected. Liposomal amikacin for inhalation (Arikace™) was developed as a possible
      treatment for chronic infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in CF patients.

      The purpose of this double-blind, placebo controlled study is to determine whether Arikace™
      is effective in treating chronic lung infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Cystic
      Fibrosis subjects. The study will enroll approximately 300 subjects in clinics in the US,
      Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Subjects will be randomized to 590 mg Arikace™ or
      placebo and will receive treatment for 28 days followed by a 56 day safety follow-up period.
      The subjects will be required to visit the clinic 8 times (including the Screening visit)
      over a period of approximately 3 months. No overnight stays at the clinic will be required.
      At the completion of the TR02-109 protocol, subjects who have consented and meet study safety
      criteria may enroll in the long-term, open-label, multi-cycle extension study of 590 mg of
      Arikace™ (under a separate protocol TR02-110).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease resulting from mutations in the cystic fibrosis
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Patients with CF manifest pathological
      changes in a variety of organs that express CFTR. The lungs are frequently affected often
      resulting in chronic infections by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and airway
      inflammation. Treatment of chronic lung infections is one of the principal goals of CF
      therapy. Arikace™ (liposomal amikacin for inhalation) is a sustained-release formulation of
      amikacin encapsulated inside nanoscale liposomal carriers designed for administration via
      inhalation. It is hypothesized that the sustained-release pulmonary targeting and biofilm
      penetration properties of this formulation will have several advantages over current
      therapies in treating CF patients with chronic lung infection caused by Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa.

      This double blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 study has been designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of Arikace™ in treating CF patients with chronic
      bronchopulmonary infection. Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive 590 mg of
      Arikace™ or placebo once daily using a PARI Investigational eFlow® Nebulizer. Subjects will
      receive 28 days of treatment and will then be followed for safety for 56 days. Total study
      duration is up to 102 days (~3 months) including an up to 18 day Screening period. Subjects
      will be evaluated for safety, tolerability and efficacy bi-weekly throughout the study.
      Pharmacokinetics (PK) of Arikace™ in blood, sputum and 24-hour urine will be determined in a
      subgroup of study subjects who consent to PK evaluation.

      At the completion of the TR02-109 protocol, subjects who have consented and meet study safety
      criteria may enroll in the long-term, open-label, multi-cycle extension study of 590 mg of
      Arikace™ (under a separate protocol TR02-110).
