  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cardiovascular system plays a central role in the pathophysiology and prognosis of
      sepsis, yet the correct hemodynamic management of septic patients is still vigorously
      debated. Despite guidelines, the use of CVP and PAOP is seriously criticized for inaccurate
      prediction of fluid requirement. Recently studies showed that early goal-directed therapy
      (EGDT) aimed at achieving a ScvO2 of ≥70% significantly improved survival of septic shock
      patients, yet EGDT has not been adopted by all intensivists. The investigators have recently
      found using 2D echocardiography in 262 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and
      treated by the conventional guidelines (without ScvO2) that diastolic dysfunction and reduced
      stroke volume index are strong independent predictors of mortality. In the present study the
      investigators intend to test the effect of EGDT on resuscitation, on long term myocardial
      function and left ventricular volumes and on survival in ICU patients with severe sepsis and
      septic shock. Patients will be randomized to EGDT (resuscitation directed by ScvO2) or
      standard of therapy for the first six hours after diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock
      and admission to the ICU. After six hours patients in septic shock will be further monitored
      with non invasive cardiac output (PiCCO, Pulsion Technologies). All patients will be followed
      daily by 2D &amp; 3D transthoracic echocardiography with detailed measurements of systolic and
      diastolic left and right ventricular volumes and functions. Patients in the EGDT group will
      be compared to the control group for parameters of initial resuscitation (fluid volumes,
      ScvO2 achieved, inotrope use), initial values from non invasive cardiac output at six hours,
      interventions required from institution of non invasive cardiac output, early and long term
      effects on cardiac function and volumes from echo measurements, and mortality. The
      effectiveness of EGDT will thus be examined in the short and long terms.

      Design: Prospective randomized controlled trial, approved (now submitted for approval) by the
      Institutional Review Board. Over a period of 2 years, 300 patients with severe sepsis or
      septic shock will be randomized to either the currently accepted standard hemodynamic
      treatment in our ICU or to the standard plus goal-directed therapy according to the Rivers
      protocol and the SSC guidelines, i.e. including the addition of ScvO2 measurements and
      consequently derived treatments to achieve ScvO2 ≥70% for the first 6 hours after appearance
      of sepsis or septic shock in the ICU (Fig. 2).

      After the first 6 hours all patients in septic shock (62% of the patients according to our
      preliminary data) will be monitored by continuous cardiac output monitoring. Additionally,
      all patients will be followed daily by transthoracic echocardiography for up 19 to 5 days
      (Fig 3). Since the patients themselves will not be able to sign an informed consent, the
      inclusion to the study will be approved by the attending physician in charge of the ICU who
      will also be able to decide on stopping the study protocol at any time according to his
      clinical judgment as to the best interest of the patient.
