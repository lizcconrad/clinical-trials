      Exercise Trial for Alzheimer's Disease(EXTRA) is a pilot randomized clinical trial involving
      a physcial activity program versus a healthy lifestyle program, with one year follow-up in 30
      non-disabled, community-dwelling persons, age 65 and older.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs in 1 in 7 individuals over 65, and 1 in 2 individuals over
      85. While the progression of AD is extremely variable, it is generally established that AD
      subjects will move from having compromised function in socail and work settings, to requiring
      institutionalization and/or intensive management within 10 years of initial clinical
      diagnosis. A randomized controlled piot trial is needed to provide information regarding
      exercies effects on individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

      Exercise Trial for Alzheimer's Disease (EXTRA) is a pilot randomized controlled trial
      designed to compare a moderate-intesity physical activity program to a healthy lifestyle
      health education program in 30 older adults with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease. These
      individuals will be followed for 1 year.

      This trial will provide pilot evidence regarding whether physical activity is effective and
      practical for individuals with AD. The effects of an exercise intervention on halting,
      slowing, or reversing the cognitive effects of AD will be assessed with pilot data and
      potentially provide support for a larger trial in the future.

    <description>The healthy lifestyle program includes upper body stretching and educational workshops. The purpose of this group is to control for general levels of staff and participant time and attention, in addition to general secular and seasonal effects that could influence the outcomes of interest. The rational for this &quot;placebo exercise&quot; activity is that it helps foster adherence to this arm of the study and increases the perceived benefit of the healthy lifestyle program to the participants without directly affecting the study outcomes.</description>

    <description>The physical activity intervention consists of a general weekly physical activity goal of 150 minutes. This is consistent with the public health message from the Surgeon General's report that moderate physical activity should be performed for 30 minutes on most if not all days of the week (150-210 total minutes). This goal is approached in a progressive manner over the course of the trial.</description>
