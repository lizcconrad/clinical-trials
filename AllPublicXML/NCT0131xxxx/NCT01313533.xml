  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be 25-95 years of age and able to give informed consent

          2. Use of an approved statin and anti-platelet medication for at least 24 months.

          3. Agreeable to Cardiovascular imaging at 12 months post-coronary artery bypass graft
             (CABG).

          4. First time coronary artery bypass surgery,redo coronary artery bypass surgery and
             combined valve repair/replacement surgery and coronary artery bypass graft surgery are
             eligible to participate in study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute traumatic injury, vasculitis or planned concurrent ventricular surgical
             restoration, automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators (AICD) placement or
             valvular surgery.

          2. Hypercoaguable state.

          3. Comorbid illness making 2 year survival unlikely.

          4. Participation in another interventional investigative study of a cardiovascular drug
             or device within 30 days prior to CABG. May participate concurrently in other studies
             where the intervention/observation will not hinder execution of this study.

          5. Patients with any medical condition that, in the investigator's judgment, makes the
             patient ineligible or places the patient at undue risk (e.g. conditions that preclude
             standard invasive follow up procedures such as angiography, i.e. renal failure,
             bleeding diathesis or peripheral vascular disease preventing catheterization via the
             groin).

          6. Subject has clinical evidence of infection that the Investigator deems significant to
             the completion of the procedure or that could compromise the subject's safety.

          7. Any patient was has undergone more than 20 computerized tomography (CAT) scans.

          8. Any patient who is pregnant.
