      This purpose of this study is to

        1. Determine the change in endothelial dependent vascular reactivity and vascular
           properties

        2. Determine the changes in monocytes activation

        3. Determine the change in pro-inflammatory status

        4. Investigate the effect of six-month CPAP therapy on the above changes in patients with
           OSA

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized with chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) and
      sleep fragmentation, is associated with three-fold higher risk of cardiovascular events. CIH
      could promote production of ROS which induced the adhesion of circulating monocytes,
      endothelium injury, and production of pro-inflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules and
      lead to formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Recent studies showed vascular endothelium
      function could be noninvasively assessed with Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in brachial
      artery, whereas OSA patients have lower FMD compared to control subjects. However, the CPAP
      effects on vascular function have conflicting results. Conflicts usually involve the small
      sample size, lack of appropriate control, and inadequate control of confounding factors, like
      physical activity, and duration of CPAP treatment. Also, CPAP effect on other monocytes
      activation and inflammatory mediators are clear as well. Our previous studies showed 12-week
      CPAP treatment could not modify the levels of TNF-Î± and hsCRP. However, the 12-week treatment
      may be not long enough to draw the conclusions for benefit from long-term CPAP therapy.
      Therefore, we plan to conduct a cross-sectional followed by a double blind, randomized,
      placebo-control, parallel-group interventional study to prove our hypothesis that OSA can
      lead to endothelial dysfunction, monocytes activation, and pro-inflammatory state which leads
      to and vasculopathy and those changes can be reverted by CPAP.
