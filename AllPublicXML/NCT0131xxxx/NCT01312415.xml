  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement (TKR) is associated postoperatively with considerable pain and
      analgesic requirement. Total knee replacement is routinely performed under spinal anaesthesia
      with intrathecal bupivacaine plus preservative free morphine. We hypothesize that
      infiltration of the surgical site with peri- and intraarticular levobupivacaine local
      anaesthetic would be an efficacious pain management technique and would not be inferior to
      intrathecal morphine for postoperative pain management.

      We further hypothesize that the use of this surgical site infiltration technique would
      decrease post-operative systemic opioid requirements as well as the side effects associated
      with intrathecal and systemic opioids.

    <description>Patients will receive spinal anaesthesia with intrathecal bupivacaine (17.5 or 15 mg) without morphine, and will receive peri- and intraarticular surgical site infiltration before wound closure with a solution of levobupivacaine 0.5% 2mg/kg body weight (maximum 200mg levobupivacaine) plus 0.5mg epinephrine made up to 100ml with saline. An intra-articular catheter will be placed by the surgeon before closure under the sterile surgical conditions and this will be left in situ in the wound. The patient will receive one further injection of 15ml of levobupivacaine 0.5% at 8am the following morning.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive peri- and intraarticular surgical site infiltration to the knee during surgery and before wound closure with a solution of levobupivacaine 0.5% 2mg/kg body weight (maximum 200mg levobupivacaine will be used if the patient's weight exceeds 100kg) plus 0.5mg epinephrine made up to 100ml with saline. An intra-articular catheter will be placed by the surgeon before closure under the sterile surgical conditions and this will be left in situ in the wound. The patient will receive one further injection of 15ml of levobupivacaine 0.5% solution at 8am on the morning of the first postoperative day after which the catheter will be removed.</description>
