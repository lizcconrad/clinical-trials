  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy when using a novel dose
      conversion strategy to switch from immediate release oral opioids to sublingual (SL) fentanyl
      (Abstral) for treatment of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to show that in the advanced stage of cancer the individual patient already on
      high doses of BTcP medication will benefit from starting treatment on a higher first dose of
      SL fentanyl thus reducing the number of dosing steps with insufficient pain relief.

    <description>Baseline period: 7-15 episodes of breakthrough cancer pain treated with prior IR opioid medication
Treatment period: Conversion to SL Fentanyl at a Fentanyl:Prior opioid conversion factor of 1:50 (using the estimated Morphine Sulphate Equivalent dose for the prior opioid). SL Fentanyl use was followed for 8-15 episodes of breakthrough cancer pain. SL Fentanyl dose could be titrated between episodes.</description>

    <description>SL fentanyl will be administered during 7- 15 BTcP episodes during a maximum period of 21 days, following a baseline period with standard BTcP treatment. The start dose of SL fentanyl is selected individually according to a standardized conversion ratio. The maximum start dose is limited to 400 μg. For a single BTcP episode no more than two (2) tablets or a maximum dose of 800 μg should be given.</description>
