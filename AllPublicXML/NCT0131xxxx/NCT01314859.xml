  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for pregnant women who have been diagnosed with Threatened Preterm Labor. The
      principal aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Nifedipine treatment
      versus Atosiban treatment over these patients' newborn babies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm labor is defined as the presence of uterine contractions of sufficient frequency and
      intensity to effect progressive effacement and dilation of the cervix prior to term gestation
      (between 20 and 37 weeks).

      It is a major health problem of increased incidence, affecting approximately between 7-10% of
      pregnant women in developed countries with a high socioeconomic costs and high rates of fetal
      mortality, although perinatal progress.

      This study may allow to establish the existence of differences in perinatal outcomes and to
      define the first choice drug for tocolysis.
