    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ➢ Diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hip for at least one hip (right or left hip, or
             both hips) determined by satisfaction of BOTH of the following (as outlined in the
             STUDY TEST BATTERY section above):

               -  the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Classification Criteria for
                  osteoarthritis of the hip, AND

               -  Rating of current Degree of Pain in the hip on the 0-100 Visual Analog Scale of
                  40 or greater.

        N.B.: If both hips satisfy both of the above criteria for diagnosis of osteoarthritis of
        the hip, the hip with the highest VAS pain rating will be selected for evaluation in this
        study. That is, only one hip per subject will be evaluated in this study.

          -  Hip pain was present on most days of the prior three months.

          -  Subject is ambulatory.

          -  Subject's use of pain relief medication(s) has been stable over the past 30 days, and
             the subject is willing and able to maintain this existing use of pain relief
             medication(s) as his or her sole pain relief medication use, as needed, throughout
             study participation.

          -  Subject has been on current non-pain relief medication regimen (for any indication or
             condition such as hypertension, pulmonary disease or cardiac disease), unchanged, or
             on no current non-pain relief medication regimen, for at least 30 days prior to study
             enrollment, and is willing and able to maintain his or her regular non-pain relief
             medication regimen, unchanged, throughout the course of his or her study participation
             unless the subject's physician states that a medication change is needed for the
             subject's safety and well-being, in which case the subject agrees to inform the study
             PI of the change(s) made ,.

          -  Willing and able to abstain from partaking in other/new treatments (other than the
             study procedures) to improve osteoarthritis of the hip pain and other symptoms during
             the course of participation in the study. Such treatments include new medications,
             dietary/herbal supplements/ minerals, weight loss programs, water or other new
             exercise programs, physical therapy, occupational therapy, surgical procedures, and
