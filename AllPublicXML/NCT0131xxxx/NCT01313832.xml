  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative myocardial and pulmonary protection is important for better outcome after
      cardiac surgery. Ischemic preconditioning is one of organ protective strategies against
      ischemia-reperfusion injury by applying brief ischemia to the target organ before a
      subsequent critical ischemia, and its effect has been confirmed. However, its clinical
      application is not easy because ischemic insult may aggravate the function of vulnerable
      organ.

      On the other hand, remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is another protective approach by
      applying ischemia to other less vulnerable organ such as skeletal muscle before critical
      ischemia-reperfusion injury to heart. The effect of RIPC has been well demonstrated in adults
      and children. However, Little is known about the effect of remote ischemic precondition on
      the pediatric myocardium to ischemia and reperfusion injury. The effect of RIPC on the
      children remains to be further evaluated because the degree of ischemia-reperfusion injury is
      different according to age, cardiac pathology and cyanosis. In addition, the previous report
      on children dealt with a diverse range of congenital heart defects with a wide age range. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of RIPC on myocardial and pulmonary
      protection in infants with pulmonary hypertension who need repair of simple ventricular
      septal defect.
