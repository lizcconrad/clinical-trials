      The study investigates the safety and efficacy of PMX-60056 for the Reversal of Heparin in
      Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PMX-60056 is being developed as a rapid and effective reversal agent for use in those
      situations where anticoagulation by heparin, or LMWH must be quickly stopped. Potential uses
      include reversal of anticoagulation induced to prevent clotting during surgical procedures,
      and rescue from cases of inadvertent or unexpected overdose.
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    PolyMedix decided to stop enrollment in both clinical trials due to observations of reductions
    in blood pressure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient will undergo PCI for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes with a
             procedure that uses anticoagulation before the instrumentation and reversal of
             anticoagulation immediately after the procedure.

          2. Male or female patients of any race, aged 18-80 years old.

          3. The patient will be anti-coagulated with unfractionated heparin.

          4. The patient is medically stable and physically and mentally able to participate in
             this study.

          5. The patient has given written informed consent to participate in this study after
             fully understanding the implications and constraints of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient requires emergency surgery under conditions which prevent compliance with
             this protocol or which might cause unacceptable risk to the patient.

          2. The patient requires any concomitant surgical procedures (e.g., carotid artery, CABG)
             during the PCI.

          3. The patient has received any investigational drug within 30 days of study enrollment,
             or has had any prior exposure to PMX-60056.

          4. The patient has any condition or abnormality which may, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, compromise the safety of the patient.

          5. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding.

          6. The patient is of childbearing potential and not under adequate contraceptive
             protection.

          7. The patient has a history of clinically significant hematologic disease including
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, bleeding disorders, or platelet count &lt;100,000.

          8. Severe impaired hepatic function (SGOT, SGPT &gt;2 x ULN).

          9. History of AIDS, Â± HIV.

         10. History of allergy to heparin (beef or pig), protamine, or salmon.

         11. History of chronic alcohol or drug abuse within the last one year.
