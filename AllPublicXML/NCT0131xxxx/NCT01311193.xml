  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) frequently suffer from emotional
      instability, daytime fatigue and sleep disturbances. The investigators examined circadian
      rhythms, sleep and well-being in women with BPD under their habitual life conditions with and
      without light treatment.

      Treated women diagnosed with BPD were investigated during 3 weeks without and 3 weeks with
      morning LT. Rest-activity cycles were continuously measured using wrist actigraphy, together
      with proximal skin temperature. Saliva samples were collected weekly to determine the diurnal
      melatonin rhythm. A range of self-ratings and questionnaires were used to assess depression
      and clinical state throughout the 6-week protocol. Ten matched healthy women followed the
      same 6-week protocol without light treatment.
