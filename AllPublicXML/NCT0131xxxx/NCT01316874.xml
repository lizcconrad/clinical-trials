      This is a Phase II/Phase III study of intravesical AD 32 (valrubicin) in patients with
      carcinoma in situ (CIS) who have been previously treated with intravesical Bacillus
      Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for CIS and in whom recurrence or failure has occurred after multiple
      courses of intravesical treatment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion-

          1. Patients must have pathologically-proven CIS with no evidence of muscle invasive
             disease.

          2. Patients with concurrent Ta or T1 papillary tumors are eligible provided papillary
             tumor(s) are resected prior to study treatment. Cystoscopic evaluation and, if
             indicated, transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) must be performed within
             28 days of study treatment.

          3. Patients must have received at least two or more prior courses of intravesical therapy
             for CIS per the recommended schedules. BCG must have been one of the prior therapies
             administered. Patients can have either failed BCG therapy or have been successfully
             treated with BCG, but subsequently found to have recurrence. The standard course of
             intravesical therapy must include six weekly treatments (allowable range of
             instillations per course is 4-9).

          4. Patients must have a positive urine cytology at baseline (&lt;28 days) prior to the first
             AD 32 (valrubicin) treatment. Patients with papillary lesions must have a positive
             cytology following TURBT or have a baseline cytology that was negative or equivocal
             and histologic confirmation of CIS.

          5. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and a life expectancy of at least
             6 months.

        Exclusion-

          1. Patients with urogenital tumors with histology other than transitional cell carcinoma

          2. Patients with residual papillary disease at the time of study treatment.

          3. Patients with a history of other primary malignancy (other than squamous or basal cell
             skin cancers) within the last 5 years.

          4. Patients with evidence of muscle invasive disease (stage higher than T1).

          5. Patients with any previous intravesical treatment with AD 32 (valrubicin).

          6. Patients with any intravesical therapy within 28 days prior to first AD 32
             (valrubicin) treatment.

          7. Patients with a plan to receive other concurrent therapy for treatment of primary
             treatment tumor during participation in this study.

          8. Patients who had received prior systemic or radiation therapy for bladder cancer.

          9. Women who were pregnant or lactating. Individuals of reproductive potential could not
             participate unless agreeing to use an effective contraceptive method for themselves
             and/or their sexual partners.

         10. Patients who, in the investigator's opinion, could not comply with the provisions of
             the protocol or did not understand the nature of the study.

         11. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, could not tolerate intravesical
             administration of approximately 75 mL of fluid or who could not tolerate surgical
             manipulation (cystoscopy, mapping biopsies, barbotage) due to the presence of
             concomitant serious illnesses (ie, uncontrolled cardiac or respiratory disorders).
