  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted to evaluate the performance of the Pelvic Alignment Level (PAL)
      instrument in achieving desired acetabular position, desired leg length and offset after
      Total Hip Replacement (THR) reconstruction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement (THR) has been a sucessful treatment for cases of degenerative joint
      diseases. However, post operative complications such as dislocations, osteolysis, component
      wear and migration are still a concern. It has been noted in the scientific literature that
      precise acetabular cup position helps reduce such post operative complications. The Pelvic
      Alignment Level (PAL) offers this solution by assessing pelvic motion and optimizing implant
      position without the need for intra-operative fluoroscopy or a large capital expenditure. The
      focus of this study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes (acetabular cup placement, femoral
      offset, and leg length) of using the PAL instrument to those without using PAL instrument
      during total hip replacement. This will be a prospective, post market, randomized
      multi-center clinical study.
