  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Certain types of cancers, including sarcoma and melanoma, have specific antigens (protein
      molecules) on their surfaces. Research has shown that producing an immune reaction to these
      antigens may be able to keep tumors from growing by encouraging the immune system to destroy
      the tumor cells. By creating a vaccine that contains antigens similar to those found on the
      cancer cells, researchers hope to cause an immune reaction that targets the cancer cells.
      However, more research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of this type of
      vaccine treatment.

      Objectives:

      - To determine whether a tumor cell vaccine, given to individuals who have had surgery to
      remove malignant tumors from the chest, can cause an immune reaction that will prevent the
      tumors from coming back.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with cancer that has spread to
      the lungs, pleura, or mediastinum, and have recently had surgery to remove tumors in the
      chest.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well
           as blood tests and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will have the option to have leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for
           studies on how the body is responding to the vaccine. Participants who agree to have
           this procedure will have it before the start of treatment and after the sixth and eighth
           vaccines.

        -  Seven days before the first vaccine, participants will receive the chemotherapy drugs
           celecoxib and cyclophosphamide to take twice a day at home.

        -  Participants will receive the experimental vaccine as an injection in the thigh or arm,
           and may receive it in two shots depending on how many cells are in each vaccine.
           Participants will receive a diary to monitor medication doses and side effects, as well
           as additional cyclophosphamide and celecoxib to take at home as directed by the study.

        -  Participants will have one vaccine every month for 6 months, and will have regular blood
           tests and imaging studies. After the sixth vaccine, participants who have successfully
           responded to the treatment will have two additional vaccines given 3 months apart.

        -  After the eighth vaccine, participants will have followup visits every 3 months for 1
           year and then every 6 months for up to 4 years.

      Background:

      During recent years, the cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTA) have emerged as attractive targets
      for cancer immunotherapy. Whereas malignancies of diverse histologies express a variety of
      CTAs, immune responses to these antigens appear uncommon in cancer patients, possibly due to
      low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, as well as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells.
      Conceivably, vaccination of cancer patients with allogeneic tumor cells expressing high
      levels of multiple CTAs in combination with depletion of T regulatory cells will induce broad
      immunity to these antigens. In order to examine this issue, patients with sarcomas,
      melanomas, germ cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or
      mediastinum will be vaccinated with irradiated K562 erythroleukemia cells expressing GM-CSF
      (K562-GM) following thoracic metastasectomy. Vaccines will be administered in conjunction
      with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg PO BID x 7d q 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO
      BID). Serologic responses to a variety of recombinant CTAs will be assessed before and after
      vaccination.

      Primary Objectives:

      -To assess the safety of K562-GM allogeneic tumor cell vaccines in combination with oral
      metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib in patients undergoing thoracic metastasectomy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically proven sarcoma, melanoma, or epithelial
           malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum who can be rendered no clinical
           evidence of active disease (NED).

        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 2, without
           evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate
           pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted;
           pCO2 less than 50 mm Hg and pO2 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG; and be on no
           immunosuppressive medications except inhaled corticosteroids at the time vaccination
           commences.

        -  Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100,000, an ANC equal to or greater
           than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic
           function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of &lt;1.5 times upper limits of normal. Serum
           creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater
           than 70 ml/min/1.73m(2) at the time vaccination commences.

      Design:

        -  Following recovery from thoracic metastasectomy, patients with NED or MRD will be
           vaccinated via deep subcutaneous injection with 1x10(8) irradiated K562 GM-tumor cells
           periodically over 6 months.

        -  Vaccines will be administered in conjunction with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and
           celecoxib.

        -  Systemic toxicities, and immunologic response to therapy will be recorded. Pre and post
           vaccination serologic responses to a standard panel of CT antigens as well as cell
           mediated responses to epigenetically-modified autologous EBV-transformed B and
           autologous tumor cells (if available) will be assessed before and after vaccination.

        -  Numbers/percentages and function of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood will be
           assessed before, during, and after vaccinations.

        -  Patients will be followed in the clinic with routine staging scans until disease
           recurrence.

        -  As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined
           following completion of the trial, and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the
           analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than
           definitive.

        -  Approximately 25 patients will be accrued to this trial.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Patients with sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies
                  metastatic to the lungs, mediastinum, or pleura that have no clinical evidence of
                  active disease (NED).

               2. Patients with active disease outside the thorax may be eligible for study once
                  the extrathoracic disease is definitively treated by local modalities such as

               3. Patients must have received or refused first line standard systemic therapy for
                  their metastases (if applicable).

               4. Patients must be enrolled within 52 weeks following completion of metastasectomy
                  and have shown no evidence of disease during that time.

               5. Patients with intracranial metastases, which have been treated by surgery or
                  radiation therapy may be eligible for study provided there is no evidence of
                  active disease and no requirement for anticonvulsant therapy or steroids
                  following treatment.

               6. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 2.

               7. Patients must be 18 years of age or older due to the unknown effects of
                  immunologic responses to germ cell-restricted gene products during childhood and
                  adolescent development.

               8. Patients must have evidence of adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic and renal
                  function as evidenced by the following laboratory parameters:

                    -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1500/mm(3)

               9. Seronegative for HIV antibody. Note: The experimental treatment being evaluated
                  in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune competence and thus may be less responsive
                  to the experimental treatment.
