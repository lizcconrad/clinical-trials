      1. To test whether chronic intermittent cold exposure is more effective in programmed body
           weight loss when compared to conventional programmed weight loss.

        2. To measure the metabolic responses (e.g. in the white and brown adipose tissue, muscle
           and circulating markers) of treatment with chronic intermittent cold exposure and
           conventional treatment

        3. To measure tissue specific changes of weight loss and the treatment with chronic
           intermittent cold exposure in glucose uptake rate in adipose organ (white and brown
           adipose tissue), liver, myocardium, skeletal muscle and brain

        4. To measure tissue specific biochemical indicators before and after treatment with
           chronic intermittent cold exposure from white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.

        5. To compare changes in body composition and fat distribution after weight loss using
           chronic cold exposure or using conventional method

    <description>Cryotherapy: The whole-cody cryotherapy device (Univers Cryo-Combi;Oy MJG Univers Ab, Helsinki, Finland) consists of 3 chambers set at different temperatures. The first 2 chambers are meant for precooling (−30°Cand−60°C), and the patient remains in these for a very short time. The third chamber temperature reaches -110°C, and the patient remains inside for 3-4 minutes wearing a bathing suit or trunks, acral parts covered.</description>
