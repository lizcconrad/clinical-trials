  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions remains a difficult problem in clinical
      practice. At present, the treatment planning in pancreatic cystic neoplasms is significantly
      restricted by the limited preoperative diagnosis. Ultrasonography (US), multidetector
      computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the conventional
      modalities in imaging of pancreatic cystic neoplasms, but by these methods the diagnostic
      accuracy still remains compromised. Furthermore, recently encouraging results have been
      obtained in pancreatic cystic neoplasms using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography (18F-FDG-PET) The aim of the current project is to evaluate the possibility to
      enhance the diagnostic accuracy by using the combined 18F-FDG-PET-CT imaging in patients with
      pancreatic cystic neoplasms by combining PET-CT with MRI and MDCT.

      Today, in clinical practice the diagnosis pancreatic cystic neoplasms are based on MDCT, MRI
      and ERCP followed by surgical exploration. The information gained by conventional imaging
      modalities is restricted to the morphological details, which usually is insufficient for the
      definitive staging of the pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Based on these previous studies, it
      seems that PET especially combined with CT modality could improve the diagnostic accuracy of
      the pancreatic cystic lesions.

      So far, there are only few cases published concerning the role of 18F-FDG-PET-CT in the
      differential diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions. Therefore, more studies are needed to
      determine the role of combined 18F-FDG-PET-CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic lesions.

      The aim of the current project is to evaluate the possibility to enhance the diagnostic
      accuracy by using the combined 18F-FDG-PET-CT imaging in patients with pancreatic cystic
      neoplasms by combining PET-CT with MRI and MDCT.

      The study consists of 20-30 patients with pancreatic cystic neoplasms. The patients enrolled
      in the study will be imaged by MDCT, MRI combined with magnetic resonance
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and
      18F-FDG-PET-CT followed by surgery or follow-up. The data will be collected between 2011 and
      2013.
