  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reliable and timely detection of acute rejections in renal transplant patients is important
      to preserve the graft function and to prevent premature graft failure. The current gold
      standard for the rejection diagnosis is a renal biopsy which is usually performed upon an
      unexplained decline in the graft function (determined by serum creatinine or clearance).
      Because of the insensitivity of creatinine determinations and the invasiveness of renal
      biopsies, non-invasive tests have been suggested to diagnose acute rejection including mass
      spectrometry (MS) analysis of urine samples.

      The ability of MS analysis to detect acute rejection has been demonstrated in small studies
      on selected patients but evidence is lacking that this test is efficacious in the routine
      setting of the post-transplant patient care. Based on our previous work that established
      urine peptide sets for acute rejection by MS, a prospective, multicentre diagnostic phase III
      study will be executed.

      The aim of the study is to prove that this test is as equally effective as the allograft
      biopsy to detect acute rejection in patients that undergo a biopsy for unexplained renal
      dysfunction. The perspective of this approach is that the test could be used either in place
      of the biopsy or as decision guidance whether a biopsy is necessary to confirm the presence
      of rejection. Another perspective is that the MS test (respectively, a simplified test system
      derived from this method) could be used in the regular post-transplant surveillance for acute
      rejection, in place of the relatively insensitive procedure with periodic monitoring of the
      graft function by creatinine determinations.

    <measure>Ability of the urine mass spectrometry test to diagnose acute renal allograft rejection, compared to the gold standard 'allograft biopsy'</measure>
    <time_frame>Results of the urine test will be assessed in relation to the simultaneously performed allograft biopsy (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>In patients with unexplained renal allograft dysfunction who get an allograft biopsy to clarify if an acute rejection is present, a simultaneous urine sample will be taken.
The peptide pattern of this urine sample is analyzed by mass spectrometry and a diagnosis is made (rejection present/not present) based on a pre-defined peptide pattern which was established to detect acute allograft rejection.
In the primary outcome analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of the rejection diagnosis by the urine test is compared to the diagnosis made by the allograft biopsy.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity and specificity of the urine test to diagnose acute renal allograft rejection in subgroups with different severity grades of the rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>Results of the urine test will be assessed in relation to the simultaneously performed allograft biopsy (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity/specificity measures for the urine test will be determined in subgroups of patients with different severity of the rejection. Severity grading is based on the pathomorphological classification of the rejection (according to the BANFF classification) and on the functional impairment of the allograft at the time of rejection diagnosis.</description>

    <description>Sensitivity/specificity measures for the urine test will be determined in subgroups of patients who have a kidney transplant or a combined pancreas/kidney transplant.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity and specificity of the urine test to diagnose acute renal allograft rejection in subgroups with concurrent infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Results of the urine test will be assessed in relation to the simultaneously performed allograft biopsy (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity/specificity measures for the urine test will be determined in subgroups of patients who have concurrent infections at the time of the biopsy and urine sampling such as cytomegaly virus, polyoma virus, and urinary tract infection. The analysis intends to identify potential interference of these conditions with the urine mass spectrometry test.</description>
