             to normal source plasma donors with the following exceptions.

          -  Subjects who previously tested positive for HBsAg may be accepted into the anti-HBs
             program provided they now test negative and meet all other normal donor suitability
             criteria.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have received a hepatitis vaccination in the previous six months.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to yeast or any component of the Engerix-BÂ® vaccine.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any hepatitis B-containing vaccine.

          -  Use of any investigational product within the past 30 days or during the course of the

             entry)

          -  Received parenteral immune globulin products or blood products within 3 months before
             study entry with the following exceptions (as specified by plasma center procedures):
