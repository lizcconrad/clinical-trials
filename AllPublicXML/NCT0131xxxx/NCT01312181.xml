  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among HIV-infected individuals, non-injection drug use (NIDU) is associated with poor HIV
      medication adherence, greater HIV/AIDS risk behaviors, and increasing non-AIDS mortality.
      Thus reducing NIDU among HIV infected individuals is critical to their survival and to
      limiting the spread of HIV. We propose to study the efficacy of a technologically enhanced
      brief intervention (HealthCall) to reduce NIDU in HIV primary care patients that demands
      little from busy medical staff and is well accepted by patients. In a 3-arm randomized
      clinical trial will test the efficacy of (a) Motivational Interviewing (MI)+HealthCall; (b)
      MI-only; and (c) a control condition (advice + DVD HIV health education) in reducing NIDU.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All research volunteers will be 18 and older and HIV positive. We will include
             participants whose primary drug is non-injection use of cocaine, opioids including
             heroin, or methamphetamines and current use in the past 30 days &gt; 4 days. Participants
             will need to complete a medically supervised detoxification if such detoxification is
             required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excluded are research volunteers for whom participation would not be clinically
             appropriate, who clearly could not participate. Psychotic, suicidal or homicidal
             patients require clinical management that is too intensive for this study, and we have
             no evidence that MI+HealthCall would be effective among injection drug users. Leaving
             New York precludes follow-up. Gross psychomotor/cognitive impairments that may hinder
             patients' HealthCall use. Hearing and severe vision impairments that preclude
             telephone use precludes randomization to MI+HealthCall.
