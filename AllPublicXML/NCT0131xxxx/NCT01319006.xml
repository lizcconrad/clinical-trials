      A randomized, open label, 3-period crossover study in healthy subjects. The primary objective
      of this study is to determine the relative bioavailability of GSK1278863A after single oral
      doses of 100mg GSK1278863A tablets with particle sizes of 13, 29, or 41 micrometers (um) in
      healthy subjects.

             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             contraception methods

             diastolic and &lt;=140mm Hg systolic/90mm Hg diastolic.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening medical assessment,
             laboratory examination, or ECG (12 lead) judged by the Investigator and /or medical
             monitor to potentially introduce additional risk factors and/or interfere with the

          -  Significant cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, renal, hepatic, neurological, psychiatric,
             or gastrointestinal conditions that in the opinion of the investigator and/or GSK

             trial.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the investigational products, or components thereof
             or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

             (juice), star fruit, onions, kale, broccoli, green beans, or apples from 7 days prior
             to the first dose of investigational product, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor this will not interfere with the study procedures
             and compromise subject safety.
