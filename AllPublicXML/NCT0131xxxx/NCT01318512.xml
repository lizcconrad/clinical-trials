  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational, prospective, multicenter study will describe the mean dose of Mircera
      (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) and the hemoglobin levels in patients with chronic
      kidney disease. Patients are not on dialysis and are naive to, or have received
      erythropoiesis stimulating agent treatment. Data will be collected for 10 months.
