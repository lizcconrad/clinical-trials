  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the western lifestyle, correlated with a high calorie intake and low physical
      activity, obesity is becoming a major health problem. All over the world obesity reaches
      epidemic proportions. Obesity is closely linked to type 2 diabetes, a multi-factorial disease
      that increases the presence of multiple health problems. Until now, exercise and dietary
      intervention seem to be the single most effective interventions to treat obesity and type 2
      diabetes mellitus. In obesity and type 2 diabetes, not only fat accumulation in adipose
      tissue, but also fat accumulation in the peripheral tissues occurs. Fat accumulation in
      peripheral tissues has been associated with insulin resistance. Exercise seems to have a
      positive effect on the accumulation of fat in the peripheral tissue and on the insulin
      sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients.

      In this study we want to investigate if a prolonged exercise training program can lower the
      intrahepatic lipid content and can improve the metabolism of the liver in type 2 diabetic
      patients and patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and to examine if this leads to
      improvements in metabolic risk markers. To this end, we will include investigation of the
      effect of exercise on adipose tissue (inflammatory markers and adipocyte size) and skeletal
      muscle (ex vivo lipid metabolism) to incorporate the effect of exercise on liver, muscle and
      adipose tissue and to clarify the crosstalk between these tissues in the pathophysiology of
      type 2 diabetes.

    <measure>Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp for measurement of insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After taking fasting blood samples, a primed constant infusion of glucose is initiated. Plasma glucose levels are clamped at ~5 mmol/L by variable co-infusion of 20 % glucose. Every 5 minutes, blood is sampled for immediate determination of plasma glucose concentration. Glucose infusion rate is adjusted to obtain plasma glucose levels of ~5 mmol/L (euglycemia). A bolus of insulin is then infused. Before and during steady state, substrate oxidation is measured using an indirect calorimeter, which determines metabolic flexibility.</description>

    <description>A small amount of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (~1g) will be collected under local anaesthesia (2% lidocain) using needle biopsy (with the needle connected to a vacuum syringe). Inflammatory markers in the adipose tissue (e.g. IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, PAI-1, TNFa, CD68, CD163, CD11b, MCP-1, leptin, adiponectin mRNA expression) and adipocyte size will be analysed</description>

    <description>. After local anaesthesia (2.0% Xylocain without adrenaline), a 5-mm diameter side-cutting needle will be passed through a 7-mm skin incision, according to the protocol of the Medical Ethical committee of the Academic Hospital and University of Maastricht. The muscle biopsy will be used to measure ex vivo lipid metabolism, muscle mitochondrial density and muscle mitochondrial function.</description>
