  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement is a major surgical procedure usually associated with significant pain
      in the early postoperative period. In our hospital, total hip replacement is routinely
      performed under spinal anaesthesia with intrathecal bupivacaine local anaesthetic plus opioid
      in the form of preservative free morphine. The use of 'local infiltration analgesia' as an
      alternative postoperative analgesic technique has been investigated.In this technique the
      surgeon infiltrates the surgical site with a long-acting local anaesthetic and places a
      catheter under direct vision which remains in situ and is used to administer local
      anaesthetic in the postoperative period until such time as it is removed (when no longer
      deemed necessary for pain relief or at a pre-set time in the postoperative period e.g. 48
      hours). We hypothesize that infiltration of the surgical site with peri- and intraarticular
      levobupivacaine local anaesthetic would be an efficacious pain management technique and would
      not be inferior to intrathecal morphine for postoperative pain management.

    <description>Patients will receive spinal anaesthesia with intrathecal bupivacaine, and will receive peri- and intraarticular surgical site infiltration during surgery and before wound closure with a solution of levobupivacaine 0.5% 2mg/kg body weight with epinephrine made up to a volume of 1.5ml/kg with saline. A catheter will be placed by the surgeon before closure and this will be left in situ in the wound. The catheter will be sited under the fascia lata exiting antero-superior to the incision. A bacterial filter will be attached and it will be connected to an elastomeric pump which will deliver a continuous infusion of levobupivacaine 0.25% at 4ml/hr commencing 6 hours postoperatively and continuing for 24 hours.</description>
