  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm the clinical benefit observed in the pivotal
      registration study, Hx-CD20-406. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)
      required that a randomized study be conducted in CLL patients with bulky
      fludarabine-refractory disease as a specific obligation for grant of conditional approval for
      ARZERRA™ in the European Union (EU). This study will compare ofatumumab with the physicians'
      choice of therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with CLL that is refractory to fludarabine have few treatment options and a poor
      prognosis. There is a continued need for new therapies for these CLL patients, as
      demonstrated by the limited responses and substantial toxicities with existing therapies.
      This is supported by the lack of a consensus around standard of care treatment for CLL
      patients with bulky fludarabine-refractory disease. The objective of this study is to confirm
      the response rate and disease control in the refractory setting through a controlled trial
      comparing ofatumumab with the physicians' choice of therapy in fludarabine-refractory, bulky
      lymphadenopathy patients. After 24 weeks of treatment with ofatumumab, patients will be
      further randomized to either extended ofatumumab treatment or observation. Patients on the
      physicians' choice arm will have the option of receiving ofatumumab if they experience
      progressive disease.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the randomization date up to 60 months post the randomization date.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is the interval of time between the date of first randomization to the date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any reason, whichever occurred first. The date of PD was defined as the first occurrence of any criteria of progression. PD criteria requires at least one of the following: progression of lymphadenopathy, &gt;=50% increase in liver or spleen size, &gt;=50% increase in number of lymphocytes per microliter, more aggressive histology, occurence of cytopenia after treatment attributable to CLL. Disease progression was determined according to the 2008 International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (IWCLL) update of the National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group CLL Guidelines for Response (NCI-WG). PFS was censored at the time of the last follow up for participants who have neither progressed or died.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Were Positive or Negative for Human Anti-Human Antibodies (HAHA) Post-OFA Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>From the randomization date up to 60 months post the randomization date.</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of HAHA in human serum was determined using a validated electrochemiluminescent assay in a multi-tier assay format. All samples were first assessed in a screening (SCR) assay, and the potential positive (Pos) samples were further tested in the confirmation (CNF) assays. Confirmed positives were reported as HAHA positive and titer was determined for each positive sample. The drug tolerance of the HAHA assay is 200 microgram/milliliter (µg/mL); thus, samples that tested negative in the assay and had ofatumumab concentrations no more than 200 µg/mL were considered as conclusive negative (Neg) results.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 16 Item Module (EORTC QLQ-CLL 16)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the randomization date up to 60 months post the randomization date.</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-CLL16 is comprised of 16 questions that address 5 domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) important in CLL. There are 4 multi-item scales - fatigue (2 items), treatment side effects ([TSE], 4 items), disease symptoms (disease effects scale [DES], 4 items), and infection (4 items) - and single item scales (social activities [Social Problems (SP) Scale] and future health worries[Future Health (FH) Scale].). These are measured on a four point scale where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much. These scores are transformed to give a rating from 0 - 100, where 0 =no symptoms or problems and 100 = a severe symptoms or problems. EORTC QLQ-CLL16 was assessed at Screening; Week (W) 12 (W4 of Cycle[C] 3), W24 (W4C6), W36 (W4C9), W48 (W4C13); during Follow-up which was every month for Months (M) 1-6, every 8 weeks for M7-12 and every 3 months up to M60; and then at PD.</description>

    <description>The HCQ consists of a single question in which the participant is asked if he/she has experienced any change in his/her health overall since beginning the study. For HCQ, values from 1 to 9 were assigned to the 9 responses in the HCQ questionnaire, ranging from 1 for 'my health is a great deal better' to 9 for 'my health is a great deal worse' since the beginning of the study. A score of 3 or less indicates improvement from Baseline. HCQ was assessed at Screening; Week (W) 12 (W4 of Cycle[C] 3), W24 (W4C6), W36 (W4C9), W48 (W4C13); during follow-up which was every month for Months 1-6, every 8 weeks for M7-12 and every 3 months up to M60; and then at PD..</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants(par) were randomized to receive an Open-Label treatment(trt) of ofatumumab(OFA) or a physicians choice(PC) trt for up to 24 weeks. OFA par without progressive disease(PD) underwent a second randomization to receive an additional 24 weeks of OFA or no further trt. PC par who developed PD had the option to receive OFA salvage therapy.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Ofatumumab</title>
          <description>Participants (par.) were randomized to receive ofatumumab (OFA) at Randomization 1. Par. were initially administered OFA 300 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV). Beginning at Week 2, par. were administered OFA 2000 mg once weekly for 7 weeks, followed by 4 infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks for a total of 12 infusions over 24 weeks. Following Randomization 1, par. not demonstrating PD entered Randomization 2 (OFA Extended or OFA Observation); or par. entered Survival Follow-up (SFU) if demonstrating progressive disease (PD). During Randomization 2, par. either received another 24 weeks of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks (OFA Extension) or received no further treatment (trt) (OFA Observation). Par. entered Follow-up until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par only entered SFU if demonstrating PD during the study. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU.</description>

          <description>Par. randomized to receive PC trt during Randomization 1 were administered treatments approved for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) and well-established standards of care as prescribed with standard dose and route. Experimental therapies or any doses beyond the approved/standard of care dose ranges were not allowed. Par. who developed PD during PC trt or Follow-up had the option to receive (single-agent) OFA salvage trt. Par. received an initial IV dose of OFA 300 mg. One week later, par. received OFA 2000 mg followed by 7 weekly infusions of OFA 2000 mg, followed by infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks until Week 48, for the maximum trt duration of 48 weeks. Par. entered Follow-up after the OFA salvage trt until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par. entered SFU if demonstrating PD during OFA salvage trt. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU. Par. who did not receive OFA salvage trt and demonstrated PD, entered SFU.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC)</title>
        <description>PFS is the interval of time between the date of first randomization to the date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any reason, whichever occurred first. The date of PD was defined as the first occurrence of any criteria of progression. PD criteria requires at least one of the following: progression of lymphadenopathy, &gt;=50% increase in liver or spleen size, &gt;=50% increase in number of lymphocytes per microliter, more aggressive histology, occurence of cytopenia after treatment attributable to CLL. Disease progression was determined according to the 2008 International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (IWCLL) update of the National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group CLL Guidelines for Response (NCI-WG). PFS was censored at the time of the last follow up for participants who have neither progressed or died.</description>

            <description>Participants (par.) were randomized to receive ofatumumab (OFA) at Randomization 1. Par. were initially administered OFA 300 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV). Beginning at Week 2, par. were administered OFA 2000 mg once weekly for 7 weeks, followed by 4 infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks for a total of 12 infusions over 24 weeks. Following Randomization 1, par. not demonstrating PD entered Randomization 2 (OFA Extended or OFA Observation); or par. entered Survival Follow-up (SFU) if demonstrating progressive disease (PD). During Randomization 2, par. either received another 24 weeks of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks (OFA Extension) or received no further treatment (trt) (OFA Observation). Par. entered Follow-up until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par only entered SFU if demonstrating PD during the study. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU.</description>

        <title>Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by the IRC</title>
        <description>ORR is defined as the number of participants achieving either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). ORR was measured using the IWCLL updated NCI-WG guidelines 2008. CR requires all of the following criteria: no lymphadenopathy(Ly)/ hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms; neutrophils &gt;1500 per microliter(µL), platelets(PL) &gt;100,000/µL, hemoglobin(Hb) &gt;11 grams/deciliter(g/dL), lymphocytes(LC) &lt;4000/µL, bone marrow(BM) sample must be normocellular for age, &lt;30% LC and no lymphoid nodules. PR requires the following criteria for at least 2 months: &gt;=50% decrease in LC, reduction in Ly (i.e., &gt;=50% decrease in lymph node size or no increase or new lymph nodes), &gt;=50% decrease in the size of liver and spleen and at least one of the following results: PL &gt;100,000/µL or 50% improvement over Baseline(BL), Hb &gt;11 g/dL or 50% improvement over BL, neutrophils&gt;1500/μL. Nodular PR (nPR) indicates persistent nodules in the BM.</description>

        <description>Immunoglobulins or antibodies are large proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign particles such as bacteria and viruses. Their normal blood levels indicate proper immune status. Low levels indicate immuno-suppression. IgA, IgG, and IgM were measured in the blood samples of the participants. Immunoglobulin testing was performed at Screening (SCR), Cycle 3 Week 4 (C3W4), Cycle 7 Week 4 (C3W4) ,Cycle 9 Week 4 (C3W4), 6 Month Follow-up Visit (6M FU), 9 Month Follow-up (9M FU), 12 Month Follow-up (12M FU), 18 Month Follow-up (18M FU), 24 Month Follow-up (24M FU), 30 Month Follow-up (30M FU). A cycle is defined as the time between one round of treatment until the start of the next round.</description>

            <description>Participants (par.) were randomized to receive ofatumumab (OFA) at Randomization 1. Par. were initially administered OFA 300 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV). Beginning at Week 2, par. were administered OFA 2000 mg once weekly for 7 weeks, followed by 4 infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks for a total of 12 infusions over 24 weeks. Following Randomization 1, par. not demonstrating PD entered Randomization 2 (OFA Extended or OFA Observation); or par. entered Survival Follow-up (SFU) if demonstrating progressive disease (PD). During Randomization 2, par. either received another 24 weeks of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks (OFA Extension) or received no further treatment (trt) (OFA Observation). Par. entered Follow-up until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par only entered SFU if demonstrating PD during the study. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU.</description>

Experimental therapies or any doses beyond the approved/standard of care dose ranges were not allowed. Par. who developed PD during PC trt or Follow-up had the option to receive (single-agent) OFA salvage trt. Par. received an initial IV dose of OFA 300 mg. One week later, par. received OFA 2000 mg followed by 7 weekly infusions of OFA 2000 mg, followed by infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks until Week 48, for the maximum trt duration of 48 weeks. Par. entered Follow-up after the OFA salvage trt until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par. entered SFU if demonstrating PD during OFA salvage trt. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU. Par. who did not receive OFA salvage trt and demonstrated PD, entered SFU.</description>

        <description>The presence of HAHA in human serum was determined using a validated electrochemiluminescent assay in a multi-tier assay format. All samples were first assessed in a screening (SCR) assay, and the potential positive (Pos) samples were further tested in the confirmation (CNF) assays. Confirmed positives were reported as HAHA positive and titer was determined for each positive sample. The drug tolerance of the HAHA assay is 200 microgram/milliliter (µg/mL); thus, samples that tested negative in the assay and had ofatumumab concentrations no more than 200 µg/mL were considered as conclusive negative (Neg) results.</description>

            <description>Participants (par.) were randomized to receive ofatumumab (OFA) at Randomization 1. Par. were initially administered OFA 300 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV). Beginning at Week 2, par. were administered OFA 2000 mg once weekly for 7 weeks, followed by 4 infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks for a total of 12 infusions over 24 weeks. Following Randomization 1, par. not demonstrating PD entered Randomization 2 (OFA Extended or OFA Observation); or par. entered Survival Follow-up (SFU) if demonstrating progressive disease (PD). During Randomization 2, par. either received another 24 weeks of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks (OFA Extension) or received no further treatment (trt) (OFA Observation). Par. entered Follow-up until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par only entered SFU if demonstrating PD during the study. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU.</description>

The drug tolerance of the HAHA assay is 200 microgram/milliliter (µg/mL); thus, samples that tested negative in the assay and had ofatumumab concentrations no more than 200 µg/mL were considered as conclusive negative (Neg) results.</description>

        <description>The EORTC QLQ-CLL16 is comprised of 16 questions that address 5 domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) important in CLL. There are 4 multi-item scales – fatigue (2 items), treatment side effects ([TSE], 4 items), disease symptoms (disease effects scale [DES], 4 items), and infection (4 items) – and single item scales (social activities [Social Problems (SP) Scale] and future health worries[Future Health (FH) Scale].). These are measured on a four point scale where 1 = not at all and 4 = very much. These scores are transformed to give a rating from 0 – 100, where 0 =no symptoms or problems and 100 = a severe symptoms or problems. EORTC QLQ-CLL16 was assessed at Screening; Week (W) 12 (W4 of Cycle[C] 3), W24 (W4C6), W36 (W4C9), W48 (W4C13); during Follow-up which was every month for Months (M) 1-6, every 8 weeks for M7-12 and every 3 months up to M60; and then at PD.</description>

Beginning at Week 2, par. were administered OFA 2000 mg once weekly for 7 weeks, followed by 4 infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks for a total of 12 infusions over 24 weeks. Following Randomization 1, par. not demonstrating PD entered Randomization 2 (OFA Extended or OFA Observation); or par. entered Survival Follow-up (SFU) if demonstrating progressive disease (PD). During Randomization 2, par. either received another 24 weeks of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks (OFA Extension) or received no further treatment (trt) (OFA Observation). Par. entered Follow-up until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par only entered SFU if demonstrating PD during the study. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU.</description>

Experimental therapies or any doses beyond the approved/standard of care dose ranges were not allowed. Par. who developed PD during PC trt or Follow-up had the option to receive (single-agent) OFA salvage trt. Par. received an initial IV dose of OFA 300 mg. One week later, par. received OFA 2000 mg followed by 7 weekly infusions of OFA 2000 mg, followed by infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks until Week 48, for the maximum trt duration of 48 weeks. Par. entered Follow-up after the OFA salvage trt until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par. entered SFU if demonstrating PD during OFA salvage trt. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU. Par. who did not receive OFA salvage trt and demonstrated PD, entered SFU.</description>

        <title>Mean Health Change Questionnaire (HCQ) Score</title>
        <description>The HCQ consists of a single question in which the participant is asked if he/she has experienced any change in his/her health overall since beginning the study. For HCQ, values from 1 to 9 were assigned to the 9 responses in the HCQ questionnaire, ranging from 1 for ‘my health is a great deal better’ to 9 for ‘my health is a great deal worse’ since the beginning of the study. A score of 3 or less indicates improvement from Baseline. HCQ was assessed at Screening; Week (W) 12 (W4 of Cycle[C] 3), W24 (W4C6), W36 (W4C9), W48 (W4C13); during follow-up which was every month for Months 1-6, every 8 weeks for M7-12 and every 3 months up to M60; and then at PD..</description>

            <description>Participants (par.) were randomized to receive ofatumumab (OFA) at Randomization 1. Par. were initially administered OFA 300 milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV). Beginning at Week 2, par. were administered OFA 2000 mg once weekly for 7 weeks, followed by 4 infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks for a total of 12 infusions over 24 weeks. Following Randomization 1, par. not demonstrating PD entered Randomization 2 (OFA Extended or OFA Observation); or par. entered Survival Follow-up (SFU) if demonstrating progressive disease (PD). During Randomization 2, par. either received another 24 weeks of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks (OFA Extension) or received no further treatment (trt) (OFA Observation). Par. entered Follow-up until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par only entered SFU if demonstrating PD during the study. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU.</description>

Experimental therapies or any doses beyond the approved/standard of care dose ranges were not allowed. Par. who developed PD during PC trt or Follow-up had the option to receive (single-agent) OFA salvage trt. Par. received an initial IV dose of OFA 300 mg. One week later, par. received OFA 2000 mg followed by 7 weekly infusions of OFA 2000 mg, followed by infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks until Week 48, for the maximum trt duration of 48 weeks. Par. entered Follow-up after the OFA salvage trt until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par. entered SFU if demonstrating PD during OFA salvage trt. Only the survival status and anti-cancer therapy information was collected in the SFU. Par. who did not receive OFA salvage trt and demonstrated PD, entered SFU.</description>

Beginning at Week 2, par. were administered OFA 2000 mg once weekly for 7 weeks, followed by 4 infusions of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks for a total of 12 infusions over 24 weeks. Following Randomization 1, par. not demonstrating PD entered Randomization 2 (OFA Extended or OFA Observation); or par. entered Survival Follow-up (SFU) if demonstrating progressive disease (PD). During Randomization 2, par. either received another 24 weeks of OFA 2000 mg every 4 weeks (OFA Extension) or received no further treatment (trt) (OFA Observation). Par. entered Follow-up until withdrawal or the end of study (60 months). Par only entered SFU if demonstrating PD during the study.
