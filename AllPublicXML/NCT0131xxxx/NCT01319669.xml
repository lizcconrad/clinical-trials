  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and safety of administration of rhTPO at different time in the
      treatment of thrombocytopenia caused by first-line GC/GP regimen for non small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC)

      This is a randomized, controlled, open-labeled, multicenter clinical trial. The subjects are
      patients with NSCLC who are going to receive GC/GP regimen chemotherapy.

      Vadhan-Raj et al conducted a study in which they administered rhTPO in various ways to
      patients with sarcoma receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy. The results demonstrated
      that timing of administration of rhTPO can be adjusted according to the occurrence time of
      nadir platelet values induced by chemotherapy. The timing of administration of rhTPO in this
      study was determined based on the above proofs.
