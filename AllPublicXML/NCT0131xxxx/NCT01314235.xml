  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clonidin works as a presynaptic agonist of alpha-sympathomimetic receptors of the brain but
      also in many other tissues. It is part of balanced anesthesia in general anesthesiology as
      well as a sedastive agent in intensive care units, but also serves as a third-line agent in
      many psychiatric diseases including ADHD, schizophrenia and PTSD.

      The investigators want to show whether clonidin has an procoagulatoric effect on thrombozytes
      of patients under double anticoagulaotirc treatment with ASS and clopidogrel. The
      investigators will use a flowcytometric assay to determine activation of thrombozytes when
      they come into contact with clonidine in vitro as well as Multiplate analyses to determine
      activation of thrombozytes, either thrombin.induced aggregation, ADP-induced aggregation or
      arachidonic acid-induced aggregation of thrombozytes.
