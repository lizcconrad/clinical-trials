  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastro esophageal reflux disease and ulcer related or non-ulcer dyspepsia, attacks 20% of the
      Western population. These millions of patients are treated continuously with PPI for
      different periods, many for many years. Recently, rebound acid hypersecretion was recognized
      as a major clinical event after cessation of PPI therapy. Sustained hypergastrinemia due to
      daily PPI therapy causes increased acid-secretory capacity that appears when the drug is
      stopped. The transient increase in blood and urinary pH following gastric secretion has been
      termed the alkaline tide phenomenon. Carbonic acid, formed in the presence of the enzyme
      carbonic anhydrase, neutralizes intracellular hydroxyl ions produced as a result of luminal
      acid secretion. The bicarbonate generated is removed from the cell via the baso-lateral
      chloride bicarbonate exchanger. The investigators have shown in several studies that this
      phenomenon parallels acid secretion. Thus, stimulation of acid secretion with test meal
      increased base excess maximally after 45 minutes and these changes parallel peak acid output
      measured in gastric aspirate. The investigators hypothesize that gradual step down cessation
      of PPI will prevent this clinical relevant event. By measuring alkaline tide after PPI
      cessation the investigators may prove this hypothesis.
