    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of strength training with elastic
      bands on hip strength in soccer players, the effect measured with hand-held dynamometry. The
      primary outcomes are isometric and eccentric hip adduction strength. The hypothesis is that
      strength training with elastic bands will result in a clinical relevant increase in hip
      adduction strength.
