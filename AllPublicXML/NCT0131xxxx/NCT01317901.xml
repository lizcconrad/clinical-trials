  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1 multicenter study of bendamustine, rituximab and TRU-016 (BRT) in subjects
      with relapsed indolent B-cell lymphoma. This was a multiple-dose escalation study to
      determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of TRU-016 given in combination with rituximab and
      bendamustine and to determine a safe dosing regimen for the combination in up to 12 subjects
      with relapsed indolent lymphoma.

      The originally planned Phase 2 portion, an open-label, randomized study to evaluate the
      efficacy of BRT compared with BR, was not conducted.

      This study was planned to be conducted in 2 parts: a Phase 1b component designed to determine
      a safe dosing regimen, and a Phase 2 component designed to evaluate the efficacy of BRT
      compared to BR in subjects with relapsed indolent lymphoma. The Phase 2 component was not
      conducted.

      This was an open-label, non randomized, multiple-dose escalation study to determine the MTD
      of BRT and to determine a safe dosing regimen for the combination in subjects with relapsed
      indolent lymphoma.

      The study consisted of a screening period lasting up to 21 days, a treatment period lasting
      up to 6 cycles (28 days each), and a 60-day follow-up period. Up to 12 subjects (2 cohorts of
      6 subjects each) were planned for enrollment. Two dose levels (10 and 20 mg/kg) of TRU-016
      combined with rituximab 375 mg/m2 and bendamustine 90 mg/m2 were evaluated during up to 6
      cycles (28 days each). TRU-016 was administered by intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 15
      of each cycle. Rituximab was administered by IV infusion on Day 2 of each cycle. Bendamustine
      was administered by IV infusion on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Subjects received study
      treatment for up to 6 cycles.

    <description>Response was assessed by the investigator on the basis of clinical, radiological, and pathological (i.e., bone marrow) criteria, using the IWG criteria (Cheson et al 2007). A CR is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A PR is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed.</description>

        <title>Response</title>
        <description>Response was assessed by the investigator on the basis of clinical, radiological, and pathological (i.e., bone marrow) criteria, using the IWG criteria (Cheson et al 2007). A CR is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A PR is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed.</description>
