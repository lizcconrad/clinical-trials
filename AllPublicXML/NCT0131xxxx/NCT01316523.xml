  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lenalidomide has been shown to have single agent activity in indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
      It is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome.

      Rituximab is effective as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy for indolent
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

      The purpose of this study is to see how well giving lenalidomide together with rituximab
      works in treating patients with previously untreated indolent Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

      Lenalidomide will taken at 20 mg daily, days 1-21 of a 28 day cycle, to be continued until
      the disease progresses, unacceptable side effects or after twelve cycles if the patient is
      responding well.

      Rituximab 375 mg/m2/wk x 4 weeks will begin on Day 15 of cycle 1. After 4 cycles of therapy,
      if patients respond well to treatment, patients will receive a second course of Rituximab.

      Blood samples will be collected to assess how the immune system is functioning.

    <description>Responses will be assessed by the Revised Working Group Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. A complete response is the complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is regression of measurable disease and no new sites of disease. Stable disease is failure to attain a complete response/partial response or progressive disease.</description>
