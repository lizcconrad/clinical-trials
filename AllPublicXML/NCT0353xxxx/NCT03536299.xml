  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of a performance measure for the
      dual-task of gait and considering people with multiple sclerosis have both cognitive and
      motor problems, the secondary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a
      gait-specific dual-tasking intervention for ambulatory individuals with multiple sclerosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total target sample size of 40 adults with MS and 40 adults without MS will be recruited.
      The 40 adults without MS will undergo the two baseline testing sessions only for the first
      phase of the study. 20 of those individuals with MS will be randomly selected to undergo the
      intervention phase of the study.

      The research design will include two groups, the intervention and control group. Both groups
      will undergo a screening process, two baseline testing sessions, and be randomly assigned to
      one of the two groups. The duration of the study is 6 weeks in length for a total of 18
      training sessions. The intervention group participants will undergo gait training with a
      specific concomitant cognitive task (dual-task) for a total walking time of 20 minutes and
      with rest breaks the total session time is ~60 minutes with a physical therapist. The control
      group will undergo gait training, but without the cognitive task. Feedback from the therapist
      will be provided to each participant concerning gait mechanics and ways to improve gait
      regardless of group membership.

      Outcome measures data will be collected twice at baseline, once at mid-intervention, once at
      post-intervention, and once at one-month follow-up.

    <measure>Change in Walking and Remembering Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measures dual-task cost of gait and a titrated forward digit span cognitive task, measured as a percentage.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 2-Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measures total distance walked by an individual within a 2-minute time period. Measures distance in feet and meters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measures self-reported and self-perceived walking disability due to MS in the past 2 weeks. The 12-Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale consists of 12 questions. Each question is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The items are scored for a minimum score possible of 12 or a maximal score of 60. This summed score is then divided by 60 and the resulting percentage is interpreted. The scale's final percentage score can range from a minimum of 20% (minimal impact of MS on walking, good outcome) to a maximum of 100% (significant impact of MS on walking, poor outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measures self-reported physical and mental fatigue levels by the patient with MS. The Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions measures both the motor and cognitive domains of fatigue. The scale consists of 20 total items: 10 items related to motor fatigue and 10 items related to cognitive fatigue. Each item is rated on a Likert scale from 1 (does not apply at all) to 5 (applies completely). The scale items can be summed for a total score (ranging from 20 to 100) or subscales can be summed and interpreted with each subscale ranging from a minimum of 10 points to a maximal 50 points. Higher values in the total score or in the subscale scores indicate worse fatigue and poorer quality of life due to fatigue.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in gait speed (m/s) will be measured for a 10-meter distance. This will be measured by the Protokinetics ZenoWalkway.</description>

    <measure>Change in Gait Cadence</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>

    <measure>Changes in Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale for fatigue measures immediate self-reported fatigue. This scale is commonly used to monitor and individual's fatigue level to ensure his or her safety during an activity. The individual marks his or her fatigue level on a 10-cm line with one end denoting &quot;no fatigue&quot; and the opposite end denoting &quot;very severe fatigue&quot;. The individual's fatigue level is them measured in cm.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion is a self-reported scale that measures how much exertion an individual is putting forth during a physical activity. It ranges from 6 (no exertion) to 20 (maximal exertion). The individual chooses a number between 6 and 20 to represent his or her level of exertion. This is commonly used to monitor an individual to ensure that he or she is exercising or performing within a safe level.</description>

    <description>During the training sessions, you will participate in gait training with a physical therapist (PT). You will be asked to walk in 2-minute bouts and you will be provided with adequate rest breaks to help manage your fatigue levels. In addition to performing the gait training activities, you will be asked to perform thinking tasks at the same time. These pre-recorded questions or prompts will be provided to you through headphones and a portable music player. This is to help ensure that the PT is able to focus on giving you feedback about your walking ability and answers to the thinking tasks, and on your safety. At the end of each session, you will have walked for a total walking time of 20 minutes.</description>
