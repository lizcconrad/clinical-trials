  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label expanded access protocol for the treatment of up to approximately 250
      adult patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who have difficulty swallowing oral
      riluzole tablets and may be able to derive benefit from treatment with an alternative oral
      formulation of riluzole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Riluzole is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS). The commercially available dosage form is a 50mg oral tablet. This expanded
      access protocol (EAP) is designed to provide access to a dissolving tablet formulation of
      riluzole designed for sublingual (SL) administration, in patients with ALS who, in the
      opinion and clinical judgement of the treating physician, would benefit from treatment with
      BHV-0223.
