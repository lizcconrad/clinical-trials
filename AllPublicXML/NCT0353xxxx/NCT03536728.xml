  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 study will be conducted to establish safety and dose level of AMXT 1501 dicaprate
      alone, and in combination with DFMO, in cancer patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of oral AMXT 1501
      dicaprate (AMXT1501) in combination with DFMO in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      Secondary objectives include characterization of plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMXT 1501 as
      well as pharmacodynamic (PD) assessment of the impact of AMXT 1501 in combination with DFMO
      on polyamine uptake by circulating lymphocytes (blood cells).

      To these aims, the study will evaluate the safety, PK and PD profiles of orally-administered
      AMXT 1501 and DFMO. Approximately, 52 patients will be enrolled to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AMXT 1501 and DFMO in
      combination. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level below at which dose escalation is
      stopped.

    <description>Dose escalation of AMXT1501 with a fixed low dose of DFMO will follow a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. The AMXT 1501 starting dose administered in the first cohort will be 80 mg (2 capsules); each capsule contains 40 mg of active drug. The dose will be given orally, once daily, fasted state alone for 14 days, and starting on Day 15 AMXT 1501 80 mg given in combination with fixed low-dose oral DFMO at 250mg 2x per day (BID), for an additional 14 days; for a total 28 days of treatment per cycle. Cycle 2 includes AMXT1501 + DFMO that will be administered for 28 days. The patient can be treated for additional 28 day treatment cycles as deemed appropriate by their study investigator. Dose escalation of AMXT1501 alone will increase per Part 1 cohort.</description>

The AMXT 1501 starting dose administered in the first cohort will be one level below the AMXT 1501 Part 1 RP2D with 500 mg DFMO BID. The morning dose will be given orally of both AMXT1501 and DFMO, in a fasted state. The evening dose of DFMO alone will be given prior to bed-time for 28 days per cycle. The patient can be treated for additional 28 day treatment cycles as deemed appropriate by their study investigator. Dose escalation of DFMO alone will increase per Part 2 cohort.</description>
