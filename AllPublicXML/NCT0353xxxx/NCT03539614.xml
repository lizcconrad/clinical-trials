  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects many individuals who experience a traumatic
      event. There are a variety of treatment options for PTSD, including psychotherapy (talk
      therapy) options, as well as medications, such as the drug prazosin. Each of the treatment
      options available is effective at significantly reducing the symptoms of PTSD in some, but
      not all, individuals with PTSD. However, investigators are not yet able to predict in advance
      who is likely to respond to which of the available treatments. Neither are the investigators
      able to explain what changes in the brain after exposure to a traumatic stressors, and why it
      results in persistent symptoms of PTSD for some people, but not for others.

      In this study, the investigators are testing two things: First, is testing whether two
      simple, easy tests of how an individual's blood pressure changes with standing and how an
      individual's eye reacts to a pulse of light may be able to predict whether that person is
      likely respond to the medication prazosin for PTSD. Second, is testing whether those who have
      been exposed to a traumatic stress show differences in how their body regulates the response
      to the stress-signal noradrenaline.

      In this study, individuals will undergo an assessment that includes taking a history of their
      previous exposure to traumatic events, an assessment of current mental health symptoms
      including those associated with PTSD, and an assessment of physiologic measures, such as
      blood pressure and pupillary responses to light. For individuals who have current symptoms of
      PTSD and for whom use of the medication prazosin is a reasonable and safe option, a second
      phase of the study will be offered. In this second phase, how the individual's PTSD symptoms
      change when taking prazosin will be assessed. In addition, to test whether any changes are
      related to the prazosin itself or are part of a placebo effect, the individual will be
      randomly assigned to periods where he or she is taking a pill that looks like prazosin but is
      actual placebo (a pill with no active ingredient), and periods where he or she is taking a
      pill that looks the same but this time is actual prazosin.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a modified cross-over study, also called an aggregated N-of-1 study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total PTSD Checklist for DSM 5 (PCL5) score</measure>
    <time_frame>The PCL5 total score is assessed at baseline, during each stage of the study, and at the endpoint of the study. Thus, measurements will be scheduled to occur at the following time points, relative to the baseline visit: 0, 4, 8, 9-12, 16, and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PTSD Checklist for DSM 5 is a self-reported rating scale where an individual rates the severity of each symptom of PTSD on a likert scale. The ratings on individual items are summed to create a total score, which ranges from 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating more symptoms. The relationship between changes in participants' total PCL scores at different time points and prazosin exposure - and whether this relationship is moderated by baseline biomarker values - will be analyzed using a linear mixed effects model.</description>

    <description>All participants in this study will begin with 8 weeks of active treatment (prazosin), followed by a 4 week &quot;blinded discontinuation&quot; block where they will take a capsule that will start out as active treatment (prazosin), but will at some point change to placebo. Following these phases of the study, participants will be randomized to two arms. In this first arm, participants will spend 4 weeks on active treatment (prazosin), followed by 4 weeks on placebo.</description>
