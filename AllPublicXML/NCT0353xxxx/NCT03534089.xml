  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center,randomized,double-blind,controlled clinical trial was used to investigate the
      effectiveness of the treatment of infant iron deficiency anemia by taking ferralia and
      different contents lactoferrin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      5-9 months old infants with iron deficiency anemia were randomly divided into three groups.
      On the basis of giving the same dose of ferralia,three different levels lactoferrin infant
      formula were intervened 3 months respectively,and evaluate the clinical effect.
