  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals represents an ambitious strategy to end the acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic by 2020 [UNAIDS, 2015]. While viral load (VL)
      quantification is the gold standard of HIV treatment monitoring, it is only routinely
      available and employed in resource-rich countries. The use of an affordable, reliable,
      point-of-care (POC) VL assay has been considered a &quot;game-changer&quot;, where increased access,
      minimal lab worker training, and same day results could be addressed in a single solution. To
      date, POC VL assays have been evaluated by their manufacturers with reference panels of
      samples with some in-country laboratory evaluations. While these are appropriate and critical
      first steps, it is also important to evaluate the impact of this new technology against the
      standard of care (SOC) method of VL monitoring in an actual resource-limited setting.

      Nigeria has the second highest burden of HIV in the world, with an estimated 3.2 million
      infected and serves as a relevant setting for testing feasibility and efficacy of POC VL
      monitoring [UNAIDS, 2016]. In order to present the case for implementing the use of POC VL
      testing across Nigeria, data on the acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of using POC
      testing for VL monitoring are needed. To address this need, we have designed a randomized
      controlled trial comparing POC VL to monitoring to the SOC, which follows the Nigerian
      National Guidelines, to provide operational evidence for implementation of POC VL testing in
      Nigeria. This trial is aimed at testing the hypothesis that using POC versus SOC VL
      monitoring in HIV-infected patients newly initiating ART will improve overall ART outcomes,
      increase ART adherence and program retention rates, and result in faster switches to
      second-line treatment of patients failing first-line ART.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct an un-blinded randomized implementation trial comparing POC VL monitoring,
      using the Cepheid Xpert HIV-1 VL, to SOC VL monitoring, using the Roche AmpliPrep/COBAS
      Taqman system. The trial will be conducted at two sites in Plateau State, Nigeria.

      ART-na√Øve patients initiating ART will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to the SOC VL monitoring
      control arm or the POC VL monitoring arm. VL monitoring will occur according to the current
      Nigerian ART guidelines-recommended algorithm, with the addition of a baseline VL test. For
      the month 6 and 12 visits, patients that are enrolled in the POC VL monitoring arm will be
      provided their VL results. Participants in the SOC arm will receive their Roche VL test
      results after the results become available per SOC protocol. All other aspects of their HIV
      care and treatment will be identical to services that they would normally receive at these
      treatment centers.

      We will follow all patients up through their Month 12 follow-up visit. At trial exit, we will
      ask patients, caregivers of patients under the age of 18 years, and providers for their
      participation in surveys on the operational performance and acceptability of the POC versus
      SOC VL monitoring. Following that time point, the patients will continue receiving HIV care
      and treatment utilizing the SOC procedures for the clinic.

    <description>For enumerating viral load for patients in the POC arm, we will use the Cepheid Xpert¬Æ HIV-1 Viral Load test, a quantitative assay with a quantification range of 40 to 10,000,000 copies/mL. Based on the GeneXpert¬Æ technology, Xpert HIV-1 VL automates the test process, including RNA extraction, purification, reverse transcription and cDNA real-time quantitation in one fully integrated cartridge. The pre-loaded disposable single-use cartridges provide a visual read-out within 90 minutes. The assay requires 1 mL of plasma using a precision pipette (1.2 mL using a transfer pipette).</description>
