      Using this convergence approach from a limited group of subjects with non-diseased controls,
      patients with Parkinson's disease or related diseases, we will be able to limit the number of
      potential genes of specific susceptibility to Parkinson disease. These genes will then be
      studied using a case-control genetic epidemiology approach. The risk of developing the
      disease will then be evaluated according to clinical, biological and environmental variables
      collected in Parkinson's subjects and healthy controls in the second group of subjects. The
      specificity of the genetic associations found will be evaluated in subjects with Parkinson's
      disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria for Parkinson's patients and &quot;related diseases&quot; controls:

          -  Parkinsonian patients meeting the Gelb criteria

          -  Patients with other neurodegenerative disease (such as other Parkinson syndrome or
             synucleopathies) meeting the criteria set out in Appendix 2 (Lewy Bodies dementia,
             Parkinson's disease with dementia, MultiSystem atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear
             Paralysis) , Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Restless Legs Syndrome, Alzheimer's
             Disease).

          -  Woman of childbearing age having an effective means of contraception.

          -  Informed consent signed by the subject or his legal representative.

          -  For demented subjects coming for consultation or day hospitalization with an
             accompanying person, signature of the legal representative.

        Criteria for inclusion of non-ill controls:

          -  Absence of rest trembling, bradykinesia and stiffness

          -  MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) greater than 25

          -  Woman of childbearing age having an effective means of contraception.

          -  subject having signed the informed consent.

          -  No family history of neurodegenerative disease that started before age 70. These
             controls will not present any Parkinsonian signs during the clinical evaluation. They
             may have functional disabilities whose cause is known and unrelated to a
             neurodegenerative disease with a cognitive function measurement greater than 25 in the
             MMSE test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Criteria for non-inclusion of patients:

          -  Clinical criteria for exclusion of the diseases described

          -  Participation in another therapeutic trial or in the exclusion period of a previous
             clinical trial.

        Criteria for non-inclusion of non-ill controls:

          -  Functional discomfort in daily life of unknown cause

          -  MMSE less than 25

          -  Participation in another therapeutic trial or in the exclusion period of a previous
             clinical trial.
