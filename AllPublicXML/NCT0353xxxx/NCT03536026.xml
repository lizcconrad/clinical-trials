  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite technological advancements directed towards the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary
      lesions, an optimal approach has yet to be designed. One significant barrier for the
      bronchoscopic biopsy of peripheral lesions is the ability to reliably locate peripheral
      lesions in an efficient manner. The majority of the published literature regarding peripheral
      lesion biopsy has used diagnostic yield as the primary endpoint. Based on this data, it is
      unclear if non-diagnostic procedures are due to the inability to locate peripheral lesions,
      or due to the inability to successfully biopsy lesions once located using currently available
      instruments. This study will evaluate the bronchoscopists' ability to locate peripheral
      pulmonary lesions by using a conventional chest computed tomography (CT) scan as a reference
      and a virtual bronchoscopic navigational system, if needed, for the localization of
      peripheral pulmonary lesions.

    <description>-Diagnostic yield based on final cytology and/or histopathology will be determined from the results of the bronchoscopy. A biopsy that results in a specific diagnosis, either malignant or benign, that adequately explains the clinical scenario as determined by the treating physician, will be considered truly positive.</description>

    <description>-Bronchoscopy will be performed by pulmonary and/or critical care fellows who have performed fewer than 10 bronchoscopies (inexperienced bronchoscopists) under direct supervision by an attending Interventional Pulmonologist. The inexperienced bronchoscopist will attempt to navigate to the targeted peripheral pulmonary lesion without virtual bronchoscopic navigation, using only standard axial CT images as a reference. The attending physician will directly observe, but will provide no guidance during this period, which will last no longer than 10 minutes. If the lesion is located and confirmed with radial probe endobronchial ultrasound prior to 10 minutes, biopsies will be performed as per routine clinical practice. If the 10 minute time period elapses prior to localization of the peripheral pulmonary lesion, virtual bronchoscopic navigation will be used.</description>
