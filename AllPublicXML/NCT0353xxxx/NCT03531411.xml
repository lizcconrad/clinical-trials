  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Richmond Health and Wellness Program (RHWP) is an innovative and emerging nurse-led
      inter-professional wellness and care coordination model that represents a holistic and
      integrated approach to community based care. The model addresses unmet health care needs of
      vulnerable adults residing in low-income housing designated for older adults with a goal of
      helping them to &quot;age in place&quot; while improving quality of life through health equity. Through
      the promotion of wellness and care coordination among vulnerable older adults, RWHP will
      connect participants to resources that meet their health, nutritional, and safety needs and
      provide a meal to address nutritional needs and food insecurity.
