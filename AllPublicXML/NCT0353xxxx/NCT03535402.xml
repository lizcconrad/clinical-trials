    <textblock>
      This is a single site Phase III 48-week open-label study to evaluate the structural response
      of sarilumab 200 mg SC injection administered to active RA patients. Active RA is defined as
      having a Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) &gt;10.0. All patients will have had an
      inadequate response to MTX (treated with 12.5-20 mg/wk. for at least 3 months) and have had
      no prior exposure to biologic medications for RA. The MTX will be continued throughout the
      trial allowing for dose reduction at the Primary Investigator's discretion due to safety.
      There will be a total of twenty (20) patients enrolled into the trial.

    <description>To explore the structural efficacy of sarilumab on synovitis, osteitis, and joint erosions as measured by MRI in active RA patients who had an inadequate response to MTX using the change in the OMERACT RAMRIS score from Baseline to Week 48. Synovitis is graded 0-3 (normal, mild, moderate and severe) as estimated by thirds of the presumed maximum volume of enhancing tissue. Bone edema is graded by percentage volume (0-3),byt 33% volume increments) of the assessed bone. Bone erosion is graded by assessing percentage volume (1-10,by 10 % volume increments) of the assessed bone volume. There are multiple parameters for these measurements and the OMERACTguide has to be used to perform this analysis.</description>
