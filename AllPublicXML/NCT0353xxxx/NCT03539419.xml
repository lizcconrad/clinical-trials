  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational, prospective and multicenter study in approximately 30 sites nationwide. The
      investigators participating in this study will be dermatologists specializing in this
      pathology.

      The present study will include adult patients with moderate to severe plaque who have started
      apremilast treatment for first time 3 months (+/- 4 weeks) before their inclusion in the
      study, according to the specifications of the drug's prescribing information and under usual
      clinical practice. Recruitment will be consecutive and the reason for not including a
      potential candidate patient will be registered. The decision to prescribe apremilast
      treatment should be clearly dissociated from the inclusion of the patient in the study.
      Therefore, the choice of the therapeutic strategy will be made independently by the
      physician.

Horizontal line of 100 mm, with descriptive signs at the ends indicating &quot;no itching&quot; and &quot;the worst imaginable itch&quot;.

    <description>A patient with moderate-intensity psoriasis will be considered if he/she has PASI 7-15 and DLQI scores ≤ 15, or PASI scores &lt;7 and DLQI ≥ 5 at the time of starting apremilast treatment. (Patients with PASI 7-15 and DLQI&gt; 15 scores and presenting cutaneous lesions in locations that are difficult to access for treatment or that have a significant psychosocial impact may be classified as moderate or severe psoriasis cases according to the investigators' criteria.) In this subgroup of patients will estimate the proportion of patients with moderate-intensity psoriasis who change to mild intensity.</description>

    <description>Commonly used instruments for measuring psoriasis, such as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), have limitations, including high complexity.
