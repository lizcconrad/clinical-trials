  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine genome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with physical
      activity and exercise capacity from peripheral blood collected from patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) before and after participation in a structured 9-week
      outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program.

    <textblock>
      Subjects who are referred to pulmonary rehabilitation IN THE COURSE OF THEIR USUAL CLINICAL
      CARE will be invited to participate in our observational study. Subjects who enroll in our
      study will undergo two in-person visits, once before initiating pulmonary rehabilitation
      classes and once at the conclusion of pulmonary rehabilitation classes. Participation in this
      study will not alter the course of their usual clinical care.

      Peripheral blood and urine will be collected at 2 time points via venipuncture. Plasma and
      buffy coat will be extracted and stored for analysis at the conclusion of enrollment.

      Participation in this study will not impact the course of usual clinical care and is thus
      meets the definition of an observational study.
