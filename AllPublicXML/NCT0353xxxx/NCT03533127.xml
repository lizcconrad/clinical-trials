    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized, Double-blind, Multicenter Phase III Study Comparing Efficacy and Safety
      of LY01008 (Recombinant Humanized Anti-Human Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Monoclonal
      Antibody Injection) and Bevacizumab Combined with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for Treatment of
      Naïve Subjects with Metastatic or Recurrent Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of LY01008 and
      bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin for treatment of subjects with
      metastatic or recurrent nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.

      The subjects will receive the treatment with LY01008 or bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel
      and carboplatin for 4-6 cycles, and then both groups of subjects will receive the maintenance
      monotherapy with LY01008 until occurrence of progressive disease (PD), intolerable toxicity
      reaction, withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up, death, conduct of other
      antineoplastic therapy or completion of the whole study. The doses of LY01008 and bevacizumab
      are 15 mg/kg in combination therapy. The dose of LY01008 in maintenance monotherapy is 15
      mg/kg.
