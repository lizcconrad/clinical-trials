  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double-blind/placebo study evaluate the efficacy of ASN002 in subjects
      with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is study is a placebo controlled study where subjects with moderate to severe atopic
      dermatitis will be randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive ASN002 at 40 mg, 60 mg, or 80 mg, or
      placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Eligible subjects will get the opportunity to enroll in the
      24 month open-label extension study (OLE). There will be a 4-week follow up period for
      subjects not participating in the OLE study. This study will also characterize the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASN002 through blood sampling and three or four
      biopsies from subjects who consent.
