  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to examine the usability and efficacy, for diverse older
      adults, of a new tablet-based dynamic system: the Fittle Senior System (FSS) that will
      provide: (1) personalized behavior-change programs for improved diet and increased physical
      activity and (2) online social interaction and support from small teams pursuing similar
      goals.

      The proposed study involves a two group randomized trial where participants will be
      randomized to the Fittle Senior System or to a paper-based psycho-educational control
      condition following a baseline assessment. The duration of the intervention phase will
      involve an active 12-week intervention phase followed by a 12-week maintenance phase. We will
      recruit and randomize 180 community dwelling adults aged 65+ years, who live alone and are at
      risk for social isolation. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3mths post active
      intervention and 3mths post maintenance (6mths following active intervention) on measures of
      health and health behaviors, and indices of social support.
