  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled open-label trial. During the study, adolescents scheduled to
      receive at least one IM vaccine will receive either Buzzy®, Music, or Buzzy® and Music
      intervention(s) in addition to standard care to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of
      these interventions prior to being used in a larger study to assess the effectiveness of the
      interventions in preventing post-vaccination presyncope and syncope. Feasibility will be
      assessed according to study staff ability to successfully administer the protocol specified
      clinic-based interventions and per both study staff and healthcare provider responses to
      written feasibility assessments. Acceptability will be assessed according to the
      participant's self-report. In addition, baseline needle phobia and anxiety, post-vaccination
      pain and presyncope symptoms, and pre- and post- vaccination state anxiety will be assessed
      per participant written self-report to standardized survey questions.
