  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this RCT is to compare the postoperative outcome of transanal versus
      transabdominal minimally invasive proctectomy with ileal pouch-annal anastomosis in patients
      with ulcerative colitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Theoritically, the advantge of TAMIS surgery over traditional trans-abdominal IPAA surgery
      incudes shorter operation time due to simulatous surgery transanlly and transabdominally,
      reduced operative difficulty in narrow male pelvis, less retained rectal cuff and less
      &quot;dog-ear&quot; formation. However, its adgange has not been proven in prospecitve randomized
      trials. The aim of current study is to compare the short and long-term postoperative outcome
      of transanal versus transabdominal minimally invasive proctectomy with ileal pouch-annal
      anastomosis in patients with ulcerative colitis.

    <description>Anastomotic leakage was defined as any defect at the anastomotic site confirmed by imaging or during surgical re-intervention, and was categorised according to the impact on clinical management [A, B, C]. Grade A leaks had minimal to no clinical impact on the patient's postoperative course, requiring antibiotics at the most. Grade B leaks required active intervention such as radiological placement of a pelvic drain or transanal lavage. Grade C leaks required re-operation, mostly because the patient was not defunctioned.</description>
