  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study assess the effect of the VR technology (Pure Purr technology) on the recovery of
      the autonomic nervous system in healthy volunteers affected by moderate stress. Study subject
      randomized into two groups: in Group 1 volunteers first be tested with the VR headset A, and
      during the next visit- headset B. Group 2 volunteers first be tested with the VR headset B,
      and during the next visit- headset A. Before, after and during VR session was conducted
      stress modulation and ECG recording.

      The Pure Purr technology combines several audio and visual stimuli aimed at activation of the
      parasympathetic nervous system. Therefore, this study will investigate the effect of this
      technology on the recovery of autonomic nervous system performance after moderate stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pure Purr technology is based on discoveries in neurophysiology, medicine, acoustics, and
      computer engineering, which are used to initiate the physiological process of recreation,
      i.e. allostasis. Literally this term means &quot;achieving stability through change&quot;. This is an
      active mechanism playing a part in normalization of the tone of the autonomic nervous system
      and maintaining stability of the body internal environment. The condition in which all the
      investigator's functions are implemented fully and sparingly in response to the load, and the
      level of adaptation remains high for a long time. Pure Purr is a software and hardware
      complex for relaxation and recreation based on a virtual reality headset with a display with
      sufficient resolution, built-in processor, memory, and extended-range stereo speakers.
      Positive effect on the cognitive function of the brain and the system of neurohumoral
      regulation is achieved due to the synchronous actuation of a number of stimuli, such as:
      visual sequence enhanced by the effect of virtual reality, harmonious music with the binaural
      rhythm technology, and modified cat purrs. Currently, the use of each technology is a
      scientifically proven trigger for the activation of individual parts of the human nervous
      system. And combining them in one software complex enhances the overall effect.
