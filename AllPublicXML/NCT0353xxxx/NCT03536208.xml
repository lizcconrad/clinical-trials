    <textblock>
      This study aims to asses the effect of warfarin on markers of AXL pathway in patients with
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is emerging evidence from pre-clinical models that Axl activation is critical for the
      tumorigenesis and metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Warfarin is a readily available drug in
      the clinical setting and could be easily, safely, and quickly used in patients in combination
      with known cytotoxic chemotherapies to improve overall survival.

      Oral warfarin has been well tolerated in both prophylaxis for catheter-associated thrombosis
      and in advanced pancreatic cancer patients.

      The aim of this trial is to confirm the preclinical evidence that warfarin affects AXL
      pathway in patients with pancreatic cancer. This will validate the effect of escalating doses
      of warfarin on circulating biomarkers of AXL.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically-confirmed, localized or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
             Diagnostic biopsy must be obtained at the study institution prior to enrollment.
             Pathology material must be available for review.

          -  Patient must have measurable disease per RECIST criteria

          -  Started most recent systemic therapy regimen within 15 days of enrollment (any line of
             therapy is allowed).

          -  Ability to tolerate, swallow and absorb oral medications.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,
             having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the
             following criteria:

               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active radiation therapy, or planned radiation therapy during study period

             therapy. These can include:

        Known major bleeding diathesis:

          -  Active peptic ulcer disease with bleeding. - Significant infection or other coexistent
             medical condition that would preclude protocol therapy including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements
