  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study will be to determine if the dural puncture epidural (DPE)
      provides superior analgesia and better patient satisfaction when compared to traditional
      epidurals for cesarean sections, and to also determine if patient satisfaction in the DPE
      group is comparable to that of the CSE technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately 4 million child birth deliveries in US hospitals per year, and
      1.3million of those births are via cesarean section (c-section). With this type of surgery,
      obstetric anesthesiology plays an important role. The main objective of this study will be to
      determine if the dural puncture epidural (DPE) provides superior analgesia and better patient
      satisfaction when compared to traditional epidurals for cesarean sections, and to also
      determine if patient satisfaction in the DPE group is comparable to that of the CSE
      technique.

    <description>Using the Arrow Epidural Kit (AK-05560) an epidural will be placed using the LOR to saline or air technique. A 26g Gertie Marx needle will be inserted through the Touhy epidural needle and used to puncture the dura; clear, free flowing CSF will return in the needle, but no medications will be injected. The 26g spinal needle will be removed, and the epidural catheter inserted through the epidural needle 3-5cm in the epidural space. A test dose with 3mL 1.5% Lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine will be used to confirm the absence of intrathecal or intravascular catheter placement. The epidural catheter will then be dosed with 0.5% Bupivacaine in 5mL increments until a T4 dermatome level is reached. Epidural fentanyl 100mcg will be administered during initial dosing, and morphine-PF 3mg will be given via epidural after delivery of the fetus.</description>

    <description>Using the Arrow Epidural Kit (AK-05560) an epidural will be placed using the LOR to saline or air technique. A 26g Gertie Marx needle will be inserted through the Touhy epidural needle and used to puncture the dura; clear, free flowing CSF will return in the needle and 12mg bupivacaine, 10mcg fentanyl, 200mcg morphine-PF. The 26g spinal needle will be removed, and the epidural catheter inserted through the epidural needle 3-5cm in the epidural space. No epidural test dose will be given immediately compared to the above procedures secondary to intrathecal injection of local anesthetic with this CSE technique. Only after approximately 1 hour after intrathecal injection will a test dose of 3mL 1.5% Lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine will be used to confirm the absence of intrathecal or intravascular catheter placement. The epidural catheter will then be dosed with 0.5% Bupivacaine for the remainder of the procedure if necessary.</description>
