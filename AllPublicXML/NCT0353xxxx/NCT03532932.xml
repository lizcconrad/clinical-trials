  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the treatment patterns associated with biologics
      agents use or non-biological therapy in participants with moderate to severe Ulcerative
      Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, retrospective and prospective study of participants with IBD.
      This study will collect data to provide accurate and comprehensive information related to
      treatment patterns associated with biologics use or non-biological therapy in participants
      with moderate to severe UC and CD in routine clinical practice.

      The study will have retrospective data collection from past records of participants within
      the last 2 years before participant's enrollment. The prospective part of the study will
      include one year of observation and data collection after the participant's enrollment in the
      study.

      The study will enroll approximately 3000 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one
      of the two groups:

        -  UC Participants

        -  CD Participants

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. The overall
      period of observation in this study will be approximately 12 months. Participants will make 2
      visits within their routine practice to the clinic after the enrollment into the study
      including a final visit at Month 12.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Achieved Clinical and Combined Clinical and Endoscopic Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>At enrollment, Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Treat to target (T2T) approach for UC includes clinical remission as a resolution of rectal bleeding and diarrhea/altered bowel habit, and endoscopic remission as Mayo endoscopic sub-score of 0 to 1. T2T approach for CD includes clinical remission as resolution of abdominal pain and diarrhea/altered bowel habit, and endoscopic remission for CD as resolution of ulceration at ileocolonoscopy or resolution of findings of inflammation on cross-sectional imaging in participants who cannot be adequately assessed with ileocolonoscopy. Mayo score is an instrument used to measure disease activity. Mayo score evaluates UC stage based on four parameters: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopic evaluation and physician's global assessment. Each parameter of the score ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 3 (severe activity), with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
