    <textblock>
      This study will compare the overall survival (OS) time of elderly patients who would not
      tolerate standard chemotherapy for PCNSL treated with WBXRT together with Optune-TTF to those
      treated with whole-brain radiotherapy alone.

      Standard treatment of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) for patients with good
      performance status involves high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimens and
      whole-brain radiation therapy (WBXRT). Although up to 20% of patients with PCNSL are 80 years
      of age or older, little data exist with regard to optimal treatment of this patient
      population and they often do not qualify for clinical trials. In addition, elderly patients
      have a poorer rate of complete and partial response and increased risk of toxicity when
      treated with standard chemotherapy regimens. Though a consensus does not exist, radiotherapy
      alone is often used in these patients to minimize toxic effects of more aggressive
      chemotherapies.

      The Optune TTF device has proven effective in treating high-grade gliomas and is currently
      being investigated to treat meningiomas and metastatic lesions in the brain as well as other
      tumor types elsewhere in the body. It is generally well tolerated with no known systemic side
      effects, producing only an occasional local skin reaction. The mechanism of action is
      independent of tumor type and therefore may be effective in treating lymphoma as well.
