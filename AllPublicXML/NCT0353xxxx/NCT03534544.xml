  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn more about patient and family preferences regarding use of
      advanced diabetes technologies. Young persons with type 1 diabetes (ages 8-25) and parents of
      young persons with type 1 diabetes will complete one study visit involving a semi-structured
      interview and surveys. The results of the study will be used to assist in the design of a new
      automated insulin delivery system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes remains the most common chronic disease of childhood and affects millions of
      children and adults globally. The minority of persons with type 1 diabetes achieve the
      recommended glycemic targets. Currently approved and unapproved automated insulin delivery
      systems require patients to carry and wear multiple devices (pumps, tubing, blood glucose
      meters, mobile devices, etc.). There is a need to design automated insulin delivery systems
      that reduce the burden of diabetes management for young persons and their families in an
      effort to improve glycemic control as well as other biomedical and psychosocial outcomes.

      The purpose of this study is to conduct separate semi-structured interviews with young
      persons with type 1 diabetes and parents of youth with type 1 diabetes (not necessarily the
      parents of the youth participants) regarding their preferences for an automated, on-body
      insulin delivery system. Youth and parents will also complete short surveys related to
      perceived burden of diabetes self-care, quality of life, acceptance of diabetes, and worries
      about hypoglycemia. The feedback received from the interviews and surveys will help inform
      the design of a new on-body automated insulin delivery system.
