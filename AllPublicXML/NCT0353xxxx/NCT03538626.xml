  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is a serious disease. It has no cure or vaccine
      to prevent it. Using antibodies is one way to prevent HIV infection that seems promising.
      Antibodies are naturally made by the body to fight germs so people stay healthy. Researchers
      want to see if the antibody N6LS, made artificially in the lab, can prevent HIV infection.

      Objective:

      To see if the antibody N6LS is safe and well-tolerated.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy people ages 18 50

      Design:

      Participants will be assigned to 1 of 6 groups.

      Group 1 4 participants will have about 13 visits over about 24 weeks. They will get N6LS
      once.

      Group 5 6 participants will have about 26 visits over about 48 weeks. They will get N6LS 3
      times.

      Visits that involve receiving N6LS may be up to 8 hours. Follow up visits are about 30
      minutes. Female participants will have pregnancy tests at each one.

      Some participants will get N6LS through a thin tube in an arm vein. A pump will give N6LS
      directly into the vein for about 30 minutes. A tube in a vein in the other arm will collect
      blood.

      Some participants will get the antibody as an injection into the fatty tissue of the belly,
      arm, or thigh.

      Participants will have blood taken at every visit.

      Participants will get a measuring tool and thermometer. They will check their temperature
      every day for 3 days after they get N6LS. They will check the injection site and measure any
      redness, swelling, or bruising.

      Non-N6LS visits will be about 2 hours. Participants will report any health changes and how
      they have been feeling.

      VRC 609: APhase I, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of a
      Human Monoclonal Antibody, VRC-HIVMAB091-00-AB (N6LS), Administered Intravenously or
      Subcutaneously to Healthy Adults

      Study Design:

      This is the first study in healthy adults of the N6LS monoclonal antibody (MAb). It is a
      dose-escalation study to examine safety, tolerability, dose, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      N6LS. The hypothesis is that N6LS administration to healthy adults will be safe by the
      intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes. A secondary hypothesis is that N6LS will be
      detectable in human sera with a definable half-life.

      Product Description:

      N6LS (VRC-HIVMAB091-00-AB ) is a human MAb targeted to the HIV-1 CD4 binding site. It was
      developed by the VRC/NIAID/NIH and manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice
      (cGMP) regulations at the VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant operated under contract by the Vaccine
      Clinical Materials Program (VCMP), Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick, MD. The
      product is provided as a sterile aqueous buffered solution in 10 mL glass vials at a
      concentration of 100 +/- 10 mg/mL and volume of 6.25 +/- 0.10 mL.

      Subjects: Healthy adults, 18-50 years of age.

      Study Plan:

      This open-label study will include 6 dose groups to assess N6LS given as a single IV infusion
      at the 5, 20, or 40 mg/kg dose level (Groups 1, 3,4); a single SC injection at the 5 mg/kg
      dose level (Group 2); or in 3 administrations, 12 weeks apart by SC injection at the 5 mg/kg
      dose level (Group 5), or by IV infusion at the 20 mg/kg dose level (Group 6). Enrollments
      will initially open with Groups 1, 2 and 5; followed by the sequential activation of Groups
      3, 4, and 6.

      Study Duration:

      Subject study participation will be approximately 24 weeks for subjects in Groups 1 to 4 and
      48 weeks for subjects in Groups 5 and 6.
