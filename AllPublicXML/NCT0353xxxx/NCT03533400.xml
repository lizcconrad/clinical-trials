    <textblock>
      The Effectiveness of the Jamboxx Respiratory Therapy Device in Treatment of Patients with
      Decreased Respiratory Function is a proposal for investigation of the application of gaming
      to improving respiratory health. The Jamboxx device combines gaming with traditional
      incentive spirometry to provide users with a fun experience to keep them engaged in their
      respiratory therapy routine. The device allows users to play a series of mini-games that walk
      them through their routines. The Jamboxx also records airflow and lung parameters with an
      external mouthpiece attachment to provide users with real time feedback, and helps to assess
      increases or decreases in relative lung function over time. The Jamboxx has the potential to
      significantly impact the field of respiratory therapy by being one of the first gaming
      devices for patient therapy, and the first respiratory therapy gaming device that is
      accessible to users with limited mobility. Jamboxx provides a fun and engaging, low cost
      alternative to the traditional therapy techniques used and aims to improve patient
      compliance.

      Study 1 addresses the concerns of pneumonia risks in quadriplegics with compromised
      respiratory pump mechanics. In cases of spinal cord injury or high-level motor neuron
      disease, complications with respiratory function are a common concern. Lack of innervation to
      the intercostal and abdominal muscles can cause a decline in respiratory capacity as well as
      overall lung function, with associated increased risk of mortality. Shallow tidal breathing
      and impaired or absent cough results in morbidity and mortality from pneumonia. Several
      studies have found failure of the respiratory system, including pneumonia, to be a leading
      cause of mortality among spinal cord injury patients (van den Berg et al, 2010; Soden et al;
      2000). In order to maintain pulmonary health, many people with quadriplegia and other
      high-level motor neuron diseases undergo routine respiratory therapy to help stretch the
      muscles around the lungs, exercise the diaphragm, and loosen mucus build-up. Incentive
      spirometry is one commonly used component of respiratory therapy designed to mimic natural
      sighing or yawning by encouraging the patient to take long, slow, deep breaths (Barlett et al
      1970;Craven et al 1974). This is done with an incentive spirometer device, which provides
      patients with visual or other positive feedback with a piston or a ball that moves inside a
      gauge. Respiratory therapy techniques are also used to help maintain pulmonary health in
      individuals with a number of chronic or temporary respiratory diseases and conditions such as
      asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema. These techniques often become
      strenuous and mundane for users with limited mobility, and thus patient compliance rates are
      low. Gaming controlled by forceful respiratory maneuvers will be studied to ascertain if
      respiratory mechanics can be improved in this group.

      Testing Plan: Study participants will be randomized into 2 groups through drawing of sealed
      envelopes. Group 1 (control group) will be given the standard Jamboxx musical device (see
      appendix a for device details), while Group 2 (treatment group) will be given the Jamboxx
      respiratory therapy device, which combines musical gameplay with incentive spirometry
      exercises. Participants from both groups will have two 20 minute training sessions with the
      device: one initial training visit and one follow up visit. Training sessions will take place
      either in the home, or at Albany Medical Center. During the initial visit a simple spirometry
      test (FEV1, FVC and PEF) and maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP) will
      be performed. These functions will be measured again at 3, 6, 9 &amp; 12 months by a respiratory
      therapist (RT). The Dyspnea-12 (D-12) questionnaire will be conducted at by the RT at months
      0, 3, 6, 9, and 12. Self-Reported Patient Dyspnea and the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile
      (MDP) will be reported electronically by study participants on a weekly basis. Medical
      records will be evaluated for relevant health history, medication use, and hospitalizations
      including dates. Access to medical records will be obtained by a signed medical release form.

    <description>Group 1 (control group) will be given the standard Jamboxx musical device. They will be trained to use the device during two 20 minute training session with a respiratory therapist, and will be instructed to play the device for a minimum of 30 minutes, 3 times a week. The Jamboxx musical device is a hands-free breath controlled musical device designed for people with quadriplegia. The mouthpiece acts as a transducer, changing air pressure created by the user's lungs to a joystick signal to the computer via a differential pressure sensor. The Jamboxx can produce musical sounds of many instruments (trumpet, drums, etc.) in many different scales and in any key.</description>

    <description>Jamboxx musical device is a hands free, breath controlled music device designed for people with quadriplegia. It resembles a common harmonica in that the user slides a mouthpiece along its horizontal axis to change the pitch of the instrument. The device connects to a personal computer via a mini USB to USB cable to interface with software that provides visual feedback for playing notes and sends the information to the computer speakers. The mouthpiece acts as a transducer, changing air pressure created by the user's lungs to a joystick signal to the computer via a differential pressure sensor. The Jamboxx musical device can produce musical sounds of many instruments (trumpet, drums, etc.) in many different scales and in any key</description>
