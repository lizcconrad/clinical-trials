  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition affecting the whole joint and is a major cause of pain and
      disability worldwide. Although OA is very common, the initial steps which lead to the
      development of pain and tissue damage are not fully understood. In this study participants
      will be investigated for markers in the blood, joint and urine in people who have a diagnosis
      of osteoarthritis or inflammatory arthritis and are receiving a steroid injection for their
      condition. Markers will be evaluated in participants with osteoarthritis compared with other
      types of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis.

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis worldwide. OA causes major
      disability and pain and places a huge financial burden on healthcare worldwide. In recent
      work, the gene expression profile of bone marrow lesions (BML) in osteoarthritis has been
      evaluated. BML in OA have a novel gene expression profile which includes genes involved in
      inflammation, neurogenesis and matrix turnover. The plan is to investigate the functional
      significance of the genes found at the protein biomarker level in studies of joint tissue,
      blood and urine from participants with knee OA and compare these changes with participants
      who have other forms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis.
