    <textblock>
      Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is one of the potential manifestations of peripheral artery
      diseases and it is often observed in patients with evolving renal function impairment and
      concomitant coronary artery disease, or in those suffering from hypertension refractory to
      medical therapy.Percutaneous renal artery stenting is an effective therapeutic tool and
      represents the treatment of choice for RAS. Identification of parameters able to discriminate
      patients who benefit from RAS stenting, thus, has become of crucial importance if this
      technique has to survive.

      Aortic dissection represents a common cardiovascular disease and it is responsible for the
      most commonly encountered pathologies in aortic emergency. Renal dysfunction is a common
      complication associated with aortic dissection, with resultant high mortality rate. The
      antegrade propagation of the dissection from the proximal aorta to the level of renal
      arteries and the intervention during surgery may both increase the risk of renal
      malperfusion; thus, it is important to assess renal function for pre- and post-operative
      evaluation and guidance for treatment. This can be achieved through perfusion imaging.

      Presently, C-arm Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) perfusion is well established, in
      particular, in the diagnostic assessment of acute stroke and cerebral ischemia. The main
      novelty of our study lies in the fact that intra-procedural renal perfusion assessed for the
      first time semiquantitatively by Syngo Dyna Parenchymal Blood Volume(PBV) software,
      discriminate patients who will benefit from the intervention procedure.

      In conclusion, our study suggests that a routine assessment of pre, and post-stenting renal
      perfusion could help to identify patients at higher risk of no improvement or even worsening
      of renal function after stenting and, perhaps, more aggressive medical therapy.
