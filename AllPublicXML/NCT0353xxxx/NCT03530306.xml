    <textblock>
      This is a four arm, patient subtyping and parameter optimisation study for a neuromodulation
      treatment for tinnitus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with chronic tinnitus will be provided with a CE marked neuromodulation device.
      Participants are randomized to one of four different treatment arms. The treatment period is
      intended for 12 weeks of use, in which different parameter settings are implemented between
      the first and second halves of the treatment period. Differences in tinnitus severity scores
      will be compared between and within treatment arms.
