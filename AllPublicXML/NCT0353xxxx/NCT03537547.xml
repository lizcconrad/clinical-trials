  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder is a chronic psychiatric illness that leads to devastating
      consequences at the individual and societal levels. Today, the choice of treatment continues
      to be largely based on subjective factors, primarily the clinician and/or patient's
      preferences, as well as the individual's history of response to treatment, often tainted by
      recall bias. Psychiatric medication decisions are even more arbitrary when the subject in
      question has not had past treatment trials. This often leads to a trial and error process and
      an increasingly resistant disease with each failed trial. Early implementation of an
      objective tool designed for tailoring medication choice to an individual may prove highly
      beneficial in decreasing illness chronicity, individual suffering, and economic burden.

      GeneSight Psychotropic test is a pharmacogenomic decision support tool, developed to help
      clinicians make informed, evidence-based decisions about proper drug selection. Therefore, we
      propose conducting a randomized, double blind, controlled trial to evaluate the impact of the
      GeneSight Psychotropic test to guide treatment decisions in patients with treatment-naïve
      (never having taken medication for depression) Major Depressive Disorder.

      This study will involve 6 visits over about 24 weeks where participants will be randomized to
      have their study clinician have access to their pharmacogenetic report in order to make
      treatment decisions, or to not have access to their report for the first 12 weeks. At Visit
      5, Week 12, all participants will receive a copy of their pharmacogenetics report and all
      clinicians will be unblinded to be able to use the results to guide treatment options for an
      additional 12 weeks.
