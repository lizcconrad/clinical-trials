  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: 1) describe drug utilization for Fluoroquinolone(FQ),
      Azithromycin (AZ) and Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim(ST) in the entire Truven MarketScan
      Commercial Claims and Encounters database (CCAE) database, and specifically among individuals
      in the Health and Productivity Management (HPM) during the observation period; 2) describe
      the rate of disability associated with 2 or more System Organ Class adverse events (SOC AEs)
      and exposure to FQs for several acute, uncomplicated indications; and 3) compare the rates of
      disability for 2 or more SOC AEs and exposure to FQs and AZ/ST for the same indications.

    <description>Number of participants with disability in temporal proximity to 2 confirmed System Organ Class (SOC) adverse event (AEs) among the 6 of interest (peripheral nervous system, neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, sensory, cardiovascular, skin) will be reported. Disability is defined as an incident short-term disability claim in the Health and Productivity Management (HPM) database if it is observed within 120 days of the first Fluoroquinolone(FQ) or Azithromycin/ Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (AZ/ST) exposure.</description>

All participants must have continuous observation of at least 180 days prior and 120 days after event index date, and all events will be evaluated per participant.

        uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis, or bronchitis and were prescribed an oral
        fluoroquinolone (FQ) or oral azithromycin(AZ) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) for
        urinary tract infection.
