  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to quantify patterns of activity and sedentary behavior
      in independent living residents and to collect preliminary data on the feasibility of
      reducing sedentary behavior using a 12-week, behavioral intervention in older adults. We will
      also measure the effects of reducing sedentary behavior on physical function, sleep, quality
      of life, energy/mood, pain and blood pressure. Participants will act as their own controls
      through the use of a double baseline period to examine stability of the physical activity and
      outcome measures.

      Aim 1: To measure the amount of sedentary time and ambulation (steps) in older adults
      residing in independent living communities.

      Aim 2: To test the acceptability and effectiveness of a 12-week sedentary behavior
      intervention to decrease sitting and increase ambulation which will in turn improve physical
      function (primary outcome) as well as sleep, quality of life, energy/mood, pain and blood
      pressure (secondary outcomes) in independent living residents.

      Background: Sedentary behavior, or sitting for prolonged periods during waking time, is
      identified as a health risk that is distinct from the failure to achieve sufficient physical
      activity. Older adults exhibit the greatest time in sedentary behavior which is concerning
      given its association with chronic disease and poorer physical function. Preliminary data
      suggest that individuals in long term care facilities may have even greater sedentary time
      due to personal factors and environment influences. Most often, exercise is targeted as a
      mechanism for ameliorating frailty in older adults; however, reduction in sedentary time may
      be a more appealing and realistic goal for improving health outcomes. Despite this, studies
      targeting sedentary time in older adults, particularly in those in independent living
      facilities, are lacking.
