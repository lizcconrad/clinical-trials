  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, single blinded, comparative pilot study is to evaluate U/S
      guided serratus anterior plane catheter block (SAPB) versus patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA) on the emergence of post - thoracotomy pain syndrome (PTPS). The investigator's assumed
      hypothesis is that; SAPB is an effective thoracic analgesic technique that may reduce the
      development of PTPS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer has the highest incidence of all malignancies worldwide &amp; represents about 13% of
      all cancer victims. Lung cancer still represents the first cause of cancer deaths and lung
      resection surgeries could be the main therapeutic procedure. Hence, the number of
      thoracotomies is progressively increasing with more &amp; more post- thoracotomy pain . Together
      with amputation, thoracotomy is considered the main etiology of severe &amp; long-term acute and
      chronic post-surgical pain syndromes (CPSP). The prevalence of post - thoracotomy pain
      syndrome (PTPS) is variable (30-50%). The international association for the study of pain
      (IASP) has defined PTPS as &quot;pain that recurs or persists along the thoracotomy scar at least
      2 months after the procedure&quot;.Besides, PTPS is mostly described with neuropathic
      manifestations along the thoracotomy scar, mammary &amp; submammary ipsilateral scapular &amp;
      interscapular areas. Pain is often aching, burning with tingling, numbness, pruritis plus
      sensory loss and/or hypoesthesia.Preemptive post-thoracotomy analgesia is mostly multimodal &amp;
      integrates both systemic &amp; regional techniques. Systemic drugs (either given parenterally or
      through patient controlled - analgesia &quot;PCA&quot;) include, NSAIDs, Cox - II inhibitors,
      paracetamol, opioids, ketamine (as N-methyl-D- aspartate blocker), gabapentins &amp; pregabalin,
      selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and/or duloxetine .Regional analgesic techniques
      include thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) which, is considered by many as the gold standard
      analgesic mode for post-thoracotomy pain .Other regional analgesic techniques are
      paravertebral analgesia (PVB), intercostal nerve blocks and intrapleural analgesia.Recently
      SAPB has been practiced more widely as an U/S - guided, simple technique of effective
      post-thoracotomy analgesia which is comparable with standard techniques such as TEA and PVB.

    <description>Analgesia is maintained using disposable silicon ballon pump &quot;Accufuser&quot; containing morphine 0.2 mg/ml, 8mg ondansetron plus and 180 mg ketorolac. The infusion rate is 5 ml / h and lockout interval of 15min. the hourly delivered morphine dose is 1-1.8 mg &amp; the pump is sufficient for about 60 hours according to patient response.</description>

    <description>Linear ultrasound transducer (superficial) 6-12 MHz is utilized to count the ribs up to 4th or 5 th rib in the mid-axillary line. Musculature of thoracic wall is identified sonographically,an echogenic needle &quot;14-16 G, 100 mm&quot; is inserted in plane with the U/S probe towards the plane deep to the serratus anterior muscle. Under real - time U/S, single shot of 20ml contrast medium &quot;iohexol = omnipaque&quot; 150 mg I2 / ml is injected to check the plane and level (T3-T8/9) of SAPB.A reinforced radiopaque catheter is threaded through the needle and its final position underneath the plane of serratus anterior muscle is confirmed fluoroscopically. 20ml 0.25% levobupivacaine (Chirocaine).Analgesia is maintained using 0.125% levobupivacaine infusion at a rate of 7-12 ml/h according to patient response.</description>
