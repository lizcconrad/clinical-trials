  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesizes that vegetable and protein consumed before a carbohydrate will reduce
      the glucose response. The vegetables and protein consumed before carbohydrate have different
      effects on insulin and satiety responses.

      Up to 20 healthy subjects will be recruited for the study and before inclusion in the study,
      potential participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions. Subjects who will
      fulfill all the acceptable criteria(Chinese ethnicity, body mass index between 18-25 kg/m2,
      weight of at least 45kg, normal blood pressure,less than or equal 140 and 90 mmHg; age
      between 21-40 years, fasting blood glucose less than 6 mmol/L) may be included in the
      study.Each subject will be asked to complete a screening session(lasting approximately1 hour)
      in a fasted state where baseline measurements including anthropometric measurements, fasting
      blood glucose and blood pressure will be collected from each participant to assess their
      eligibility.On the day before each test, enrolled subjects will be asked to restrict their
      intake of alcohol and caffeine-containing drinks and to restrict their participation in
      intense physical activity (eg, long periods at the gym, intensive swimming, running, aerobics
      etc). There is a total of five test sessions. Test sessions will be interspaced by a
      minimumof 1 week. For each session, subjects are required to come between 8:00-9:00am, with
      each session lasting approximately 4 hours. Subjects would have to come following a 10-12
      hour overnight fast. An indwelling catheter will be inserted into a vein in your forearm and
      will be kept patent (free of clots) for the remainder of the test session. The investigators
      will then take a blood sample from the cannula to measure baseline values. The investigators
      will also take a finger prick blood sample to measure blood glucose concentration. After
      obtaining the baseline blood samples the investigators will give subjects the test meal in
      different sequence consume in 15 minutes. Followingthe meal we will take further blood
      samples (from the cannula and finger pricks) for the next 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and180
      minutes. The amount of blood that will be collected at every time point will be about1.2
      teaspoon of blood (approximately 6 mL).At the same time intervals the subjects will be
      instructed to fill in visual analogue scales on feelings of fullness, hunger, desire to eat
      and prospective food consumption.Visual analogue scales are 100 mm continuous lines anchored
      with opposing answers to a specific question asked. The specific questions asked will be,
      'How hungry do you feel?', 'How full do you feel?', 'How strong is your desire to eat?', '
      How much more food do you think you can eat?'. The subjects will be instructed to make a mark
      on the line which corresponds with their subjective feeling. After 3 hours, the cannula will
      be removed and the subjects will be instructed to an ad libitum lunch. After finish the
      lunch, the subjects will also be asked to complete a visual analogue scales (VAS) for the
      measurement of hunger and feelings of fullness. After which,subjects are free to leave CNRC.
      During the entire testing period the subjects will be instructed to remain rested and in the
      laboratory.
