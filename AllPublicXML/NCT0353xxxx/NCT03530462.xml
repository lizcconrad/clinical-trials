  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of patients with autoimmune encephalitis are left with permanent cognitive deficits of
      varying severity. The patients' life and career would be affected definitely by cognitive
      deficits. Recently, more and more clinical physician have begun to focus on cognitive
      impairment of patients with autoimmune encephalitis. Generally, the outcome was measured by
      the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). However, the mRS are commonly used to evaluate the degree of
      disability or dependence in the daily activities of the patients suffering from a stroke and
      cognition function were minimally evaluated in this scale. It is crucial to adopt detailed
      cognition tools to study the long-term cognitive outcomes and as an indicator of overall
      curative effect judgment in autoimmune encephalitis.

      Currently, only early immunotherapy is uniformly and consistently considered to produce
      favorable cognitive outcomes. However, studies concerning the association of second-line
      immunotherapy with cognitive outcomes have been scarce and have shown conflicting results
      regarding autoimmune encephalitis.

      Hence, the goal of this study was to explore cognitive neural mechanism of autoimmune
      encephalitis by using neuropsychological tests and multi-mode MRIs.

      The goal of this study was to explore cognitive neural mechanism of different types of
      autoimmune encephalitis by using neuropsychological tests and multi-mode MRIs.
      Neuropsychological tests involves the assessments of different cognitive domains. And
      multi-mode MRIs contains resting-fMRI, DTI and task-related fMRI.
