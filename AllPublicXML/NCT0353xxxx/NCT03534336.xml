  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to design a Behavioral Economics Based Online Lifestyle
      Balance Program that employs behavioral economics to engage and motivate adherence to the
      Internet-based program. We compare the effects of two financial incentives on inducing weight
      loss: a direct financial incentive for weight loss and a financial incentive for learning
      health literacy.

      This project investigates whether participants in a online weight loss program can be induced
      to achieve weight loss using financial incentives. The study is a 3-arm RCT stratified by
      gender. The goal is to examine how overweight individuals respond to two different types of
      financial incentives. The first type of incentive, IW (incentive for weight loss), is a cash
      award of approximately $150 given for achieving 5% weight loss over 12 weeks. The second type
      of incentive, IE (incentive for education), is a $150 award for passing quizzes that test the
      participants' health literacy about weight loss and techniques required for maintaining a
      healthful lifestyle. We compare the effectiveness of IW to IE in promoting weight loss in
      overweight individuals and investigate whether the two incentives work equally well for men
      and women.

    <description>Participants are enrolled in a 12-week, self-administered online weight loss program. The program is delivered through 12 weekly sessions; each includes educational videos and a health literacy quiz. Each quiz contains 10 questions, and a quiz is considered &quot;passed&quot; when at least 7 questions are answered correctly. ALL participants are encouraged to follow the program, take the quizzes, and lose 5% of their baseline body weight by the end of the program.
No financial incentives are given for losing weight or passing quizzes.</description>
