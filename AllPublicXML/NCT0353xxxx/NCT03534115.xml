  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental bleaching is a simple procedure for aesthetic restoration of vital and non-vital
      discolored teeth. Nevertheless, a number of studies conducted previously demonstrated the
      risk of tissue damage from contact of these agents with the oral mucosa along with their
      possible genotoxic potential after exposure to oral mucosa. Hence the aim of this study is to
      conduct a human clinical trial to incorporate the chemoprotectant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) in
      the procedure of bleaching which could safely be used to eliminate the toxicity of bleaching
      materials leaving their esthetic benefits intact. 30-40 human subjects will be recruited and
      bleaching will be done at the UCLA School of Dentistry dental clinic.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be self reported as healthy individuals with no significant medical
             issues.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Self-report of present medical history (determined by the primary care doctors) of
             donors for:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  HIV-seropositivity and AIDS because the study is designed to evaluate the effect of
             NAC in general population with no underlying immunological deficiencies or general
             pathologies which may result in confounding effect in the outcome. Since this is a
             small study we are limiting the procedure to healthy individuals with no known
             underlying pathologies.
