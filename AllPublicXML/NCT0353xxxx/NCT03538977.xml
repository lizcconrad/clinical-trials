  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature newborns (PTNB) often develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which can be related
      to an inability to maintain differences in tonus patterns (extensor and flexor) between the
      cervical muscles, upper and lower limbs. Babies who develop BPD remain in the neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) for a prolonged period of time, undergoing a large number of
      painful procedures. Exposure to pain in premature newborns (PTNB) is one of the most damaging
      factors in the extrauterine environment, also causing stress, which can also interfere with
      tonus pattern. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of hydrotherapy on
      muscular activity, pain, sleep and wakefulness, stress, physiological conditions and the need
      for oxygen in PTNB with BPD during hospitalization in the neonatal unit. EXPECTED RESULTS:
      Hydrotherapy is expected to relieve pain, improve sleep quality and reduce oxygen therapy and
      ventilatory support in hospitalized PTNB babies with BPD.

      INTRODUTION:The development of medicine in recent years, especially in neonatology, has
      contributed to a considerable reduction in mortality rates,however, with the increase in
      diseases that contribute to morbidity and mortality, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia
      (BPD). Such condition is defined by the need for supplemental oxygen and/or ventilatory
      support for more than 28 days.One of the complications of BPD is the inability to maintain
      differences in tonus patterns(extensor and flexor) between the cervical muscles, upper and
      lower limbs, which can be assessed by surface electromyography (EMG). Babies who develop BPD
      remain in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for a prolonged period of time, undergoing
      a large number of painful procedures.Exposure to pain in premature newborns (PTNB) is one of
      the most damaging factors in the extrauterine environment, also causing stress, which can be
      measured by salivary cortisol.Studies with pain relief methods in these babies are needed,
      such as hydrotherapy.This approach has proven to be effective and safe in reducing the signs
      of pain and stress and to improve sleep quality in preterm infants in the NICU, besides
      improving physiological parameters, such as peripheral oxygen saturation. OBJECTIVES: To
      evaluate the effects of hydrotherapy on muscular activity, pain, sleep and wakefulness,
      stress, physiological conditions and the need for oxygen in PTNB with BPD during
      hospitalization in the neonatal unit. METHODOLOGY: PTNB with a diagnosis of BPD will be
      randomized into two groups: conventional physiotherapy (GP) and conventional physiotherapy
      plus hydrotherapy (GH). The PTNB randomized to GH will be submitted to 11 hydrotherapy
      sessions. The PTNB from both groups will be submitted to evaluation of heart rate (HR),
      peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (RR), pain, respiratory distress, sleep
      state, and wakefulness. The level of salivary cortisol and muscular activity (EMG) will also
      be evaluated. EXPECTED RESULTS: Hydrotherapy is expected to relieve pain, improve sleep
      quality and reduce oxygen therapy and ventilatory support in hospitalized PTNB babies with
      BPD.

    <masking_description>For the evaluation of pain, respiratory effort and state of sleep and wakefulness, specific scales previously validated for this population will be used: NIPS (Neonatal Infant Pain Scale) scale, Silverman Andersen respiratory severity score, and the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale, respectively. Patients will be filmed during the five moments of assessment, and two physiotherapists blinded to the groups will watch the filming and perform the evaluation using the scales previously mentioned.</masking_description>

    <description>A re-sterilizable stainless steel bucket with an upper diameter of 30 cm, a depth of 32 cm, with water at a temperature between 37 and 38º Celsius will be used. The amount of water used will be sufficient to keep the baby submerged up to shoulder height. The baby will be immersed in the heated water of the bucket and will be suspended by occipital support performed by the physiotherapist, who alternates lateral-lateral and anteroposterior movements with only static suspension. The therapy will last from eight to ten minutes and will be discontinued if there is agitation, cyanosis, worsening respiratory distress or major evacuation. If the baby is using any type of ventilatory support or oxygen therapy, the same will be maintained during the procedure of hydrotherapy.</description>

    <description>Conventional physiotherapy consists of manipulations of Thoracoabdominal Rebalancing, a registered technique which uses simultaneous passive stretching of inspiratory muscles and stimulation of the diaphragm. The manipulation used to improve the dynamic diaphragm included the thoracic-abdominal and lower abdominal support maneuvers. Back repositioning was used to minimize posteriorization of the ribs and costal kyphosis due to thoracic distortion.</description>
