  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OEF/OIF/OND war Veterans have unique post-deployment care needs that the VA is striving to
      understand and address. Unfortunately, there is a significant disparity in utilization of
      mental health (MH) care and VA access as most war Veterans don't seek needed care. New
      interventions are urgently needed to address disparities in post-deployment MH treatment
      engagement for war Veterans and to support VA's efforts to provide them with optimal access
      and care. Online health interventions have been shown to be preferred by OEF/OIF combat
      Veterans and have the potential to promote access to VA MH care. The investigators' research
      team has developed a web-based interface (WEB-ED) evolved by feedback from Veterans that
      screens for common post-deployment MH and readjustment concerns, provides tailored education
      about positive screens, and facilitates linkage to VA resources. Data from the investigators'
      prior studies demonstrate WEB-ED can be successfully implemented within VA and activate
      Veterans to seek needed care. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that when patients are
      educated about their health conditions and treatment alternatives using shared
      decision-making (SDM), increased treatment participation and adherence, and better health
      outcomes result. Next steps include: linking Veteran WEB-ED screening results to a VA secure
      network so that a provider can access the results; and integrating a SDM interface to promote
      Veteran-Provider partnerships in patient-centered care. This study will improve the
      investigators' understanding of the most effective methods to reduce barriers to enrollment
      in VA/MHV and transferring important medical information using My HealtheVet (MHV).
      Furthermore, it will provide important information regarding how WEB-ED results can enhance
      the capability of VA providers and transition patient advocates to use Veterans' screening
      results to triage and engage Veterans in patient-centered MH care and promote VA provider
      adoption of WEB-ED+ to facilitate patient engagement. Online screening, tailored education,
      and links to geographically accessible VA resources has been shown to be preferred by
      Veterans, providing recognition of treatable post-deployment MH concerns, and education that
      reduces stigma. This study builds upon and augments this prior work with research to
      understand and evaluate the processes needed to integrate WEB-ED+ into current VHA systems to
      support efficient care delivery, facilitate patient-centered care, and address unmet need for
      MH care while also resolving disparities in VA and VA MH care access and engagement for war
      Veterans. WEB-ED+'s use of shared decision making is a key component for promoting these
      benefits. WEB-ED+ represents a readily implementable and cost-effective intervention that,
      with partner collaboration, can be integrated into VA systems through MHV. Findings have
      important policy implications for several operational partners heavily invested in the
      improved access and delivery of evidence-based mental health care for war Veterans.

      network so that a provider can access the results; and integrating a SDM interface to promote
      Veteran-Provider partnerships in patient-centered care. The investigators propose a three
      phase study to address the investigators' aims. Aim 1 (phase 1) the investigators will gather
      qualitative information from key VA and Veteran informants to create an enhanced version
      (WEB-ED+) of the investigators' Current WEB-ED that includes an eHealth and SDM interface.
      Aim 2 (phase 2) will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test WEB-ED+ vs. Current
      WEB-ED in promoting VA MH care engagement. Aim 3 (phase 3) the investigators will employ a
      process evaluation to determine the feasibility and acceptability of WEB-ED+ for both
      Veterans and VA practitioner and to document the VA processes Veterans use to enroll and
      engage in VA MH care. This study will improve the investigators' understanding of the most
      effective methods to reduce barriers to enrollment in VA/MHV and transferring important
      medical information using My HealtheVet (MHV). Furthermore, it will provide important
      information regarding how WEB-ED results can enhance the capability of VA providers and

    <description>Veterans who screen positive on one or more mental health screens in WEB-ED will be eligible for RCT and those who consent and are randomly assigned to the WEB-ED+ Group. WEB-ED+ augments Current WEB-ED in a next step online interface via Pharos. If successful, this enhancement could be integrated into the next iteration of WEB-ED. Enhancements include:
An eHealth interface tailored to Veterans' VA and MHV enrollment needs, links for an electronic interface with VA enrollment, MHV and MHV premium status enrollment, and secure messaging guidance.
Shared decision making (SDM) interface: Veteran SDM-related educational (e.g., existing YouTube videos) and structured questions about treatment concerns, preferences, and questions and can be accessed through postal and email distribution or Pharos portal.
Access to a health coach (the research coordinators) will be available through a toll-free number to assist both Veterans and providers/Transition Patient Advocates.</description>
