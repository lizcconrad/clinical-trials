  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare revascularization strategy and its immediate results
      after augmented-reality computed tomography angiography (CTA) guided vs. standard angiography
      guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in native coronary lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While stand-alone angiography is the first-line imaging modality for guidance of PCI, it has
      some inherent limitations which may result in suboptimal stent placement related to residual
      reference segment disease and stent underexpansion. Coronary CTA, on the other hand, can
      provide reliable measurements of the vessel size and lesion length as well as the
      visualization of the morphological features of coronary plaque, and has been suggested as
      potentially valuable for changing PCI technique. The AR-PCI trial has been designed as a
      single-center, investigator initiated and investigator sponsored, randomized (1:1),
      controlled, prospective clinical trial. It is hypothesized that the review of CTA datasets
      using augmented-reality glass in the catheterization laboratory could influence PCI treatment
      strategy and its immediate results by more adequate lesion coverage with less residual
      disease and better stent expansion as compared to traditional angiography-guided PCI alone.
