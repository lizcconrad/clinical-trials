      This study will be conducted on (100) pregnant women diagnosed as placenta previa by
      ultrasonography and are candidates for either emergency or elective repeated cesarean section
      or hysterectomy (if the diagnosis of placenta accreta is confirmed).

      All of those patients are presenting during the period of may 2018 to july 2018 to Kasr-Al
      Ainy Obstetrics outpatient clinic or casualty department during their 3rd trimester.

      All of them will be assorted according to certain inclusion and exclusion criterions as
      follow:

      This study will be conducted on (100) pregnant women diagnosed as placenta previa by
      ultrasonography and are candidates for either emergency or elective repeated cesarean section
      or hysterectomy (if the diagnosis of placenta accreta is confirmed).

      Those patients are attending to Kasr-Al Ainy Obstetrics outpatient clinic or casualty
      department during their 3rd trimester.

      Ultrasound and doppler will be done to all patients to diagnose placenta accreta . The
      diagnosis will be confirmed by intraoperative assessments and histopathological examination
      of the uterus after cesarean hysterectomy
