    <textblock>
      The alterations of coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters have been described in patients
      with endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) and those treated with glucocorticosteroids (GCs).
      The change in hemostatic process is associated with an increased risk of venous
      thromboembolic events (VTE) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Anticoagulation prophylaxis reduces
      thromboembolic complications in endogenous and exogenous hypercortisolism. The impact of the
      intravenous GCs therapy on hypercoagulability, however, remains unclear and perplexing.
      According to the European Group On Graves' Orbitopathy (EUGOGO), patients with active,
      severely symptomatic and sight-threatening Graves' orbitopathy (GO) should be treated with
      high dose intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) pulses. There are, however, reports of fatal
      side effects that may be associated with this therapy (e.g.: PE, myocardial infarction,
      severe cerebrovascular events, acute liver damage and sudden death). For this reason, the
      cumulative dose of IVMP should not exceed 8 g within each treatment course, and pulses should
      not be given on consecutive or alternate days, except for the case of dysthyroid optic
      neuropathy. Nevertheless, even smaller cumulative therapy may be associated with fatal
      cardiovascular complications. Hence the aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of IVMP
      therapy on hemostatic process in patients with GO. All of patients were treated according to
      EUGOGO recommendations with standard doses of methylprednisolone with standard recommended
      schedule. Inclusion criterion for the therapy was according to EUGOGO guidelines
      moderate-to-severe and active GO (12 pulses of IVMP 6x0.5g followed by 6x0.25g every week).

      The end point of the study was a change in hemostatic variables' levels in laboratory tests.
      There were short- and long-term hemostatic changes analysed during IVMP therapy: comparisons
      of laboratory tests before, 24h and 48h after selected pulses, and between the beginning of
      1st, 6th and 12th IVMP pulses, respectively. Hemostatic variables that were evaluated: factor
      [F] II, FV, FVII, FVIII, fibrinogen, antithrombin, activated partial thromboplastin time,
      prothrombin time, platelets and D - dimer. Moreover, analyses were performed concerning
      clinical data (such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking, duration time of GO, presence of
      hypertension, basal markers of thyroid function) between independent groups (patients with
      initially increased/reduced selected markers versus without increased/reduced selected
      markers).

      Venous blood was collected in the morning following a 12 hour fast. This was utilized for
      preparation of serum, 3.2% sodium citrate plasma, and citrate platelet - poor plasma after
      double centrifugation. Hemostatic parameters were analyzed within 1 - 1.5 hour after blood
      sampling, except for FVIII activity measured in platelet - poor plasma stored frozen at -70°C
      until assay.
