  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our main goal is to test a web platform accessible by computers, smartphones and tablets,
      addressed specifically to caregivers and people with mild cognitive deterioration or mild to
      moderate dementia providing added value services based on social networks, adapted
      interventions, clinic strategies and gamification to improve the quality of life of
      caregivers and people living with dementia (dyads) and permitting to leave in the community
      as long as possible.

      To evaluate the platform effectiveness and impact in dementia type disease affected people
      and caregivers a randomized, controlled, parallel, longitudinal is proposed. The objective
      will be to assess during 18 months aspects related to health of individuals (general aspect
      of health, neuropsychological, daily living functionalities, quality of life, treatment
      adherence, comorbidities ...), social aspects (improving dyad relationshipâ€¦) and economics
      (cost-effectiveness of platform utilization), as well as satisfaction degree and usability of
      platform.
