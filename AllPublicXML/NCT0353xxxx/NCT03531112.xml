  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to pilot a 6-month, cognitive-behavioral binge eating
      intervention, Appetite Awareness Training (AAT) to reduce binge eating and prevent weight
      gain for Black women with a BMI &gt; 25 kg/m² and with weekly binge eating episodes.
      Intervention participants will receive a 8-week group AAT intervention, and will also receive
      bluetooth-connected scales for daily weighing. Participants will also receive tailored
      feedback on self-weighing frequency and weight change. We will follow-up with participants at
      six months.

      Aim 1. Using an experimental design, examine the feasibility and acceptability of 6-month AAT
      (N=40) in North Carolina. Forty overweight and obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²) community-based Black
      women will be randomized to the AAT intervention or wait-list control (who will eventually
      receive the intervention). AAT participants will meet weekly for 8 weeks, followed by a
      4-month period of daily weighing and weekly tailored feedback only. The study will examine
      the following: recruitment feasibility, attendance/retention, adherence, satisfaction, and
      barriers to completion.

      Aim 2: At 2 and 6 months, compare changes in (a) binge eating, eating self-efficacy, and
      depressive symptoms and (b) weight, blood pressure, and waist circumference for participants
      in the intervention vs. control group.

      H_1: Participants in the AAT intervention will report less binge and overeating and gain less
      weight than those in the control group at 2 and 6 months.

      Secondary aim: Examine characteristics (e.g., baseline BMI, severity of binge eating,
      frequency of self-weighing) related to change in binge eating and weight.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study will use a randomized clinical trial design. A sample of 40 black women who report at least weekly binge eating episodes will be randomized to 2 arms of a 6-month AAT intervention: AAT or a wait-list control group (delayed intervention group). AAT participants will receive an 8-week AAT program using a group format, and will be provided a smart scale (with bluetooth-connection for automatic data reporting) and instructions to weigh themselves daily. Participants will also be provided with weekly tailored feedback on self-weighing frequency and weight change. Assessments will be conducted at 0, 2, and 6 months.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This measure contains 16 questions that describe both behavioral and emotional manifestations of a binge episode. This scale was specifically developed to assess binge eating severity and associated emotional distress in individuals with overweight and obesity. The total score for the measure ranges from 0-46 points with higher scores indicating greater problems with binge eating and lower scores indicating better outcome.</description>

    <description>The goal of Appetite Awareness Treatment (AAT) is to enable participants to be able to relearn their stomach's hunger signals and begin to obey and monitor functions of satiety. AAT has been successful in helping participants diagnosed with Binge Eating Disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa reduce binge eating, overeating, urges to eat in response to non-appetite stimuli, and prevent weight gain. The AAT intervention includes eight 60-minute group sessions. All sessions involve didactic training, review of self-monitoring of eating episodes, interactive activities, and homework assignments to enable participants to practice learned skills. Participants will be provided a workbook, which will include session content, and self-monitoring forms.</description>
