    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of venetoclax and to see how well
      it works in treating participants with mature T-cell lymphoma that has come back or does not
      respond to treatment. Venetoclax may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of venetoclax, including the dose ramp-up, in adults
      with relapsed or refractory mature T-cell lymphoma. (Safety Lead-in) II. To estimate the
      overall response rate (ORR) of venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory mature
      T-cell lymphoma. (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the complete response rate, duration of response, time to response, overall
      survival and progression free survival of venetoclax in relapsed/refractory mature T-cell
      lymphoma. (Phase 2) II. To further characterize the safety and toxicities of venetoclax in
      relapsed/refractory mature T-cell lymphoma. (Phase 2)

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine changes in Bcl-2 gene expression in pre- and post-treatment tumor samples of
      mature T- cell lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a safety lead-in dose-escalation study, followed by a phase II study.

      Participants receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up periodically for up to 24
      months.

    <description>ORR includes the proportion of patients achieving completion response (CR) or partial response (PR).

    <description>Rates and 95% Clopper-Pearson binomial confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for overall response rate (patients that have confirmed CR or PR), as well as for CR rate.

    <time_frame>At baseline and during course 1 or 2 (each course is 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor tissue samples will be collected from participants for assessment. Summary statistics and plots will be used to describe the pre- and post-treatment gene expression levels and the associated change between the timepoints. Paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to explore the difference in gene expression levels before and after treatment. Data transformation such as log transformation will be considered if appropriate. For the exploratory correlation of these gene expression level/change with response, analyses comparing groups of participants defined by response may be conducted by two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. For the exploratory correlation of these endpoints with survival outcomes, survival analysis techniques such as Log rank test will be used.</description>
