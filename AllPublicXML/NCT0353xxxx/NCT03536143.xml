  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if KB103 (HSV1-COL7) can safely and effectively
      restore functional collagen VII expression in DEB patient skin (primary endpoint) and promote
      healing of DEB patient wounds (secondary endpoint).

      Six subjects are planned for this study: 3 adults and 3 subjects age 5 and older. Adults are
      enrolled first and data from the adults is evaluated for KB103 safety and bioactivity prior
      to administration to children. Subjects are enrolled upon obtaining consent and meeting entry
      criteria. One wound is selected for treatment during this study. This wound will receive
      topical KB103 at Days 0, 2, 28, and 30. Another similar wound will be administered a placebo
      gel. Intact skin will be administered small injections of KB103 for the purpose of mechanism
      of action evaluations. Throughout the study wounds will imaged and intact skin and wounds
      will be biopsied for safety and efficacy analyses. Subjects will be on-trial for
      approximately 4 months, at which point they will be asked to participate in a 5-year
      long-term follow-up study.

    <description>KB103-related adverse events will be monitored throughout the study during onsite visits as well as in adverse event diaries. Adverse events will be grouped into pre-treatment adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events and will be tabulated by preferred terminology and by body system for each study phase. The number of adverse event entries, as well as the number of patients will be reported. Analyses will include tabulation of adverse event type, relationship to KB103, seriousness, and severity of adverse events according to CTCAE
This will include testing for:
Physical exams (including vital signs, skin exams, and wound cultures as needed)
Monitoring for immune reaction to HSV by HSV antibody analysis
Presence of replication competent virus
Monitoring for immune reaction to collagen VII by COL7 antibody analysis</description>
