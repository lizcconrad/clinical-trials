  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Nightly medical application prototype is a potential, non-invasive class I medical
      device. The application has the potential to combine both diagnostic and therapeutic
      procedures for sleep. At home, Nightly measures the user's motion during sleep and then
      records the sleep pattern from the received data. The obtained data are then used for the
      diagnosis of sleep disorders (REM and NREM sleep). Using acoustic and visual stimulation, the
      application has the capability to support the natural process of falling asleep, provide a
      better night's sleep by minimizing sleep deprivation and nightmares, while awakening the user
      at the appropriate moment (during light sleep).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a cohort, single-center, randomized trial. The duration of one participant
      included in the study is three successive nights. Visual analysis of polysomnographic
      recordings taken from the second and third nights will be performed independently by two
      independent, blinded experts. According to the sleep architecture description derived from
      the Nightly application, polysomnographic and actigraphy studies will be assessed using the
      intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC, version &quot;Two-Way Random&quot;. Parameters of the sleep
      architecture will be the average total length of the individual sleep phases (provided with
      standard deviations and coefficients of variability defined as the quotient of standard
      deviation and mean).

    <description>The ICC for distribution of the total duration of standby periods during phases NREM and REM should not be less than 0.6 in the comparative analysis of results provided by the Nightly application and at least one of the visual recordings from polysomnography.</description>

    <description>The ICC value when evaluating the accuracy of recognizing sleep phases and vigilance using the Nightly application and the reference method should be no less than the ICC when comparing actigraphy and the reference method</description>

    <measure>The incidence of arousal and wakening's</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion - after 3rd night of PSG</time_frame>
    <description>The stimulation produced by the Nightly application should not significantly affect the incidence of arousal and wakening's (when compared to analogous conditions without stimulation) with presumed statistical significance (p = 0.05). In other words, the aim of the experiment is to provide evidence that the distribution of arousals and wakening's measured in the study without stimulation is not statistically different from the distribution of the number of events during the Nightly application stimulation session</description>

    <description>The Nightly application will be installed independently on the user's smartphone. Once the user has set up their account and has logged in, they can then perform regular sleep quality assessments. In order to record a measurement, the user must first select a film (first screen) and watch it (second screen), the visualizations and acoustics aid in the process of falling asleep. After the film finishes, the participant places the phone on the corner of the bed, firstly with the screen facing up, and then under his/her pillow. Throughout the night, the application registers sleep phases that will be analyzed later.</description>
