    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if a novel instrument called a Binocular Optical
      Coherence Tomographer (OCT) may resolve many of the issues with the assessment of patients
      with cataract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract is the second leading cause of blindness in western Europe but the leading cause of
      blindness in the developing world and both central and eastern Europe. The most common cause
      of cataract is age. A number of clinical assessments are required to assess the status and
      suitability of each patient for cataract surgery. Currently, these procedures are performed
      in an inefficient manner with the patient having to move to different clinical areas to
      access often large instruments that are costly to both purchase and maintain. Such an
      inefficient patient pathway has been identified as a factor that can markedly increase the
      cost of outpatient appointments, extend waiting times, and crucially lead to a reduction in
      patient satisfaction. A novel instrument that offers a solution to such problems is the
      recently developed Binocular Optical Coherence Tomographer. Binocular-OCT is capable of
      non-invasively imaging the whole-eye in a potentially small, inexpensive and portable device
      and is also capable of capturing images from both eyes in the same session without the need
      for assistance from a trained technician. The Binocular-OCT has the capability to perform the
      functions of many clinical tools in a single instrument. Of particular relevance to the
      assessment of the patient with cataract is the ability to capture high resolution images of
      the anterior eye and crystalline lens with swept-source OCT technology. In this study, the
      proposed advantages of binocular OCT system will be assessed for the management of cataract.

      This research is important, to not only improve cataract assessment and optomise surgical
      outcomes, but it is also vital to establish sensitive measures of lens quality to determine
      tools to aid trails attempting to retard the progression of cataract.
