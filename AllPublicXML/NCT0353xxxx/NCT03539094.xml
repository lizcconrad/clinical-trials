    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial that will test the effects of intermittent fasting (IF)
      in subjects with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). The goal of this clinical trial is to acquire
      objective evidence regarding whether an IF diet has beneficial effects in MS patients.Two
      dietary regimens, IF and western diet, will be compared in a randomized, controlled,
      single-blinded 12 week trial in RRMS patients. This is a single-center study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RRMS patients will be enrolled in a randomized, controlled, single-blinded 12 week trial in
      which IF will be compared to a standard western diet. Patients will be recruited at the John
      L. Trotter MS center and randomly assigned to either a standard western diet or an IF diet
      (1:1). Enrolled subjects will complete a clinical and laboratory assessment before starting
      the diet (baseline), at week 6 and at end of the study (week 12). The primary outcome will be
      leptin at week 12 measured in the peripheral blood. Secondary outcomes will be: 1) peripheral
      blood metabolic profiling; 2) anthropometric (body mass index and waist circumference) and
      total body fat measures; 3) gut microbiota richness and composition.
