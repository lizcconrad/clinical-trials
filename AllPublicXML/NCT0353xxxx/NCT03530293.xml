    <description>The YGTSS is designed to rate the overall severity of motor and phonic tic symptoms across a range of dimensions: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The scale also includes an impairment assessment. The YGTSS total tic score (TTS) will be the primary measure for this study and represents the sum of the 5 subcategories (number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference) for both motor and phonic tics, each scored from 0 to 5, with higher values representing a worsening assessment.</description>

          7. Have a known history of substance dependence, substance (drug) or alcohol abuse

          8. Have a significant risk of suicidal or violent behavior

          9. Have initiated Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (CBIT) during the
