  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant and pervasive public health challenge and is
      associated with mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). Although the perinatal period may be a time of greater risk for experiencing
      IPV, and greater vulnerability to PTSD symptomatology, a lack of research exists pertaining
      to the identification/treatment of IPV-related PTSD symptoms during this period. Utilizing a
      mixed-methods approach, and employing a feminist, intersectional framework, the effectiveness
      of trauma-informed cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) among pregnant survivors of IPV
      experiencing PTSD symptomatology on depression, anxiety, PTSD and maternal-infant attachment
      will be explored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPV is a pervasive public health problem [1], with estimates of approximately 50% of Canadian
      women experiencing IPV at least once during their lifetime [2]. Some studies suggest that the
      perinatal period is a time of higher risk for experiencing IPV [3-4]. Numerous studies have
      linked women's experience of IPV with mental health concerns such as depression, anxiety and
      PTSD [5-8] and rates of PTSD are higher for perinatal women compared to the general
      population [9-10]. Prevalence rates of PTSD among survivors of IPV range from 31-84% [7,11].

      The perinatal period may relate to greater risk for re-triggering of PTSD, given the
      physical/emotional changes, and the intimate/invasive nature of perinatal care. Additionally,
      the medicalized processes involved may contribute to feelings of powerlessness and
      vulnerability, further compromising at-risk women [9]. PTSD can alter psychological
      functioning and is associated with depression [12], disordered eating, substance abuse,
      sexual risk exposures and re-victimization [13] and failure to engage in health promotion
      strategies such as exercise, diet and routine health care [14]; all of which may exacerbate
      obstetrical risk. Furthermore, mental illness and trauma have been associated with infant
      prematurity, low birth weight and childhood developmental delays [15] in addition to adverse
      effects on maternal functioning such as maternal-child attachment [15]. As such, there are
      enormous personal and societal costs associated with PTSD related to IPV for childbearing
      women.

      Recently, a significant gap in the literature was identified pertaining to the identification
      and treatment of IPV-related PTSD of childbearing women [16]. There is a critical need for
      individualized, trauma-informed care to facilitate optimal maternal and child attachment
      outcomes [16]. Fortunately, effective PTSD treatments exist, such as CBT; however, research
      exploring CBT in pregnant populations is lacking [17]. As such, the purpose of this study is
      to explore the effectiveness of CBT for the treatment of IPV-related PTSD among antenatal
      women.
