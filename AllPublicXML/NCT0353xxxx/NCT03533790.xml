    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib together with
      liposomal doxorubicin, etoposide and methylprednisolone (DEP-Ru) as a salvage therapy for
      refractory/relapsed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

    <time_frame>Change from before and 2,4,6 and 8 weeks after initiating DEP-Ru salvage therapy</time_frame>
    <description>A complete response was defined as normalization of all of the quantifiable symptoms and laboratory markers of HLH, including levels of sCD25, ferritin, and triglyceride; hemoglobin; neutrophil counts; platelet counts; and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). A partial response was defined as at least a 25% improvement in 2 or more quantifiable symptoms and laboratory markers as follows: sCD25 response was&gt;1.5-fold decreased; ferritin and triglyceride decreased at least 25%; for patients with an initial neutrophil count of&lt;0.5 ×109/L, a response was defined as an increase by at least 100% to&gt;0.5× 109/L; for patients with a neutrophil count of 0.5 to 2.0 × 109/L, an increase by at least 100% to &gt;2.0 × 109/L was considered a response; and for patients with ALT &gt;400 U/L, response was defined as an ALT decrease of at least 50%.</description>
