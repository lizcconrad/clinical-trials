      Safety of combination of ibrutinib and radiation at various dose levels in unmethylated
      o6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) glioblastoma and study of ibrutinib,
      temozolomide, and radiation combination therapy in methylated MGMT glioblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a number of brain tumor studies including those in NCI consortium that are not
      including temozolomide for increased toxicity with novel agents or other drugs when added to
      temozolomide and radiation. However,if the combination of ibrutinib and radiation in
      unmethylated MGMT glioblastoma patient population is safe at every dose level we can study
      the safety of ibrutinib, radiation and Temozolomide in the methylated patient population.
      Concomitant use of radiation will lead to break down of the blood brain barrier and increase
      ibrutinib delivery to the brain tumor and hence the rationale to combine ibrutinib with
      radiation with or without temozolomide.
