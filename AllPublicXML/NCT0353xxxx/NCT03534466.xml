  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been many studies on the use of running training in older children to improve gait
      development in children with cerebral palsy. The aim of our study was to conduct early
      treadmill training in infants who were highly suspected of cerebral palsy and to follow up on
      their long-term gait development.

    <description>The newborns who received treadmill intervention were stimulated by running 3 times a week for a total of 10 minutes each time (complete in 5 cycles, 2 minutes per cycle, 2 minutes after the completion of one cycle and rest for 2 minutes to start the next cycle). Until the completion and completion of the five cycles). During the remaining four days of each week, other physical rehabilitation training is carried out by the rehabilitator in accordance with the established rehabilitation plan. The stimulation of running lasted from 3 months of corrected gestational age to being able to walk alone for 3 steps or to correct for 18 months.</description>
