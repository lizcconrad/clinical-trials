  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the EarPopper
      device (EP) in the reduction of episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) in children with
      recurrent otitis media. The control arm will be observational. The intervention arm will have
      the EP used.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this randomized controlled trial is that the EP device will be able to
      prophylactically decrease incidence of AOM in children with recurrent AOM. The secondary
      hypothesis is that the EP device will be able to decrease morbidity of AOM and severity of
      AOM in children with recurrent AOM (by measuring quality of life and associated endpoints).

      The EP device is 510(K) regulated (510(K) Number K073401) as a non-surgical, non-drug related
      treatment for middle ear pressure problems such as: Middle ear fluid (Otitis Media with
      Effusion), Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, Temporary hearing loss, Ear pain and pressure caused
      by air travel, Ear fullness caused by colds, allergies and sinusitis.

      This is a randomized, controlled, double blinded study. This is a randomized controlled
      clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of the EarPopper device (EP) in the reduction of
      episodes of acute otitis media (AOM) in children with recurrent otitis media. The control arm
      will be observational.

      Patients will be followed up for a period of one year, and monthly telephone call interviews
      will be conducted.

      All patients will receive the EarPopper device for participation in this trial (for the
      control arm, they will receive the device at the end of their study follow up).

    <masking_description>Since there will be no dummy devices in this trial, we will be unable to blind the patients and physicians to whom is using the EP device. The assessors/data collectors will be blinded for patient follow-up, and the statistician will be blinded. Therefore this will be a double blinded study.</masking_description>

    <measure>Incidence of AOM</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Null Hypothesis: The incidence of AOM is the same between two arms of the study. Description: Definition of AOM will be presence of AOM documented in the clinic notes during the follow-up period. This is a binary data point.
Test: chi-square test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hazard ratio of time to AOM</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Null hypothesis: Hazard ratios between groups is the same. Test: Cox proportional hazards ratio (CPH) model for time-to-event data will be computed. Actuarial data will be displayed as Kaplan Meier curves (KM) and the differences between the curves will be tested with the Log-rank test. Assumptions for proportional hazards will be conducted to ensure that the data obtained fulfills the criteria for the Cox model.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients without AOM and antibiotics use</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Null hypothesis: Proportion is the same between groups. Test: Fisher exact test will be used to compare the proportions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Otitis Media Outcome-22 (OMO-22) form and questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Null hypothesis: Otitis Media Outcome-22 form scores are the same between the two arms of the study.
Description: The Otitis Media Outcome-22 form is a 22-item questionnaire based on a 7-point Likert scale. The questionnaire is divided into physical, emotional, hearing loss, speech, and social symptoms subsets. The Likert range is 0-6, 0 being no problem and 6 being the worst.
The total score is calculated by adding up all the scores from the 22 individual questions. Therefore, the max possible total score is = (6 for each individual item) * (22 items) = 132. Range of total score = 0-132. The higher the total score, the worse the impact of otitis media in the patient.
Test: Significance testing between timepoints will be performed using paired t test statistics for parametric data with equal distributions and the Mann-Whitney rank sum test for nonparametric data.</description>

    <description>All patients in this arm will receive the EarPopper device.
Length of administration: 1 year Dose: Dosing of the EP device will be twice per day, once in the morning and once before bedtime. This is consistent with previous dosing which showed no adverse events and an excellent safety profile. 5, 6
Administration:
Hold nosepiece firmly against nostril opening creating a good, tight seal is crucial. Plug the other nostril closed.
Push button to start the airflow and swallow while the device is running.
Repeat on other nostril. After 5 minutes, repeat steps 1 - 3. This will complete one treatment.
Telephone call survey:
Will be administered monthly by study investigator. Telephone call survey is based on the OMO-22 Form.</description>

    <description>The EP device is 510(K) regulated (510(K) Number K073401) as a non-surgical, non-drug related treatment for middle ear pressure problems. The device is based on the Politzer Maneuver, and works by opening the Eustachian tube by delivering a safe, constant stream of air into the nasal cavity. In clinical studies funded by the National Institutes of Health (Grant#: 5R44DC003613-03), the EarPopper has proven to be effective in reducing chronic middle ear effusions. By regularly aerating the middle ear, we hypothesize that the EarPopper device will be an effective prophylactic measure to reduce incidence of AOM in children with recurrent OM. The device delivers a jet of air pressure from the nozzle at 5.2PSI, at a volume velocity of 1,524mL/min.</description>
