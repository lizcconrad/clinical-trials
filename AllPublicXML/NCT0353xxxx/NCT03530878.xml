  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip dysplasia is a complex problem that exists on a spectrum from mild to severe disease.
      Periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) remains the gold standard for most patients with dysplasia;
      however, the procedure is quite invasive making the decision to proceed in cases of mild
      disease difficult. Hip arthroscopy (HA) is an alternative minimally invasive technique that
      can be used to address mild dysplasia. Nevertheless, HA has less capability for correction
      and in rare instances can exacerbate instability in the dysplastic hip. There is a paucity of
      data examining outcomes between these two treatment strategies for this challenging problem.

      The Bernese periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) remains the gold standard for treatment of
      symptomatic developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in most patients with closed triradiate
      cartilage. First developed by Ganz in 1984, this technique utilizes 4 osteotomies to
      completely mobilize the acetabular fragment 1. Although a technically demanding procedure, it
      allows optimal correction in all planes and maintains integrity of the posterior column,
      enabling early weight bearing and mobilization. Several groups have confirmed the long-term
      efficacy of this joint preservation procedure with a recent report from the inventing
      institution documented impressive survivorship up to 30 years after surgery 2. Treatment with
      PAO is more controversial for mild forms of dysplasia where the lateral center-edge angle
      (LCEA) is 18° - 25° and/or the Tӧnnis angle is 8° - 15°. In these patients the delta
      correction is more limited, thus creating a more unpredictable result with equally invasive
      surgery.
