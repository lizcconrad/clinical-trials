  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pterygium is a wing-shaped, benign tissue growth which forms on the surface of the
      conjunctiva and grows towards the cornea. It can eventually lead to vision impairment. The
      precise cause of pterygium formation is unknown but new blood vessel growth and fibroblastic
      structures are characteristics of the disease. AG-86893 is an eye drop being developed to
      treat hyperemia (redness) and growth of the pterygium.

      Hypothesis

        1. AG-86893 dosed three times daily for 28 consecutive days has an acceptable safety
           profile as measured by the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) compared with
           vehicle

        2. At least 1 concentration of AG-86893 is effective, as measured by the mean change from
           baseline in conjunctival hyperemia (redness), compared with vehicle

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Good health with no clinically significant findings based on the medical history,
