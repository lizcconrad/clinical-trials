  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This national multicenter prospective study is aimed to study the diagnositic performance of
      STE/STQ elastography in liver fibrosis and prognosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B
      infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound liver elasticity measurement and imaging has not only been proposed as an
      alternative to evaluate the severity of chronic liver fibrosis, but also as a mean to
      stratify patients with advanced fibrosis according to risks of occurrence of clinical
      complications of end-stage liver diseases.

      Sound touch elastography (STE）and sound touch quantify (STQ) developed by Mindray Resona 7
      imaging system provide both two-dimensional and point shear-wave elastography of tissue
      elasticity with stronger penetration and easy operation.

      This analysis will study the diagnositic performance of STE/STQ elastography for lver
      fibrosis and the prognostic value of STE/STQ elastography for the prediction of clinical
      complications of chronic liver diseases.

    <measure>Degree of Liver Fibrosis</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 years</time_frame>
    <description>All liver biopsies will be taken for evaluating the degree of liver fibrosis according to the METAVIRE classification. The degree of fibrosis is classified in a 0-4 scale as follows: F0: no fibrosis, F1: portal fibrosis alone, F2: portal fibrosis with rare septa, F3: portal fibrosis with many septa, and F4: cirrhosis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complication rates depending on liver STE/STQ measurement values at baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical complications in our study protocol are: ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices, fundal varices, variceal bleeding, liver failure, HCC and death. The complication rates are regarded as occurrence of clinical complications in patients with chronic hepatitis B.</description>
