  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Expanded Access Program to make lenvatinib available to participants with
      radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer in Brazil. Participants who have no
      other treatment options available, and who, in the opinion and clinical judgment of the
      treating physician, would benefit from treatment with lenvatinib will be enrolled. This is a
      multicenter, open-label program consisting of 2 phases: a 28-day pretreatment phase
      (including screening) and a treatment phase. Treatment will be provided as long as there is a
      clinical benefit based on tumor assessments performed according to the center's standard of
      care and the judgment of the participant's treating physician.

               -  One or more lesions that have substantially increased in size within 12 months of
                  radioiodine therapy, despite demonstration of radioiodine activity at the time of
                  that treatment by pre- or posttreatment scanning

               -  Cumulative activity of radioiodine of greater than 600 millicurie or 22

                  program entry

          -  Participants must have received and failed treatment with sorafenib or have shown
             intolerance to sorafenib for radioiodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.

          -  Blood pressure less than or equal to 150/90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) at screening
             with or without antihypertensive medications and no change in antihypertensive
             medications within 1 week prior to Cycle 1/Day 1

          -  Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 milliliters/minute according to the
             Cockcroft and Gault formula

          -  Adequate bone marrow function:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5 × 10^9 per Liter (L)

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL) (can be
                  corrected by growth factor or transfusion)

               -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100 × 10^9/L

          -  Adequate liver function:

             contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout
             the entire program. If currently abstinent, participants must agree to use a

          -  History of intolerance to or progression on prior treatment with lenvatinib that led
             to the discontinuation of lenvatinib

          -  Any history of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the treating
