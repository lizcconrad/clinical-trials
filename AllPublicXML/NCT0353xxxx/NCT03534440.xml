  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair (TEVAR) surgery will have
      transthoracic echocardiography evaluation of left ventricle diastolic function during the
      perioperative period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing TEVAR surgery are a high risk group of developing perioperative
      cardiovascular complications.

      Left ventricle diastolic dysfunction is common in this group of patients because of the
      prevalence of risk factors: &gt; 60 years old, hypertension, smoking history and diabetes.

      Because of many predisposing factors that occur during the surgery: stress respond, fluid
      shifts, anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation. Deterioration of the diastolic function is
      likely to occur in perioperative period

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate change in left ventricle diastolic function as
      a marker for early detection of a myocardial failure in patients scheduled for an elective
      TEVAR surgery. The examination will be performed preoperatively, shortly after the surgery
      and 24 hours after the surgery.

      Aim: The aim of the study is to evaluate the diastolic function of left ventricle in
      perioperative period after high risk surgery. This may provide a valuable information in
      preoperative risk stratification and postoperative therapy guidance.
