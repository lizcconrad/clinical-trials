  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis is a therapy that filters waste, removes extra fluid and balances electrolytes.
      In hemodialysis, blood is removed from the body and filtered through a man-made membrane
      called a dialyzer, and then the filtered blood is returned to the body. Hemodialysis is
      associated with injury to the heart muscle called myocardial stunning. This may occur for
      many reasons, including removal of fluid during dialysis or low blood pressure. Initial
      ischemia and subsequent white blood cell infiltration into the injured myocardium play a
      critical role in the degree of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury.

      In this study an additional man made membrane (selective cytopheretic device) and tubing will
      be added to the dialysis circuit. The device shifts the circulating white blood cells pool to
      a less inflammatory phenotype. Researchers believe the selective cytopheretic device will
      alter the phenotype of circulating white blood cells which play a role in myocardial
      stunning.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the selective cytopheretic device will
      reduce myocardial stunning events in hemodialysis patients. It will also report the rate of
      adverse events.

    <description>Regional wall motion will be scored using a standard wall motion scoring scheme. (1= normal; 2=hypokinetic; 3= akinetic; 4=dyskinetic). Scores will be tabulated for each of 16 predefined segments and a global wall motion score calculated as the sum of individual scores divided by the number visualized segments.</description>

    <description>The treatment arm (all participants are in this arm) is done in two phases that are described below:
Treatment 1 will be standard hemodialysis (no device).
Treatment 2 will be hemodialysis with the study device. Of importance, this 5 hour session is planned to ensure adequate solute clearance but with only 4 hour high ultrafiltration to achieve the patients dry weight.</description>

    <description>Each patient will receive two hemodialysis treatments while on this study. The first hemodialysis treatment will be standard of care hemodialysis. The second treatment will be the experimental hemodialysis treatment using the Selective cytopheretic device.</description>
