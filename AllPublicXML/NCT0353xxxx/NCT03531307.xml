  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In neurosurgery, brain tumor patients show increased levels of lactate at the beginning of
      surgery. This has been related to malignancy. Ki-67 is a cell proliferation index used as a
      marker of tumor mitotic activity.

      This research aims to describe the correlation between lactate levels and the Ki-67 index in
      patients with brain tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lactate levels are used in the evaluation of perfusion status in critical care. Increases not
      related to a hypoperfusion state are observed in the patient with brain tumors. These
      increases have been related to type and tumor grade. This observation does not fully explain
      the variation within the same tumor grade.

      Ki-67 label index is a marker of mitotic activity that can be used as proliferation index. It
      has been associated with histologic grade and survival rate. Provides a quantitative measure
      of the tumor proliferation status.

      The investigators will perform a retrospective analysis of the clinical charts of patients
      after brain tumor resection. The study will address the relationship between baseline lactate
      levels and the proliferation index found in tissues biopsies.
