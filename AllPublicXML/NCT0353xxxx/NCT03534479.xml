  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance play a key role in the onset and development
      of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. Data in mice models have recently
      demonstrated that circulating immunoglobulins G (IgG) could be involved in the process.
      Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), who are characterized by low
      circulating levels of IgG, might represent an ideal model to clarify the role played in vivo
      in humans by circulating IgG. Polyclonal IgG, obtained from multiple donors, given
      intravenously (IVIgG), are used to treat various immunodeficiencies and autoimmune diseases,
      including CVID. By using this disease and its treatment by IVIgG as a model, aim of the
      current study is to clarify whether IgG affect endothelial function and insulin sensitivity
      in humans in vivo and whether the action of IgG on the endothelium involves a direct
      interaction with the endothelial cells.

    <textblock>
      For this purposes, 24 patients with CVID, receiving the last therapeutic dose of IVIgG
      infusion 5-weeks before the baseline measurements (CVID-IVIgG group), are studied. In all
      subjects, endothelial function is evaluated as flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial
      artery, measured by ultrasonographic technique at baseline and 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after
      IVIgG infusion. FMD is also measured in a group of IVIgG naive CVID patients (number of
      patients recruited depending on availability) and a group of control healthy subjects. The
      latter FMD measurements serve only as a mere reference of pathological or normal values in
      condition of deficiency or normal levels of circulating IgG and are not used for primary
      outcome evaluation. To dissect further the mechanisms of improved endothelial function after
      IVIgG infusion, we investigate the role of human IgG on the production of Nitric Oxide (NO)
      in vitro on Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells (HCAEC) isolated from normal human
      coronary arteries.

    <description>The patients of the CVID-IVIgG, polyclonal IgG infusion, group are studied five weeks from their last therapeutic polyclonal IgG i.v. infusion (IVIgG). On the mornings of day 0, vascular reactivity of the brachial artery, assessed as Flow mediated dilation (FMD), is measured and blood collected for biochemistry (baseline). Immediately after the FMD measurements and the blood collection, the 24 patients receive half dose of IVIgG necessary to treat their disease (400 mg/kg body weight in 10% solution). Twenty-four hours later, before infusing the second half of the dose of the IVIgG, vascular reactivity is again measured and blood collected. Vascular reactivity is again measured 1, 2, and 3 weeks after the first IVIgG infusion.</description>
