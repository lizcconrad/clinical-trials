  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in
      the world. NAFLD is associated with a lot of comorbidity, such as diabetes, metabolic
      syndrome, coronary heart disease and chronic kidney diseases. However, the correlation
      between the NAFLD and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events remains controversial. This study
      is an observational study based on a big retrospective cohort in china to explore the
      prevalence of NAFLD in China, the risk factors associated with NAFLD, as well as whether
      patients with NAFLD are more prone to experience CVDs and CVD events.
