      Background:

      Many smartphone apps intend to help people with addictions. But not enough is known about how
      they should work. Researchers want to study an app that gives people the advice they need,
      just when they need it. This is a JITAI. It stands for Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention. To
      create a good JITAI, researchers need to know what approaches work best at different moments.

      Objective:

      To develop ways to treat addiction with a smartphone app.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-75 who use heroin or other opioids

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in another protocol.

      Participants will visit a Baltimore clinic 3 days a week to give urine and breath samples.

      Some participants will get their treatment at this clinic.

      Participants will answer questions about their personality and stress.

      Participants will randomly be assigned to the JITAI group or a comparison group.

      Participants will have a training session on using the smartphone app. JITAI participants
      will also watch a video about the written messages they ll see in the app.

      Weeks 3-10: participants will carry a smartphone. Four times a day, it will beep and ask
      questions. These will be about the participant s activities and mood. The JITAI group will
      see a short message after. The message is meant to be helpful.

      For the first 16 evenings, JITAI participants will get more information on the phone.

      Answers to the app s questions will be transferred automatically from the smartphone to
      secure computers at the NIH.

      During the last week, participants can choose the kind of messages they see.

      Week 11: participants will return the smartphone and answer questions.

      Weeks 12-16, participants who are getting their medicine from the research clinic will be
      encouraged to transfer to other clinics. Otherwise, they will have their dose slowly reduced
      to zero.

      BACKGROUND: Our research group has made extensive use of ecological momentary assessment
      (EMA) to understand people s daily experiences with opioid craving, use, and lapse. We have
      also administered clinic-based psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), in
      which clients learn to avoid, escape, resolve, or reframe problems (such as stress) that can
      trigger lapses to drug use. CBT contrasts with ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), a
      mindfulness-based approach in which difficult thoughts and feelings are viewed as necessary
      and potentially valuable components of a full life, to be experienced observantly rather than
      resolved or reframed. CBT and ACT can and do coexist in a single treatment plan, but we know
      of no systematic attempt to reconcile their differences. We have also not tried to administer
      either of them on a mobile device.

      OBJECTIVE: To test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI)-a treatment given when and
      where it is needed. Our JITAI will be delivered via smartphone app and will combine elements
      of two widely used treatments for addiction: CBT and ACT. Our goal is not to bring another
      branded app onto the market, but rather to clarify when and for whom the generic components
      of such apps are effective or not. This will include determining when CBT is more helpful
      than ACT and vice versa.

      PARTICIPANT POPULATION: Outpatient adults who are physically dependent on opioids -up to 175
      enrolled (25 for a formative-interview phase, 150 for a trial) for a target of 105 evaluable
      (20 interviewees, 85 trial participants). Target enrollment will include 40% women and 60%
      minorities (mostly African-American). In the trial, some participants will receive
      buprenorphine in our clinic, and others will be receiving buprenorphine or methadone
      elsewhere; this is a procedural matter, not a component of the experimental design.

      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: After a formative-interview phase, the study will be run as a
      microrandomized trial that will also include a conventionally randomized between-groups
      clinical-trial component. In microrandomization, interventions are randomized at the
      momentary level within person; the effect is measured proximally (e.g., 20 minutes later).
      This is a powerful way to assess the effects of different interventions administered in the
      field and to examine strategy-situation fit, i.e., whether interventions are differentially
      effective under specific momentary circumstances. We are powering our study mostly to detect
      (1) any effect of CBT or ACT versus control moments with no intervention given, and (2)
      preferential advantages of CBT over ACT, and vice versa, as a function of the participant s
      ability to control (change, escape) a given situation. The between-groups aspect of the
      design (JITAI group versus EMA-only control group) is needed to demonstrate an effect of our
      JITAI on traditional, distal measures of outcome, such as reductions in opioid use.

      METHODS: In the formative-interview phase, we will conduct interviews with people who use
      opioids and express interest in using a mobile treatment app. We will show interviewees item
      lists, onscreen mockups, and/or functional demos, and we will ask interviewees to comment on
      the app's likely usefulness, its likely pitfalls, and how we could improve it.

      In the clinical trial, participants will be randomized to one of two groups (JITAI vs.
      EMA-only control). During weeks 1-2, all participants will have baseline assessments of
      coping styles and personality, and all JITAI participants will be shown a video introducing
      basic concepts of CBT and ACT. For weeks 3-10 (8 weeks), participants will carry smartphones
      for EMA with or without JITAI. During week 11, participants will be readministered some of
      the assessments from baseline. Participants receiving buprenorphine from us will then be
      offered a dose taper or encouraged to transfer to continued treatment elsewhere. All
      participants will come to our clinic thrice weekly for urine testing throughout
      participation.

      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Proximal effects of CBT and ACT messages in the JITAI group:
      decreases over 20-minute intervals in craving and negative mood, with increases in
      self-efficacy; (2) strategy-situation fit in the JITAI group; (3) group differences in distal
      effects of treatment (week 11 versus week 2) in terms of self-efficacy and coping
      flexibility.

      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Trait predictors of differential responses to CBT and ACT, in
      the JITAI group; (2) group differences in frequency of opioid-positive urine over time; (3)
      time courses of responsiveness to ACT vs. CBT, in the JITAI group; (4) whether the
      intervention types that benefit participants most when pushed by the app are the same ones
      participants choose when subsequently given the opportunity to pull interventions.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Phase 1: Formative interviews.

        The enrollment ceiling is 25 outpatients (to collect evaluable data from 20) who meet these
        criteria: (1) Age 18-75; (2) physical dependence on opioids (by self-report); (3) interest
        in receiving the types of treatment about which we will be conducting interviews.

        Elsewhere, TE). Participants must meet these criteria:

        OBOT participants: (1) Age 18-75; (2) physical dependence on opioids (by positive urine
        and/or frank opioid withdrawal); (3) interest in receiving the types of treatment we are
        testing.

        Treatment Elsewhere (TE) participants: (1) Age 18-75; (2) receiving methadone or
