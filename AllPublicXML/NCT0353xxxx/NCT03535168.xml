      The primary objectives of this study are to:

        -  Investigate the safety and tolerability of ascending repeated oral doses of BAY1902607
           in healthy subjects (Part 1).

        -  Investigate the effect of BAY1902607 on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a sub-therapeutic 1
           mg dose of midazolam (Part 1).

        -  Investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BAY1902607 in patients with
           refractory chronic cough (Part 2).

        Woman without childbearing potential based on surgical treatment at least 6 weeks before
        screening, such as bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy with or without

        1902607) after the last dose. In addition during the study and for at least 31 days after
        the last dose women of child bearing potential are not allowed to donate oocytes.

             ability to taste, as revealed by the taste-disturbance questionnaire during screening
             and the predose procedures

        Part 2:

          -  FEV1(Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second) or FVC(Forced Vital Capacity ) of less than
             60% of predicted normal, at screening

          -  History of upper or lower respiratory tract infection or recent significant change in
             pulmonary status within the 4 weeks before screening

          -  Current smoking habit or history of smoking within the 6 months before the screening
             visit

          -  History of smoking (at any time) for more than 20 pack-years in total (20 cigarettes
