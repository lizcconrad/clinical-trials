      Background:

      Problem drinking affects nearly half the people who drink alcohol. Drinking alcohol affects a
      person s social behavior and brain structure, but researchers don t have a good understanding
      of how. They want to test a technique called neurofeedback to learn more about how to treat
      problem drinking.

      Objectives:

      To study what happens in the brains of people who drink alcohol when they look at pictures of
      social things and of alcohol. To learn if people can control brain activity in a magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and if this helps people with drinking.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 21 65 who have an alcohol use disorder.

      Healthy volunteers ages 21 65

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with

      Physical exam

      Medical history

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Mental health interview

      Questions about their alcohol drinking.

      At each session, participants will have:

      A urine test for drugs and pregnancy. If they test positive, they cannot participate.

      A breath alcohol test and assessment for alcohol withdrawal.

      Participants will complete surveys, talk to researchers about behaviors, and play games.

      Participants will have MRI brain scans. The scanner is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic
      field. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of the scanner for 1 2 hours.

      Participants will do tasks in the scanner:

      They will look at pictures, sometimes of alcohol.

      They will try to hit a goal. Some participants will get feedback during this task. They will
      see how their brain activity changes or how someone else s changes.

      Participants may have follow-up phone questions at least 3 times over about 6 months.

      1. Objective

           The purpose of this protocol is to understand the mechanism whereby neural processes of
           socioemotional cognition associated with alcohol use disorders lead to negative drinking
           consequences. This study is a two-stage procedure to both provide evidence of a response
           modulation deficit associated with socioemotioal processing in individuals with alcohol
           use disorder and investigate how moderating that deficit affects socioemotional
           processing and negative drinking consequences.

        2. Study Population

           Community participants both with and without alcohol use disorder and Inpatients with
           alcohol use disorder.

        3. Design

           In the first stage, participants will undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging
           while looking at socioemotional stimuli and alcohol cues and will pilot a neurofeedback
           training protocol. Personality traits and executive function will also be investigated.
           In the second stage, inpatient participants with alcohol use disorder will be randomly
           assigned to receive active or sham neurofeedback. Participants will undergo two
           functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions including looking at socioemotional
           stimuli and alcohol cues, resting state fMRI, and real time neurofeedback during alcohol
           craving. Ability to inhibit attention to alcohol cues and craving will be assessed prior
           to and following the neurofeedback as well. Participants will be contacted approximately
           1 month, 3 months, and 6 months post release from inpatient treatment to assess
           outcomes.

        4. Outcome

      The primary outcome of this study is to demonstrate that deficits in response modulation in
      the presence of alcohol cues drive socioemotional processing and negative drinking outcomes.
      The mechanism will be demonstrated through less socioemotional neural processing in alcohol
      cued compared to non-alcohol cued conditions, and through evidence that down regulation of
      alcohol cue salience reduces the alcohol cue effect on socioemotional processing.
