  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b randomized, double-blinded, single-center safety and pharmacodynamics
      study of sequential cohort, dose-escalating, repeat-dosing of dapansutrile or placebo (4:1
      ratio) in subjects with stable systolic heart failure (HF) with LVEFâ‰¤40% symptomatic for NYHA
      functional classification II-III who show signs of systemic inflammation (high sensitivity
      plasma C reactive protein [hsCRP] &gt; 2 mg/L). A total of 20 subjects will be enrolled in 2
      sequential cohorts by randomized allocation (8 active and 2 placebo within each cohort).
      Progression of dose escalation will occur following the Day 14 visit of the last subject in
      the first cohort.

      Subjects will be screened and evaluated twice for eligibility: 1) at the time of Screening
      (up to 28 days prior to enrollment); and 2) at the Baseline visit, prior to randomization.
      Following enrollment, Baseline assessments will be conducted and the first dose of
      investigational product (either dapansutrile capsules or placebo capsules) will be
      administered at the clinical site upon completion of all assessment and collection of
      baseline parameters. Subjects will then self-administer investigational product once or twice
      daily, depending on cohort, for up to fourteen (14) consecutive days beginning at the
      Baseline visit and continuing through the planned Day 14 visit. Subjects will return to the
      study clinic on Days 4, 8, 14 and 28 for follow-up visits. Additionally, subjects will be
      contacted for telephone follow-up on Day 42.

Each domain is scored on a 0-100 scale with 100 being better and 0 being worse.
