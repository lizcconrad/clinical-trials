  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to evaluate cabozantinib in combination with durvalumab in previously treated
      patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer and other gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies.
      Finding effective novel therapies after failing the current standard of care chemotherapy
      options for patients with advanced gastric cancer and other GI malignancies is an area or
      great unmet need. We believe that modulating the tumor microenvironment with biologic agents
      like cabozantinib will have synergistic effect when combined with checkpoint-based
      immunotherapeutics like durvalumab in this patient population. This is a phase 1b, open
      label, single arm trial looking at safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy endpoints.
