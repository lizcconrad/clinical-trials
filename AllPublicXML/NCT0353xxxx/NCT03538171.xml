  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized phase III trial is to evaluate the clinical benefit of the
      addition of Entinostat to endocrine therapy (Exemestane) in Chinese patients with
      HR-positive, ER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have previously
      progressed on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI). In addition，the safety, tolerance and
      PK profile are evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies Exemestane and Entinostat to see how well they work
      compared to Exemestane alone in treating Chinese patients with hormone receptor-positive
      breast cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or another place in the body.

      Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Endocrine therapy using Exemestane may
      fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Entinostat may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Previous
      Phase I trial in US breast cancer patients demonstrated a significant anti-tumor effect of
      combined therapy when compared to Exemestane alone.

      It is not yet known whether Exemestane is more effective with or without Entinostat in
      Chinese patients with advanced breast cancer.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed informed consent.

          2. Female, age≥18 years and ≤75 years (For the Open-label study， only the patients with
             natural menopause or surgical ovariectomy are enrolled).

             Note: surgical ovariectomy is defined as bilateral oophorectomy.

          3. The ECOG score is 0-1.

          4. Life expectancy duration ≥12 weeks.

          5. Estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive, human epidermal
             growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) negative.

               1. ER and PR status should be histologically confirmed with staining of ≥ 1% cells.

               2. Positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) should be defined as
                  positive ISH test or immunohistochemical test +++ or ++ with positive ISH
                  amplification test.

               3. Receptor status may be based on any time during treatment prior to study
                  randomization, and from any site (i.e. primary, recurrent, or metastatic).

          6. The patient must have measurable or non-measurable but can only be bone metastasis
             Stage III /locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (in accordance with the
             general evaluation criteria, RECIST Version 1.1).

             For Part 2 the Randomized, double-blind study: the ratio of patients with
             non-measurable lesion (simple bone metastasis) should be ≤ 20%; not required for Part
             1-the Open-label study.

             Notes:

               1. Evaluation of lesions must be performed within 4 weeks prior to the
                  randomization. The radiological examination includes cranial MRI (magnetic
                  resonance imaging), thoracic and abdominal contrast-enhanced CT (computed
                  tomography, the lower limit of abdominal scan must reach anterior superior iliac
                  spine). MRI is optional in patients who are allergic to the contrast substance.
                  It needs to ensure that the lesions should be scanned and evaluated in accordance
                  with the requirement in the general evaluation criteria RECIST version 1.1.

               2. Non-measurable lesion is defined as all the other lesions, including small foci
                  (the maximum diameter&lt;10 mm or minor axis of pathological lymph node ≥10 mm but
                  &lt;15 mm) and unmeasurable foci (meningeal foci, ascites, hydrothorax, pericardial
                  effusion, pelvic effusion, inflammatory breast cancer, carcinomatous lymphangitis
                  of skin or lung, abdominal mass that can't be diagnosed or followed up by
                  radiology, and cystic lesion).

          7. In terms of the treatment of aromatase inhibitors (AI) other than Exemestane, the
             patients must meet at least one of the following conditions:

               1. Advanced tumor, progression of disease at any time point after previous treatment
                  of nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AI).

               2. Adjuvant therapy of nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AI) for advanced tumor
                  (regardless of other endocrine therapy previously), tumor recurrence at or within
                  12 months after the end of treatment.

             Notes:

             In the above two circumstances, any other therapy other than Exemestane (including but
             not limited to fulvestrant, everolimus, palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib and other
             CDK inhibitors) must be competed two weeks prior to the start date of the dose of
             investigational product, i.e., Day 1 (D1) in the Run-in period in open-lable study and
             Day 1 in the 1st cycle (C1D1, Cycle 1 Day 1) in the randomized, double-blind study.

          8. Exemestane is allowed to be used in the following two circumstances:

               1. Within 4 weeks prior to C1D1;

               2. If the disease-free interval is &gt;12 months after discontinuation of Exemestane,
                  Exemestane as previous adjuvant therapy is allowed.

          9. For the patients with metastatic breast cancer who have already received at most one
             chemotherapeutic regimen，the end of chemotherapy should be at least 4 weeks before the
             randomization.

         10. The end of previous radiotherapy should be at least 2 weeks before the randomization,
             and the patient must have recovered from the toxicity of radiotherapy (grade 1 or
             below).

         11. The patient is allowed to receive the medications to regulatebone metabolism, for
             example, bisphosphonates and RANK-L (nuclear factor κB ligand receptor activator,
             e.g., denosumab); the bone metabolism-regulating therapy needs to be initiated 1 week
             prior to the first administration of treatment in the clinical trial, the same drug
             must be used throughout the clinical trial, except that actual clinical situation that
             requires amendment to the therapeutic regimen;

         12. Patients must have adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function one week (7
             days) prior to the Run-in period in open-label study and prior to randomization in
             randomized, double-blind study, which are defined as below:

               1. Haemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 90 g/L;

               2. platelet count ≥ 100×109/L

               3. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5×109/L

               4. Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

               5. Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 ×ULN (upper limit of normal) (≤3 mg/dL in case of Gilbert
                  syndrome);

               6. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5×ULN; ALT
                  and AST ≤5×ULN for liver metastasis.

         13. Open-label study only enroll the patients with natural menopause or surgical
             ovariectomy. Postmenopausal, premenopausal/perimenopausal and menopausal female
             patients can be enrolled in the randomized, double-blind study; patients with
             childbearing potential must agree to use recognized effective methods for
             contraception (including condom containing sperm inactivation, vaginal septum, oral or
             injectable contraceptives, etc.) or abstain from sex life during participation in the
             study and within three months after discontinuation of the treatment.

        Postmenopause is defined as:

          1. Underwent irreversible surgical sterilization such as amputation of uterus, bilateral
             oophorectomy, but not tubal ligation;

          2. Age≥60 years;

          3. Age&lt;60 years, natural menopause≥12 months, blood follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             and estradiol (E2) levels within the postmenopausal range (FSH&gt;40 IU/L and E2&lt;30
             pg/mL) in case of no use of chemotherapy, Tamoxifen, Toremifene or ovariectomy in
             recent one year;

          4. Age &lt;60 years, currently using Tamoxifen or Toremifene, blood follicle stimulating
             hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2) levels within the postmenopausal range (FSH&gt;40 IU/L
             and E2&lt;30 pg/mL).

        Notes:

          1. It will be considered as the premenopausal or perimenopausal state if the above
             criteria on menopause are not met;

          2. The premenopausal/perimenopausal female patients can be enrolled only when they agree
             to use the concomitant drug LHRH agonist Goserelin, and need to start the dose of LHRH
             agonist at least 4 weeks prior to randomization;

          3. If the patient has received other LHRH agonist prior to entry in the study, he/she
             must switch to Goserelin during the study.
