    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) adjusted by duration of subject exposure to Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP)</measure>

    <description>The number of TEAEs adjusted by duration of exposure to study treatment is scaled such that it provides an incidence rate per 100 patient-years. If a subject has multiple events, the time of exposure is calculated to the first occurrence of the Adverse Event (AE) being considered. If a subject has no events, the total time at risk is used.</description>

    <description>The number of SAEs adjusted by duration of exposure to study treatment is scaled such that it provides an incidence rate per 100 patient-years. If a subject has multiple events, the time of exposure is calculated to the first occurrence of the AE being considered. If a subject has no events, the total time at risk is used.</description>
