    <textblock>
      World health organization recommends noise level should be less than 30db in hospital.
      However many analysis conclude to an average of 67dB in the post anesthesia care unit. No
      many studies were reported about noise impact in a post-anesthesia care unit. Only one was
      published by B.Allaouchiche in 2002. However, noise is a complaint reported by patients and
      it could be responsible for physiological and psychological troubles. In this prospective
      study, the main objective is to determine patients' satisfaction in the post anesthesia care
      unit, before and after installation of a noise warning device. Between the two parts, a short
      training about noise consequences on health will be presented to nurses. Improvement off
      anti-noise actions on patient's satisfaction will analysed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the post- anesthesia care unit can be noisy, the effect of noise on patients
      recovering from anesthesia is unknown. Indeed, many studies are achieved in reanimation or
      ICU. That's why this prospective study is about patients' satisfaction after their stay in
      the post-anesthesia care unit. In a first part, noise is just measured with a sound level
      meter and patients are asked about their experience. Before the second part, during few days,
      nurses will be informed about noise consequences on heath. With some precaution, a decrease
      of the sound level in a room (ex: decrease scope alarms, speaking quietly, not slamming the
      drawer, noise warning deviceâ€¦) will be expected. The main objective is to determine the
      patient's satisfaction in the post-anesthesia care unit before and after installation of a
      noise warning device.
