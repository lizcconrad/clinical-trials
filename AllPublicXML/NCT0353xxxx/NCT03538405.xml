  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the short-term effect of both harmonic techniques and supporting
      cushions on muscle tone, range of motion, pain and daily care activities in 22 patients with
      moderate to severe paratonia. The study consisted of two parts, each part was conducted
      during one week. In the first part of the study the short-term effect of supporting cushions
      was examined; in the second part of the study the additional short-term effect of harmonic
      techniques was investigated.
