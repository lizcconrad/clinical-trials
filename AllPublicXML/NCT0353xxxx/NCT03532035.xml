  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and adenovirus (AdV) antiviral activity of multiple
      ascending doses of IV brincidofovir (BCV). Approximately 30 eligible subjects will be
      sequentially enrolled into 1 of 3 planned cohorts. Within each cohort, subjects will be
      randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive IV BCV dosed twice weekly (BIW) (on Days 1, 4, 8, and
      11) or to receive investigator-assigned standard of care (SoC).
