  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test effectiveness of a new treatment program for adolescents and
      young adults within the age of 14-21 suffering from AN (MANTR-a) compared to treatment as
      usual (TAU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious mental illness which leads untreated to aggravation of
      symptomatology and chronification. Among all mental illnesses, AN has the highest mortality
      rate, which is about 5.1 per 1000 people per year. High drop-out rates (up to 40%) or small
      treatment motivation constrains treatment success. Since the onset of AN is mainly in
      adolescence, it is important to start with therapy as early as possible and establish an
      effective single-setting treatment program for this age group to prevent chronification.

      MANTR-a (Maudsley model of anorexia nervosa treatment for adolescents) is an innovative,
      theory-based, tailored treatment program which combines a cognitive behavioural approach with
      motivational interviewing. The main focus of the treatment program is the transformation
      maintaining factors of AN, like personality aspects, pro-anorexic beliefs, emotion regulation
      strategies, thinking styles and obstructive behaviour from caregivers.

      The aim of this study is the examination ot the effectiveness of the MANTR-a treatment
      program for adolescents and young adults. Therefore we compare MANTR-a (intervention group)
      with treatment as usual (control group). Assessments will be conducted before treatment (T0,
      baseline), after six months (T1), after 12 months (T2) and after 18 months (T3, follow-up)
      via questionnaires, interviews and neuropsychological measurements. Process evaluation takes
      place after every session. Each group consists of female adolescents and young adults within
      the age of 14-21 suffering from AN (ICD-10: F50.0, F50.1), resulting in an overall sample
      size of 100.

      The long-term goal of the study is to provide an evidence-based outpatient treatment for
      children and adolescents with AN in order to prevent a chronic course of the disease.

    <description>Patients who are in the MANTR-a group attend the MANTR-a treatment program, which consists of 20 once-weekly therapy sessions. Caregivers can be invited to 2 sessions. After 20 weeks, therapy continues with four monthly booster-sessions. In sum, each patient (whose bodyweight is above the 3rd BMI percentile) can attend 24 therapy sessions. In patients whose bodyweight is below the 3rd BMI percentile treatment will be extended to 30 once-weekly and 4 monthly booster sessions. Besides therapy the patients are in nutritional consultation by a dietician and under regular medical care to monitor the physical health and weight gain.
