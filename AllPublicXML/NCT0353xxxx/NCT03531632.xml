  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of MGD007 when combined with MGA012. Pharmacokinetics (PK),
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), and the anti-tumor activity of the combination of
      MGD007 and MGA012 will also be assessed.

    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, Phase 1b/2, dose escalation and cohort expansion study designed
      to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor
      activity of MGD007 and MGA012, administered in combination by IV infusion, in patients with
      histologically proven, relapsed/refractory metastatic colorectal carcinoma, irrespective of
      the KRAS and MMR status of their tumors.

      The study consists of a Dose Escalation Phase to determine the MTD or Maximum Administered
      Dose (MAD; if no MTD is defined) of the combination, followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase to
      further define the safety and initial antitumor activity of the combination with the doses
      established in the Dose Escalation Phase.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven, relapsed/refractory metastatic colorectal cancer

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria

          -  Participants in the Dose Escalation Phase must have had recurrence, progression or
             intolerance to standard therapy consisting of at least 2 prior standard regimens
             (containing a fluoropyrimidine plus a platinum analogue and/or irinotecan) for
             metastatic disease. Participants in the Cohort Expansion portion will be allowed to
             participate after 1 prior standard regimen. Those who are inappropriate candidates for
             or have refused treatment with these regimens are also eligible. No more than 5 prior
             therapies are permitted.

          -  Availability of sufficient tumor specimens to enable retrospective determination of
             gpA33, CD3, PD-1, and PD-L1 expression

          -  30 participants in the Cohort Expansion portion must have lesions that are accessible
             for paired biopsies with acceptable clinical risk in the judgment of the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases. No concurrent treatment for the
             CNS disease; no progression of CNS metastases on MRI or CT for at least 14 days after
             last day of prior therapy for the CNS metastases; no concurrent leptomeningeal disease
             or cord compression

          -  History of known or suspected autoimmune disease with certain exceptions

          -  Major surgery, systemic anti-neoplastic therapy, or investigational therapy within 4
             weeks

          -  Radiation therapy within 2 weeks

          -  Systemic corticosteroids (≥ 10 mg per day prednisone or equivalent) or other immune
             suppressive drugs within the 14 days

          -  History of Grade 3 or greater drug-related diarrhea/colitis during treatment with
             checkpoint inhibitors including anti-LAG-3, anti-PD-1, anti PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4
             antibodies

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease; gastrointestinal disorders; pulmonary
             compromise; viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infections

          -  History of positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus or history of acquired
             immune deficiency syndrome

          -  History of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or known positive test for hepatitis B
             surface antigen, hepatitis B core antigen, or hepatitis C polymerase chain reaction.
