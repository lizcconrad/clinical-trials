  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test if their intervention, Asthma Self-Management for Adolescents
      (ASMA), an 8-week, high school-based intervention for teenagers, improves asthma in rural
      high school students with uncontrolled asthma when delivered by CHWs. The investigators will
      also test the cost-effectiveness of ASMA, and examine the barriers and facilitators of ASMA's
      widespread implementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma, the most common pediatric chronic illness, has high prevalence and morbidity among
      adolescents. Despite this, there are few interventions for high school students, and none
      have been tested when delivered by Community Health Workers (CHWs) or in rural areas. This
      represents a significant limitation because the CHW model has been shown to be successful in
      clinic- and home-based interventions. Also, rural adolescents with asthma represent a very
      large population. Given the high prevalence of asthma in this group, this oversight is a
      significant public health concern. Cost effectiveness analyses and implementation research
      are also lacking in asthma intervention research. This study addresses these treatment and
      methodological gaps. The investigators developed and established the efficacy of Asthma
      Self-Management for Adolescents (ASMA), an 8-week, high school-based intervention, in urban
      Hispanic and African American adolescents.

    <description>In 3 group sessions and 5 one-on-one sessions, held at school during the school day, students will receive information about asthma and other health topics relevant to adolescents (e.g., nutrition, safety). They will learn to monitor their health by using diaries to record behaviors, such as what they eat, and/or their sleep patterns. Students will be referred to their medical providers for asthma and other health concerns; if they do not have a provider, they are given referrals in their community.</description>

    <description>ASMA, grounded in social cognitive theory and utilizing motivational interviewing techniques, guides adolescents in their transition to being consumers and teaching them to navigate the health system, including overcoming challenges to health care access. Briefly, it consists of three complementary components: (1) an 8- week intervention for students; (2) caregiver education; and (3) education for students' medical providers.</description>
