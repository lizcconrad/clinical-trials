  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of a video-based intensity level demonstration on
      self-reported physical activity in individuals aged between 40 and 75 years. Aim of the video
      demonstration is to achieve a better concordance of physical activity reports with
      accelerometer-based measurements.

      This study examines whether the demonstration of different intensity levels of physical
      activity by video in the context of a tablet PC (personal computer)-based survey can achieve
      a higher degree of concordance between self-reported and accelerometer-measured physical
      activity compared to an assessment without video demonstration. The recruitment of the study
      participants in the age range between 40 and 75 years takes place in a shopping center in the
      city Greifswald in Germany.

      Informed consent consists of: (i) activity recording over 7 days using an accelerometer, (ii)
      completion of standardized questionnaires, (iii) participation in a standardized measurement
      of weight and height as well as waist and hip circumference.

      Participants are asked to wear an accelerometer during the day for a period of 7 days.
      Subsequently, a questionnaire about the frequency, duration and intensity of physical
      activity in the last 7 days will be answered in the DZHK (Deutsches Zentrum für
      Herz-Kreislauf-Forschung)- examination center. Prior to the physical activity assessment the
      study participants are randomly assigned to the study conditions &quot;Video&quot; or &quot;No Video&quot; (ratio
      1:1). Optionally, participants may receive feedback on their physical activity measured by
      accelerometer upon completion of the study.

    <description>Video group: Individuals in this group receive the intervention &quot;Video demonstration of physical activity intensity levels&quot;. They watch a 3-minute-video explaining and visualizing light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity levels of physical activity before completing a tablet PC-supported physical activity assessment at the DZHK-examination center.The video can not be skipped.</description>

    <description>No video group: Individuals in this group do not receive the intervention &quot;Video demonstration of physical activity intensity levels&quot;. They complete a tablet PC-supported physical activity assessment at the DZHK-examination center without receiving a 3-minute-video explaining and visualizing the different intensity levels of physical activity.</description>

    <description>In the video demonstration, an approximately 50 year old male explains 1) light-intensity, 2) moderate-intensity, and 3) vigorous-intensity physical activity referring to differences in heart rate, breathing frequency and capability to talk normally. Simultaneously, on a treadmill he demonstrates the body signs of the three intensity levels. He gives examples and points out that there are individual differences in the intensity evaluation of comparable activities.</description>
