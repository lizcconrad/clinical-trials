  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is a severe and diffuse lung injury
      that is a common cause of admission and mortality in the pediatric intensive care unit
      (PICU). PARDS can be secondary to many different causes, and there are few therapies that
      have been shown beneficial in PARDS. This study seeks to identify important PARDS subtypes
      using gene expression profiling of nasal and bronchial epithelial cells from endotracheally
      intubated control and PARDS subjects.

  <detailed_description>

      Enrolled subjects will have nasal and bronchial brushings collected at days 1, 4, 7, and 14
      of intubation with collection of serum at these same time points. Brushing RNA will be
      processed by microarray for gene expression analysis and compared to previously published
      serum biomarkers (interleukin-8, advanced glycosylation end-product specific receptor, and
      angiopoietin-2) to assess correlation and ability to discriminate PARDS endotypes. Changes in
      gene expression over time will be assessed to define a PARDS recovery gene expression
      signature, and correlation between bronchial and nasal gene expression will be determined.
