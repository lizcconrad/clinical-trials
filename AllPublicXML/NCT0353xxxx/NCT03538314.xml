  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UV1 is a therapeutic cancer vaccine that has been explored in prostate and lung cancers, and
      in combination with ipilimumab in malignant melanoma. This study will explore the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of UV1 administered with GM-CSF in melanoma patients who are also
      receiving pembrolizumab.
