  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the optimal biological dose
      (OBD) as well as the optimal schedule for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC)
      administrations of RO7172508 as monotherapy in participants with locally advanced and/or
      metastatic carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-positive solid tumors who have progressed on
      standard of care (SOC) treatment, are intolerant to SOC, and/or are non-amenable to SOC. This
      study will be conducted in two parts. Part I of the study will consist of an IV single
      participant cohort/multiple-ascending dose-escalation to evaluate the safety of RO7172508.
      Part II is a multiple participant cohort/multiple-ascending dose-escalation to define the MTD
      and/or OBD of RO7172508 administered as single agent, IV and/or SC, in participants with
      tumors that are expressing high as well as moderate/low-CEA. The study will switch from Part
      I to Part II when the maximum planned dose for Part I is reached or the occurrence of a
      RO7172508-related Grade &gt;= 2 adverse event (AE) or dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed,
      whichever comes first. The Sponsor may decide to switch from Part I to Part II in the absence
      of an observed RO7172508-related Grade &gt;= 2 toxicity or prior to maximum planned dose for
      Part I.

    <description>Part I is a multiple-ascending dose-escalation in single participant cohorts. RO7172508 will be administered IV once every 3 weeks (Q3W). The starting dose of RO7172508 will be 65 microgram (mcg) and the maximum dose explored will be 1.6 milligram (mg).</description>

    <description>Multiple ascending dose-escalation of IV-administered RO7172508 in multiple participant cohorts: The starting-dose for the initiation of the IV dose-escalation will be determined by Part I and RO7172508 will be initially given Q3W. Dose-escalation will be undertaken based on safety until determination of the MTD or the highest safe dose if MTD is not reached. If on-target toxicity is reported in the first cycle of treatment, fractionated dosing may be implemented for the first cycle to improve tolerability.</description>

    <description>Multiple ascending dose-escalation of SC-administered RO7172508 in multiple participant cohorts: These will be initiated once the IV schedule has shown RO7172508 preliminary clinical activity or the MTD has been established and is greater than 6 mg. SC dosing will be once a week (QW). The starting-dose for SC administration will be proposed based on the evaluation of the safety and PK data observed following IV administration. Dose escalation in this arm will proceed until the SC MTD/OBD has been determined. If on-target toxicity is reported in the first cycle of treatment, fractionated dosing may be implemented for the first cycle to improve tolerability.</description>

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) 0-1.

          -  All acute toxic effects of any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgical procedure
             must have resolved to Grade &lt;= 1 or returned to baseline except alopecia (any grade)
             and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Adequate hematological, liver, renal, and lung function

          -  For women: agree to remain abstinent or use two contraceptive methods that result in a
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year from screening until 2 months after the last dose of
             RO7172508 and have a negative pregnancy test within one week prior to the first study
             treatment administration

          -  For men: remain abstinent or use contraceptive measures such as a condom plus an
             additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt;1% per

             metastases unless they have been previously treated, are asymptomatic, and have had no
             requirement for steroids or enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants in the last 14 days before
             screening.

          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases that could affect
             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results or contraindicate the use of
             an investigational drug.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, serious cardiac
             arrhythmia that requires treatment with the exceptions of atrial fibrillation and
             paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and history of myocardial infarction within 6
             months of enrollment.

          -  Active or uncontrolled infections.

          -  Known hepatitis B or C

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury &lt; 28 days prior to the first RO7172508
