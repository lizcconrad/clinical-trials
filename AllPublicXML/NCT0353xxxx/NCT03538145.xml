      This study will aim to translate the original RS-14 (English version) into traditional
      Chinese. It will then test the psychometric properties of the newly translated RS-14 to
      examine its factorial structure using both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and CFA.

    <textblock>
      Mental health problems in adolescents reflect a global problem that is becoming more
      prevalent in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, there is a significant change in family structure to
      small nuclear families. Children receive more attention and may even be overprotected by
      parents. Also, parents' great expectations for high academic achievement also contribute to
      the increase in mental health problems among adolescents in Hong Kong. The Polytechnic
      University and the Christian Family Service Centre conducted a mental health survey study of
      12,518 Form 1 to Form 7 pupils from 2011 to 2014. Of the respondents, 62.1% demonstrated
      slight to very serious depression symptoms. Evidence has shown that depressive symptoms
      predict suicidal tendencies among adolescents.

      Resilience effectively prevents the development of mental health problems and is associated
      with positive mental health outcomes in adolescents. Assessing resilience in adolescents is
      therefore crucial for developing a thorough understanding of their responses to stress and
      adversity. The literature reports various instruments used to assess resilience, such as the
      Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and the Resilience Scale (RS). And translated
      version of RS-14 is also developed because of linguistic and cultural differences.

      The proposed study will aim to translate the original RS-14 (English version) into
      traditional Chinese. It will then test the psychometric properties of the newly translated
      RS-14 to examine its factorial structure using both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and
      CFA. Furthermore, using the newly validated RS-14, a survey will be conducted to assess the
      resilience level of a large sample group of Hong Kong Chinese adolescents.

    <description>The RS-14 is a 14-item scale measuring two factors: personal competence, and acceptance of self and life. The item is answered using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree,&quot; with total possible scores ranging from 14 to 98. Higher scores indicate higher levels of resilience.</description>

    <measure>Number of depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects' depressive symptoms will be assessed using the Chinese version of the CES-DC. The CES-DC comprises 20 fully standardized items to evaluate depressive symptoms. All items are evaluated on a four-point self-report scale in relation to their incidence during the last week, which were scored from 0 to 3, with total possible scores ranging from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating greater symptomatology.</description>

    <measure>Levels of self-esteem</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The subjects' self-esteem will be assessed using the Chinese version of the RSES. The RSES is designed to measure the global self-esteem of children and adolescents. The scale comprises 10 items, rated using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4, with total possible scores ranging from 10 to 40. Higher scores indicate higher levels of self-esteem.</description>
