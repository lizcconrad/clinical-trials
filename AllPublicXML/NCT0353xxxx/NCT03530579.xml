      The primary goal of this study is to develop, implement, and test a community health worker
      (CHW) program designed to promote diabetes prevention among Korean and South Asian Americans
      in New York City.

      In particular, the specific aims of this study are:

        1. To utilize community based participatory research (CBPR) methods to expand upon an
           existing campus-community partnership to develop and implement a CHW program among
           Korean and South Asian Americans that promotes diabetes prevention;

        2. To develop, implement, and assess the efficacy of a CHW intervention to promote diabetes
           prevention and access to care among NYC Koreans and South Asians.
