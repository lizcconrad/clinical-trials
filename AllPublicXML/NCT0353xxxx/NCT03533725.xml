      This study will compare data associated with breastfeeding experiences and
      outcomes--specifically, breastfeeding continuation after initiation, exclusivity for 6 months
      of an infant's life, and breastfeeding duration--among 120 subjects recruited late in
      pregnancy and provided peer counseling and education services incorporating mobile health
      (mHealth) tools during a period of at least 6 months post-delivery with the data collected
      from a control group of approximately 120 mothers that did not receive the study
      intervention.

      Approximately 24 women that are experienced in breastfeeding will be recruited to serve in
      the role of breastfeeding peer counselors. These women will assess usability and
      acceptability of mobile health (mHealth) education tools designed following a series of focus
      groups for the project, Breastfeeding Education Support Tool for Baby. The mHealth tools will
      be used during the training and education of the peer counselor subjects. Following
      appropriate modification, some of the mHealth tools will be used with a total of
      approximately 120 women recruited late in pregnancy for initial breastfeeding counseling
      before delivery and the subsequent provision, for at least 6 months post-delivery, of home
      visits for peer counseling and education that integrates use of mHealth tools. Peer
      counselors and research staff will gather data from mothers receiving the intervention about
      breastfeeding experiences and outcomes, including breastfeeding continuation after
      initiation, exclusivity for 6 months of an infant's life, and breastfeeding duration. This
      data will be compared to data obtained through surveys administered to a control group of
      approximately 120 maternal subjects that received standard pre- and post-delivery care but
      not the study intervention of peer counseling and education using mHealth tools.
