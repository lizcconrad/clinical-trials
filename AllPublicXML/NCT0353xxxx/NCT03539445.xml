  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Butylphthalide, as a well-known neuroprotective medication, is a family of compounds
      initially isolated from the seeds of Apium graveolens Linn, of which active ingredient is
      dl-3-N-butylphthalide (dl-NBP). With the significant effects of reducing the cerebral
      ischemic damage and eventually improving patients' clinical outcomes, by the potential
      mechanisms of promoting microcirculation, as well as releasing oxidative stress,
      mitochondrial dysfunction and poststroke inflammation, dl-NBP has been widely applied in
      acute ischemic stroke as an anti-ischemic drug in China since 2002. While with the evolution
      of using iv. recombinant tissue plasminogen activator（rtPA ）and mechanical thrombectomy in
      acute ischemic stroke（AIS）patients, it is still undefined whether combination therapy with
      dl-NBP could enhance the curative effect. The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate
      the recovery of neurological deficits in AIS patients who receive iv-rtPA and/or mechanical
      thrombectomy with the a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide and Sodium Chloride Injection 100ml
      twice/day in the initial 14 days and Butylphthalide Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the
      rest 15th to 90th day therapy versus a 3-month regimen of Butylphthalide Placebo Injection
      100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and followed by Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules
      0.2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo parallel controlled,
      multiple-center trial. A total of approximately 500 patients (Age≥18years) within 6 hours of
      symptom onset of acute ischemic stroke, who shows NIHSS from 4-25 points and intend to be
      treated with iv-rtPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy will be enrolled. Patients fulfilling all
      of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into two
      groups after offering informed content, meanwhile all the use of drugs are before
      intravascular treatment: 1) one group will receive Butylphthalide and Sodium Chloride
      Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days, then take Butylphthalide Soft Capsules 0.2g
      triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy; 2) the other group will receive
      Butylphthalide Placebo Injection 100ml twice/day in the initial 14 days and then take
      Butylphthalide Placebo Soft Capsules 0.2g triple/day for the rest 15th to 90th day therapy.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the recovery of neurological deficits in acute ischemic
      stroke（AIS）patients who take dl-NBP after receiving iv-rtPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy.
      The study consists of four visits including the day of randomization, 2 days after the first
      injection, 14 days when the injection therapy is done, and 30, 60 and 90 days when the oral
      therapy is finished. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test,
      neuro-imaging assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the
      program. The recovery of neurological deficits will be assessed by the difference of the 90
      days NIHSS to the baseline NIHSS. The trial is anticipated to last from June 2018 to June
      2019 with 500 subjects recruited form 15 centers in China. All the related investigative
      organization and individuals will obey the Declaration of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical
      Practice standard. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly monitor safety
      during the study. The trial has been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics
      Committee(EC) in Being Tiantan hospital, Capital Medical University.

    <description>Generic health status evaluated by EQ-5D questionnaire at the end of the therapy，which consists of two components：EuroQol-5-Dimensions Scale（EQ-5D）for health state description and Visual analogue scale（VAS）for self-evaluation. EQ-5D descriptive system covers five dimensions including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three response levels (no problem, some problems, and severe problems). The EQ-5D descriptive system generates 243 health states, each of which was assigned a utility score ranging from -0.59 to 1.00 (full health). While the EQ-5D also includes a 20-cm vertical VAS, with 0 and 100 representing worst and best imaginable health states, respectively. We classified the EQ-VAS scores into four groups, namely&lt;65 (bad), 65 to 79 (fair), 80 to 89 (good), and 90 to 100 (excellent).</description>
