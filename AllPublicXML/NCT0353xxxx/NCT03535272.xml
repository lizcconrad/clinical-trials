  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of prophylactic bismuth subsalicylate
      (BSS) has an effect on the acquisition of travelers' diarrhea (TD) or antimicrobial
      resistance (AMR) genes in fecal samples among international travelers who departed from the
      United States to South East Asia, South Central Asia, or Africa. Our hypotheses will be
      tested using a double-blinded, placebo controlled randomized clinical trial with participants
      from a pre-travel health clinic in the United States.

          3. Plan on leaving for an international trip ≥7 days after their pre-travel consultation

          4. Plan on traveling in country for ≥7 days but ≤21 days (21 day limit due to BSS
             duration recommendations and a lack of data on longer-term BSS use)

          5. Traveling to either South East Asia, South Central Asia, North Africa, or Sub-Saharan
             Africa for at least 7 days of their itinerary

          6. Be willing to complete an initial eligibility screening

          7. Be willing to complete questionnaires and provide biologic specimens (stool) within 7
             days of departure and within 10 days after return

          8. Be willing to refrain from taking any pre-biotics, probiotic, synbiotic and/or herbal
             supplements throughout their study period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are &lt;18 years of age or &gt;69 years of age

          2. Are traveling in country for &lt;7 or &gt;21 days

          3. Have known or suspected contraindications to taking BSS (including, but not limited
             to, travelers with kidney disease, diabetes, gout, a clotting disorder, or an allergy
             to any component of BSS)

          4. Are pregnant (via self-report), are planning to become pregnant, or may become
             pregnant during travel (not actively using contraception and are sexually active), or
             are breastfeeding

          5. Routinely take a medication known to interact with BSS (including, but not limited to,
             insulin, methotrexate, valproic acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
             anticoagulants, or other salicylates)

          6. Have taken an antibiotic in the 30 days before departure

          7. Have taken any medications that may lower one's ability to fight infection (e.g.,
             steroids, monoclonal antibodies, etc.)

          8. Have previous diagnoses of immunocompromising conditions such as HIV/AIDS, complement
             deficiency, immunoglobulin deficiency, or undergoing active chemotherapy or
             participants with chronic gastrointestinal disorders, such as chronic diarrhea,
             irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (i.e., Crohn's disease,
             ulcerative colitis), celiac disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic
             insufficiency, gallbladder disease, or current gastrointestinal cancer

          9. Have had diarrhea anytime in the previous 30 days, have diarrhea at the pre-travel
             consultation, or develop diarrhea before departure

         10. Have been given doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis for the current trip (due to
             possible drug-drug interactions and decreased absorption of the doxycycline)

         11. Have an allergy to any component of the placebo tablets
