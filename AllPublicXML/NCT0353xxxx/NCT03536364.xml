  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of type 2 diabetes commonly follows a pattern of postprandial
      dysregulation followed by fasting hyperglycemia leading to overt type 2 diabetes.
      Approximately 38% of the US adult population is estimated to have pre-diabetes. In a previous
      study of 16 overweight/obese patients with metformin treated type 2 diabetes, using a typical
      Western meal, investigators demonstrated that a food order in which protein and vegetables
      are consumed first, before carbohydrate, results in significant lowering of incremental
      glucose peaks compared to the reverse order. In the present study, investigators seek to
      expand on the previous findings to gain further insight into the impact of food order in
      individuals with pre-diabetes, using a meal with different macronutrient composition, in the
      setting of three meal patterns. The study is designed to be a simple, practical intervention
      that may have very significant clinical implications for prevention of diabetes in a large
      population at increased metabolic risk.
