      Aim The primary aim is to examine whether LI-ESWT and vacuum erectile device (VED) followed
      by manipulation exercises has beneficial effect on PD patients compared to a placebo group.

      Primary Outcome

        -  Peyronie's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)

        -  Visual Analogue Scale score (VAS)

        -  International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IEFF-5)

        -  Penile curve measurements (gold standard) on pictures before and after treatment

        -  Plaque size

      Method This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled with follow-up after 1, 3 and 6 months.

      A total of 50 participants who meets the inclusion criteria's will randomly be assigned to
      I(intervention) or C(control) group based on a randomization list which is retained in a
      sealed envelope. The content of the envelope is only familiar to the Head of the Department
      of Urology to ensure valid randomization.

      All treatment sessions are executed at the outpatient clinic of the department of urology
      department L at Odense University Hospital(OUH). All patients receive treatment with the same
      device a DuolithÂ® SD1 T-Top from Storz Medical. However, when treating patients in the
      control group the handpiece will be covered by a shockwave absorbent material. Settings and
      setup are identical in both groups to make sure that patients are unable to acknowledge which
      treatment is being performed.

    <measure>Change in pain score using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>VAS will be assessed at baseline, and 1,3 and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a subjective pain score ranging from 0-10 whereas 0 means no pain, and 10 being excruciating pain. Patients are asked to rank their average pain for the last 24 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Erectile function using the International Index of Erectile Function 5 (IIEF-5).</measure>
    <time_frame>IIEF-5 will be assessed at baseline, and 1,3 and 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Erectile function is estimated using the IIEF-5 which is a 5 item questionnaire. Based on the patients answers a final score is merged. The definition of erectile dysfunction(ED) is; 5-7 (severe), 8-11(moderate), 12-16(mild-moderate), 17-21(mild) and 22-25 no ED.</description>
