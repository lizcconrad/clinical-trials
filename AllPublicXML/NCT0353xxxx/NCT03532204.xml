  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of radiotherapy in metastatic cancer has historically been limited to palliation
      while metastasectomy or radiofrequency has emerged as playing a major role in disease
      control. Although resection is the standard of care for liver metastasis, 80-90% of patients
      are not resectable at diagnosis in particular because of the presence of oligometastases.
      Factors that favour a truly oligometastatic state include a long latent interval between the
      treatment of the primary tumor and the appearance of metastases.

      Oligometastatic cancer is a very heterogeneous disease with respect to several factors
      including the location of the primary tumor. With the advent of extracranial stereotactic
      body radiation therapy (SBRT), higher biological equivalent doses can be safely delivered in
      3 to 5 fractions, thus potentially ablating all the tissue in the treated area while
      protecting more efficiently the hosting organ and healthy tissues surrounding the tumors.

      In patients with liver oligometastases, in-field local control rates at 2 years range from
      70% to 90% with less than 5% severe grade 3 or higher toxicity rates. Retrospective studies
      indicate that roughly 20% of the patients remain disease-free 2 to 4 years after SBRT.

      For patients treated with SBRT some authors found that half of the patients had either no
      metastatic progression or very little progression in terms of number and site of metastases.
      The patterns of failure after SBRT for oligometastases in one organ showed that 73% of
      patients eventually developed new metastases with higher than 80% occurring as new metastases
      in the same index organ. These findings support the idea of an oligometastatic state in which
      aggressive local therapy could improve progression-free survival (PFS).

      With this phase III study, we sought to evaluate the impact of SBRT on PFS at 2 years in
      patients with synchronous or metachronous liver-only oligometastases from colorectal cancers
      patients after a first line chemotherapy for metastatic disease but not having progressed
      during first line chemotherapy and up to 1 year
