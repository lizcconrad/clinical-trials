  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults are at risk for developing sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss, which
      increased the risk of disabilities, falls, and loss of independence. Many older adults do not
      consume enough protein each day to maintain their muscle mass and this study aims to
      investigate if consumption daily egg white protein supplement can help maintain muscle mass
      and functionality in community-dwelling older adults. Food insecure older adults that attend
      congregate nutrition sites will be targeted.

      The study aims to evaluate the impact of egg white protein supplementation on muscle mass,
      strength, and physical function in older adults with low muscle mass or function. Older
      adults will be recruited from San Antonio, Texas, the least food secure metropolitan area for
      older adults. The project will be conducted entirely at community locations such as
      congregate meal sites, senior activity centers, and housing communities. Researchers will
      conduct recruitment, distribution of supplements and pre and post assessments entirely at
      these sites, which will alleviate the travel of participants to research sites and provide a
      unique opportunity to assess this underserved population. One hundred older adults (≥60yrs
      old) will be randomly assigned to consume a daily supplement of egg white protein or
      isoenergetic carbohydrate for 6 months. Changes in skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and
      physical function will be assessed.

    <description>A short questionnaire will be used to gather information on number of falls recalled over the past 6 months, whether the individual sought medical attention for any of the falls, and whether an injury resulted from any of the falls. The Falls Efficacy Scale is a 10 item scale assessing the confidence level individuals have in performing daily activities without falling. Each item is rated on a scale of 0-10, with 0 signifying no confidence and 10 indicating very confident. Scores are totaled and range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating greater confidence</description>

    <description>The Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument is a validated questionnaire that measures both functional limitations and disability. The function component evaluates self‐reported difficulty in performing 32 physical activities. Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating higher levels of function. Disability component evaluates self‐reported limitations and frequency of limitations in 16 activities. Scores range from 0-100 with higher scores indicating higher levels of function.</description>
