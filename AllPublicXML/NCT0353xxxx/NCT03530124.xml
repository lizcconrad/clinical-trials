  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized open-label clinical trial will be conducted from July 2018 to
      October 2020. Approximately 300 preterm infants will be enrolled across three sites: Duke
      University Medical Center, the University of North Carolina, and Cincinnati Children's
      Hospital Medical Center. Eligible infants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 2-month US
      licensed childhood vaccines (PCV13, DTaP, HBV, IPV an Hib) or no vaccines. After their
      participation in the study, healthcare providers of the infants in the unvaccinated group
      will make decision abut receipt of their 2-month childhood vaccines. The study will collect
      data from the continuous cardiorespiratory and pulse oximetry monitors from randomization to
      48 hours after randomization for infants in the unvaccinated group, and from randomization to
      48 hours after vaccination for infants in the vaccinated group. Infants in both groups will
      be monitored for up to 60 hours for the occurrence of apnea, bradycardia, and oxygen
      desaturation. For infants in the &quot;vaccinated&quot; group, the study will also collect adverse
      events of clinical interest and serious adverse events occurring between the end of the
      48-hour monitoring period and 14 days after vaccination. This information will be collected
      through parental report and review of medical records.
