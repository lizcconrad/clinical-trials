  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I randomized trial assessing the safety of a single vaginal placebo film
      application. In order to develop a vaginal film which can provide extended release of an
      Antiretroviral (ARV), the film polymers and formulation have been altered from the cellulose
      and polyvinyl alcohol films used to deliver dapivirine and tenofovir in previous trials.
      Therefore, the proposed study will evaluate the safety and persistence of these film polymers
      when applied vaginally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study will involve the use of a placebo vaginal film. Investigators want to
      evaluate the safety of the film and understand the acceptability and length of time for the
      film to dissolve once inserted into the vagina. In future studies, this film may have
      medication added to it to deliver medication over an extended period of time (i.e. extended
      release).

      All of the eligible women will be randomized (distributed by chance, like rolling a dice) at
      the Enrollment Visit to one of four study groups. The groups will specify what day Visit 3
      will be performed.

      Participants will have an equal likelihood of being in any one of the four groups. Neither
      the participant nor the study staff can choose the group or can change the group the
      participant has been placed into. Regardless of which group the participant is in she will
      only use the film once during the study. Women in all of the study groups will have the same
      study visit schedule except for the timing of Visit 3.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Women must meet all the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:

          1. Age 18 through 45 years (inclusive) at screening

          2. Able and willing to provide written informed consent to be screened for and to take
             part in the study.

          3. Able and willing to provide adequate locator information

          4. HIV-uninfected based on testing performed by study staff at screening (per algorithm
             in Appendix II)

          5. In general good health as determined by the site clinician

          6. Agree to be sexually abstinent for 48 hours prior to each visit and from Visit 2 to
             seven days after Visit 3

          7. At screening, agrees to abstain from any other intravaginal product or penetration
             (including sex toys, excluding tampons) for 48 hours prior to each visit and between
             Visit 2 and 3.

          8. Willingness to undergo all study-related assessments and follow all study-related
             procedures

          9. At screening and enrollment, agrees not to participate in other research studies
             involving drugs, medical devices, or vaginal products while enrolled in this trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Women who meet any of the following criteria by participant report will be excluded from
        the study. Of note, the study is limited to premenopausal women with an intact uterus
        because the mucosal immune environment differs substantially between pre- and post-
        menopausal women. Therefore, inclusion of post-menopausal women would introduce
        heterogeneity into the population.

          1. Menopause (as defined as amenorrhea for one year or more without an alternative
             etiology)

          2. Hysterectomy

          3. Participant report of any of the following:

               1. Known adverse reaction to any of the study products (ever)

               2. Known adverse reaction to latex (ever)

               3. Non- therapeutic injection drug use in the 12 months prior to Screening

               4. Surgical procedure involving the pelvis in the 90 days prior to enrollment
                  (includes dilation and curettage or evacuation, and cryosurgery; does not include
                  cervical biopsy for evaluation of an abnormal pap smear)

               5. Participation in a drug, spermicide and/or microbicide study in the 30 days prior
                  to enrollment or anticipated participation in an investigational drug study until
                  completion of the study

               6. Currently pregnant or pregnancy within 42 days prior to enrollment

               7. Currently lactating

               8. Use of a diaphragm, NuvaRingÂ®, or spermicide for contraception

               9. Internal vaginal use of any device or product (except tampons) in the 48 hours
                  prior to enrollment

          4. Urogenital infection or suspected infection within 14 days of enrollment including:
             symptomatic candidiasis, trichomonas vaginalis, and symptomatic bacterial vaginosis;
             or cervical infection, including N. gonorrhoeae (GC), C. trachomatis (CT), or
             mucopurulent cervicitis; syphilis; HSV lesions, or other sores (Note: seropositive HSV
             without active lesions will not be excluded); acute pelvic inflammatory disease;
             urinary tract infection; recent exposure to a partner with GC, CT, Trichomonas,
             syphilis, or NGU

          5. Antibiotic or antifungal therapy (vaginal or systemic) within 14 days of enrollment

          6. As determined by the PI, has any significant uncontrolled active or chronic
             cardiovascular, renal, liver, hematologic, neurologic, gastrointestinal, psychiatric,
             endocrine, respiratory, immunologic disorder or infectious disease

          7. Menses-like bleeding at the time of the Enrollment visit* or expected menses-like
             bleeding within 14 days of the Enrollment visit (*Women who have vaginal bleeding at
             the scheduled Enrollment Visit may return at a different date to be re-examined and
             possibly enrolled provided they are still within the screening window and meet all
             criteria.)

          8. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude provision of
             consent, make participation in the study unsafe, complicate interpretation of study
             outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives
