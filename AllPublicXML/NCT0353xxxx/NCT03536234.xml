  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open, randomised, parallel arm phase IIa study. 52 HIV-1 infected patients will be
      randomised (in a 1:1 ratio) to either an active group or a control group. The active group
      will receive the GnRH analogue triptorelin depot monthly at baseline, week 4 and week 8.
      Patients in the active group and in the control group will continue their triple combination
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the study without changes; unless there is rationale for
      change on medical ground. In order to prevent the negative effects of a low testosterone
      level, patients in the active group will be offered to receive a single intramuscular depot
      injection of testosterone approximately 7 days after triptorelin treatment. This depot
      administration will keep the serum testosterone on a normal level until the next triptorelin
      dose. This will be repeated when triptorelin is administered at week 4 and week 8. Total
      study period is 24 weeks.
