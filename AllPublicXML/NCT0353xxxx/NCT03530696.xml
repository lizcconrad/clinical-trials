      This is a randomized phase II study to evaluate if the combination of T-DM1 with palbociclib
      improves progression-free survival compared to single agent T-DM1in patients with metastatic
      HER2 positive breast cancer

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, phase II study of T-DM1 with or without palbociclib in
      the treatment of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to T-DM1 with or without palbociclib.

      Hypotheses: Combination of T-DM1 with palbociclib improves progression free survival compared
      to single agent T-DM1

      Primary objective: Compare progression free survival of the combination arm (T-DM1 with
      palbociclib) to single agent T-DM1

      Secondary objectives i) Compare response rates between both treatment arms ii) Compare
      overall survival between both treatment arms

      Correlative objectives i) Investigate predictive biomarkers of response in blood and archived
      tumor tissue ii) Investigate mechanisms of resistance for palbociclib in blood and tumor
      tissue

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be informed of the investigational nature of the study and all pertinent aspects of
             the trial

          2. Sign and provide written consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines.

          3. ECOG Performance status of 0-2

          4. Recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2 positive is defined per
             ASCO-CAP guidelines)

          5. Adequate cardiac reserve (EF≥50%)

          6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), bilirubin ≤ 2.0,

             therapy. All female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative
