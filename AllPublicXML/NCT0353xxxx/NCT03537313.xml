      Comparison of the effectiveness of povidone-iodine douching and painting for reducing febrile
      morbidity after total abdominal hysterectomy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) is the most common gynecologic operation worldwide. The
      two most common complications after TAH are febrile and infectious morbidities, incidence
      varying between 5 and 50 percent. After performing TAH, vaginal canal must be breached and
      closed to be blind-pouch stump. Routing vaginal douching at the night before and on the
      morning of the surgical date, and intra-operative painting are routinely practiced. However,
      no good quality of evidence base supports the effectiveness of vaginal douching and painting
      in preventing febrile and infectious morbidities after TAH.
