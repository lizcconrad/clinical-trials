    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well indocyanine green lymphangiography works in identifying
      thoracic duct during neck surgery. Diagnostic procedures, such as near infrared fluorescence
      imaging with indocyanine green may help recognize and prevent injury to thoracic duct during
      neck surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Feasibility and optimization of thoracic duct identification using indocyanine green (ICG)
      lymphangiography.

      II. To explore specifically how identifying the thoracic duct (TD) will prevent injury
      intra-operatively.

      III. To understand if a TD injury can be recognized by leakage of fluorescent chyle into the
      operating field.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive indocyanine green solution subcutaneously (SC) and undergo near-infrared
      imaging over 1-2 minutes during their standard of care neck surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for up to 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult patients who are undergoing LEFT modified radical or selective
             (including zone IV) lymph node dissection for any indication; this includes patients
             who have had prior neck surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children, minors, pregnant women, women who are breast feeding, institutionalized
             patients

          -  Known prior allergic reaction to ICG or allergy to iodine

          -  Patients with excessively high anesthesia risks who cannot tolerate the extra time
             under general anesthesia needed to perform this study; the surgeon and
             anesthesiologist will determine this pre-operatively
