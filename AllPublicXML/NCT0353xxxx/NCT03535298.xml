  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DELIVER-MS study seeks to answer the question: Does early treatment with highly effective
      DMT improve the prognosis for people with MS? This is an area of significant controversy and
      no data currently exist to guide treatment choices for patients and clinicians. The study
      results will help guide overall treatment philosophy and will be applicable not only to a
      wide range of existing therapies but also to new therapies, meeting a significant unmet need
      in patient decision making and aiding the decision for medication approval by third parties.

          5. Participants unable to provide informed consent.

          6. Contraindication or inability to undergo MRI with Gd due to metal or metal implants,
             allergy to Gd contrast, claustrophobia, pain, spasticity, or excessive movement
             related to tremor.
