  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ORIOLES is a pre-post study designed to improve quality of opioid prescribing and use after
      discharge for patients undergoing urologic surgery. The study will initially focus on a
      pre-defined cohort of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. After the predefined study
      period and results are obtained, the intervention may be applied to all urologic surgeries
      based on the degree of improvement demonstrated by the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to reduce the amount of opioid analgesia prescribed after urologic
      surgery in the Department of Urology at Johns Hopkins. The initial quality improvement
      initiative will focus on patients undergoing surgery for prostate cancer with radical
      prostatectomy including patients enrolled in IRB00123618/NCT03006562. The pre-intervention
      arm will consist of patients enrolled August 2017 to January 2018. The intervention arm will
      consist of patient enrolled January 2018 to completion of the study.

      The intervention will consist of nurses providing improved education for patients at
      discharge about appropriate use of opioid medication, routes for disposal, and potential side
      effects (using an education sheet). Data on prescriptions written (amount and type of
      mediation) and use of opioid and other pain medication after surgery will be compared before
      and after the quality improvement initiative is started. Outcomes are assessed via 30-day
      phone call follow-up with data on perioperative outcomes, postoperative medication use, and
      symptoms already assessed in IRB00123618/NCT03006562. Providers in the urology department
      will be informed about the average and distribution of usage of post-discharge opioids by
      patients to help reduce/personalize the amount of opioids prescribed at discharge to reduce
      wasted medication entering circulation. The initiative may then be expanded to encompass all
      urologic surgeries in the department.
