      The study aims to determine whether there is a need for preparative fasting prior to
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of fasting orders for imaging and other procedures is common, this seemingly benign
      practice can lead to real harms to patients and poor satisfaction with their care. The
      nothing per os (NPO) order is sometimes used in CT scans because gastrointestinal tract
      contents can interrupt visualization of the intestinal lumen, but more commonly NPO orders
      are are thought to protect all supine patients from aspiration during delivery of intravenous
      contrast. There is limited evidence to support such practice of NPO orders prior to
      contrast-enhanced CT scans. The authors' main objective is to determine if there is a need
      for preparative fasting prior to contrast-enhanced CT scans.

        The participants are inpatients who are undergoing contrast enhanced computed tomography
        that will be divided into two cohorts. The first will need at least 4 hours of fasting
        prior to contrast enhanced computed tomography scans and the second will be allowed to eat
        and drink freely prior to contrast enhanced computed tomography scans
