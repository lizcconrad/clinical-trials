  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the rapid increase of the elderly population in Brazil and the growing impact of
      depression, the third cause of global burden of diseases in the world, the relevance of
      depression prevention and treatment in older people tend to raise in future years. The
      investigators planned to screen 2,700 individuals, 60 years and older, from Basic Health
      Units in the west region of Sao Paulo city, for subsyndromic depressive and / or anxiety
      symptoms. The elderly will be assessed with a standardized psychiatric interview to calculate
      the prevalence of subsyndromic symptoms of depression and / or anxiety and the prevalence of
      depressive and anxiety disorders. Those who do not meet criteria for depressive disorders and
      / or anxiety will be invited to participate in a randomized clinical trial with 2 arms: a
      stepped-care prevention program with physical activity (n = 35) or usual care (n = 35). The
      primary outcome measure will be the cumulative incidence of major depressive disorder, or
      anxiety disorders, after 12 months.

    <description>The assessment of physical activity in the prevention of depression. The intervention program being implemented in this study consists of four steps, lasting three months each:
Step 1 - Watchful waiting Step 2 - Physical Activity Intervention 1 Step 3 - Physical Activity Intervention 2 Step 4 - Referral to primary care In the case of the CES-D scores remain high, participants will receive orientation to discuss with their doctors the need to receive a specific medication.</description>
