                       administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
                       and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient

        intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the initial ECG, and
        the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine
        eligibility.

          -  Diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before first dose of study treatment,

             agent per treating physician's clinical judgment. Subjects with diabetes type I,
