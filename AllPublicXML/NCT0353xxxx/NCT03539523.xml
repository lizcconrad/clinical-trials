  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to investigation of the validity and reliability of the L test in
      children with cerebral palsy. Eighty children with CP with mean age of 11.60±3.85 (56 boys,
      24 girls) were included in the study. ICC ((Intraclass Correlation Coefficient) was used to
      assess interclass, intraclass and test- retest validity of the L test. Two independent
      examiners made L test, for the inter-rater reliability, twice within 1 day for the
      test-retest reliability. The minimal clinical important difference at 95% confidence interval
      intra-class correlation coefficient and standard error of measurements were calculated. The
      correlations of L test with Timed up and Go Test (TUG) and Timed up and Down Stairs Test
      (TUDS) were assessed for concurrent validity.

      Inclusion criteria were: cerebral palsy diagnosis, absence of other diseases that may impact
      gait performance, ambulatory for at least 20 meters, maximum level 2 according to Gross Motor
      Function Classification System. Exclusion criteria were: difficulty in following the
      instructions, severe lower extremity pain that affects mobility, orthopedic surgery within
      the last 12 months, Bothulium toxin A injection for lower extremity within the last 3 months
      and walking with a physical assistance from another person. Informed consents were obtained
      from the parents of the participants for the trial. Assessments were conducted in a special
      training and rehabilitation center where children with cerebral palsy received regular
      treatments.

    <description>The child sat down on a armchair with their back on the backrest, then got up from the chair with the start command, walked the L-shaped 10 meters (3m+7m), turned back, walked the same distance and sat down the chair again. Time lapsed was recorded in seconds</description>
