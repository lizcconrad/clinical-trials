      To assess the efficacy of Taurolock-hep500™ as anticoagulant and antimicrobial catheter lock
      solution in comparison to unfractionated heparin as alock solution to improve performance of
      hemodialysis catheters and quality of hemodialysis .

      In this study,investigators will recruit 60 patients with ESRD on regular hemodialysis from
      hemodialysis units in Ain-Shams university Hospitals, Patients will be recruited to study at
      the time of catheter insertion.

      They will be randomized into 2 groups. Group 1; 30 Patients will receive unfractionated
      heparin (5000i.u/ml) after hemodialysis sessions (control group).

      Group 2; 30 Patients will receive Taurolock-hep500™ after hemodialysis sessions. All patients
      will be subjected to;

        1. Full history including history of ESRD and dialysis initiation.

        2. Clinical examination. Aseptic technique will be used in handling with catheters
           including (sterile gloves, antiseptic solution in dealing with covers and caps topical
           antibiotics spray and ointment) catheter will be instilled by 10 ml of normal saline in
           both opening followed by either taurolock hep 500™ or unfractionated heparin 5000 iu/ml.

      Patients will be followed up for one month and will be monitored for clinical symptoms and
      signs of catheter related bacteremia (fever ,rigors, hypotension, sweating ) on the
      hemodialysis sessions . Also catheter performance will be assessed using the following
      parameters;

        1. Blood flow rate measured by hemodialysis machine blood pump in (ml/min).

        2. Dialysis quality by URR( urea reduction ratio) is a dimensionless number used to
           quantify dialysis treatment adequacy by calculating difference between urea level before
           and after hemodialysis session (average of 4 sessions , 1 per each week).

        3. CBC ,markers of inflammation (CRP) baseline and at time of appearance of symptoms and
           signs of bacteremia in both groups in addition to (IL6) measured by Elisa technique
           baseline and at time of appearance of symptoms and signs .
