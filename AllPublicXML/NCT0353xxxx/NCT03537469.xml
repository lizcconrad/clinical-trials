  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-depolarizing magnetic fields, like Low Frequency-Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (LF-PEMFs)
      have shown the ability to modulate living structures, principally by influencing synaptic
      activity and ion channels on cellular membranes. Recently, the CTU Mega 20 device was
      presented as a molecular accelerator, using energy up to 200 Joules and providing high-power
      (2 Tesla) pulsating fields with a water-repulsive (diamagnetic) action and tissue
      biostimulation. The investigators tested the hypothesis that LF-PEMFs could modulate
      long-term corticospinal excitability in healthy brains by applying CTU Mega 20Â®. Ten healthy
      subjects without known neurological and/or psychiatric diseases entered the study. A
      randomized double-blind sham-controlled crossover design was employed, recording TMS
      parameters (amplitude variation of the motor evoked potential as index of cortical
      excitability perturbations of the motor system) before (pre) and after (post +0, +15, +30
      min) a single CTU Mega 20 session on the corresponding primary right-hand motor area, using a
      real (magnetic field = 2 Tesla; intensity = 90 J; impulse frequency = 7Hz; duration = 15
      minutes) or sham device. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA with TIME (pre, post +0, +15, +30
      min) and TREATMENT (real vs sham stimulation) as within-subjects factor was applied.

    <description>A single-session of real CTU Mega 20 on the corresponding primary right-hand motor area, using the real (magnetic field = 2 Tesla; intensity = 90 J; frequency of impulses = 7Hz; duration = 15 minutes) CTU Mega 20 device.

    <description>A single-session of sham CTU Mega 20 on the corresponding primary right-hand motor area (magnetic field = 0 Tesla; intensity = 0 J; frequency of impulses = 7Hz; duration = 15 minutes).
