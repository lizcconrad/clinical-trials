  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency in childhood leads to poor bone growth and muscle weakness, yet it is
      unknown if the amount of vitamin D a woman consumes during her pregnancy affects her child's
      bone and muscle development. In collaboration with researchers in Bangladesh, the
      investigators recently completed a study of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in
      which women were assigned to 1 of 5 groups containing vitamin D or placebo (no vitamin D).
      The investigators now aim to conduct a follow-up study of a sample of 250 3-4 year old
      children born to these mothers to test the possible effects of vitamin D supplementation in
      pregnancy on children's bones, their body composition and the strength of their muscles.

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is a modifiable regulator of bone mineral metabolism and muscle function; yet
      little is known about the role of in utero vitamin D exposure on bone mineral accrual and
      muscle development in early childhood. Observational findings suggest associations between
      prenatal vitamin D status and infant bone, lean and fat mass and muscle function, but data
      from intervention trials is either unavailable or limited to early infancy. The investigators
      of the proposed study have previously shown that prenatal vitamin D supplementation safely
      improves maternal-fetal vitamin D status and perinatal calcium metabolism. Given the current
      interest in the potential role of vitamin D in perinatal health, adequately powered and
      well-designed randomized trials are required to investigate the effect of maternal vitamin D
      supplementation on offspring musculoskeletal health and body composition.

      The investigators recently conducted the Maternal Vitamin D for Infant Growth (MDIG) trial
      (NCT01924013), a randomized placebo-controlled dose-ranging trial of vitamin D
      supplementation in pregnancy and lactation in Bangladesh, where severe vitamin D deficiency
      is common. Women at 17-24 weeks' gestation were randomized to 1 of 5 dose groups (range
      0-28,000 IU/wk) until 6 months postpartum. Enrolment (n=1300) was completed in September
      2015, and all infants were delivered by February 2016. The MDIG trial was primarily designed
      to determine the effect of maternal vitamin D on infant length at 12 months of age, with
      follow-up continuing until infants reach 24 months of age (to be completed in March 2018).

      In the proposed observational follow-up study, the investigators will leverage the design and
      infrastructure of the MDIG trial to investigate effects of vitamin D on early childhood bone
      and muscle outcomes in a sample of MDIG participants at 3-4 years of age (n=250). The primary
      objective is to quantify the effects of prenatal vitamin D supplementation versus placebo on
      offspring bone mineral content and density. Secondary objectives are to examine the effect of
      vitamin D on lean and fat mass, and muscle function. Bone, lean and fat mass will be measured
      using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Muscle strength (handgrip test), anthropometry,
      dietary intake and vitamin D status will also be assessed, in addition to biomarkers of bone
      turnover that may affect musculoskeletal health in young children.

      The proposed follow-up study of a large randomized trial will contribute new evidence
      regarding the effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on musculoskeletal health
      in childhood.
