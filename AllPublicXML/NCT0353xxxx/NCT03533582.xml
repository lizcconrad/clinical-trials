      This partially randomized phase II/III trial studies how well cisplatin and combination
      chemotherapy works in treating children and young adults with hepatoblastoma or liver cancer
      after surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, fluorouracil,
      vincristine sulfate, carboplatin, etoposide, irinotecan, sorafenib, gemcitabine and
      oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving combination
      chemotherapy after surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To reduce therapy associated toxicity for patients with non-metastatic hepatoblastoma (HB)
      and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without adversely affecting long term outcomes.

      II. To determine the event-free survival (EFS) in patients with HB whose tumor is completely
      resected at diagnosis and either receive no adjuvant chemotherapy (completely resected well
      differentiated fetal histology HB) or 2 cycles of standard dose cisplatin monotherapy
      (completely resected non-well differentiated fetal histology HB ? 100 mg/m^2/cycle given 3
      weeks apart). (Group A) III. To demonstrate that 4 to 6 cycles of interval compressed lower
      dose cisplatin monotherapy (80 mg/m^2/cycle; 320 480 mg/m^2 total) is adequate for low risk
      HB. (Group B) IV. In patients who are resected after 2 cycles of cisplatin monotherapy, to
      compare EFS following a randomized comparison of 2 versus 4 post-operative cycles of
      cisplatin monotherapy. (Group B) V. In patients whose tumors are deemed unresectable after 2
      cycles of cisplatin monotherapy, to determine the proportion of tumors rendered completely
      resectable by an additional 2 or 4 cycles of chemotherapy. (Group B) VI. To compare in a
      randomized fashion, EFS in patients with intermediate risk HB treated with 6 cycles of
      cisplatin/5-fluorouracil/vincristine/doxorubicin (C5VD) chemotherapy versus 6 cycles of
      interval compressed cisplatin monotherapy (100 mg/m^2/dose). (Group C) VII. To determine the
      EFS in patients with HCC whose tumor is completely resected at diagnosis who receive no
      adjuvant chemotherapy (completely resected HCC arising in the context of underlying liver
      disease) or 4 cycles of cisplatin/doxorubicin (PLADO) (completely resected de novo HCC).
      (Group E) VIII. To improve the EFS of patients with high risk HB by treating them with
      interval compressed cisplatin and doxorubicin based induction regimen followed by
      response-adapted consolidation therapy. (Group D) IX. In patients whose metastatic disease
      resolves with the administration of Societe Internationale d?Oncologie Pediatrique (SIOPEL) 4
      Induction therapy, to determine if the promising pilot results observed in SIOPEL 4 can be
      validated in a large international study. (Group D1) X. In patients whose metastatic disease
      does not resolve with the administration of SIOPEL 4 Induction therapy, to determine in a
      randomized comparison which post induction treatment (irinotecan and vincristine sulfate
      [vincristine] alternating with carboplatin and doxorubicin or carboplatin and etoposide
      alternating with carboplatin and doxorubicin) results in superior outcomes. (Group D Arm CE &amp;
      Arm VI) XI. In patients with unresectable/metastatic HCC at diagnosis, to determine whether
      the addition of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX + sorafenib) to a cisplatin, doxorubicin
      and sorafenib backbone improves chemotherapy response, resectability and survival. (Group F)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Molecular characterization of HB tumors to validate newly identified molecular and
      immunohistochemical biomarkers correlating with known clinical prognostic factors and
      outcome. (Group A-D) II. To determine whether the molecular profile of pediatric HCC overlaps
      with HB or adult-type HCC while correlating biologic features with treatment response and
      survival. (Group E and F) III. To define the prognostic relevance in HB of a ?small cell
      undifferentiated? tumor component and percentage of tumor necrosis in post chemotherapy
      specimens.

      IV. To determine the concordance of Pretreatment Extent of Disease (PRETEXT) and
      Post-treatment Extent of disease (POSTTEXT) based surgical guidelines and the surgical
      intervention performed.

      V. To determine which system (Children's Oncology Group [COG] PRETEXT, SIOPEL PRETEXT, or a
      new hybrid definition of PRETEXT) of the annotation factors for V, P, E, F and R provides the
      best prognostic information for determining response to chemotherapy, guiding risk based
      therapy, predicting surgical resectability, and EFS.

      VI. To determine the concordance between institutional and expert panel review assessment of
      PRETEXT and POSTTEXT stage in an international cooperative group setting.

      VII. To assess clinical characteristics, basic chemotherapy and surgical treatment details,
      biological characteristics at baseline and recurrence (when available) and outcome of
      patients with refractory or relapsed hepatoblastoma after initial treatment.

      VIII. To identify novel biomarkers of renal toxicity (urine NGAL, cystatin C and Kim1) from
      cisplatin therapy when given according to the regimens used on this study, and to correlate
      such biomarkers with pharmacogenomics, other associated toxicities, and outcomes.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the Childhood Hepatic tumor International Consortium (CHIC) hepatoblastoma
      risk stratification analysis of very low risk (Group A), low risk (Group B), intermediate
      risk (Group C) and high risk (Group D) groups stratifies patients allowing appropriate
      utilization of varying intensity chemotherapy regimens and surgical resection strategies.

      II. To define the prognostic relevance of a positive microscopic margin in Group A-D resected
      HB specimens.

      III. To define the frequency of histologically detectable multifocal lesions in liver
      explants and resected specimens in which multifocal disease was detected at diagnosis and
      disappeared on cross sectional imaging following treatment with chemotherapy.

      IV. To determine the prognostic impact on EFS and overall survival (OS) of biopsy technique
      in liver tumors unresectable at diagnosis.

      V. To determine the frequency of intraoperative complications from surgery for local control
      (conventional resection or liver transplantation) and its impact on EFS.

      VI. To determine the 3-year EFS and OS of HB patients who undergo liver transplantation
      versus (vs) extreme resection in Group C and D patients.

      VII. To determine the 3-year EFS and OS of Group D patients who undergo pulmonary
      metastatectomy.

      VIII. To determine the 3-year EFS and OS of patients who undergo liver transplantation for
      HCC.

      IX. To determine the frequency of relapse in non-metastatic HCC in children treated by liver
      transplantation versus conventional resection.

      X. To assess the pharmacogenomics (PG) related to cisplatin therapy in pediatric and
      adolescent liver tumor patients and correlate PG with Boston Grading Scale for ototoxicity.

             Group (ECOG) scores of 0, 1, or 2; use Karnofsky for patients &gt; 16 years of age and
             Lansky for patients =&lt; 16 years of age; patients who are unable to walk because of
             paralysis, but who are up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the
             purpose of assessing the performance score

          -  Patients must be newly diagnosed with histologically-proven primary pediatric hepatic
             malignancies including hepatoblastoma or hepatocellular carcinoma, except as noted
             below; note that rapid central pathology review is required in some cases; please
             note: all patients with histology as assessed by the institutional pathologist
             consistent with pure small cell undifferentiated (SCU) HB will be required to have
             testing for INI1/SMARCB1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) according to the practices at
             the institution

          -  Patients with histology consistent with pure SCU must have positive INI1/SMARCB1
             staining

          -  In emergency situations when a patient meets all other eligibility criteria and has
             had baseline required observations, but is too ill to undergo a biopsy safely, the
             patient may be enrolled without a biopsy

               -  Clinical situations in which emergent treatment may be indicated include, but are
                  not limited to, the following circumstances:

                    -  Anatomic or mechanical compromise of critical organ function by tumor (e.g.,
                       respiratory distress/failure, abdominal compartment syndrome, urinary
                       obstruction, etc.)

                    -  Uncorrectable coagulopathy

               -  For a patient to maintain eligibility for AHEP1531 when emergent treatment is
                  given, the following must occur:

                    -  The patient must have a clinical diagnosis of hepatoblastoma, including an
                       elevated alphafetoprotein (AFP), and must meet all AHEP1531 eligibility
                       criteria at the time of emergent treatment

                    -  Patient must be enrolled on AHEP1531 prior to initiating protocol therapy; a
                       patient will be ineligible if any chemotherapy is administered prior to
                       AHEP1531 enrollment

               -  Note: If the patient receives AHEP1531 chemotherapy emergently PRIOR to
                  undergoing a diagnostic biopsy, pathologic review of material obtained in the
                  future during either biopsy or surgical resection must either confirm the
                  diagnosis of hepatoblastoma or not reveal another pathological diagnosis to be
                  included in the analysis of the study aims

          -  Patients may have had surgical resection of the hepatic malignancy prior to
             enrollment; all other anti-cancer therapy for the current liver lesion is prohibited

          -  Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;= 70
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 or

             monoxide [DLCO]) if there is clinical indication for determination (e.g. dyspnea at
             rest, known requirement for supplemental oxygen); for patients who do not have
             respiratory symptoms or requirement for supplemental oxygen, pulmonary function tests
             (PFTs) are NOT required

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent
