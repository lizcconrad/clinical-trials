    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this protocol is to evaluate if Dextromethorphan (DXM) can suppress
      symptoms associated with Fibromyalgia (FM). DXM is used in multiple over the counter cough
      suppressants. The investigators will be observing the effects of DXM on daily self-reported
      pain measures and activity within people who have fibromyalgia. If one of these medications
      help the symptoms of FM, it will give information about what is wrong in people with FM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic widespread pain syndrome. Those impacted by this syndrome
      experience pain, fatigue, sleep issues, cognitive impairment, headaches, among other
      symptoms. Fibromyalgia (FM) affects approximately 5% of all women in the United States.
      Current treatment options are limited because its pathophysiology is not currently
      understood. Many patients suffer with decreased quality of life and loss of employment due to
      this illness.

      The precise mechanism of Fibromyalgia, is not yet understood and there is no targeted
      treatment for the condition. A way to treat the symptoms of FM is paramount as other research
      concurrently attempts to understand the mechanisms behind the disease. Dr. Younger's current
      study includes taking daily blood draws for 25 consecutive days in an attempt to identify the
      underlying biomarker for Fibromyalgia.

      DXM has been used in previous research and has been shown to suppress pain symptoms. One
      research study administered low dose DXM to rats with spinal cord injuries and demonstrated
      that DXM has a favorable impact on neuropathic pain.

      Previous literature has suggested that dextromethorphan at 0.1mg/kg intraperitoneally reduces
      central inflammation. This dosage would translate to approximately 8mg for an average U.S.
      female weighing 166 pounds. Our dosage of 20mg has been adjusted up to account for rapid
      first-pass metabolism when administered orally.

      In this study, the investigator will be administering no more than a daily dose of DXM (20
      mg) to observe the possible suppression of symptoms in Fibromyalgia.
