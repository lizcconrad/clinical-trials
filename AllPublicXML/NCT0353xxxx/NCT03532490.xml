  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no treatments to specifically target asthma in obese adults. This pilot
      study is being conducted to investigate how effective roflumilast is in treating asthma in
      participants that have a higher BMI. Roflumilast can induce weight loss, which may lead to
      improved asthma control.

      The primary objective of TRIM is to perform a pilot placebo-controlled trial of roflumilast
      for the treatment of poorly controlled obese asthmatics.

      TRIM is a 24 week, randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled trial that will enroll 38
      participants.

      This study will be take place in six centers of the American Lung Association- Airways
      Clinical Research Centers (ALA-ACRC). The centers include: Northwestern University Feinberg
      School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine, Duke University, University of
      Arizona, University of Vermont, and the University of California at San Diego. Johns Hopkins
      University will be the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for the trial.
