  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to conduct a prospective, multicenter cohort study over
      four months to compare the cost of standard of allopathic care (control group, N=90) versus
      standard of care plus osteopathic manipulative treatment (experimental group, N=90) in a
      cohort of 180 consecutive patients seeking treatment for chronic low back pain at three
      osteopathic clinics and three allopathic medical clinics (offering only standard care)
      located in three different regions of the United States.

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The cost data will be collected from the electronic medical record of each patient enrolled in the study. Because the costs for comparable treatments vary with respect to different socioeconomic and geographic regions in the United States, the mean total-healthcare costs per patient will be calculated based on codes for 2018 Medicare fee schedules for each clinic listed in the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) for office visits, medications, OMT, and referrals.</description>

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Various pain medications that might have been prescribed will be calculated and compared to morphine equivalents at admission to the study and after four months at each of the treatment centers.</description>

        This prospective, multicenter, observational study will follow two groups of patients over
        four months. The first (experimental) group will be 90 new patients seeking treatment for
        chronic back pain at three osteopathic clinics. The experimental group will receive
        standard of care plus osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) for low back pain.

        The second (control) group will be 90 new patients who will receive only standard care
        without OMT for chronic low back pain as delivered at a local pain clinic.
