  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious medical illness associated with significant
      suicidal risk and marked disability. Despite the availability of numerous treatments,
      achievement of consistent and favorable long-term outcomes remains challenging.

      This study will assess the safety, efficacy and tolerability of brexpiprazole as adjunctive
      therapy to protocol-specific open-label antidepressant therapy.
