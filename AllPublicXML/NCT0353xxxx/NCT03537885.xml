      The goal of this study is to monitor the brain using electroencephalography (EEG) while
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is being administered, as a potential pathway
      to determine neurophysiological markers capable of forecasting the intensity of a subject's
      response to tDCS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that has
      been the subject of many recent investigations. There is a growing body of evidence to
      suggest that tDCS can enhance the efficacy of various therapies. However, progress in the
      field is slow: many studies suffer from reproducibility issues, or highly variable results,
      including stroke rehabilitation. It is feasible that much of the variance in experimental
      results can be explained by an inability to quantitatively track individual responses to tDCS
      in real-time, and personalize stimulation parameters for maximum effect.

      Monitoring the brain via EEG while tDCS is being administered is a potential pathway to
      determine neurophysiological markers capable of forecasting the intensity of a subject's
      response to tDCS. This research has not previously been attempted due to technical
      difficulties- namely, the electromagnetic interference that is associated with tDCS degrades
      EEG signal quality. Recent advances in electrode and amplification technology have made it
      possible to make EEG recordings simultaneously with tDCS.

      Our study will attempt to determine whether specific EEG signatures can indicate the
      magnitude of a tDCS response. Subjects will receive either real or sham anodal tDCS to the
      hand representation of their left primary motor cortex.

      The efficacy of the tDCS protocol will be quantitatively determined using transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) to generate a motor-evoked potential (MEP) in the hand pre- and
      post-tDCS. Additionally, prior to, during, and following the tDCS protocol, we will record
      EEG event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to a finger-tapping (motor) task.

      We aim to draw a correlation between the magnitude of MEP changes and pre- and post-tDCS and
      changes in recorded ERPs before, during and after tDCS in order to quantify the response to
      tDCS over the motor cortex. If we can use EEG metrics to gauge efficacy in real-time during
      tDCS administration, we will gain significant insight into how to appropriately and
      quantitatively individualize tDCS dosage parameters for each patient.
