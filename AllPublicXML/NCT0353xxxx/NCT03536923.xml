    <textblock>
      This open-label proof-of-concept study is designed to evaluate the impact of the leva digital
      incontinence system on the treatment of stress and mixed urinary incontinence in women over a
      six week period. Subjects will participate in a 2.5 minute exercise program twice daily
      (performed at a clinic with therapist assistance 5x weekly, and at home once daily on
      weekdays and twice daily on weekends. Validated surveys (UDI-6, IIQ-7 and PGI-I) will be used
      to evaluate symptom relief. A battery of pelvic floor muscle exercises will be performed
      weekly to evaluate progress in muscle strengthening.
