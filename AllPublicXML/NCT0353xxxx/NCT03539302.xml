    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts (Part A and Part B). Part A has an open-label, randomized,
      multi center design to evaluate the feasibility of administration of inhaled flecainide in
      two dosing regimens. Part B has a randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled, multi center design to evaluate the safety (including tolerability) and
      efficacy of inhaled flecainide compared to matched placebo in two dosing regimens.

      Subjects eligible to participate in the study must provide written informed consent (IC)
      before randomization or any study- specific procedures.

      The study consists of 2 parts (PART A and PART B) as described below:

      PART A: has an open-label, randomized, multicenter design to evaluate the feasibility of
      administration of inhaled flecainide in two dosing regimens.

      Subjects are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to a single (N = 10) or repeat (N = 10) dose regimen.

      PART B: has a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      design to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of inhaled flecainide against
      matched placebo in the two dosing regimens.

      Subjects are randomized at a 1:1 ratio to a single or repeat dose regimen. Within each dose
      regimen, subjects are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either inhaled flecainide or matched
      placebo. Randomization yields the following 4 groups:

        -  Single dose inhaled flecainide (N = 30)

        -  Single dose matched placebo (N = 15)

        -  Repeat dose inhaled flecainide (N = 30)

        -  Repeat dose matched placebo (N = 15)

      Randomization, for both Part A and Part B, is stratified by duration of the presenting AF
      episode (≥ 1 h up to ≤ 24 hours; &gt; 24h up to ≤ 48h).

      Once study regimen is allocated, the subject will self-administer the study treatment and
      inhalation regimen.

      If at 30 minutes after initiation of dosing, no conversion to SR is observed, the
      Investigator may offer the subject another appropriate therapy. Discharge is left up to the
      discretion of the treating physician but no less than 240 min after initiation of dosing.
      Heart rhythm will be confirmed with event recorder in follow up.

      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for monitoring safety
      during the study.

    <description>To assess the safety and tolerability of inhaled flecainide compared to matched placebo, under two oral inhalation dosing regimens in subjects with recent onset of paroxysmal AF. All subjects are monitored for safety for 240 minutes while in the hospital. Two follow up telephone assessments will be completed 24 hours and 7 days post treatment.
