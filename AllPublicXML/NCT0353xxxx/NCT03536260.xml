  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immediate implant placement has a success rate from 94-100 % . After tooth extraction there
      is a loss in the horizontal and vertical dimension by about 3-6 mm and 1-2 mm respectively
      and alveolar crest resorption of about 44% especially through 6 months after extraction.

      After immediate implant placement there is usually a void between the implant and the socket
      walls which is called jumping distance or gap which may heal spontaneously or need bone graft
      to bridge the space. If the gap is 1-2 mm it may heal spontaneously more than that this will
      need bone graft. There is no evidence that the graft impairs osseointegration Development of
      artificial bone has increasingly progressed in the last few years. Nanobone &quot;nanocrystalline
      hydroxyapatite embedded in a porous silica gel matrix bone graft is introduced which has
      osseoconductive and biomimetic properties .the sub-micron modification in the bone substitute
      will enhance osteogenic property. It bind to the bone by stimulation of osteoblast activity
      and enhance growth factors which improve bone healing and provide more strength and stability
      to the implant.
