  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, non-randomized, observational, multicenter clinical
      trial. The primary aim of this study is to observe if the use of the rapid responds
      electroencephalography (EEG) system impacts physician decision making. Secondary aims include
      exploring the safety and performance information of the Ceribell EEG system compared to
      conventional EEG system. The study will recruit physicians (Faculty physicians and Trainees)
      at up to five institutions and examine the impact of rapid response EEG when providing care
      to patients in whom EEG recording has been ordered for clinical reasons.

    <description>This trial will qualitatively examine how information from rapid response and conventional EEG data changes physicians' diagnostic suspicion or their treatment decisions and confidence levels. In addition, the results will examine the mean time to EEG lead placement, and ease of use.</description>

        The study will involve two groups of subjects:

          1. Physicians (faculty and trainees), who will be asked to fill out a nonsensitive
             questionnaire. These are members of Epilepsy and Neuro-ICU team (attendings, fellows,
             or residents) who are actively involved in the care of patients and know the patient's
             history of present illness.

          2. Patients undergoing clinically ordered EEGs.
