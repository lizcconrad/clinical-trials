  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1982, Steven Hayes, a clinical psychologist, developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT), a unique empirically based psychological intervention that uses acceptance and
      mindfulness strategies, together with commitment and behavior change strategies, to increase
      psychological flexibility. In 1954, John Lilly, a cognitive neuroscientist, developed the
      sensory deprivation tank (known today as Floatation Restricted Environmental Stimulation
      Therapy - Float REST), to access a wide range of healing, higher brain functions, and
      meditation through an unparalleled deep relaxation state. In this study, the investigators
      aim to examine whether participants in the ACT + Float REST condition will have larger
      decreases of the burnout phenomenon than those who receive either only ACT or Float REST.

      Burnout is a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors on the job.
      Burnout syndrome is thus defined as a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and
      emotional exhaustion, cynicism and detachment, and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of
      accomplishment. Human service providers often develop burnout, along with psychological
      distress, including anxiety and depression. Those experiencing burnout are likely to have a
      number of somatic complaints, such as shortness of breath, headaches, gastrointestinal
      symptoms, sleeplessness, aches, and lingering colds. However, American companies,
      universities, and the general public, unlike their European counterparts (particularly the
      Netherlands and Sweden) have been slow to recognize the rise, and by extension, the
      far-reaching effects, of this negative phenomenon.

      One potential way to address burnout is through mindfulness. Mindfulness has been used
      therapeutically to foster effective emotional and behavioral responding to distress. In a
      systematic review of mindfulness training, decreases in job burnout were evident for
      healthcare professionals and teachers. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), is one such
      mindfulness-based psychotherapy. ACT has been efficaciously used for chronic pain, anxiety,
      depression, addiction, and general stress - all issues relevant to burnout syndrome.

      One finding from previous ACT studies on chronic pain and workplace stress alike is that the
      treatment effects are larger for psychosocial effects than they are for reductions in
      physical symptoms. Therefore, for a burnout intervention to be complete, it may be necessary
      to include a secondary treatment to supplement ACT. One approach that directly addresses
      physical symptoms is Flotation REST.

      Float REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy), which typically provides sensory
      isolation and deep relaxation by laying supine in a light-proof, sound-proof, zero- gravity
      tank with 10-12 inches of water and 1,200 pounds of Epsom salt. Preliminary, noncontrolled
      studies on Float REST have shown promising results for fibromyalgia, muscle tension pain,
      stress, burnout syndrome, depression, anxiety, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, and
      post traumatic stress disorder. The primary investigator's long-term objective is to
      establish a safe, cost-effective treatment that addresses whether a combination of a
      mindfulness-based treatment and Float REST works better than either alone.

      Previous research has indicated a combination of psychotherapy and Float REST results in a
      significant decrease in degree of depression and anxiety stemming from burnout syndrome and
      increased positive outlook in life. In addition, the research has indicated a significant
      decrease in extent of painful areas and intensity. However, the authors did not indicate the
      specific form of therapy that was provided to participants, nor did they parse the effects in
      a controlled, comparative way, or look to see if one treatment bolstered the other. Thus, one
      could reasonably conclude an acceptance and values-based treatment would be the perfect
      complement to Float REST in order to address both physiological and psychological components.

      All participants will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions over the span of 12
      weeks: ACT training, one hour of Float REST per week, and ACT training + one hour of Float
      REST per week. Participants will complete measures of psychological flexibility (AAQ-II),
      Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS), the Short Form Health Survey
      (SF-36; RAND Health), and the Stress Map Inventory before the first week, at week four, at
      week 8, after the last week. There will be an additional follow-up after one month.
      Approximately 45 adults working in the human services industry (behavioral therapists,
      physical therapists, nurses, doctors, etc.) will be randomly assigned to the ACT, Float REST,
      or the ACT + Float REST condition (15 participants per group).

      The aim of this study is to examine whether participants in the ACT + Float REST condition
      will have larger decreases of the burnout phenomenon than those who receive either only ACT
      or Float REST. Given commercial float centers are becoming more popular and affordable, and
      that this study would be a pilot study for future research, this additive treatment could
      improve the quality of life by reducing suffering and increasing psychological flexibility
      for many individuals.

    <description>A 36 item measure of health status to determine cost-effectiveness of a health treatment. The 8 sections entail pain, emotional well being, general health, emotional problems, physical functioning, physical role functioning, social functioning, and vitality. 1, 2, 20, 22, 34, and 36 are scored as the following: 1 = 100, 2 = 75, 3 = 50, 4 = 25, 5 = 0. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are scored as the following: 1 = 0, 2 = 50, 3 = 100. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 are scored as the following: 1 = 0, 2 = 100. 21, 23, 26, 27, and 30 are scored as the following: 1 = 100, 2 = 80, 3 = 60, 4 = 40, 5 = 20, 6 = 0. 24, 25, 28, 29, and 31 are scored as the following: 1 = 0, 2 = 20, 3 = 40, 4 = 60, 5 = 80, 6 = 100. 32, 33, and 35 are scored as the following: 1 = 0, 2 = 25, 3 = 50, 4 = 75, 5 = 100. Once recorded, average the scores according to their respective scales and add the total score. A score of 100 represents the highest level of functioning possible for all questions.</description>

All statements or questions in each of the 21 scales are given a score of 0 to 3, with 0 or 3 representing the highest levels of stress, contingent on how the respective statement or question is framed. Once each scale is completed the scores from each question are added to determine the score of each respective scale. In scales 1 to 5, a higher score indicates burnout. In scales 6 to 12, a lower score indicates burnout. In scales 13 to 21, a higher score indicates burnout.</description>
