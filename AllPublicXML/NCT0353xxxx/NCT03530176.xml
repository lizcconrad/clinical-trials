  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery calcification is a sign of heart disease. A nuclear medicine PET-CT test
      using sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) radioisotope has been shown to help identify growing
      calcification plaques early on in the disease process. It is known that diabetic patients are
      at a high risk of developing premature coronary disease; the investigators intend to use this
      new technology to identify those patients at higher risk of developing coronary artery
      disease.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic patients are at very high risk of suffering premature coronary artery disease events
      compared to the general population. Whether pancreas transplant completely reverses the
      biochemical imbalances of diabetes mellitus and the high cardiovascular risk of these
      patients is unclear. Investigators in the field of imaging have been looking for ways to
      identify patients at greater risk of suffering events by searching for plaques in the
      cardiovascular system more likely to fracture and cause acute intravascular thrombosis
      (vulnerable plaques) with subsequent precipitation of acute events. Recent advances in PET-CT
      provide an opportunity to pursue such search with limited risk to the patient and high
      probability of success. CT scanning is used to identify vascular calcification -a marker of
      atherosclerosis- and PET imaging with 18F-NaF helps determine whether the calcification is
      actively accumulating calcium and phosphorus making it an actively growing plaque. PET
      imaging with 18F-NaF has been used in the setting of acute coronary syndromes to identify the
      most active and unstable plaques and in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis to follow
      the natural history of this disease. The investigators propose to perform PET-CT imaging with
      18F-NaF in a pilot study of 100 patients chosen among the subjects followed in the outpatient
      diabetes clinics at the University of Alberta. The aim is to investigate the presence and
      extent of unstable plaques in ambulatory patients affected by diabetes, and to identify a set
      of clinical variables most likely to be associated with a large burden of disease. Since
      there are no published studies in this particular field it is impossible to make precise
      sample size calculations and these analyses must therefore be considered exploratory.

    <description>18F-NaF (sodium Flouride ) is a radio-pharmaceutical used to image skeletal pathology, including primary and secondary neoplasms. Despite US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval and 18F-NaF being listed in the US Pharmacopeia, 18F-NaF is not currently approved by Health Canada for use as a cardiac imaging tracer. Therefore, a concurrent Health Canada Clinical Trial Application is being submitted to ensure its availability. Intervention on single arm: A dose of 18F-NaF (200 - 400 MBq) will be injected intravenously at rest. After a 60 minute, an ECG-gated PET acquisition will be performed centered over the heart for 20 minutes. A CT coronary calcium score examination will also be performed on a dedicated CT scanner and the Agatston and volume scores calculated according to standards.</description>
