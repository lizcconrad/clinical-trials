  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial aneurysm are frequent with a prevalence estimated over 2-5% in the general
      population. These are focal dilatations occuring in the cerebral vessels. They usually remain
      silent until complications occur. Complications associated with intracranial aneurysms
      include mass effect on adjacent structures and rupture. Rupture is the most severe
      complication with a mortality rate of 35-50% and a high rate of morbidity including long-term
      disability. It incidence is estimated about 1% per year for aneurysm smaller than 1 cm.

      However, preventative treatments have their own risk of complication and morbi-mortality rate
      including stroke and hemorrhage. Actual guidelines for treatment planning are mainly designed
      with the size, the location and the age of the patient. This is why working on the
      identification of imaging markers of aneurysmal instability is relevant.

      Dynamic CTA acquisition allow to study the variation of metrics such as dome height, dome
      length, ostium width, ostium area, and volume during the cardiac cycle. The goal of this
      study is to assess differents aneurysmal metrics to determine those which may vary the most
      during the cardiac cycle and to assess it as an imaging marker of aneurysmal instability.
