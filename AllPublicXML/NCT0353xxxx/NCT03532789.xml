  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder is a clinical syndrome characterized by frequency, with or without urge
      incontinence, urgency, and nocturia, which affect patients' sleeping quality and
      rehabilitation program progressing. Current treatments include behavioral therapy (eg, life
      style adjustment, bladder training, pelvic floor muscle therapy) and medication.
      Antimuscarinic agents is the most common medications prescribed for OAB, but patients often
      have side effects like dry mouth and constipation. And there were plenty of herbal medicine
      which are beneficial to urine frequency and voiding dysfunction in ancient Chinese medicine
      books and records. In human trial, 62 Subjects diagnosed as overactive bladder will be
      enrolled and treated with Cinnamon patch. After treatment we will estimate the efficacy and
      record adverse events to conduct statistically analysis.

      The 1st year project: (1) Expect to enroll 62 clinical subjects of OAB. (2) Evaluate subjects
      'symptom and proceed patch treatment. (3) Record treatment responses including adverse
      effect. (4) Conduct statistically analysis.

      The 2nd year project: (1) Completing enrollment of 62 clinical subjects of OAB. (2) Finish
      evaluation and treatment of all subjects. (3) Statistically analysis all collecting data (4)
      Discuss and analyze the outcome.
