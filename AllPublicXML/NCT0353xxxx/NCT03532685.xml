  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the study of a population of severe asthmatics, not controlled despite the treatment
      conducted, it was possible to evidence 5 phenotypic groups of patients. According to the
      refractoriness of the response to treatment, severe asthma may be phenotype in some distinct
      groups.Other prospective study found a large proportion of severe asthmatics with persistent
      airway obstruction, despite optimized treatment and systematic follow-up. Small airway
      involvement and remodelling, characterized by bronchial muscle thickening, appear to be the
      main culprits for asthma severity and persistent obstruction in this population.A point of
      interest in the severe asthmatics cohort was the vast majority were female and there were a
      considerable number of obese. Recent reviews show that the more consistent division of
      phenotypes in patients with severe asthma is still based on 3 previously described criteria
      (presence of atopy, eosinophilia and age of onset of asthma) and a more recent criterion for
      the presence of multi-comorbidities. Heterogeneity is the rule, the presumption of a natural
      evolution of gravity is not confirmed and the overlap of clusters is frequent. The stability
      and natural history of the phenotypes is poorly understood, postulating that the inflammatory
      activation of the severe asma is multifactorial and may resemble that described in the
      oncology literature.To date, there are no markers that allow prediction of lung evolution of
      most patients with severe asthma, and which patients are at greater risk of developing
      persistent or accelerated loss airflow or lung function, factors determining the severity of
      asthma. It is also unclear whether and how much phenotype-based treatment impact on disease
      control and prognosis. Future studies will be instrumental in defining how and why. These
      phenotypes are evolving, leading to the disabling characteristics of severe asthma and what
      may be the more effective therapeutic approaches for these patients. Since the initiated
      research group from 2006 has an extensive clinical, functional, inflammatory, tomographic and
      morphological evaluation of a cohort of patients with severe asthma, the ideal scenario
      exists to advance the understanding and investigation of the evolution of this rare disease
      through standardized follow-up.
