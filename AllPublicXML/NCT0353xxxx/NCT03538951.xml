  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with actinic keratosis involving daily
      application of 1 of 2 strengths of VDA-1102 topical ointment for approximately 12 weeks (84
      days). This study has no placebo and the subjects enrolled in the study will know exactly
      what they are receiving. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and benefit
      of these two strengths.
