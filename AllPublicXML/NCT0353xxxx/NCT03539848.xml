    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test whether a portable goggle system (I-PAS) is
      good at diagnosing mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in a community setting. The goal is to
      determine whether the IPAS goggle system can be used reliably in an urgent care or emergency
      department setting.

             Hospital, or by direct referral to the clinic with a history of all of the following:
             1) Blow or impact to head, 2) Period of loss or alteration of consciousness, 3)
             Neurosensory symptoms, and 4) Diagnosis by Emergency Room Staff or Medical Staff of
             having suffered an mTBI/Concussion.

          2. An age- and sex- matched control group also recruited from emergency department or
             urgent/acute care facility at the University of Miami Hospital, Jackson Memorial

                  currently experience any head injury symptoms at time of enrollment

               2. For head injured group - history of head injury within the last three months or
                  experiencing head injury symptoms immediately prior to the current head injury

          3. Presence of severe aphasia

          4. History of diagnosed neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. hypochondriasis, major
             depression, schizophrenia)
