      Introduction : Cesarean rate varies from 45% to 73% in the literature in patient with
      diabetes type 1. Having a prior C-section is the most important risk factor. The aim of this
      study was to identify risk factor of cesarean in this population.

      Methods: This study is an observational, retrospective and single-center study from the
      hospital of Montpellier. All the pregnancies, planned or not, with subcutaneous insulin
      infusion or multiple daily injections of insulin, in patients with diabetes type 1 between
      2009 and 2015, after 24 weeks of gestation were included. All the data were retrospectively
      collected by the principal investigator with computer and paper files.
