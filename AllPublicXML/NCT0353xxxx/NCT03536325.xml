    <measure>Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: predose, end of infusion (EOI) and 8 hours (h) post dose; Day 2: 24 h post dose; Day 3: 48 h post dose; Day 4: 72 h post dose; Day 5: 96 h; Day 6: 120 h; Day 7: 144 h post dose; Days 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, and 113</time_frame>
    <description>The Cmax is the maximum observed serum concentration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Serum Concentration Versus Time Curve from Time 0 to the Time Corresponding to the Last Quantifiable Plasma Concentration (AUC[0-last])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: predose, EOI and 8 h post dose; Day 2: 24 h post dose; Day 3: 48 h post dose; Day 4: 72 h post dose; Day 5: 96 h; Day 6: 120 h; Day 7: 144 h post dose; Days 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, and 113</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC(0-last) is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to last quantifiable concentration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity])</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: predose, EOI and 8 h post dose; Day 2: 24 h post dose; Day 3: 48 h post dose; Day 4: 72 h post dose; Day 5: 96 h; Day 6: 120 h; Day 7: 144 h post dose; Days 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, and 113</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC(0-infinity) is the area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(0-last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC(0-last) is area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Terminal half-life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: predose, EOI and 8 h post dose; Day 2: 24 h post dose; Day 3: 48 h post dose; Day 4: 72 h post dose; Day 5: 96 h; Day 6: 120 h; Day 7: 144 h post dose; Days 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, and 113</time_frame>
    <description>Terminal half-life (t1/2) is the time measured for the serum concentration to decrease by 1 half to its original concentration. It is associated with the terminal slope of the semi logarithmic drug concentration-time curve, and is calculated as 0.693/lambda(z).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Systemic Clearance (CL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: predose, EOI and 8 h post dose; Day 2: 24 h post dose; Day 3: 48 h post dose; Day 4: 72 h post dose; Day 5: 96 h; Day 6: 120 h; Day 7: 144 h post dose; Days 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, and 113</time_frame>
    <description>CL is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the body. The total systemic clearance after intravenous dose is estimated by dividing the total administered dose by the plasma Area Under the Serum Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of Distribution (Vz)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: predose, EOI and 8 h post dose; Day 2: 24 h post dose; Day 3: 48 h post dose; Day 4: 72 h post dose; Day 5: 96 h; Day 6: 120 h; Day 7: 144 h post dose; Days 15, 22, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, and 113</time_frame>
    <description>The Vz is total volume of distribution at terminal phase after IV administration, defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Antibodies to Guselkumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1: predose; and Days 15, 29, 57, and 113</time_frame>
