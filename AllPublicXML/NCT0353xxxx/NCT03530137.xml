  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us learn what are the best services to promote young
      children's healthy development for families who are experiencing homelessness. Participants
      may participate in three programs: 1. Healthy Home: four weekly, one-hour group sessions on
      health topics; 2. Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC): 10, one-hour parenting with
      parent and child; 3. Healthy Steps: helps families identify, understand and manage parenting
      challenges completed at well child visits. Participants will be asked to complete surveys,
      participate in focus groups, and interviews about the experiences with the services offered.
      Questionnaires about understanding health issues and surveys about parenting behaviors and
      self-efficacy will also be completed. Study duration is approximately 10 - 12 weeks. Programs
      may be continued once families move into permanent housing.
