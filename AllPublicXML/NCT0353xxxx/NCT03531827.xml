  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Some prostate cancer keeps growing even when testosterone in the body drops to very low
      levels. This is called castrate-resistant prostate cancer. One treatment is enzalutamide.
      This is a modern hormonal therapy. But it only works for a certain amount of time and then
      the cancer becomes resistant to it. Researchers want to see if adding the treatment CRLX101
      could make enzalutamide work again for people who have already had it.

      Objective:

      To test a new way of treating prostate cancer using CRLX101 plus enzalutamide in people with
      certain prostate cancer who already had enzalutamide treatment.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 years and older with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer who have
      had enzalutamide treatment

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood
      and urine tests. They will have a scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis. They will have a bone
      scan.

      Participants will get treatment in cycles. A cycle lasts 28 days. They will take enzalutamide
      by mouth once a day. They will get CRLX101 through an IV every 1 or 2 weeks.

      Participants will repeat screening tests throughout the study.

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 3 4 weeks after they stop taking the study drug.
      They will repeat most screening tests and have an electrocardiogram.

      Background:

        -  Enzalutamide is established as first-line hormonal therapy in patients with metastatic
           castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, it is increasingly recognized
           that acquired resistance to therapy (e.g. AR overexpression, AR-V7) could limit the
           durability of response to therapy

        -  Upregulation of HIF-1Alpha in hypoxic tumor cells provides a mechanism of acquired
           resistance to current hormonal therapies and chemotherapies. Acquired resistance
           increases angiogenesis and metastasis, leading to disease progression

        -  Targeting the hypoxia driven tumor microenvironment (e.g. down-regulation of HIF-1Alpha)
           in addition to the androgen receptor (e.g. enzalutamide) has synergistic activity
           against prostate cancer cell line models (e.g. LNCaP, 22Rv1).

        -  CRLX101 is a nanoparticle drug conjugate composed of 20(S)-camptothecin (a potent and
           highly selective topoisomerase I inhibitor with anti-HIF-1Alpha properties) conjugated
           to a linear, cyclodextrin-polyethylene glycol-based polymer

        -  CRLX101 has been to shown to be safe, tolerable, and efficacious in numerous Phase II
           clinical investigations in a variety of tumor subtypes.

        -  Preclinical and clinical studies have shown CRLX101 significantly down-regulates
           HIF-1alpha, impacting tumor-driven angiogenesis.

        -  The treatment combination of CRLX101 and enzalutamide provides a reasonable approach to
           re-sensitizing prostate cancer cells to hormonal therapy via synergistic antitumor
           activity and inhibition of acquired resistance

      Objectives:

      -Primary Objective: To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of CRLX101 at the recommended phase
      II dose (RP2D) in combination with enzalutamide with respect to treatment response, defined
      as greater than or equal to 50% PSA decline or stable disease on imaging following 5 months
      of treatment.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have progressive mCRPC per PCWG3

        -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and able to give informed consent

        -  ECOG Performance Status less than or equal to 2

        -  Evaluable metastatic disease on bone scan or measurable disease on CT Scan per PCWG3

        -  Patients must have had disease progression while receiving prior enzalutamide treatment

      Design:

        -  The study will be conducted using an optimal two stage Phase II design (8 patients,
           expandable to 21 patients total) aimed to determine the percentage of patients with a
           PSA decline of greater than 50% or stable disease at 5 months.

        -  The first 3 to 6 patients enrolled on study will follow a lead-in dosing scheme to
           confirm the safety of the combination (CRLX101 12 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks for the first
           two cycles, followed by CRLX101 15 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks at the start of cycle 3, with
           enzalutamide 160 mg administered once daily starting on cycle 1 day 2) prior to
           initiation of the optimal two stage study design.

        -  For patients enrolled on study following the lead-in, the confirmed tolerable dose of
           CRLX101 will be administered via IV infusion every 2 weeks. Enzalutamide 160 mg will be
           administered orally once daily beginning on cycle 1 day 2.

        -  Blood and urine will be collected at multiple time points for PK and PD analyses.

        -  Tumor assessments will be made using 99Tc bone scintography and/or CT scan (chest,
           abdomen, and pelvis) at baseline, prior to Cycle 3 and every 3 cycles thereafter.

        -  The accrual ceiling for the study is set at 30 patients.

             nilutamide for &gt;6 months immediately before enrollment on this study must be off
             treatment for 4 weeks (6 weeks for bicalutamide) and demonstrate a continued rise in
             PSA. Patients on antiandrogens for &lt;6 months must be off medication for 2 weeks.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of enzalutamide and CRLX101 in patients &lt;18 years of
             age and prostate cancer is not common in children &lt;18 years of age, children are

             medication at least 28 days prior to study entry.

          -  The effects of enzalutamide and CRLX101 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason and because androgen receptor antagonists and topoisomerase I inhibitors
             as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic,
             all study subjects must agree to use a condom during the study treatment period and
             for 120 days following the last dose of study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to
             60%).

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. A minimum washout period
             of 28 days is required prior to the initiation of on study treatment.

          -  Patients who have been treated with prior secondary hormonal manipulations with
             proposed investigational rationale for having efficacy against AR-V7 splice variants.

        eligible for this study. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy will also be
        eligible for this study).

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Patients with history of seizure as an adult including febrile seizure or any
             condition that may predispose to seizure (e.g., prior stroke, brain arteriovenous

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension (SBP&gt;170/DBP&gt;105), or psychiatric illness/social
             situations within 6 months that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patients who have received palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks of study entry and
             have not recovered to Grade 1 or baseline from associated toxicities. Note: Patients
             may receive palliative radiation once enrolled on study. The subject has not recovered
             to baseline or CTCAE less than or equal to Grade 1 from toxicity due to all prior
             therapies, including surgery, except alopecia and other non-clinically significant
             AEs.

          -  Patients who are unable to swallow tablets or have a gastrointestinal disease that
             could hinder the absorption of enzalutamide

          -  The use of any herbal products that may lower PSA levels (e.g. saw palmetto).

          -  Patients with microscopic hematuria (defined as &gt;100 RBCs on urinalysis) or worsening
             urinary symptoms within 7 days prior to the initiation of study treatment.

        INCLUSION OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN:

        -Men of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Women are excluded as
        prostate cancer does not exist in this population.
