      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible participants. This program is designed
      to provide continued access to TRx0237 to individual patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer's
      disease who do not qualify for participation in an ongoing clinical trial. Eligible
      participants must have previously completed participation in a clinical trial of TRx0237
      conducted by TauRx, among other criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, as confirmed by a cognitive assessment

          -  Clinical benefit of continued access to TRx0237 is expected to outweigh any perceived
             risk

          -  The patient has the ability to travel to the named clinic for regularly scheduled
             visits.

          -  The patient and/or his/her legal guardian have been informed of the potential risks
             and obligations and have given written informed consent for continued treatment
             consistent with local requirements.

          -  The patient is not participating in a clinical trial of another investigational drug.

          -  A female patient of child-bearing potential must use adequate birth control (as
             defined by the protocol) for at least 90 days before beginning treatment and agree to
             continue its use whilst on treatment and for 30 days after the last dose of TRx0237.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Swallowing difficulties which prevent taking the medication whole as instructed.

          -  Patients, who in the opinion of the treating physician, are unable to comply with this
             study protocol or have health concerns that may increase risk.

          -  Patients who enrolled in a previous TRx0237 clinical trial and either did not complete
             the clinical trial or had a significant treatment-related adverse event that could
             cause an undue risk

          -  Current use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine

          -  Use of drugs for which there is a warning or precaution in the labeling about
             methemoglobinemia at approved doses (e.g., dapsone, local anesthetics such as
             benzocaine used chronically, primaquine and related antimalarials)

          -  Use of clozapine or olanzapine

          -  Clinically significant respiratory failure (e.g., caused by chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, lung fibrosis, or other disease)

          -  History of clinically significant hematological abnormality (including
             hemoglobinopathy, myelodysplastic syndrome, hemolytic anemia, or splenectomy) or
             hemoglobin value (confirmed upon repeat) below age/sex appropriate laboratory lower
             limit of normal

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min

          -  Clinically significant alanine transaminase (3×the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and/or
             bilirubin (2×ULN) values

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., acute coronary syndrome or
             symptoms consistent with angina pectoris, signs or symptoms of clinical heart failure,
             atrial fibrillation that is not currently controlled, QTcF [QT corrected for heart
             rate using Fridericia's formula] of &gt;460 msec in males or &gt;470 msec in females, poorly
             controlled hypertension, tachycardia, or bradycardia)
