    <textblock>
      Young patients with keratoconus face two problems: disease progression and corneal shape
      irregularity. Both underlie the 20% rate of corneal transplantation in keratoconics required
      to maintain useful vision.

      Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) is a now the gold-standard treatment to halt disease
      progression. The aim is to strengthen the cornea to prevent further shape deterioration. For
      patients whose quality of vision has already suffered, standard CXL can generally only
      prevent further deterioration, rather than improving vision. Refractive CXL, a new iteration
      of CXL in which a bespoke treatment pattern is applied to the cornea, aims to smooth out
      surface irregularities thereby improving vision.

      This primary objective of this study is to compare the visual outcome in patients with
      progressive keratoconus treated with refractive CXL, as compared with historical controls
      treated with standard CXL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irregular astigmatism (irregular corneal shape leading to irregular focus) is a common cause
      of failure to achieve an adequate spectacle correction for many patients with corneal
      disease. For patients affected, rigid gas permeable contact lenses are the only means of
      visual rehabilitation. Not all patients tolerate rigid contact lens wear, and those that do
      are often uncomfortable and have a restricted wearing time.

      Keratoconus, in which the corneal shape becomes progressively steeper and more irregular in
      the 2nd to 4th decades of life, is a common cause of irregular astigmatism. Disease
      progression in keratoconus can be stabilised with corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL),
      effective in 90% of cases. Pre-existing irregular astigmatism often remains after CXL, with
      many patients requiring rigid gas permeable contact lenses to regain good vision.

      We have recently demonstrated improvements in vision following simultaneous combined
      cross-linking with laser refractive surgery (TransPRK/CXL). The excimer laser is used to
      create a smoother, more regular focusing shape on the cornea to improve the quality of vision
      achieved in spectacles. Although effective, the downsides of using this approach are both the
      cost and limited availability of excimer laser equipment in the NHS. Also, excimer laser
      smoothing works by removing corneal tissue. It is not yet known whether this tissue removal
      will have any detrimental effect on corneal shape stability post CXL.

      As a cheaper and potentially more widely accessible alternative, refractive CXL aims to
      regularise the corneal surface by applying a bespoke treatment pattern based on pre-operative
      corneal surface shape (topography) scans. 60% of our patients undergoing standard CXL already
      have impaired vision at the time treatment. We are aiming to offer these patients both
      long-term stability of their keratoconus and an improvement in their vision in a single
      treatment.

A bandage contact lens will be applied to encourage regrowth of the corneal surface and reduce post-operative pain.</description>
