      impact of teeth loss has not been evaluated. Present study aims to evaluate the psychological
      conditions of patients pending complete tooth extraction before and shortly after tooth loss
      using Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) and Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index
      (GOHAI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be interviewed concerning their psychological conditions (HADS) and their oral

    <measure>Change in Hospital anxiety and depression (HAD) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month (change in score from baseline (before tooth extraction) to 1 month after tooth extraction)</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item self-assessment scale designed to evaluate emotional stress induced by chronic pain in non-psychiatric populations. HAD-A assessed anxiety and HAD-D evaluated depression. Scores of greater than 10 were indicative of anxiety or depression, scores of 7 or less were indicative of no significant anxiety and depression, and scores of 8 to 10 indicated borderline anxiety or depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in General oral health assessment index (GOHAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month (change in score from baseline (before tooth extraction) to 1 month after tooth extraction)</time_frame>
    <description>The General oral health assessment index (GOHAI) is a questionnaire about the impact of oral health on quality of life. It includes 12 items evaluating three dimensions of oral health with respect to quality of life: (1) functional field (eating, speaking, and swallowing); (2) psychological field (appearance, social relationship); (3) pain or discomfort concerning gums or teeth. Each item has a score ranging from 1 to 5. The GOHAI-add score corresponds to the sum of the scores and ranges from 12 to 60 (20 for functional field, 25 for psychological field, and 15 for comfort/pain field). A score higher than 57 is high and indicates a satisfactory oral quality of life. A score from 51 to 56 is average and a score of 50 or less is low, reflecting a poor oral quality of life.</description>
