      An Open-Label Extension and Safety Monitoring Study of Patients with Symptomatic
      Transthyretin Cardiomyopathy Who Have Completed the Phase II Study AG10-201

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      AG10 administered to adult patients with symptomatic transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy
      (ATTR-CM) in patients who have completed the study AG10-201.

      This study will be an Open-Label Extension and Safety Monitoring Study of 45 male and/or
      female patients with symptomatic ATTR-CM aged 18 through 90 years, who have completed the
      Phase II Study AG10-201. Enrollment into the study will be followed by visits every 3-months
      and a 30-day follow-up visit after last dose.

      If all doses are well tolerated, the duration of each patient's participation in the study
      will continue based on periodic recommendations of the AG10 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
      and/or registration of the product for the treatment of symptomatic ATTR-CM.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AG10
      administered orally twice daily in patients with symptomatic ATTR-CM, and to describe the
      long-term pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of AG10 as assessed by established assays of
      transthyretin (TTR) stabilization, including Fluorescent Probe Exclusion (FPE) assay and
      Western blot, and to describe the PK-PD relationship of AG10 in adult patients with
      symptomatic ATTR-CM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has completed the study AG10-201.

          2. Is, in the opinion of the investigator, willing and able to comply with the study
             medication regimen and all other study requirements.

          3. Agrees not to participate in another investigational drug or device study while
             participating in this open-label extension study.

          4. Has the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be
             obtained prior to initiation of study procedures.

          5. Male patients and female patients of childbearing potential who engage in heterosexual
             intercourse must agree to use appropriate method(s) of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has hemodynamic instability at Screening that, in the judgment of the PI, would pose
             too great a risk for participation in the study.

          2. Has estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Screening.

          3. Has abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests at Screening that, in the judgment of
             the PI, would pose too great a risk for participation in the study.

          4. Has any clinically significant ongoing medical condition that, in the judgment of the
             PI, might jeopardize the patient's safety or interfere with the study, including
             participation in another investigational drug or investigational device study within
             the 30 days prior to Screening with potential residual effects that might confound the
             results of this study.

          5. Has any laboratory abnormality or condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could
             adversely affect the safety of the patient or impair the assessment of study results.

             formulation excipients.

          7. Is likely to undergo heart transplantation or placement of a mechanical circulatory
             device within the next year.

          8. Is receiving current treatment with diflunisal, tafamidis, green tea, doxycycline,
             TUDCA/Ursodiol, Patisiran, Inotersen or any other investigational ATTR agent within 14
             days or 5 half-lives of the prior investigational agent (whichever is longer) prior to
             Screening.

             nursing before the study drug is administered. A negative serum pregnancy test at

             patients of childbearing potential.
