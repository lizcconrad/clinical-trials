      Aims and objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess whether a structured
      exercise program improves cardiac relaxing properties in patients with hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy (HCM).

      Background: HCM is a hereditary disease in which the myocardium becomes thickened without an
      identifiable cause (other than genetic). It is the most common genetic cardiovascular disease
      with an estimated prevalence of 1/500 (i.e. 10.000 affected individuals in Denmark). The
      majority of patients with HCM suffers from shortness of breath and reduced exercise capacity
      due to increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness. Exercise training has been shown to improve
      exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with HCM, but the mechanisms responsible for this
      improvement are not known.

      Methods and materials: The study is a randomized, single blinded, prospective, controlled
      clinical trial. Eighty patients are recruited from outpatient clinics in the Capital Region
      of Denmark. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 12 week of moderate-intensity exercise
      training or usual activity level. Assessments will include right heart catheterization,
      echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, blood-samples, quality of life, and, in a
      subgroup of patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The primary end-point is change in
      LV filling pressure assessed as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at 25 W workload.

      Expected outcome and perspectives: The investigators hypothesize that an exercise training
      program will reduce cardiac stiffness and improve symptoms in patients with HCM. Training of
      HCM patients has long been debated and the topic is poorly researched. The effects of
      exercise on hemodynamics in HCM patients are unknown and a better understanding of these
      mechanisms is pivotal for improving treatment.
