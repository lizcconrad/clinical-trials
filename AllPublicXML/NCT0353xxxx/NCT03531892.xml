    <measure>Clinical Response Rate Based on Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response rate is defined by the percentage of participants who satisfy the combined definition of the change of the total value of Mayo score and the change or the actual value of individual subscales. Mayo score is used in clinical trials to assess ulcerative colitis (UC) disease activity. It consists of 4 subscales: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings on endoscopy and physician's global assessment. Each subscale is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0= normal condition and 3= severe disease condition. The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Response Rate Based on Partial Mayo Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response rate is defined by the percentage of participants who satisfy the combined definition of the change of the total value of partial Mayo score and the change or the actual value of individual subscales. Partial Mayo score is used in clinical trials to assess UC disease activity. It consists of 3 subscales: stool frequency, rectal bleeding and physician's global assessment. Each subscale is scored on a scale of 0 to 3, where 0= normal condition and 3= severe disease condition. The total partial Mayo score ranges from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Clinical Remission Rate 2</measure>
