      This Compassionate Use Program (CUP) is setup to provide study patients with continuous
      access to Brivaracetam (BRV) for the time period between closures of the long-term follow up

    <description>Patients will start on the individual Brivaracetam (BRV) dose that they had reached at the completion of the previous study. The BRV dose can be adjusted based on the individual patient's seizure control and tolerability; however, the BRV dose may not exceed 200 mg/day in divided (preferably symmetrical) morning and evening doses, taken with or without food.
Up- and down-titration steps should be performed in steps of maximum 50 mg/day on a weekly basis. The full down-titration should include a 1-week step at 20 mg/day.</description>
