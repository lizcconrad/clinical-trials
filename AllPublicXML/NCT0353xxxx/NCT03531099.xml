  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The percentage of malignant prostate tumors detected very early is constantly increasing and
      the number of well differentiated tumors, with small volume and low risk of progression
      increases. When a tumor of this type is identified, radical prostatectomy remains the
      reference treatment, but this treatment is not without side effects. Active surveillance is a
      strategy which aims at detecting an early development of the cancerous disease in order to
      propose curative treatment in a timely manner and thus improve specific survival. Patients
      are therefore re-evaluated each year by rectal examination, PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen)
      assay. Active surveillance remains difficult to manage psychologically for both the patient
      and the practitioner, because of the lack of treatment on the one hand and a rate of
      non-curable cancers close to 50% when signs of progression trigger a radical treatment.

      The aim of the focal treatment HIFU (High Intensity Focused Ultrasound) is to destroy the
      cancer without causing side effects in contrast to radical treatments. It is in this sense
      that it is positioned both as an alternative to radical surgery and as an alternative to
      active surveillance.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the comparison between the 2 groups of the proportion of patient converting to a radical treatment at 48 months of follow-up. Conversion to a radical treatment is define as a medical decision based on the following criteria:
An increase in Gleason score to a score 7 (3 + 4) with bilateral involvement (Gleason 6 or 7).
An increase in the Gleason score to a score 7 (3 + 4) with tumor whose location is not compatible with a focal treatment (impossibility to apply safety margins of 9mm).
An increase in Gleason score to a score of 7 (4 + 3) or higher.
Risk of lymph node invasion&gt; 5% (calculated with the MSKCC nomogram)
An extension of the tumor beyond the prostatic capsule (MRI and / or biopsies).
Appearance of pelvic ganglion metastases.</description>

    <description>65 patients will receive the immediate treatment with focal HIFU in order to destroy the cancer without causing side effects. HIFU treatment will be conducted with the Focal One® device. The treatment area will be defined using MRI data and 3D biopsies. A safety distance of at least 9 mm will be defined around the tumor. An intraoperative contrast echocardiographic control will be performed to evaluate the necrotic area. If necessary, additional HIFU lesions will be performed during the same session. In case of residual tumor demonstrated during control biopsies, additional treatment of this tumor with focal HIFU may be proposed.
Patients randomized in this arm will also have PSA dosage, MRI exam, questionnaires and prostatic biopsies during their follow up.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient having been clearly informed of the study and having accepted, with sufficient
             reflection time, to participate by signing the informed consent form of the study.

          -  Age between 50 and 80 years with a life expectancy of more than 5 years. Patients
             between the ages of 75 and 80 will need to have a lower G8 score.

          -  Initial diagnosis of localized prostate cancer (T1 or T2a) with the following
             characteristics:

               -  A multiparametric MRI showing a single invasive tumor focus at most two
                  contiguous sextants confirmed by biopsies (index tumor). Patients with multiple
                  suspected MRI foci may be included if only one of these foci is confirmed by
                  targeted biopsies.

               -  The tumor volume on MRI should be&gt; 0.5 cc, ie a tumor ≥10 mm in its longest
                  dimension.

               -  A maximum tumor length&gt; 3 mm or at least 3 positive biopsies on all biopsies
                  performed (12 randomized biopsies and 2 biopsies per MRI target guided by fusion
                  software).

               -  Gleason 6 score (risk group 1 of the D'Amico classification).

               -  Tumor positioned so that a safety distance of at least 9mm can be defined during
                  HIFU-F treatment in prostate tissue around the target.

          -  PSA ≤ 10ng / ml.

          -  Patient affiliated with health insurance or beneficiary of an equivalent plan.

                  MRI target).

               -  Multiple intra prostatic calcifications inducing, on ultrasound, a shadow cone in
                  the prostate preventing the penetration of ultrasound and thus the realization of
                  the treatment.

               -  History of pelvic irradiation

               -  Presence of an implant (stent, catheter) located less than 1 cm from the

                  treatment).

               -  Anterior surgery at the level of the anus or rectum making the introduction of
                  the probe impossible.

               -  Allergy to latex.

               -  Thickness of the rectal wall&gt; 10mm.

          -  Patient undergoing treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with IPSS&gt; 25.
