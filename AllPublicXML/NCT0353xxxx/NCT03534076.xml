    <textblock>
      This 5-year prospective, observational study will: (1) determine the individual, social, and
      environmental predictors of sleep duration, quality, latency, efficiency, timing and
      regularity in African American smokers, (2) quantify the prospective relationship between
      multiple metrics of sleep with tobacco use, such that a sleep phenotype of risk for smoking
      is defined, and (3) examine the extent to which short sleep (&lt;7 hrs) and other unhealthy
      sleep metrics, predicts lung function through smoking behaviors and inflammation, in 480
      African Americans at risk for advancing COPD (GOLD Stage 0-2 and current smoker). Study
      subjects will be recruited via Temple Health System sites. Following eligibility screening,
      initially eligible subjects will provide written study consent and complete an in-home sleep
      assessment to rule out the exclusionary moderate-severe sleep apnea and other sleep
      disorders. Consenting and eligible subjects will be entered into the study and across the
      60-month data collection period, complete 8 assessments: 4 annual clinical based assessments,
      interspersed by 4 mid-year, phone-based, self-report assessments.
