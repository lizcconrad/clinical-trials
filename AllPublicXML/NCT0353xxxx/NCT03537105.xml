  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By contrast to other proinflammatory cytokines which are found up-regulated in the skin of
      patients with psoriasis, atopic dermatitis or systemic sclerosis, IL-34 is the only cytokine
      that undergoes down-regulation. This finding is interesting regarding the description of
      IL-34 as an immunosuppressive cytokine. In this study, the expression and the role of
      interleukin-34 (IL-34) will be investigated in the physiopathology of systemic sclerosis.

    <textblock>
      The mechanisms involved in the physiopathology of systemic sclerosis (SSc) are not fully
      understood, particularly the pattern of cytokine expression in the skin of SSc patients.
      These cytokines are known to play a central role in the regulation of numerous inflammatory
      diseases and, among them, IL-34 is the only cytokine which has been found to be
      down-regulated in other skin inflammatory disorders such psoriasis or atopic dermatitis.
      IL-34 has been described as an immunosuppressive cytokine, and our preliminary results show
      that IL-34 is active on fibroblasts, a key cell that undergoes dysfunction in SSc. Thus, we
      are willing to explore its expression profile in the skin of SSc patients and its potential
      role in the physiopathology of the disease. For this study, we will analyze IL-34 mRNA levels
      in the skin and the plasma of SSc patients by comparison to healthy patients. Thirty patients
      will be included in the Internal Medicine Unit of the CHU de Poitiers during a single visit,
      in the frame of their medical follow-up, to collect two skin biopsies and 5 ml of blood after
      obtaining their informed consent. The expression of IL-34 will also be investigated at the
      protein level by immunostaining on skin sections and by ELISA (skin protein lysates and
      plasma). Moreover, the expression of other proinflammatory cytokines will be investigated
      both at the mRNA and protein levels.
