  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical event with severe consequences. In the United
      States alone, greater than one million hospitalized patients per year are diagnosed with AKI.
      It has been independently associated with prolonged hospital stays, 25-80% risk of
      in-hospital death, and future progression to chronic kidney disease. While there has been an
      increase in awareness about the prevalence and significance of AKI, studies have uncovered
      systematic failure in the management of AKI, largely relating to the failure of clinicians to
      recognize and manage the condition appropriately. This is where we can use electronic health
      records (EHRs) and electronic alerts (e-alerts) to our advantage. In this study, the
      investigators plan to use e-alerts integrated into a clinical decision support (CDS) system
      to improve the care of and outcomes of patients with AKI. The aims are to study the
      prevalence of AKI and its progression among hospitalized patients using an 'AKI sniffer' (an
      EHR based automated system) and to prospectively study if introducing a complex intervention
      (an e-alert combined with a clinical decision support system) will reduce progression of AKI
      in children. The investigators have developed an AKI care bundle which provides simple
      guidelines for management of AKI along with specific discharge instructions to improve follow
      up care. The primary outcome is AKI progression. Secondary outcomes include morbidity,
      mortality, length of hospital stay, need for renal replacement therapy, and recovery of renal
      function by time of hospital discharge. The investigators will also look at documentation of
      AKI and if these participants get appropriate follow up.
