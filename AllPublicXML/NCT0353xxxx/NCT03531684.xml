      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MMFS for improving cognition
      and global function in patients with probable mild Alzheimer's disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study in patients with probable mild Alzheimer's disease. The study is a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group design, in which participants
      (up to 6 per arm; 12 total) will receive oral placebo or MMFS twice daily for 24 weeks.
      Randomized patients and their informants (required) will complete 3 assessments total: at
      baseline (prior to taking any study tablets), 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. At each of the three
      assessments, participants will complete cognitive and behavioral measures and clinical
      interviews, a blood sample will be collected for safety and biomarkers related to Alzheimer's
      disease, and the informant will complete an interview concerning the patient's cognition,
      mood, and function. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will also be obtained from patients via
      lumbar puncture at baseline and Week 24 for biomarker analyses. A range of safety and
      tolerability assessments will also be performed (including vital signs, laboratory tests, and
      ECGs). Participants will be contacted by phone between clinical assessments for monitoring.

                  during the study, this will lead to discontinuation from study participation
                  unless it relates to a medication that, in the view of the study investigator,
                  does not affect participation in the trial.
