  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will consist of reminders which will be send to the participants randomly
      via email, with aim to increase the frequency and amount of translated plain language
      summaries (PLS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All study participants who accept participation in the study will be initially assigned 3
      PLSs, and subsequently they will be assigned more PLSs when they translated the previous
      ones. Intervention group will receive one customized e-mail reminder two weeks after the PLS
      assignment if they do not translate it within two weeks. If they still do not translate the
      PLS, they will receive another customized e-mail reminder after every two weeks until they
      translate the PLS or until we reach maximum of 4 bi-weekly reminders (at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6
      weeks and 8 weeks post-assignment) or until participants indicate that they are unable to
      translate it anymore. Text of the reminder that will be sent to the study participants is
      available in Supplementary file 1. The reminders will be customized for each PLS, and they
      will contain a name of the PLS indicated in the message. If the participants do not translate
      PLS within 2 months from PLS assignment, we will stop sending them reminders and we will
      consider them as dropouts.

      Control group will receive no intervention, i.e. standard procedure. Participants in the
      control group will receive PLSs for translation, in the frequency they indicated, and they
      will not receive any reminders. They will be assigned new PLSs once they translate the ones
      that were previously assigned.

      All PLSs will be translated in Memsource, a translation management tool that Cochrane plans
      to start using since March 2018 for managing translation of summaries. Participants will be
      followed 6 months from the moment of allocation.
