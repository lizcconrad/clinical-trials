    <textblock>
      The goal of this translational study is to establish a newly emerging CT-based tool for the
      characterization of changes in bone micro-architecture and assessment of their implications
      for fracture-risk in a population of COPD patients at risk for osteoporosis. The tool will be
      suitable and generalizable across emerging CT scanners from different vendors, and it will
      provide a more structurally-based assessment of osteoporosis and bone loss than is provided
      by simple bone density measures. The study will characterize the impact of different
      COPD-related factors on bone structure, and their implications for fracture-risk, leading to
      the development of a COPD-specific model for assessment of fracture-risk that will utilize
      patient-specific demographic, clinical and radiographic data, and CT BMD at the spine, as
      well as bone structural measures at the wrist and/or ankle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This translational study seeks to establish a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD)-specific fracture prediction model using the investigators unique computed tomography
      (CT)-based assessment of peripheral bone micro-architecture. Osteoporosis, a common
      comorbidity among patients with COPD, accelerates morbidity and mortality. The basis for this
      comorbidity is poorly understood, thus the need for characterizing the link between
      COPD-related factors and bone micro-architecture and their association to fracture-risk.
      Multiple COPD-related factors are associated with osteoporosis. Different COPD-related causes
      of bone loss may non-uniformly impact cortical and trabecular bone structures with varying
      mechanical consequences, reflective of divergent COPD-associated fracture-risk in individuals
      with similar bone mineral density (BMD). Little is known about this linkage, and the study
      goal is to fill this knowledge gap using a clinically suitable emerging CT-based tool for
      characterization of bone micro-architecture at peripheral sites. Specifically, this study
      will—(1) establish the generalizability of the investigators bone micro-architecture
      assessment applied to emerging low dose / high resolution CT scanners from different vendors;
      (2) assess its potential as compared to dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to explain
      prevalent fractures and predict incident fractures among patients with COPD; (3) quantify the
      impact of different COPD-related factors on bone structures and their implications for
      fracture-risk; (4) identify COPD subtypes with rapid bone structural degeneration; and (5)
      develop a COPD-specific model for assessment of fracture-risk using patient-specific data.

      The study will take advantage of—(1) existing COPD patient cohorts with lung characterization
      at the University of Iowa (UI) and Columbia University (CU) representing a wide demographic
      range; (2) access to emerging CT scanners at both sites; and (3) unique image processing
      methodologies for quantifying three-dimensional bone structural metrics. The study will
      recruit 470 COPD patients from the UI and CU cohorts and 80 age-sex-similar never-smoker
      controls. At baseline and 3-year follow-up visits, the study team will collect—(1) data
      related to risk factors; (2) a lateral spine CT scout scan to assess vertebral fractures; (3)
      high resolution CT scans of the ankle and wrist for computation of bone structural metrics;
      and (4) whole-body, spine and hip DXA.

      This study will establish an emerging CT-based scanner-independent generalizable tool to
      assess bone response to different therapeutic interventions aimed at slowing or reversing
      bone loss, and possibly restoring bone structure, potentially leading to more
      patient-specific interventions. Also, this study seeks to explain the relationships among
      various COPD-related factors, bone structural changes and their implications for
      fracture-risk.

      Finally, a COPD-specific model for assessment of fracture-risk will be developed that will
      utilize patient-specific demographic, clinical and radiographic data, and CT BMD at the
      spine, as well as bone structural measures at the wrist and/or ankle.
