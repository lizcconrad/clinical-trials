  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure plasma concentrations of bivalirudin in pediatric patients undergoing
      cardiac catheterization, cardiac surgical procedures utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB),
      or extracorporeal support with ECMO, ventricular support devices (VAD) or lung-assist devices
      (LAD). The aim is to understand the pharmacokinetics of bivalirudin in these settings.

    <time_frame>Throughout the duration of treatment with bivalirudin and for one hour after the infusion is stopped. To be specific: 1. In CPB and cath lab cases arm: average 6 hours. 2. In ECLS arm: average 10 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end-point will be the plasma bivalirudin concentration (nanogram/mL) measured at multiple set time-points throughout the administration of bivalirudin in order to delineate the pharmacokinetic profile in the pediatric population.</description>

    <description>CPB: Per hospital protocol, bivalirudin 1 mg/kg IV will be administered to the patient 10 minutes prior to the start of CPB along with an infusion of bivalirudin at 2.5 mg/kg/hr. Additional bolus doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg will be administered for ACTs less than the specified target (either 2 times baseline ACT or &gt; 400 seconds per the discretion of the patient's providers). 50mg of bivalirudin will be administered to the bypass circuit.
Cardiac Catheterization: Bivalirudin will be administered to the patient as 0.75mg/kg IV bolus followed by a 1.75mg/kg/hr infusion for the length of the procedure. Changes in infusion rate or bolus dosing during the procedure and post-procedure will be at the discretion of the patient's care providers.
ECMO/VAD: Dosing will be informed by the hospital's formulary recommendations(http://online.lexi.com/lco/action/doc/retrieve/docid/chibos_f/6317841), but will ultimately be determined by patient's primary provider.</description>
