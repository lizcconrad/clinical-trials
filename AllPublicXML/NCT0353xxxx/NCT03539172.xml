    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, phase II, open label study of radiotherapy concurrent with Apatinib
      Mesylate after surgery in patients with advanced head and neck soft tissue and bone sarcomas.
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib Mesylate
      in patients with head and neck soft tissue and bone sarcomas.
