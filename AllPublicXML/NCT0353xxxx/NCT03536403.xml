  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal diseases often induce gait disorders with multifactorial origins such as lumbar pain,
      radicular pain, neurologic complications, or spinal deformities. However, radiography does
      not permit an analysis of spinal dynamics; therefore, sagittal balance dynamics during gait
      remain largely unexplored. This prospective and controlled study try to assess the Vicon
      system for detecting sagittal spinopelvic imbalance and to determine the modification induced
      by ant induced anterior sagittal imbalance on the kinetics walking parameters
