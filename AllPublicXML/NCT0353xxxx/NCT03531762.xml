  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate in healthy subjects (i) the effect of omeprazole (proton pump
      inhibitor) co-administration on the single dose PK of tepotinib under fed conditions, and
      (ii) the effect of food on the single dose PK of tepotinib after co-administration of
      omeprazole and tepotinib. Furthermore, the study will assess the safety and tolerability of
      tepotinib alone and upon co-administration of omeprazole.
