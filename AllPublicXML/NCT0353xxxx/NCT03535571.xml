    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Salmon Protein Hydrolysate Powder
      (ProGo®) on energy increase and anti-inflammatory modulation in healthy males and females.
      Eligible participants will be asked to consume 1 sachet of ProGo for 128 days and keep a
      study diary. Assessments will be measured at the randomization visit, and the end of study
      visit.
