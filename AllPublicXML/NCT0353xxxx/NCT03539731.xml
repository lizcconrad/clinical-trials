  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well [18F]DASA-23 and positron emission tomography (PET) scan
      work in evaluating pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression in patients with intracranial tumors
      or recurrent glioblastoma and healthy volunteers. PKM2 regulates brain tumor metabolism, a
      key factor in glioblastoma growth. [18F]DASA-23 is a radioactive substance with the ability
      to monitor PKM2 activity. A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of a radioactive
      substance, such as [18F]DASA-23, is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make
      detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the substance is used. Tumor
      cells usually pick up more of these radioactive substances, allowing them to be found. Giving
      [18F]DASA-23 with a PET scan may help doctors evaluate PKM2 expression in healthy volunteers
      and in participants with intracranial tumors or recurrent glioblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the fluorine F 18 DASA-23 ([18F]DASA 23) PET scan signal change from
      pre-therapy to one week after initiation of therapy can predict the tumor's responsiveness to
      therapy and 6 month progression free survival (PFS6), in suspected recurrent glioblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of [18F]DASA-23 PET imaging in
      identifying intracranial tumors in patients with intracranial tumors.

      II. Determine whether the [18F]DASA-23 PET scan signal change from pre therapy to one week
      after initiation of therapy can predict progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS), in suspected recurrent glioblastoma.

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.

      GROUP I: Healthy volunteers receive [18F]DASA-23 intravenously (IV) and undergo brain PET
      scan over 15 minutes and 4 vertex-to-toe PET scans over 30 minutes each.

      GROUP II: Intracranial tumor participants receive [18F]DASA-23 IV and undergo brain PET scan
      over 60 minutes and 1 vertex-to-toe PET scan over 30 minutes.

      GROUP III: Recurrent glioblastoma participants receive [18F]DASA-23 IV and undergo brain PET
      scan over 60 minutes and 1 vertex-to-toe PET scan over 30 minutes. Participants undergo
      second PET scan 7 days after the initiation of therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, intracranial tumor and recurrent glioblastoma
      participants are followed up every 3 months for 12 months.

    <description>Response to treatment is based on the response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria. Each patient will be dichotomized into responding (yes) or not responding (no) to treatment based on RANO criteria. The [18F]DASA-23 PET scan signal will be calculated according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) response criteria guidelines and reported as median and range, both for the entire cohort as well as separately for the responder and non-responder subgroups. The Mann-Whitney test of [18F]DASA-23 PET scan signal between responders and non-responders will be performed.</description>
