    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify the target Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
      population(s) that over express c-Met (c-Met+) best suited for telisotuzumab vedotin therapy
      in the second line or third line setting (Stage 1) and then to expand the group(s) to further
      evaluate efficacy in the selected population(s) (Stage 2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with known epidermal
             growth factor receptor (EGFR) status (wild type or mutant; with site documented
             status), or histologically documented squamous cell NSCLC.

          -  Has locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

          -  Has c-Met+ NSCLC as assessed by an AbbVie designated immunohistochemistry (IHC)
             laboratory.

          -  If a subject meets eligibility criteria for c-Met protein expression level based on
             archival tissue material, subject must agree to submit fresh tumor material for
             assessment of c-Met protein expression level prior to first dose of telisotuzumab
             vedotin

          -  Has progressed or is ineligible for treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy
             doublet, and/or an immune checkpoint inhibitor, or EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor
             (TKI).

          -  Has received no more than 2 lines of prior systemic therapy in the metastatic setting.

          -  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has adenosquamous histology.

          -  Has received anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy,
             immunotherapy, biologic, or any investigational therapy as described in the protocol.

          -  Has known uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system (CNS). Subjects with
             brain metastases are eligible if they meet requirements described in the protocol.

          -  Has a clinically significant condition(s) described in the protocol.
