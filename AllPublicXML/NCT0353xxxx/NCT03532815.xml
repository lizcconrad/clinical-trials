  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the major cause of mortality globally. Applying a
      comprehensive interventional program based on the individual's risk may reduce the incidence
      and complications of CVD; thus, helping to decrease the burden on the healthcare system. This
      study compared the effects of a 3-month intervention involving lifestyle modification and
      physical activity with standard care in women ≥30 years having a moderate-to-high risk of
      CVD, with respect to improving physical activity and cardiovascular disease risk factors at
      the National Guard Residential City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2015. The effects of this
      community-based lifestyle program were assessed through a randomized controlled trial. Women
      in the intervention group (n=31) received health education, exercise training, and diet
      counselling as individuals and in groups according to the participant's risk. Women in the
      control group (n=28) received one health education session at the screening site. The
      Framingham risk score (FRS) was calculated at baseline and at 3 months for both groups. The
      mean participant age was 42±8 years.

    <description>The proportion of individuals with moderate Framingham risk scores (FRS) reducing their risk by 10% and the proportion of individuals with high (FRS) reducing their risk by 25% using the Framingham risk score. It consists of six point scores including age, total cholesterol, smoking status, HDL level, diabetes status, systolic Blood Pressure and Treatment Status. The sum of these points will result in an estimate of the 10-Year risk of developing cardiovascular event and for risk categorization of low (&lt; 10% FRS), moderate (10%-19% FRS), or high risk (≥ 20% FRS).</description>
