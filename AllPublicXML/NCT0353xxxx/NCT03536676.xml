  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether whether the implementation of 'Breakfast in the Classroom'
      improves school breakfast participation and breakfast consumption in middle school
      adolescents; whether the implementation of 'Breakfast in the Classroom' improves appetite
      control, mood, cognitive performance, and unhealthy snacking behavior in middle school
      adolescents; and whether the implementation of a novel 'Higher Protein, 'Egg-cellent'
      Breakfast in the Classroom' leads to additional improvements.

      The investigators propose an 8-week parallel design breakfast study in children enrolled in
      6-8th grade within the Center School District in the Kansas City, Missouri. This school will
      begin their 'Breakfast in the Classroom' program on March 26, 2018. Prior to the start of
      'Breakfast in the Classroom', baseline data will be collected on the students who wish to
      participate in the study. Baseline data includes anthropometric assessments; demographics;
      current eating habits; cognitive performance; appetite; and mood. Following baseline, the
      students will be provided 1 of 2 breakfasts for 8-weeks: 'Breakfast in the Classroom' or the
      'Egg-cellent Breakfast in the Classroom.' At 4 weeks, the study participants will complete a
      sub-set of baseline outcomes. At the end of the 8-week period, similar outcomes (to that of
      baseline) will be completed.

    <measure>Body Mass Index Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 8-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index (units of kg/m^2) will be calculated based on body weight and height of participants. Body weight will be measured to the nearest tenth of a kg using a standard scale. Height will be assessed with a stadiometer or wall ruler (to the nearest tenth of a centimeter). Both procedures will be measured in a private room.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Habitual Breakfast Habits Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks (Post-study)</time_frame>
    <description>During one day, a questionnaire assessing previous breakfast habits will be given to participants. This questionnaire asks how many days per week they consume various breakfast foods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Benefits of Breakfast Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks (Post-study)</time_frame>
    <description>During one day, a questionnaire asking the participants what happens when participants consume breakfast and skip breakfast will be administered. They will be given a list of choices (multiple selections are allowed) and the units for analysis will be binary (they chose it or did not choose it).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Snacking Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks (Post-study)</time_frame>
    <description>During one day, questionnaires assessing typical snacking behavior will be completed once. Participants will be asked to think about what they ate during the past week. They will be asked how many times they ate a variety of foods throughout this week. The students will complete these on their respective Chromebook laptops or will be provided paper copies (if their Chromebook is not available).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Performance Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8-weeks (Post-study)</time_frame>
    <description>During one day, cognitive performance assessments will occur once between 120 min and 180 min after breakfast using the online CNS Vital Signs neurocognitive assessment system during one day. The CNS Vital Signs system contains a battery of computerized tests to assess attention, memory, executive function, and cognitive flexibility. The assessment will occur outside of classroom learning activities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appetite Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4-weeks (Mid-study) , and 8-weeks (Post-study)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires, assessing hunger, fullness, prospective food consumption, and eating initiation, will be completed during the following times for 3 consecutive days: before breakfast, immediately after breakfast, 60 minutes after breakfast, 120 minutes after breakfast, and before lunch. The questions are worded as &quot;how strong is your feeling of&quot; or &quot;how strong is your desire&quot; with anchors of &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; The students will complete these on their respective Chromebook laptops or will be provided paper copies (if their Chromebook is not available). All results will be a number from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 100 (&quot;extremely&quot;) with the unit &quot;of out of 100.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Mood State Questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4-weeks (Mid-study), and 8-weeks (Post-study)</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaires assessing tiredness, sleepiness, energy, irritability/agitation, etc.) will be completed during the following times for 3 consecutive days: before breakfast, immediately after breakfast, 60 minutes after breakfast, 120 minutes after breakfast, before lunch. The questions are worded as &quot;how strong is your feeling of&quot; or &quot;how strong is your desire&quot; with anchors of &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely.&quot; The students will complete these on their respective Chromebook laptops or will be provided paper copies (if their Chromebook is not available). All results will be a number from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 100 (&quot;extremely&quot;) with the unit &quot;of out of 100.&quot;</description>

    <description>Questionnaires assessing whether they ate breakfast or skipped breakfast and what types of foods they ate (if they ate breakfast) will be completed for 5 consecutive days during baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breakfast Plate Waste</measure>
    <time_frame>8-weeks (Post-study)</time_frame>
    <description>For 5 days, the students will be asked to place all uneaten breakfasts into labeled baggies and discard in the bins at the front of the room. Research staff will weigh the meals prior to being delivered to the hallway kiosks and will re-weight the meals once the students are finished with breakfast.</description>
