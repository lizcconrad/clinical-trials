      1.1 Aims：This cohort study aims to investigate the clinical value of Hybrid APC for treatment
      of early central lung cancer.

      1.2 methods：A total of 30 patients with early central lung cancer will be included in this
      open, multicenter, prospective study. Primary observation endpoint is recorded at 3 months
      follow-up, and after 3 months patients could be continued to follow up. The data are
      expressed in terms of mean and percentage. The categorical variables are analyzed by
      chi-square test, and the four table data is analyzed using the exact probability method. The
      continuous variable analysis is used by t test. Statistical analysis is performed with SPSS
      20.0 software. P &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

      Including criteria :

        1. Bronchoscopy and fluorescence bronchoscopy found endoluminal growth lesions of upper
           segmental bronchus. AFB indicates malignant possibility.

        2. Size ≤ 20 mm

        3. Flat, nodule or polypoid type

        4. Negative imaging: HRCT indicates no tumor in lung and lymph node enlargement; or PET-CT
           finds no lesions in lung or suspicious lymph node tumors involve.

        5. Clinical stage: Tis or T1N0M0

        6. High-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (including severe atypical dysplasia and carcinoma
           in situ) or squamous cancer confirmed by biopsy histopathology

        7. High-frequency EBUS indicates the depth of lesions is cartilage endomembrane or internal
           part of adventitia of tracheal membranous part

        8. Patients are not suitable for surgery or refuse surgery

        9. Inform consent is available Exclusion criteria ：

      1) Patients with severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction or other contraindication can not
      tolerate endoscopic examination and treatment 2) Severe bleeding tendency 3) Poor compliance
      4) Unstable vital signs 5) Investigators consider subjects should not be included because of
      specific situations Treatment

        1. Pre-operative regular examination confirms patients with early central lung cancer have
           no contraindications of treatment

        2. The procedure of HybridAPC is seen in &quot;research methods&quot;

        3. Keep endoscopic picture after operations, and record treatment information

        4. Stay in hospital for 1-3 days

        5. Discharge: patients are recommended to pay attention to hemoptysis, chest pain, chest
           distress, chilly and other symptoms. Therapeutic regimen is decided by doctors based on
           patients' conditions and recorded.

    <description>• HybridAPC is integrated with traditional APC and water-jet technique, which has been successfully applied for endoscopic treatment of mucosal lesions in GI, such as Barrett esophageal and lesions in colon. Submucosal injection of water jet can elevate superficial lesion, and then APC can be more effective in ablation of superficial tumor with a protection for muscular layer. The application of HybridAPC in respiratory intervention could theoretically protect cartilage, adventitia, reduce damage and formation of scare, and increase ablation energy to reach radical treatment. • High-frequency EBUS, could display the boundary between cartilage endomembrane and cartilage, in order to determine the depth of tumor.</description>
