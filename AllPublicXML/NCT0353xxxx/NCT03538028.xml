             to resection with curative intent.

          -  Disease progression after treatment with available therapies that are known to confer
             clinical benefit, or intolerant to treatment, or refuse noncurative standard
             treatment. There is no limit to the number of prior treatment regimens.

          -  Participants with advanced or metastatic cervical cancer, MSI-high endometrial cancer,
             gastric cancer (including stomach and GEJ), esophageal cancer, hepatocellular
             carcinoma, melanoma (uveal melanoma excluded), Merkel cell carcinoma, mesothelioma,
             MSI-high colorectal cancer, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, SCCHN, SCLC, RCC, triple-negative
             breast cancer, and urothelial carcinoma, or alternative immunogenic tumor types with
             medical monitor approval. Participants with DLBCL may participate in Part 2 of the
             study.

             biopsies.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Laboratory and medical history parameters outside the protocol-defined range.

          -  Transfusion of blood products (including platelets or red blood cells) or
             administration of colony-stimulating factors (including granulocyte colony-stimulating
             factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or recombinant
             erythropoietin) within 14 days before study Day 1.

          -  Receipt of anticancer medications or investigational drugs within protocol-defined
             intervals before the first administration of study drug.

          -  Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study drug.

          -  Active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past.

          -  Known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment, or
             history of other malignancy within 2 years of study entry. See protocol-defined
             exceptions.

          -  Evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis or history of interstitial lung disease.

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Evidence of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection or risk of reactivation.

          -  Known history of HIV (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-LAG-3 antibody for any indication.
