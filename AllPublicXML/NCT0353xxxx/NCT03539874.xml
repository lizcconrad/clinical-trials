  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress (OS) is characterized by an imbalance between the production of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of the body to eliminate them. Such an imbalance can
      lead to lipid peroxidation, DNA damage and cell apoptosis. Studies have suggested that
      infertile men are more likely to have high concentrations of ROS in their seminal plasma. We
      hypothesize that a high level of oxidative stress (OS) in patients with abnormal sperm
      parameters could influence fertilization and / or pregnancy success. Our first goal is to
      compare OS levels to semen parameters, as defined by the World Health Organization in 2010,
      as well as DNA fragmentation and chromatin decondensation in sperm. Our second objective is
      to compare OS levels in sperm to fertilization and blastulation rates at first, and then
      measure the impact of OS levels on pregnancy success, both in intrauterine insemination (IUI)
      and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Sperm samples from men in 3 groups will be analyzed: a
      group of fertile men with confirmed paternity (n = 50), a group of men in IVF (n = 100) and a
      group of men in their first three cycles of IUI (n = 100). The static oxidation reduction
      index (sORP) will be measured by the MiOXSYS © system, a rapid sperm analysis system using
      electrochemical technology. A small portion of the fresh sperm sample will be deposited on a
      MiOXSYS sensor and the ORP will be measured. Sperm ROS will also be measured using the
      CellROX Deep Red probe. The sperm parameters will be measured by the techniques used
      routinely in the Fertilys Reproductive Health Center andrology lab. Regarding couples in IVF,
      fertilization and blastulation rates, embryo quality and pregnancy success will be noted.
      Pregnancy success will be noted for IUI couples. If the usefulness of sORP levels in
      predicting pregnancy and its outcome is demonstrated, it could be a new marker in the
      diagnosis of male infertility and act as a guide for clinicians to apply appropriate
      treatment.
