  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to compare the success
      rate of IAN block injection carried out with two cartridges of 2% lidocaine with 1:80000
      epinephrine each combined with 0.2 ml dexamethasone versus two cartridges of 2% lidocaine
      with 1:80000 epinephrine each combined with 0.2 ml sterile distilled water for endodontic
      treatment of mandibular molars with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several investigations have been carried out to demonstrate the effect of dexamethasone added
      to local anesthetics in regional block injections. These investigations shown that the
      addition of dexamethasone to local anaesthetics may prolong the duration of anesthesia and
      also results in a faster onset. It is hypothesized that dexamethasone added to lidocaine may
      affect the success rate of inferior alveolar nerve block

    <description>The success of the anesthesia was defined as the tooth without pain or with mild pain according to the Heft-Parker visual analog scale (HP-VAS ≤ 54). This scale is a 170-mm horizontal line, divided into 4 categories. No pain corresponded to 0 mm; mild pain was defined as &gt;0 mm and 54 mm. Mild pain category included faint, weak and mild pain. A score &gt;54 mm and &lt;114 mm indicated moderate pain and included the descriptor of moderate pain. A score &gt;54 mm and &lt;114 mm indicated moderate pain and included the descriptor of moderate pain. Severe pain was defined as ≥114 mm. Severe pain was defined as strong, intense and maximum possible.</description>
