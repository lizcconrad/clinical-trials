  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is still unclear if Lymph Node Yield (LNY) and Lymph Node Ratio (LNR) may have a
      prognostic role in patients affected by carcinoma of the head and neck. Only retrospective
      studies are available. For this reason, this prospective, multi center, observational study
      should provide indications in this regard. Proper stratification by patients characteristics
      will allow to understand if LNY and LNR may enter in the future TNM staging system

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymph node status is a important determinant of survival in patients affected by head and
      neck cancer. The last edition of the AJCC cancer staging manual introduced tumor depth and
      extra nodal extension (ENE) in the staging system for oral cavity, pharynx and larynx sub
      sites. It is still unclear if other factors such as Lymph node yield (LNY) and Lymph Node
      Ratio (LNR) may have a prognostic role and should be implemented in the staging system of
      squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, hypopharynx and larynx. Retrospective studies,
      meta-analyses and a meta-regression seem to indicate that LNY and LNR may have a important
      role in defining the prognosis. This study aims to validate with a appropriate methodology
      the results coming from the retrospective studies and the meta-analyses. This study should
      account for potential biases and should provide proper stratification of the analyzed
      outcomes in order to finally define the exact role and the precise cut-off values of LNY and
      LNR. A proposal of a new staging system will be provided by the results of the present study.
