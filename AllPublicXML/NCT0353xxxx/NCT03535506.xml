  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study which will evaluate the effects of pre-operative treatment of
      DCIS of the breast with palbociclib. Patients with biopsy-proven DCIS are eligible for the
      study.

      There will be 2 independent and unrelated study groups of 12 patients each, for a total of 24
      patients:

        1. Group A, of male or female patients treated with palbociclib single agent (n=12);

        2. Group B, untreated, of male or female patients who consented translational studies in
           blood, as well as diagnostic and definitive surgical specimen, but not the pre-operative
           treatment with palbociclib (n=12).

    <measure>Feasibility: recruitment rates</measure>
    <time_frame>14 - 40 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The approach will be considered feasible if more than 50% of the enrolled patients are treated and followed within protocol rules, if collected samples are suitable for studies, and if pathologic changes are detectable when comparing diagnostic and surgical specimens, or treated and untreated specimens. In Group A, patients will be treated with palbociclib alone, providing the opportunity to address if proposing this kind of treatment for these patients is feasible. Obtaining human data and feasibility data would be key for designing efficacy/definitive studies of palbociclib in DCIS. This will be measured through data collected on eCRFs regarding timeline from consent to treatment, and treatment to surgery, including treatment delivery (beginning date, end date, number of tablets taken) and date of definitive surgery, as well as number of drop outs.</description>
