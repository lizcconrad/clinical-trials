  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At most institutions, the average patient with clinical concern for PE(pulmonary embolism)
      will have a CT angiogram(CTA) with contrast of the lungs performed to evaluate for a clot.
      However, CTA has risks including contrast- induced allergic reactions and nephropathy, as
      well as radiation which has been linked to development of cancer later in life. There is
      literature that has looked at using lower extremity doppler ultrasound first to evaluate for
      a DVT (deep venous thrombosis) in patients where there is concern for a PE. There is also
      literature showing that emergency medicine physicians can perform adequate lower extremity
      compression ultrasounds (LCUS), at the bedside with results similar to that of the ultrasound
      tech. The goal of this project is to fuse both principles by having emergency medicine
      physicians perform LCUS at the bedside, to help reduce CTA utilization in the evaluation of
      PE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the subgroup of hemodynamically stable patients felt to be at moderate to high
      risk for PE will receive a bilateral LCUS before possible CTA/VQ imaging. The LCUS of the
      entire proximal leg including the popliteal fossa will be performed by an emergency medicine
      resident provider in conjunction with their attending. All positive studies will then be
      confirmed with a second ultrasound by the Albany Medical Center's vascular laboratory
      service. Patients with confirmed acute positive studies identifying a DVT will be treated for
      a presumed PE, which is the same treatment as that for the DVT. No CTA will be ordered from
      the ED. They will be anticoagulated and admitted to the hospital, with further management as
      per the inpatient hospital team. Patients with a negative emergency department LCUS done by
      the resident will receive either a CTA or a VQ (ventilation/perfusion) scan as per the
      initial treatment plan established by the attending physician.

      According to this protocol, patients discharged home by default must have had a negative CTA
      or VQ scan, and so PE was effectively ruled out. Therefore they will not require further
      follow up after discharge. However, we will follow patients who were admitted throughout
      their admission course. Through review of medical records, we will take note of any
      complications such as any issues with starting anticoagulation treatment without a CTA,
      misdiagnoses, whether a CTA was ordered later as a part of their course and why, and further
      details.

    <intervention_model_description>In all enrolled patients with concern for pulmonary embolism, a lower extremity ultrasound will be performed at the patient's bedside by the emergency room provider. If it is positive for a deep vein thrombosis, then a confimatory ultrasound will be performed by the vascular lab, and the patient started on anticoagulation to treat both the DVT and presumed PE. No CTA will be obtained in this group. Everyone else who had a negative bedside ultrasound performed by the ER provider will not receive a second ultrasound, but will rather go on to get the CT angiogram of the chest they would have likely received if not in the study.</intervention_model_description>
