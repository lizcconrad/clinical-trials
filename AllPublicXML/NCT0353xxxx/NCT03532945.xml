  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up study for more than 3 years to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of bioactive glass-ceramic intervertebral spacer (Novomax) in posterior lumbar interbody
      fusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During one-level PLIF, bioactive glass-ceramic intervertebral spacer (Novomax) and titanium
      cage were inserted in the experimental group and control group, respectively. Bone fusion by
      simple radiography had angular deformity of less than 3 degrees and a potential of less than
      3 mm in flexion extension radiographs, and thin-section CT (&lt;2 mm) was used to determine the
      combination between the vertebral endplate and the autogenous bone or bioactive glass-ceramic
      intervertebral spacer (Novomax) in the cage without any gaps or the part connected to bony
      trabecula as fusion, and both groups will be compared.
