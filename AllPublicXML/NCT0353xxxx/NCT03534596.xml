  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a population-based cohort study of patients operated for adhesive small bowel
      obstruction during a five-year period (2007-2012) in two Swedish neighboring regions.
      Patients were identified by a broad search of operation and ICD codes. Preoperative data as
      age, gender, co-morbidity, previous surgery was registered as well as mechanisms of
      obstruction and intraoperative data. Short and long-term complications were analyzed.
      Patients were followed to 31st January 2017 , last medical note or death.
