    <description>include the quality of recovery in each domain over the postoperative follow-up period as compared to the same in preoperative period (baseline value) using the postoperative quality of recovery scale. The different domains include physiological (with subdomains: systolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen requirement, airway, agitation, consciousness and ability to lift head, each scoring from 1 to 3), nociceptive ( scoring 1to 5, higher score means more pain), emotional (1 to 5), activity of daily living( 1 to 3), cognitive ( with subdomains orientation(1 to 3), number forward and backward(1 to 6), word task and executive memory) and impact on ability to work(1 to 3)</description>
