  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term effects of walkasins® use on
      clinical and subject-reported outcomes of balance and gait function, quality of life,
      physical activity/participation, pain, and medication use in persons with peripheral
      neuropathy who experience balance problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the current study is to show a long-term (10 weeks) sustained
      improvement in FGA score &gt;4 following walkasins® use as compared to initial baseline
      assessment and to examine a potential relationship between initial baseline assessment data
      and long-term outcome. We believe our finding of a short-term FGA change &gt;4 during walkasins®
      use justifies a pre-post study design to investigate the long-term effects of walkasins® use.

      We also intend to extend our observations of the short-term effects of walkasins® by
      replicating the initial assessment session randomized cross-over design of our previous
      short-term study. This study will help us further refine the prescription criteria for
      walkasins® and understand whether the presence of a short-term response is indicative of
      long-term improvements or not.

    <description>Subjects will first wear walkasins and receive vibrotactile feedback that reflects real changes in center of pressure sway. Following a one-hour rest period, they will be retested with walkasins turned off.
After the baseline visit, subjects will take the devices home for long-term use and return for periodic follow-up visits.</description>

    <description>walkasins® consist of two parts for each leg: the leg unit and the foot pad. The leg unit wraps around the lower leg of the user and contains electronics for reading foot pad pressure signals, a microprocessor, and four vibrating motors that provide gentle tactile sensory cues to the front, back, medial, and lateral surfaces of the user's leg. These cues reflect real-time foot pressure information at a location above the ankle where skin sensation is still present.</description>
