  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Febrile neutropenia is a common complication in pediatric oncology patients. Standard of care
      requires admission of all patients for intravenous antibiotics until cultures are negative,
      patients are afebrile and there are signs of bone marrow recovery. This often results in
      prolonged hospital admissions with significant financial costs, decreased quality of life and
      potential secondary infections. More recent data suggests it may be possible to identify a
      &quot;low risk&quot; group that can be discharged prior to signs of bone marrow recovery. At this time,
      researchers have been unable to identify a model that is safe for early discharge across
      institutions.

      1. Conduct a pilot study to determine the feasibility of using the Karius Assay to risk
           stratify pediatric oncology patients admitted with febrile neutropenia. This will
           provide preliminary data for a larger study which would randomize patients to early
           discharge vs. usual care.

        2. Evaluate the Klaasen and SPOG clinical decision rules with and without the Karius Assay
           to predict patients at low risk for adverse infectious outcomes during admission.
           Adverse infectious outcome will be defined as: positive blood or urine culture,
           radiographic evidence of infection, admission to the intensive care unit or death.

        3. Model potential cost savings of early discharge for patients deemed low risk for an
           adverse infectious outcome.
