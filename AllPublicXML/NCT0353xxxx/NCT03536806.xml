  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, superiority clinical trial
      was to assess clinical efficacy of potassium canrenoate - canrenone in rapid conversion of
      atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Canrenone is a specific antagonist of aldosterone. It is a competitive inhibitor of
      aldosterone receptors and inhibits the effects of aldosterone. Spironolactone is a prodrug
      which is active after its conversion into canrenone. By inhibiting the effects of aldosterone
      it increases aqueous and sodium diuresis and is classified as a diuretic. It decreases
      urinary elimination of potassium and increases urinary excretion of calcium. Canrenone is
      used for the treatment of primary or secondary hyperaldosteronism, edema and ascites of
      congestive heart failure and cirrhosis, and in the treatment of the arterial hypertension.
      Current evidence supports renin-angiotensin-alodsterone (RAAS) inhibition:
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) or,
      potentially, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) as an upstream therapy for atrial
      fibrillation (AF) management. It has been demonstrated that plasma aldosterone concentration
      may be increased in patients with AF episode, and it lowers after cardioversion. Only
      canrenone (potassium canrenoate) may be administered intravenously. Canrenone increases
      plasma level of potassium, lowers blood pressure and reduces preload at the same time.

      To show superiority of canrenone over placebo a sample size of 80 patients was calculated
      based on following assumptions: two-tailed test, a type I error of 0.01, a power of 90%,
      efficacy of placebo 5%, efficacy of canrenone 50% and 20% drop-out rate to fulfill the
      criteria of intention-to-treat analysis. Due to presumed lack of statistical power the
      secondary end points and safety endpoints will be considered exploratory.
