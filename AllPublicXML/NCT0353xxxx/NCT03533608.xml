  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged Exposure therapy (PE) is a first-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder;
      however few VA patients receive this treatment. One of the barriers to PE receipt is that
      this treatment is only available in an individual (one-on-one) format, whereas many VA mental
      health clinics provide the majority of their psychotherapy services in group format. In
      particular, PTSD residential rehabilitation programs (RRTPs) offer most programming in group
      format. Thus, the current study was designed to pilot test a group format of PE in RRTPs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty Veterans who are currently receiving treatment in the PTSD RRTP at a Midwest VA will be
      recruited to participate in a Group PE protocol. Participants will engage in 12, 90-minute
      sessions of Group PE over the course of 6 weeks. Treatment consists of psychoeducation,
      rationale for treatment, and in vivo exposure to reduce trauma-related avoidance and thereby
      improve PTSD symptoms. PTSD symptoms will be measured via the PCL-5. The goal of this pilot
      study will be to determine whether or not it will be feasible to conduct a full-scale trial
      of Group PE in the current setting by testing the process, resources, management, and
      scientific basis of the planned trial. As such, the proposed study will primarily assess
      feasibility outcomes and not efficacy outcomes. The investigators will assess number of
      participants screened, number meeting inclusion criteria, adherence of participants to the
      proposed treatment (measured via number of sessions attended), standard deviation of the
      outcome measure (PCL-5), response rates to questionnaires, and loss to follow-up. The
      investigators will also measure clinicians' adherence to protocol and acceptability of the
      treatment to patients.

    <description>PTSD symptoms will be measured via the PCL-5 at baseline, 6-weeks, and 2-months. The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Patients are asked to rate how bothered they are by each item in the past month on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 0-4 (not at all, a little bit, moderately, quite a bit, extremely). A PCL-5 cut point score of 33 is used for provisional PTSD diagnosis.</description>

    <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured via the PHQ-9 at baseline, 6-weeks, and 2-months. The PHQ-9 is a 9-item self-report measure that assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. Patients are asked to rate the presence of symptoms over the past 2 weeks on a 4-point likert scale ranging from 0-3 (not at all, several days, more than half the days, nearly every day). Total scores ranging from 5-9 indicate mild depression, 10-14 indicate moderate depression, 15-19 indicate moderately severe depression, and 20-27 indicate severe depression.</description>
