  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is reported that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a non-histone nuclear protein, can
      serve as an alarmin with damage associated molecular patterns to activate immune responses in
      the early stages of hemorrhagic shock (HS). However, the origin of HMGB1 and how it is
      released following HS is poorly understood. In this study, we teased out this mechanism. We
      try to record the concentration of serum HMGB1 protein following HS in clinical patients.

      The study was approved by the First People's Hospital of Chenzhou, Hunan, P.R. China. Consent
      was obtained from patients in their hospital course. Eighteen patients were enrolled for each
      group. In addition, Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score
      was used to evaluate the severity and morbidity of HS patients Serial blood samples were
      collected at indicated time points on hospital admission for HS patients (0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and
      72 h following HS). Levels of HMGB1 were detected by ELISA according to the kit
      manufacturer's instructions.

    <ipd_description>Hemorrhagic shock (HS) is a pathologic process caused by insufficient perfusion in multiple organs, and usually initiates a systemic post-traumatic inflammation response. The resulting increased inflammation response may accelerate the multiple organ dysfunctions . Extracellular high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was found to mediate inflammation during sterile and infectious injury and contributes significantly to disease pathogenesis. However, the exact role of HMGB1-mediated inflammation in HS is not fully understood.
In this study, we first test the serum HMGB1 concentration in clinical HS patients and then we explored the underlying mechanism in HS animal model. An unexpected mechanism of HMGB1 released from multiple organs (especially in kidney) was found.</ipd_description>
