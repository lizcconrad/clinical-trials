      This is a retrospective study aimed at establishing a database of the current health of adult
      patients with IEM in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. .

      Background Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of rare disorders caused by genetic
      mutations that affect enzymes of intermediary metabolism. Because adult with IEMs has become
      an emerging and challenging group in Switzerland, this study is intended to assess the actual
      situation of adult patients with IEM in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, namely their
      age, their sex, their diagnosis, age at disease onset and their clinical outcome including
      complications of the disease.

      All adult patients with a biochemical and/or genetic diagnosis of IEM followed at the adult
      metabolic clinic from the Lausanne University Hospital and Geneva University Hospital between
      01.10.2013 to 31.12.2017 will be included in the study. In addition, investigators will also
      include the patients referred to the clinic for suspicion of IEM and determinate if the
      investigation confirmed an IEM disease. Electronic and paper patient charts will be reviewed
      for clinical features, biochemical investigations, molecular genetic testing, diagnostic
      imaging, treatment and long-term outcome. All data will be entered in an Excel database.
