  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome in patients with a midshaft
      clavicle fracture treated with to different techniques. the first one was placing a 3.5mm
      reconstruction plate in the superior side of the clavicle and the second one placing the same
      3.5mm reconstruction plate in the anteroinferior side of the clavicle. the patients had the
      same rehabilitation program and evaluated with functional scores at 30, 60, 90 and 365 days
      after surgery. biomechanical studies have demonstrated more stable construct using an
      anteroinferior plate in clavicle fractures and we were trying to find out if it has a
      clinical relevance in patients with midshaft clavicle fractures.

      clavicle and the second one placing the same 3.5mm reconstruction plate in the anteroinferior
      side of the clavicle.

      the patients had the same rehabilitation program and evaluated with Disabilities Arm Shoulder
      and Hand functional outcome score and Visual Analogue Score for pain at 30, 60, 90 and 365
      days after surgery.
