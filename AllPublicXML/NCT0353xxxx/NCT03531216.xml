  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this prospective crossover, open-label, nonrandomized study are to estimate
      effect sizes of vasodilatation and sense of warmth after application of topical rosemary
      essential oil in patients suffering from systemic sclerosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a crossover design, patients suffering from systemic sclerosis (12 subjects) receive
      applications of olive oil and of 10% Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) essential oil to
      both hands with a wash-out period of 3 hours. Effects on vasodilatation are measured with
      infrared thermography. Patients' sense of warmth is assessed by the &quot;Herdecke warmth
      perception questionnaire&quot;. Measurements take place at baseline and 45 minutes following the
      interventions (pre-post-comparison). To determine within and between-differences, 2-sample
      t-tests will be used and effect sizes will be calculated (Standardized Effect Size).
