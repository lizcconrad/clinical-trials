    <textblock>
      First seconds after birth, new born baby go through physiologic changes to successfully
      adjust to the external environment specially establishment of independent respiration.
      Majority of the organ systems adaptation in newborns occur gradually, but radical and rapid
      cardiopulmonary adaptation must occur for neonates to survive. It is during this period that
      approximately 10% neonates require some level of support in the form of resuscitation.

      A knowledgeable, quick and skillful response by all caregivers is crucial for extra uterine
      survival. Tracheal intubation is performed frequently in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units
      (NICU) and delivery rooms. Neonatal intubation is a critical and time-sensitive procedure,
      and failure deprives the sickest newborns of oxygen.

      Current methods to detect a misplaced esophageal ETT in newborns are suboptimal. Physical
      examination findings are often unreliable, exhaled carbon-dioxide testing is often
      unavailable outside of resource-rich facilities and can lead to false positive results ,while
      chest radiographs are not only time consuming ,labor intensive but also expose vulnerable
      newborn babies to significant radiation However portable ultrasound machines are relatively
      available even in small centers mostly being used in the maternity units, being an
      indispensable tool for managing obstetrics, gynecology and trauma cases.

      POCUS methods of assessing ETT position offer an alternative that is time saving, cheap and
      safe, thereby of critical importance in the neonatal &quot;time-is-brain&quot; scenario.

      Our project aims to demonstrate that POCUS can effectively and accurately detect esophageal
      intubations, and in shorter period of time than current standard-of-care methods that are
      colorimetric end- tidal carbon-dioxide (CO2) detector and chest x-ray.

      Phase 1 would entirely base on training of all newborn care providers. The training phase of
      the study includes two stages:

      Stage 1: It will involve training of new born care providers in detecting esophageal versus
      tracheal intubations using the ultrasound simulator, and then ensure they are able to
      accurately detect this difference using our evaluation tools.

      Experts in POCUS will train neonatal health care providers at Aku.

      Stage 2 : It would comprise of validation and assessment of POCUS competency. For this
      purpose neonatal health care providers that underwent training will perform Ultrasound of
      intubated babies who are hemodynamically stable in NICU, captured images and save them.

      These images will be interpreted in real time by the trainee and validate by trained PI. 10%
      images will be sent to Sick Kids POCUS trainer for revalidation. Health care provider will
      validate at least 10 images correctly to be certified as successfully trained and move to
      Phase 2.

      Phase 2. New-born at The Aga Khan Hospital who requires intubation will be assessed for ETT
      placement via ultrasound and simultaneously with the standard methods. The time required to
      assess a correct endotracheal intubation will be compared between POCUS and standard care
      methods that are colorimetric end- tidal carbon-dioxide (CO2) detector.

      Study population and sample size:

      Phase 1: The training session will be provided to health care providers who attend deliveries
      and exclusively involved in newborn care, which include Neonatal attending, postgraduate
      trainees, neonatal fellows and nursing staffs.

      The POCUS will be done by Fellows, attending and Senior Staff only.

      Phase 2: A Sample size of 292 newborn will be recruited considering these assumptions that in
      the Aga khan university, Hospital Karachi currently has approximately 5,000 deliveries per
      year and 600 infants per year require admission in the NICU (12% of total NICU admissions).

    <description>POCUS methods of assessing ETT location offer an alternative that is time saving and thereby of critical importance in the neonatal &quot;time-is-brain&quot; scenario. Recently the government of Pakistan began upgrading health facilities and ensuring placement of essential equipment required to provide competent medical care, which may include provision of ultrasound machines to areas where there is established benefits to their use. Presence of trained staff and provision of portable ultrasound machine with short start-up time can save newborn lives(12).POCUS method empowers health care providers to read and interpret images in real time thereby saving critical time and need for specialized human resources (radiologists).</description>
