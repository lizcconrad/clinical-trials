  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection continues to be a pandemic, Mexico has around
      184,000 people infected by this virus. A common metabolic problem for these patients is
      oxidative stress (OS), which has been related with the progression of the disease and the
      presence of comorbidities. Pomegranate is a fruit rich in antioxidants, which potentially can
      inhibit or reduce deleterious metabolic compounds resulting from OS; however; it has never
      been tested in patients infected with HIV. The present project was done in patients HIV+ from
      state of Hidalgo in order to see the effects of microencapsulated red pomegranate juice
      (MRPJ) and ascorbic acid (AA) on antioxidant activity and lipid peroxidation both biomarkers
      of oxidative stress. Sixty subjects were recruited, 30 HIV positive (HIV+) and 30 HIV
      negative (HIV-). Three subgroups (n=10) were formed from each group: 1) supplemented with
      (1g/d) MRPJ; 2) supplemented with 1g/d AA; and 3) control group (unsupplemented). The
      intervention lasted 90 days and blood samples were taken four times: at the beginning and
      every 30 days. Antioxidant activity in the blood serum was measured by the DPPH
      (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS + (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic
      acid) methods while lipid peroxidation by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels which was measured by
      TBARS method. The baseline results showed a significant decrease of antioxidant activity in
      HIV+ groups compared to the HIV- groups, although there was no significant difference in
      lipid peroxidation, as measured by MDA assay levels. Several studies suggest that the
      reduction of antioxidant activity is a consequence of the infection and the antiretroviral
      treatment, although the organism tries to reestablish it unbalance it usually fails, thus
      (OS) is significant in these patients. The groups that received AA had antioxidant activity
      greater than the MRPJ treated. MRPJ treatment, however, the groups that received MRPJ had
      significantly reduced lipid peroxidation. Reduced lipid peroxidation could have more
      beneficial effects on HIV+ subjects since the reduction of markers of OS, such as lipid
      peroxidation, has been associated with reductions in the risk of death from HIV.

      Since Patients HIV+ suffer oxidative stress, microencapsulated of red pomegranate juice will
      be evaluated for decreasing oxidative stress in HIV+ patients it will be compared with
      patients treated with ascorbic acid. The supplementation will take 90 days and blood samples
      were taken four times: at the beginning of the study and every 30 days thereafter.
      Antioxidant activity in the blood serum was measured by the DPPH and ABTS+ methods lipid
      peroxidation was measured as stress oxidative markers
