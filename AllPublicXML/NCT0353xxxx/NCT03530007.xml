    <textblock>
      Shivering is one of the most frequent complications occurring during or after spinal
      anesthesia with many side effects. The aim of the present study was to compare between two
      different doses of ondansetron for anti-shivering effect

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shivering is one of the most frequent complications occurring during or after spinal
      anesthesia, it affects about 40%-60 % of patients under spinal anesthesia. Intra and Post
      spinal shivering is distressing for the patients and anesthetist. Shivering may aggravate
      medical conditions in patients with limited cardiac or respiratory functions. It increases
      tissue oxygen demand many folds which in turn leads to increase the load on respiratory and
      cardiac systems to cope with increased aerobic metabolism. Shivering interferes with good
      patient monitoring by causing artifacts of electrocardiography, invasive and non-invasive
      blood pressure, pulse oximetry, etc... . Postoperatively shivering may cause discomfort to
      the patient, increases wound pain by stretching incision, increase the incidence of bleeding
      and infection.

      We aim to compare the prophylactic use of two different doses of ondansetron on the incidence
      of shivering after spinal anesthesia in patients scheduled for lower limb surgery.

      The primary outcome was percentage of patients suffering from shivering after spinal
      anesthesia, secondary outcomes include any side effects related to both doses.
