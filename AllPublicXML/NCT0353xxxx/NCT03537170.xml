  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe tuberculosis (TB) leads to wasting and anorexia, increasing risk of the refeeding
      syndrome (RFS) as defined by current criteria. TB patients have high metabolic rates and
      require a high calorie diet, with nutritional supplementation programs improving outcomes.
      BMI inversely correlates with mortality in these patients. Risk of RFS, a life-threatening
      syndrome associated with initiation of feeding after a period of low intake, has not been
      studied in this population and it is not known whether severely malnourished TB patients
      benefit from lower caloric intake. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of RFS in TB
      inpatients in rural India and correlate this with baseline and inpatient caloric intake.
