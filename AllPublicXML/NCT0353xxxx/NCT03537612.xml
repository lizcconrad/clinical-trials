  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposal is to determine if quantitative sensory testing (QST)
      assessing pain modulation can be used as a clinical tool to optimize perioperative pain
      management. The central hypothesis is that the identification of patient's sensory pain
      profile allows personalizing therapeutic approaches to improve individualized pain management
      and thus prevents pain chronicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if pre-operative QST can identify if
      patients will have high pain intensity peri-operatively and at 6 months post-operatively. We
      will evaluate the intensity and chronicity of pain and the function of the descending
      inhibitory system through a short QST procedure before surgery and six months after surgery.
      In addition, we will evaluate the patient's physical and emotional functioning, and explore
      the potential biological underlying mechanisms at the same time points.

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine if the peri-operative use of an alpha-2
      adrenergic receptor agonist enhances the efficacy of the descending inhibitory system of
      patients with sub-optimal CPM efficacy before surgery by decreasing pain after surgery.
      Consequently, this pharmacological intervention may also reduce the incidence of acute and
      chronic pain after surgery. We will evaluate the pain intensity and the function of the
      descending inhibitory system through a short QST procedure six weeks after surgery and six
      months after surgery in patients receiving Clonidine or placebo during the perioperative
      period. We will also evaluate the patient's physical and emotional functioning, and explore
      the potential biological underlying mechanisms at the same time points.

      We will also evaluate the potential biomechanical alterations in 3D related to pain in
      children reporting presence of back pain pre and post spine surgery.

      Our hypothesis is that patients undergoing spine surgery with poor inhibitory pain response
      will have less pain in the immediate and long-term period when treated prophylactically with
      Clonidine in the perioperative period.
