  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, prospective cohort study was used to collect the general information of
      patients' sex, age, previous history, family history, electrocardiogram, echocardiography,
      cardiac biomarkers TnT, BNP, biochemical examination, and clinical treatment of the patients
      who diagnosed cancer by pathology in National Cancer Center/ Cancer Hospital , Chinese
      Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College from January 2018 to December
      2020. This study intends to evaluate and screen the cardiovascular risk of tumor patients
      during antitumor therapy and to establish a model of cardiovascular risk assessment for tumor
      patients, providing clinical evidence for the prevention of cardiovascular disease risk
      associated with cancer patients.
