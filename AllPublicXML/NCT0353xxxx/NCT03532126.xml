  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation aims to confirm the safety and effectiveness of Princess VOLUME PLUS
      Lidocaine in midface volume deficit augmentation and includes a long term safety followup.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will evaluate subjects treated with Princess VOLUME PLUS
      Lidocaine for midface volume deficit augmentation. A touch-up treatment will be allowed, on
      discretion of the treating investigator, if the initial treatment didn't provide optimal
      correction. The effectiveness parameters will be evaluated based on a validated scale for
      midface volume deficit scale and confirmed by use of patient reported outcome questionnaires
      as well as based on photographs to be evaluated by an independent evaluator.

             bleeding/bruising is discharged after consultation with subject's physician who had
             prescribed such medicine.

          7. Cutaneous, inflammatory and/or infectious processes (e.g., acne, herpes) in the area

          9. History of other aesthetic/surgical treatment which may interfere with performance
             evaluation.

         10. Current or previous (within 30 days of enrolment) treatment with another
             investigational drug and/or medical device or participation in another clinical study.
