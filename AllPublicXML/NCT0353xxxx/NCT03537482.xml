  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-agent, open-label, Phase I study of APG-2575. The study
      consists of the dose escalation stage and the dose expansion stage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      APG-2575 will be administered orally, once daily for consecutive 4 weeks as one cycles.
      Initially, the start dose is 20mg. Single patient cohorts will be evaluated, the dose of
      APG-2575 will be increased in subsequent cohorts, to 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg, 600mg and
      800mg accordingly. If there is any one of the following event is observed, a DLT, two drug
      related Grade 2 toxicities or one drug related ≥ Grade 3 toxicity, or laboratory or clinical
      TLS, or suspected hypersensitivity reaction occur in Cycle 1, or dose level of 400 mg is
      reached, the dose escalation will convert to the standard 3+3 design, If ≥ 2/6 patients
      develop DLT at any dose level dose escalation will cease and the dose level immediately below
      will be expanded to 6 patients. If ≤ 1/6 patients develop a DLT at the highest dose reached
      this will be declared the MTD. After the MTD is defined, a maximum of 20 patients will be
      treated at that dose level.
