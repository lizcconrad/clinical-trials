    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VEE vaccine, C-84,
      TSI-GSD 205, Lot 7, Run 1, and collect data on the incidence of occupational VEE infection in
      vaccinated personnel.

      Venezuelan Equine Encephalomyelitis Vaccine, Inactivated, Dried, C-84, TSI-GSD 205, Lot 7,
      Run 1, to be administered as dose(s) of 0.5 mL given subcutaneously in the upper outer aspect
      of the triceps area. Subjects who showed an initial immune response ≥ 1:20 to TC-83 and whose
      titer decreased over time or who rollover from a previous VEE C-84 protocol will receive a
      single 0.5 mL booster dose of C-84 vaccine. Subjects who were initial non-responders (&lt; 1:20)
      to TC-83 will be given subcutaneous 0.5 mL injections on Days 0, 28-35, and 56-63.

      Duration of participation is 12-15 months if the subject demonstrates a PRNT80 of ≥1:20 at 1
      year; if not, the vaccination procedure with C-84 will be repeated with a minimum of 28 days
      between doses. A maximum of four booster doses will be given in a year. If the PRNT80 titer
      is &lt; 1:20 after four booster doses in any 12-month period, the subject's participation in the
      study will be placed on hold for 12 months; titers will be repeated at 1 year (± 30 days),
      and, if required, the subject will be given a booster dose of C-84 vaccine.

      Safety endpoint measurements will be evaluated for all subjects receiving at least one
      vaccination under this protocol regardless of compliance with the protocol. Immunogenicity
      endpoints will be evaluated for subjects who have been vaccinated in compliance with the
      protocol and who have had blood for titers drawn in compliance with the protocol.
