  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of brigatinib by confirmed
      objective response rate (ORR) by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]), in participants with ALK+ locally advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC whose disease has progressed on therapy with alectinib or ceritinib.

      The drug being tested in this study is called brigatinib (AP26113). Brigatinib is being
      tested to treat people who have anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+), advanced
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      The study will enroll approximately 103 patients. Participants will be assigned to the
      treatment group:

      • Brigatinib

      All participants will be asked to take brigatinib 90 mg tablet in lead-in period for 7 days,
      followed by brigatinib 180 mg at the same time each day throughout the study.

      This multicenter trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 5 years, but the total sample size and study duration may be adjusted
      according to preliminary data from interim analysis. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic, and 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose (approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.</description>

    <time_frame>First dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose (approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 incorporates 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 28 questions (4-point scale where 1=Not at all [best] to 4=Very Much [worst]) and 2 questions (7-point scale where 1=Very poor [worst] to 7= Excellent [best]). Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status scale, higher scores represent better quality of life (QOL); for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL.</description>

    <time_frame>First dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose (approximately 5 years)</time_frame>
    <description>HRQOL scores will be assessed with EORTC, its lung cancer module QLQ-LC13. QLQ-LC13 contains 13 questions assessing lung cancer-associated symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and site-specific pain), treatment-related side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia), and use of pain medication. Scale score range: 0 to 100. Higher symptom score = greater degree of symptom severity.</description>
