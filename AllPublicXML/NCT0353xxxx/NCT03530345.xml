  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of intravenous neridronic
      acid in subjects with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).

      The trial consists of an Enrollment Period lasting up to 60 days, Treatment Period A
      consisting of 4 infusions (neridronic acid or placebo) over 10 days, and a Follow-up Period 1
      until Week 26.

      At Week 26, participants not meeting the pre-specified criteria to continue into Treatment
      Period B will continue in Follow-up Period 2 until Week 52. Participants meeting the
      pre-specified criteria will enter the open-label Treatment Period B with 4 additional
      infusions (neridronic acid) over 10 days and follow-up visits until Week 52.

    <description>Dynamic mechanical allodynia: a tactile stimulus is applied in a single sweeping motion (1 cm to 2 cm length) on the skin on the affected limb.
The participants are asked to judge the stimulus intensity by means of an NRS (0 to 10). &quot;0&quot; in this case means &quot;no pain&quot;. Each &quot;pricking&quot;, &quot;stinging&quot; or &quot;burning&quot; sensation is defined as a painful sensation, which should always be evaluated by giving a value greater than &quot;0&quot;. &quot;10&quot; corresponds to the individual maximum pain imaginable.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline (Visit 2 [Day 1]) to Visit 8 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure pain threshold: using a pressure algometer (contact area 1 cm2), the threshold for pressure-induced pain is measured on the thenar muscle/abductor hallucis muscle in 3 series of slowly increasing stimulus intensities (at a rate of about 50 kPa/s). The threshold is then determined as the arithmetic mean of the 3 series (in kPa).
The ratio of the thresholds of the affected limb versus the unaffected limb will be calculated.</description>

    <description>In participants with the CRPS sign of edema on the CRPS severity score at baseline, circumference of the hand or foot will be measured by the investigator with measurement tape using the figure-of-eight method at both the affected limb and the contralateral unaffected limb. Each measurement will be performed 3 times. The average of the 3 measurements will be used for further analysis.
The ratio of the averages of the affected limb versus the unaffected limb will be calculated.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent signed.

          -  Male or female participant at least 18 years of age at Visit 1.

          -  A diagnosis of CRPS according to the clinical diagnostic criteria recommended by the
             International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP; &quot;Budapest clinical criteria&quot;),
             assessed at Visit 1. Signs and symptoms of CRPS must apply to an affected limb (arm or
             leg) and must demonstrate asymmetry with respect to the contralateral limb. The CRPS
             duration must be 2 years or less since onset of symptoms.

          -  A baseline average pain intensity score of greater than or equal to 4 using an
             11-point NRS, referring to the CRPS-affected limb (average of pain recorded over 7
             days). The baseline average pain intensity score will be calculated automatically by
             the electronic diary, which must be checked prior to allocation at Visit 2. A
             participant who has not met average baseline pain intensity requirements (at least 4
             average pain intensity ratings) due to lack of compliance with the electronic diary
             may be rescheduled for Visit 2 (1 time only), with appropriate re-training to ensure
             compliance with use of the electronic diary.

          -  In stable treatment and follow-up therapy for CRPS for at least 1 month prior to
             allocation to treatment (Visit 2). Participants must have failed attempts with at
             least 2 available treatments for CRPS, 1 of which must have been a pharmacologic
             treatment.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine Beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (ß-HCG) pregnancy test at Visit 1 and must be using 2 forms of medically
             acceptable contraception, including at least 1 highly effective method of
             contraception with a low failure rate, defined as less than 1% per year, and a second
             medically acceptable method such as use of condoms with spermicide by their male
             partner. A barrier method alone is not acceptable. Highly effective methods of
             contraception must be used for at least 1 month prior to Visit 2 and for the duration
             of the trial. Male participants must use condom and spermicide during intercourse and
             must take care that the female sexual partner uses at least 1 additional method of
             contraception with a low failure rate defined as above, starting with Visit 2 until at
             least 4 weeks after the last Investigational medicinal product (IMP) infusion.

          -  Participants must be able to communicate meaningfully, be able to differentiate with
             regard to location and intensity of the pain, and be able to answer the questions in
             the questionnaires used in this trial (assistance in filling out the questionnaires
             may be provided, if required due to motor or other physical impairment).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             ratio [ACR] greater than 150 mg/g), based on central safety laboratory data obtained
