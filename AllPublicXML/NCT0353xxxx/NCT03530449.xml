      The objectives of this study are to:

        1. Assess the repeatability and reproducibility of the SPECTRALIS with OCTA Module image
           quality

        2. Assess the repeatability and reproducibility of visibility of key anatomical vascular
           structures in the SPECTRALIS with OCTA Module

    <description>OCT Angiography offers clinicians a non-invasive three-dimensional visualization of vasculature in the retina and choroid. The visualization of perfused vasculature in a three-dimensional layout, offers clinicians an aid in the identification of retinal and choroidal pathologies such as retinal ischemia, microaneurysms, retinal neovascularization and choroidal neovascular membranes.</description>

      <textblock>
        Pathology Population:

        Subjects included should have a range of retinal vascular pathologies likely to appear in
        OCTA imaging, affecting different anatomic depths through the retina and choroid. Retinal
        vascular conditions including but not limited to diabetic retinopathy, wet age-related
        macular degeneration (AMD), and branch or central retinal vein occlusion that give rise to
        features such as retinal ischemia, microaneurysms, choroidal neovascularization and retinal
        neovascularization will be included.

        Normal Population:

        In order to be included in the Normal population, subjects will have to meet all
        inclusion/exclusion criteria for both eyes. Subjects with a history of ocular surgical
        interventions will be excluded except for those with refractive and/or cataract surgery.

             and follow instructions.

          -  Age ≥ 22

        Subjects with Normal Eyes:

          -  Corrected visual acuity ≥ 20/40 in each eye

        Subjects with Pathology:

          -  Subjects with vascular retinal conditions in at least one eye

          -  Subjects included should have a range of retinal vascular pathologies likely to appear
             in OCTA imaging, affecting different anatomic depths through the retina and choroid.
             Retinal conditions including but not limited to diabetic retinopathy, wet age-related
             macular degeneration (AMD), and branch or central retinal vein occlusion that give
             rise to features such as retinal ischemia, microaneurysms, choroidal
             neovascularization and retinal neovascularization will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All Subjects:

          -  Subjects unable to read or write

             imaging

          -  Subjects who cannot tolerate the imaging procedures

          -  Subjects with contraindication to pupillary dilation in the study eye

          -  Subjects with Normal Eyes:

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled systemic conditions, or ocular disease, as determined by
             the Investigator, during the eye exam and CFP

          -  History of ocular surgical intervention (except for refractive or cataract surgery) in
             either eye
