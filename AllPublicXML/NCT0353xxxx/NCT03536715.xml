        The sample recruited will reflect the target KAMRA inlay patient population. Thus, a
        minimum of 20 subjects (up to 50 subjects to achieve saturation) who have been implanted
        with the KAMRA inlay will be recruited from up to 5 sites across the US. Subjects with a
        range of post-operative experience, satisfaction, visual symptoms, ages and educational
        abilities will be recruited. In addition, subjects who are of non Caucasian ethnicity will
        be included.
