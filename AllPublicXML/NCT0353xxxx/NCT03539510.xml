    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of an interactive website on advance care planning for
      patients living with heart failure (HF-ACP website). The investigators will randomize
      patients to either the HF-ACP website or usual care to determine if the participants who use
      the HF-ACP website have higher advance care planning completion rates than participants
      assigned to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning is a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health to
      understand and share their personal values, life goals and preferences in order to prepare
      for future decisions regarding medical care. Public awareness campaigns to promote ACP have
      been taking place for about 10 years without significant improvements in ACP completion
      rates. Content intended for use by the general public may be too vague for those living with
      a chronic illness. Framing ACP within the context of a specific disease may provide the
      impetus for a person to engage in ACP. The investigators believe the HF-ACP website will
      improve patient understanding of the life-limiting nature of HF, the ACP process and the need
      to plan ahead to help ensure the care they receive matches their treatment preferences.

    <description>The HF-ACP website leads participants through 4 e-learning modules. Each module contains 3 core elements: (1) educational content which provides information and support to help patients complete the module (2) interactive tools for documenting their thoughts and progress and (3) motivational video clips that encourage behavior change by validating participants ambivalence, suggesting strategies to help participants complete the task and to encourage and reassure participants that they can do this.</description>

    <description>The standard of care for advance care planning at our institution is the &quot;Speak Up&quot; booklet and the Power of Attorney workbook from the Attorney General's Office - Ontario. Patients randomized to the Control arm will be asked to register on a separate research portal where participants will have electronic access to both of the booklets and a link to the Speak Up online Interactive workbook. There is no specific information on HF or HF treatments. Participants in the control arm will be asked to complete the ACP using the interactive workbook. Participants in the control arm will not receive any additional communication from the research team about their progress.</description>
