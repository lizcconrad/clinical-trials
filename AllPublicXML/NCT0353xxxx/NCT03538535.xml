  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test a computational model reinforcement learning in depression and anxiety
      and test the extent to which the computational model predicts response to an adapted version
      of behavioral activation psychotherapy. The model will be based on a data from a computer
      task of reinforcement learning during 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dysfunction of reinforcement learning is emerging as a transdiagnostic dimension of mood
      and anxiety. Computational models of reinforcement learning may expedite our ability to
      identify predictors of response, thereby improving efficacy rates. We will will, first,
      examine the neural substrates of reinforcement learning in depression and anxiety, and,
      second, test a computational model of reinforcement learning as a predictor of response to an
      adapted version of behavioral activation psychotherapy. Subjects (N=10) will be enrolled in a
      two week evaluation, followed with a nine week weekly intervention program. Assessments will
      be conducted at baseline, and during the intervention as the 3-, 6-, 9-week follow-ups.
      Reinforcement learning will be measured using 3T magnetic resonance imaging during a computer
      task. All other measures include structured clinical interviews, questionnaires, and computer
      tasks.
