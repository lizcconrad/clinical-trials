  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral tramadol 50 mg in reducing pain
      during the colposcopy-directed cervical biopsy.half of the patients will receive oral
      tramadol tablets and the other half will receive a placebo.

      .Colposcopy-directed cervical biopsy (CDB) is a procedure performed in women with abnormal
      Papanicolaou smear or abnormal human papillomavirus (HPV) testing whose cervical lesions are
      colposcopically identified. Generally, no anaesthesia is needed for the procedure which can
      be done on an outpatient basis.The degree of pain associated with this procedure varies from
      mild to severe and many studies suggested that pain levels are often high reaching a score of
      more than 40 points on a 100-point visual analogue scale (VAS). Tramadol hydrochloride is an
      orally active centrally acting synthetic opioid. It is an atypical analgesic with a dual
      mechanism of action: serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and modest l-opioid
      agonist. It has a lower incidence of respiratory depression, cardiac depression, side effects
      on smooth muscle and abuse potential as compared to typical opioid agents

    <description>the mean patient-described pain level will be measured with the visual analogue scale (VAS). Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-10. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. Subjects will be told that the far left point will represent &quot;no pain &quot;and the far right point will represent &quot;the worst pain you can imagine.&quot; They will be asked to mark a vertical line on the visual analogue scale during the procedure to note levels of discomfort.</description>
