  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mineral density and alterations in bone
      microarchitecture, leading to bone fragility and high risk of fractures. In the
      peri-menopausal period and during menopause, estrogen deficiency is responsible for an
      acceleration of bone remodeling. It is therefore important to sensitize women to this
      pathology at the beginning of menopause.

      Osteoporosis is a public health issue with more than 3 million women in France suffering from
      almost ¼ of the population over 50 years old. Paradoxically, the number of bone densitometry
      and prescribed osteoporosis drugs are decreasing. There is an under-screening and a
      disinterest of the pathology on the part of the medical world and the patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that women lack knowledge about osteoporosis. This study will
      identify these gaps, and put in place appropriate strategies to improve this knowledge.

      For this purpose, a descriptive cross-sectional observational study will carry out, through
      the fulfillment of self-administered questionnaire for women over 30 years old. The main
      objective is to assess the knowledge of women, about osteoporosis and its consequences. The
      judgment criterion is based on a percentage of correct answers per question. The interests of
      the study are to identify gaps in knowledge, to optimize the investigator's therapeutic
      education, to fight patient wait-and-see and false beliefs, and finally to improve adherence
      and longer-term adherence.

      This is a descriptive cross-sectional observational study, recruiting women over 30 years
      old, by the diffusion of the questionnaire in the general practices of Champagne-Ardenne, and
      the rheumatology department of CHU de Reims.

      The main objective of the study is to assess the knowledge of women over 30 on osteoporosis
      and its consequences. The judgment criterion is a calculation of the percentage of correct
      answers per question. The investigation plan is based on a self-administered questionnaire
      survey .The statistical analysis plan is based on a descriptive analysis with sorting flat
      and sorted; The questionnaires will be disseminated from March 2018 to May 2018, with the
      valuation of results on June 1, 2018.

      This questionnaire includes:

        -  6 questions relating to the patient : risk of osteoporosis and specific management.

        -  17 questions about osteoporosis knowledge

        -  8 questions about information resources received on osteoporosis ( media, general
           practitioner …) The questionnaire will be accompanied by a cover letter and a consent
           form. The filling of the questionnaire should last between 5 and 7 minutes. The patient
           will then give back the questionnaire directly to the person who has offered him to fill
           it out (general practitioner, rheumatologist, nurse).

      The questionnaires will be placed in waiting rooms of doctors, dentists, and paramedics of
      the Marne, the Ardennes, and the Aube.
