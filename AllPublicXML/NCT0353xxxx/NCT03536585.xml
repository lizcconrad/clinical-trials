  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the use of multi-polar radiofrequency (RF) and pulsed electro-magnetic
      fields (PEMF) energies for the treatment of vaginal looseness and for the treatment of the
      mons pubis and labia for skin tightening. All subjects will receive a total of three internal
      and three external treatments at four week intervals. Subjects will be followed up at one and
      four months after treatment is complete.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional non-surgical treatments to treat vaginal looseness include Kegel exercises or
      pelvic floor therapy with electrical stimulation of the vaginal muscles to promote muscle
      strength but may not be all that effective. Surgery is also used to tighten the vaginal canal
      and reduce the size of the mons pubis and the outer labial lips but can be associated with
      surgical complications. Development of new technologies to address these concerns is
      warranted.

      Mutil-polar radiofrequency (RF) therapy to treat stress incontinence (attributed to looseness
      of the muscles that control the ability to hold urine) and looseness of the facial and neck
      skin has been used with success and minimal risk. The addition of pulsed electromagnetic
      field (PEMF) energy to multi-polar RF therapy has also been shown to improve the results of
      the RF therapy.

      RF therapy has already been reported to be successful in vaginal tightening. This study will
      investigate whether adding PEMF to RF therapy is safe and efficacious for the treatment of
      vaginal loosenss. In addition, this study will also investigate whether RF and PEMF energy
      treatment will improve the looseness of the mons pubis and labia.
