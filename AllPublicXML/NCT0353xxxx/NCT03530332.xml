  <brief_summary>

      This research study is being done to find out whether a screening blood test can help
      identify women with an increased risk of preterm birth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and long-term disability
      throughout the world. Recently treatments early in pregnancy such as progesterone, cervical
      support and maternal support have been demonstrated to delay delivery amongst at risk women.
      Nonetheless, the majority of women who are at risk are not identified using current screening
      methods.

      Women who are 18 years or older, with a singleton pregnancy between 19 5/7 weeks and 20 6/7
      weeks gestational age (GA) confirmed by ultrasound prior to enrollment and no history of
      prior preterm birth (delivery between 16 0/7 weeks and 37 6/7 weeks) will be invited to
      participate. Women who enroll will be randomized to screening and intervention for those at
      high risk of PTB or no screening and standard care. All participants will undergo sample
      collection, but the samples from the group randomized to &quot;no screening' will not be analyzed
      until the end of the study (post-delivery of all neonates).

      Women randomized to the intervention group will be screened using the PreTRMÂ® test (Sera
      Prognostics, Inc.) at a large tertiary care center. Predicated upon the degree of risk, women
      will be treated according to a pre-specified algorithm. The outcomes of these women will be
      compared to a control group of women who do not receive screening at the same tertiary care
      center.
