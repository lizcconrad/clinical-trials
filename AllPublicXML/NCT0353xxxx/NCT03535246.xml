    <textblock>
      Malignant tumor is still a major challenge in medicine and requires technology breakthrough,
      and its mortality rate is the highest among all diseases. World Health Organization and the
      American Cancer Association expect about 12 million new cancer patients worldwide each year,
      with about 8 million cancer deaths (20 thousand cancer deaths per day). At present, more than
      20 million people are suffering from cancer, and this figure will increase to 75 million in
      2030. In Asia, the incidence of cancer is expected to rise by 60% in 2020, and the number of
      cancer related deaths will reach 7 million annually in 2030. The incidence of lung,
      Intestine, breast, prostate and gastric cancer is high, and lung, Intestine, breast and liver
      cancer are the main causes of cancer related deaths in Asia.

      Adoptive immunotherapy based on cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive with specific antigens has
      proven to be effective. In vitro induction of tumor antigen-specific immune cells and
      engineering of target specific immune cells have great potential for cancer eradication. The
      study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ex vivo manipulated EIE cells including
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified immune cells in treating cancer. The primary study
      objectives are to evaluate the safety of the investigational product, autologous EIE cells,
      to subjects by intravenous and intratumoral injection. The secondary study objectives are (1)
      to evaluate the success rate of generating autologous EIE cells ex vivo, and (2) to determine
      the anti-cancer efficacy of the EIE cells.

    <description>Objective response (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
