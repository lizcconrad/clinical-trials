  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate pressure algometry and pressure-induced
      referred pain areas in pain free individuals with a history of distal radius fracture (fully
      recovered) compared with age and gender matched healthy controls without history of fracture.
      It is hypothesized that individuals with a recovered radius fracture will have a facilitated
      referred pain patter towards the wrist but normal pressure pain sensitivity.

      Musculoskeletal injuries, nociception and pain can increase the sensitivity of the central
      pain mechanisms, which can be extended even after tissue recovery. However, little is known
      about the status of these central pain mechanisms once subjects are fully recovered from the
      tissue injury and pain. This information would help to explain pain conditions in which
      recurrence of the pain episodes is common (e.g low back pain or shoulder pain).

      Pressure-pain thresholds have been widely used in pain research to test the sensitivity of
      the pain system. Additionally, referred pain has been shown as a valid biomarker for the
      sensitization of the pain system.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate pressure pain sensitivity and referred pain
      patterns of individuals with a history of recovered fracture, compared with healthy controls.

    <description>The interventions will be conducted on both groups, on two experimental (approximately 45 minutes per session) sessions separated by 24 hours.Pressure algometry consists of measuring pressure pain thresholds at three bilateral muscle sites.Mapping referred pain areas consists of recording on an electronic body chart the area of pain induced by 60s pressure stimulation at 1.2 times the force needed to reach the pressure pain threshold, exerted on the extensor carpi radialis and the infraspinatus muscles.As group-differences can be attenuated at baseline but emerge on a sensitized (exercise-induced soreness) state, these procedures are performed at baseline and 24 hours after evoking exercise-induced muscle soreness.
