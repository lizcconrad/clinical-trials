    <textblock>
      Background:

      The drug olaparib may stop cancer cells from fixing damage to their DNA. It has been approved
      to treat certain cancers in people that were born with a mutation in the BRCA gene. It has
      not been approved for treating mesothelioma. But some people with mesothelioma have mutations
      in a gene, BAP1 related to BRCA. Researchers want to see if olaparib can work in patients
      with mutations in this gene. They also want to see if works on mutations in other genes or
      patients without any mutations. They want to see if olaparib causes mesothelioma tumors to
      shrink.

      Objective:

      To study the effect of olaparib on mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with malignant mesothelioma that has already been treated

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with

      Sample of tumor tissue or fluid

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, heart, and urine tests

      Scans and x-rays

      Participants will give blood and tissue samples. These will be genetically tested.

      The study will be done in 21-day cycles.

      Participants will take tables of the study drug 2 times each day. They will get information
      on what food and drugs to avoid during the study. They will get information about birth
      control. They will keep a diary of doses and symptoms.

      Participants will have blood and urine tests and scans every few weeks.

      Participants will be told any important genetic testing results.

      Participants will stay in the study until their disease gets worse or the participant or
      their doctor chooses to stop it.

      About 30 days after stopping the study drug, participants will have a follow-up visit. They
      will have a medical history, physical exam, blood tests, and scans.

      Some participants will continue to have scans every 6 weeks.

      Background:

        -  Malignant mesothelioma is an invasive and often fatal neoplasm that arises from
           mesothelium that lines several organs.

        -  Recent studies have identified germline mutations in the gene encoding BRCA1 associated
           protein-1 (BAP1) which can predispose to mesothelioma

        -  In addition to mesothelioma, germline BAP1 mutations confer increased susceptibility for
           the development of several other tumors including uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma,
           renal cell cancers and possibly other cancers

        -  In addition to BAP1, we found several novel germline variants that have previously not
           been associated with risk of developing mesothelioma.

        -  As evidenced by recent data derived from ovarian and prostate cancer patients, mutations
           in DNA repair genes can define subgroups of cancer patients with distinct
           vulnerabilities to DNA damage response inhibitors.

        -  Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor indicated as monotherapy in patients with deleterious or
           suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutated

        -  Both established and patient derived mesothelioma cell lines with mutated DNA repair
           genes are sensitive to olaparib.

      Objective:

      -Determine the efficacy with respect to objective response rate of olaparib in patients with
      malignant mesothelioma based on somatic or germline mutation status of DNA repair genes

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have progressive, histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant
           mesothelioma.

        -  Age &gt;18 years

        -  Patients must have received prior platinum and pemetrexed based therapies

        -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II, single center study of olaparib in subjects with malignant
           mesothelioma

        -  All subjects will take olaparib by mouth twice daily until disease progression or
           intolerable side effects

        -  Subjects will be assessed for safety (continuously) and efficacy (every 6 weeks)

        -  Subjects will be analyzed in 3 separate comparison groups according to their mutation
           status

             -  Comparison Group 1: Patients with a germline mutation in DNA repair genes

             -  Comparison Group 2: Patients with BAP1 somatic mutations

             -  Comparison Group 3: Patients with neither germline mutations nor BAP 1 somatic
                mutations

        -  Up to 30 evaluable subjects will be enrolled

          -  Pre-clinical data indicate that olaparib can have adverse effects on embryofetal
             survival and development. It is further not known whether olaparib or its metabolites
             are found in seminal fluid. For these reasons:

          -  Women of childbearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must
             agree to the use of 2 highly effective forms of contraception in combination (male
             condom plus one other method or must totally/truly abstain from any form of sexual
             intercourse. This should be started from the signing of the informed consent,
             throughout their participation in the study and for at least 1 month after the last
             dose of olaparib.

          -  Male patients must use a condom during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose
             of olaparib when having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of
             childbearing potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly
             effective form of contraception if they are of childbearing potential. Male patients
             should not donate sperm throughout the period of taking olaparib and for 3 months
             following the last dose of olaparib.

          -  Acceptable birth control methods:

               -  Total sexual abstinence i.e., refrain from any form of sexual intercourse in line
                  with the patients usual and/or preferred lifestyle. Abstinence must be for the
                  total duration of the study treatment and for at least 1month (for female
                  patients) or 3 months (for male patients) after the last dose of study treatment.
                  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
                  methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

               -  Vasectomised sexual partner PLUS male condom. With participant assurance that
                  partner received post-vasectomy confirmation of azoospermia.

             cobicistat, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate
             CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole,
             verapamil). The required washout period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks.

          -  Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, enzalutamide,
             phenytoin, rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John s
             Wort) or moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required
             washout period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital
             and 3 weeks for other agents.

             patients must have recovered from any effects of any major surgery.

          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study
             medication.

          -  Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung
             disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric disorder
             that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because olaparib has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women must either be post-menopausal or must
             have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) less than or equal to 28 days prior to
             enrollment and confirmed on day 1 of cycle 1 of study therapy. Postmenopausal is
             defined as:

        Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonaltreatments

        Luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the
        post-menopausal range for women under 50 years of age

        chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt;1-year interval since last menses

        surgical sterilisation (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with olaparib, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with olaparib.

          -  Immunocompromised patients are excluded.

          -  Patients who are known to be serologically positive for human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV). This includes HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy due to the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with olaparib.

          -  Patients with known active hepatitis (i.e. Hepatitis B or C) due to risk of
             transmitting the infection through blood or other body fluids

          -  Previous allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
