  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HEAL-D feasibility trial is a randomised control study to determine the feasibility of
      conducting an effectiveness trial of the Healthy Eating &amp; Active Lifestyles for Diabetes
      programme; a culturally-tailored diet and lifestyle intervention for the management of type 2
      diabetes in African and Caribbean communities. In this feasibility study HEAL-D will be
      evaluated against usual care in 80 patients with type 2 diabetes. HEAL-D is a programme of
      culturally-tailored diabetes self-management education and support, delivered over 7
      sessions. Key outcomes are the acceptability of the programme; and recruitment and retention
      of the research participants. The current study will also pilot the feasibility and
      acceptability to participants of measuring proposed primary and secondary outcomes including
      HbA1c, blood lipids (triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol), body
      weight, waist circumference, diabetes knowledge, diabetes and dietary competence, diabetes
      empowerment, perceived social support, quality of life, dietary intake, and physical
      activity.

    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility trial with an embedded process evaluation of the HEAL-D
      intervention compared with usual care. The study will use a randomised controlled trial (RCT)
      design, with individual patients as the unit of randomisation, evaluating the HEAL-D
      programme against usual care. The RCT design has been chosen primarily to evaluate the
      feasibility of recruiting and retaining a control arm, as well as to define what constitutes
      'usual care' and the variability within that. Patients with diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D)
      will be recruited from General Practice surgeries in the London Boroughs of Lambeth and
      Southwark. In addition participants from the phase 1 co-design study will be invited to
      participate and self-referral methods will also be used, for example posters and
      advertisements in community locations. Patients will be eligible if they have a documented
      diagnosis of T2D and are of self-declared African or Caribbean ethnicity. Patients with
      complex therapeutic dietary needs may be ineligible if their individual needs are deemed
      incompatible with the aims of the intervention. Additionally patients who are unable to
      communicate in English will be ineligible.

      A pragmatic sample size of 80 randomised patients, 40 in each arm, is anticipated to be
      sufficient to evaluate the programme, allowing for 20% drop-out/non-completion. As this is a
      feasibility trial it is not powered to detect statistically significant intervention effects,
      unless these estimated effects are extremely large. The purpose of the study is to assess the
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and of trial methods, and to provide
      estimates of key parameters such as potential effect sizes, recruitment and retention rates
      of the trial and participation rates of the programme, so that the optimal design of a
      full-scale trial can be determined.

      The HEAL-D intervention consists of 7 sessions; the programme will have a flexible schedule
      allowing participants to attend either fortnightly or monthly sessions. Each patient who
      participates will be in the study for approximately 7 months and will be asked to complete
      two assessment visits, one at baseline and one 6-8 months later, depending on the intensity
      of programme attendance. A range of potential primary and secondary outcome data will be
      collected including HbA1c, blood lipids (triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,
      LDL-cholesterol), body weight, waist circumference, diabetes knowledge, diabetes and dietary
      competence, diabetes empowerment, perceived social support, quality of life, dietary intake,
      and physical activity. Participants may also participate in an interview or focus group as
      part of the study's process evaluation.

    <description>Measured using the Diabetes Empowerment Scale-Short Form (DES-SF). It measures an individuals psychosocial self-efficacy with regard to their type 2 diabetes management. It uses a 5 point scale: Strongly Disagree; Somewhat disagree; Neutral; Somewhat Agree; Strongly Agree Strongly Disagree has a score of 1 through to strongly agree with a score of 5. The questionnaire is scored by averaging scores for all completed items. Total score ranges from a minimum of 1 to a maximum score of 5. The higher the score the higher the self-efficacy/empowerment. There are no sub-scales in this measure.</description>

Scores are on a numerical scale from 1 to 7 with 1 being the lowest social support and 7 the highest. The scores are summed. Three subscales are reported: family; friends; and significant other. Each subscale scores a minimum 4 and maximum 28. The total score ranges from 12 to 84.Higher scores indicate higher the degree of perceived social support.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol Five Dimension Three Level (EQ-5D-3L) scale measures health status. Level 1: respondents choose one statement which best describes their health status (5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities,pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), coded as 1 (no problems), 2 (some problems), or 3 (extreme problems). Numerals 1-3 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score.The person's health status is defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (extreme problems in all dimensions). There are potentially 243 different scores. Level 2 is the Visual Analogue Scale giving a score from 0 to 100, higher values indicating better health. The total score ranges from 0-1, it is calculated by applying a formula that essentially attaches values ('weights') to each of the levels in each dimension. The index can be calculated by deducting the appropriate weights from 1, the value for full health (i.e. state 11111).</description>

    <description>Measured using the Problem Areas In Diabetes-5 point scale (PAID-5). Each question has five possible answers with a value from 0 to 4, with 0 representing &quot;no problem&quot; and 4 &quot;a serious problem&quot;. The scores for each of the 5 questions are added up to give a total score ranging from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating higher degree of problems with diabetes.</description>
