  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the electronic chest drainage system (Drentech Palm Evo)
      with the traditional system, both already in use in the clinical practice, in a cohort of
      patients who received thoracoscopic lobectomy. This study is not evaluating safety or
      efficacy of these systems.

      This study's primary aim is to determine if the use of a digital chest system compared with a
      traditional system reduce the duration of chest drainage and length of hospital stay.
      Moreover, the investigators aim to quantify the variability of results regarding the
      subjective observer evaluation of active air leaks (through the traditional system) compared
      with the objective data registered by the digital system.

      Finally the investigators want to evaluate whether it is possible through the digital device
      to distinguish an active air leak from a pleural space effect by the evaluation of
      intrapleural differential pressure and to identify potential predictors of prolonged air
      leaks.

    <description>Patients in the intervention arm are connected to Drentech Palm Evo with single standard chest tube (28 Ch) immediately after closure of the chest. Patients with digital devices are managed by setting the pump to -20 cmH2O until the morning of postoperative day (POD) 1 and then setting the pump on physiologic mode (0 cmH2O) thereafter.</description>

    <description>Patients in the no intervention (traditional) arm are connected to traditional drain system with single standard chest tube (28 Ch) immediately after closure of the chest. Patients with traditional devices (requiring connection to wall suction) are managed by applying suction (-20 cmH2O) until the morning of POD 1 and are subsequently disconnected from suction thereafter.</description>
