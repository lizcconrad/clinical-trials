      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalency of two preparations of
      ensartinib capsules in Chinese healthy volunteers under fasted state or after meal. In
      addition, the safety of single dose administration of ensartinib capsules in Chinese healthy
      volunteers will also be evaluated.
