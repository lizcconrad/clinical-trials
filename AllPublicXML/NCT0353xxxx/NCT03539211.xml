  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a rotation based exercise program on core muscle
      thickness. Additionally, a second aim is to demonstrate the ability of a clinical assessment
      tool to identify muscle thickness changes. Half of participants receive the rotation based
      exercises, while the other half perform a traditional core exercise program. It was
      hypothesized that the rotation based exercises would result in greater changes in muscle
      thickness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of exercise programs and assessment tools have been evaluated for their ability to
      influence and measure the core muscles. Inefficient stability and asymmetrical muscle
      activity of the core have been linked to a wide range of lower extremity injuries. Training
      of the abdominal muscles to obtain symmetrical recruitment for optimal trunk stabilization is
      a widespread clinical practice, however valid and reliable assessment tools and effective
      intervention protocols are lacking. This study uniquely uses both a clinical assessment tool
      and musculoskeletal ultrasound to measure changes in the core muscles following an exercise
      intervention. The overall purpose of this study was to design a valid and reliable assessment
      tool and an effective training protocol to activate the core muscles.
