  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic plaque psoriasis is frequently associated with obesity and previous studies have
      shown that a calorie-controlled diet inducing body weight loss improves symptoms and
      increases the response to pharmacologic treatment. Besides, clinical improvement has been
      directly correlated with the amount of weight loss. Short-term very low-calorie ketogenic
      diets are responsible for substantial weight loss and attenuate systemic inflammation to a
      higher extent than moderately hypocaloric diets. This intervention has been recently
      demonstrated to restore, after only 4 week, the response to biological therapy in a patient
      suffering from relapsing moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and obesity-related metabolic
      syndrome. We investigated the efficacy of an aggressive weight loss program with a ketogenic
      induction phase in a single-arm trial that could provide the rationale for a large randomized
      trial.
