  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we plan to determine the efficacy of the Hunt Motivational Scale as a tool for
      weight loss compared to standard of care in the Penn Medicine Princeton Health weight
      management program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is rising at alarming rates, currently at nearly 40%. There are very few tools,
      specifically questionnaires, for healthcare providers to help their patients lose weight or
      maintain their weight loss. The Hunt Motivational Scale is one such tool to help patients
      identify areas that need improvement in order to aid in weight loss and weight maintenance.
      The HMS is designed to motivate patients to track, plan, and practice other healthy weight
      loss and weight maintenance practices so that they will have success.

      In this study, approximately 75 subjects in the Penn Medicine Princeton Health weight
      management program will be randomly assigned to either receive the HMS or not (standard of
      care). They will be followed for a period of six months at the end of which it will be
      determined whether the group that received the HMS lost more weight than the control group.
