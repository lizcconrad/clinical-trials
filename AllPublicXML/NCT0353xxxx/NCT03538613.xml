  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The gene CISH can weaken immune cells called lymphocytes. It is found in all cells of the
      body but it most negatively impacts lymphocytes. This study may help people with certain
      cancers.Lymphocyte cells will be taken from their tumors, the CISH gene will be removed from
      those cells, then the cells will be returned to the person. Researchers hope this process
      will help the cells work better and fight the tumors.

      Objective:

      To see if cells with the CISH gene removed are safe and shrink metastatic gastrointestinal
      epithelial tumors.

      Eligibility:

      People 18 70 years old with metastatic gastrointestinal epithelial cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with physical exam, scans, and heart, lung, blood, and urine
      tests.

      Participants will have cells collected in another protocol. They must tell their doctor of
      any antibiotic allergy.

      The cells will be changed in a lab. Participants will stop therapy 4 6 weeks before getting
      the cells back.

      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood is sent by a needle in one arm into a machine
      that takes out the white blood cells. The blood is returned through a needle in the other
      arm.

      Participants will have an IV catheter inserted in their upper chest to receive medicines and
      the cells.

      Participants will stay in the hospital and:

        -  Have chemotherapy for 1 week

        -  Get the cells for about a half hour to a little over an hour

        -  Get a cell growth medicine about every 8 hours for up to 12 doses

        -  Get medicines to boost blood cells and fight side effects

        -  Recover for 1 3 weeks.

      Participants will have 2 follow-up visits within 12 weeks of treatment, then a couple visits
      each year. They will repeat screening tests.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  CISH (Cytokine-induced SH2 protein) is an important negative regulator of T-cell
           signaling. The knockout or knockdown of CISH in mouse anti-tumor lymphocytes results in
           a profound increase in the ability of these lymphocytes to mediate tumor regression
           following administration to tumor bearing mice. These cells have a profound advantage in
           inducing anti-tumor responses compared to the wild-type anti-tumor lymphocytes.

        -  We have developed and optimized a CRISPR/Cas9 based strategy for highly efficient gene
           disruption in primary human T-cells without sacrificing cell viability or function.

        -  Thus, in this protocol we propose to disrupt the gene encoding CISH in lymphocytes from
           patients with metastatic cancers that are selected for anti-tumor activity.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary objectives:

        -  To determine the safety of the administration of mutation reactive autologous
           lymphocytes with knockout of the CISH gene in patients with refractory metastatic
           gastrointestinal epithelial cancer.

        -  To determine the response rate of the administration of mutation reactive TIL with
           knockout of CISH gene in patients with refractory metastatic gastrointestinal epithelial
           cancers.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years

        -  Evaluable metastatic gastrointestinal epithelial cancer refractory to standard
           chemotherapy

        -  Metastatic cancer lesions suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL

        -  No allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin administration

        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency

      DESIGN:

        -  Patients with evaluable metastatic gastrointestinal epithelial cancer will undergo a
           resection of tumor under the NCI Surgery Branch companion protocol 03-C-0277.

        -  The study will begin in a standard phase I dose-escalation. After the MTD cell dose has
           been determined, patients will be enrolled into the Phase II portion of the trial at the
           MTD established during the Phase I portion of the study.

        -  Patients will receive a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of the
           CISH knockout lymphocytes plus IV aldesleukin.

        -  In the Phase II portion, the study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design
           where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled. If 0 or 1 of the first 21
           patients experiences a clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but
           if 2 or more of the first 21

      evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a
      total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled.

        -  The objective will be to determine if the treatment regimen is able to be associated
           with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% PR
           + CR rate (p1=0.20).

        -  Up to 60 patients may be enrolled over 5 years.
