    <textblock>
      This study is a longitudinal, randomized control trial evaluating the use of two commercially
      available dynamic arm support devices (Armon Ayura and JAECO WREX) to promote participation
      in activities of daily living in non-ambulatory individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
      (DMD) with upper extremity weakness.

      This study is a longitudinal, randomized control trial evaluating the use of two commercially
      available dynamic arm support devices (Armon Ayura and JAECO WREX) to promote participation
      in activities of daily living in non-ambulatory individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy
      (DMD) with upper extremity weakness. Up to 30 individuals will be enrolled to participate in
      this research study, which includes a two-week baseline data collection period, a four-week
      device trial and a two-week post device data collection period. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to trial one of the dynamic arm support devices during the four week in-home trial.
      The ActiGraph, a wrist worn activity monitoring device, will be worn during the baseline
      period, the device trial and the post device data collection period to capture UE movement
      patterns. UE performance will be further quantified with use of a physical motor assessment,
      the Wolf Motor Functional Assessment and patient reported outcomes. Data gleaned will provide
      important knowledge and objective results regarding the potential benefit of dynamic arm
      supports in individuals with DMD with limited functional use of their upper extremities.

    <measure>Goal Attainment Scale (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The GAS will be completed and scored at baseline, then scored again at 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The GAS is a personal interview which allows the individual to determine important and personally meaningful goals. Goal scaling is standardized in order to calculate the extent to which a patient's goals are met.The GAS uses a 5-point rating scale to determine if the goal was not met (-2) up to a greater than expected meeting of the personal goal (+2). A score of 0 indicates the goal was met as anticipated.</description>
