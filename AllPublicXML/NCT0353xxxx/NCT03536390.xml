    <description>The CGI-S is a one-item scale for the clinician to assess their impression of the severity of a subject's current state of illness relative to clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. A subject's severity of mental illness is assessed considering a clinician's total clinical experience using a scale from 1 to 7 defined as: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; or 7=extremely ill.</description>

    <description>The CGI-I is a one-item scale to compare the subject's current condition to the condition at the Baseline (Day -1) visit using a scale from 1 to 7 defined as: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.</description>

          4. ADHD RS-IV Preschool—Home Version score at Screening and Baseline &gt;/= 90th percentile
             for gender and age in &gt;/=1 of the following: hyperactive-impulsive subscale,
             inattentive subscale, or total score.

          5. Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 4 (PPVT—4)Standard Score &gt;/=70.
