    <textblock>
      To compare of atrial arrhythmia incidence in patients with coronary artery disease and atrial
      fibrillation history, undergoing either coronary artery bypass grafting plus temporary spinal
      cord stimulation or coronary artery bypass grafting alone
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes 60 patients. Patients are randomized into 2 groups: coronary artery bypass
      grafting plus b-blocker treatment (according to guidelines; group I) and coronary artery
      bypass grafting plus b-blocker treatment (according to guidelines) plus temporary spinal cord
      stimulation (group 2). Temporary spinal cord stimulation is performed for 3 days before
      surgery and 7 days after coronary artery bypass grafting. Continuous ECG during intensive
      care unit stay, daily ECG and 24-h Holter monitor recordings at 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after
      coronary artery bypass grafting, external loop recorder after discharge from intensive care
      unit until 30 days after coronary artery bypass grafting. Rhythm status and clinical outcome
      assessment at 12 month follow up

    <description>Before coronary artery bypass grafting in the experimental group, 3 days of temporary spinal cord stimulation is performed than device turned off and coronary artery bypass grafting procedure is made. The device for spinal cord is turned on in intensive care unit for 7 days. Continuous ECG during intensive care unit stay, daily ECG, and 24-h Holter monitor recordings will be performed at 7, 14, 21, and 30 days after coronary artery bypass grafting, external loop recorder after discharge from intensive care unit till 30 days after coronary artery bypass grafting.</description>

    <description>Percutaneous trial (temporary) electrodes are placed through a 14-gauge needle.The skin is entered at the medial aspect of the pedicle with the Tuohy needle usually angled 30-45° toward the midline for optimal entry into the epidural space at the interlaminar edge 1 or 2 levels of cephalad (usually, Th5-Th6 level). The 14-gauge needle is then passed with the bevel facing up at a 30-45° oblique angle to reach the depth of the midline laminar target.The Tuohy needle is then carefully removed and the operative site is cleaned with chlorhexidine and alcohol. Temporary stimulation is carried out till coronary artery bypass grafting surgery for 3 days, then stimulation turns off during surgery. At the end of coronary artery bypass grafting the temporary stimulation turns on in the intensive care unit and continues for 7 days. After that, the temporary leads will be removed.</description>
