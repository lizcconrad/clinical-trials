  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization is a stressful event that might impact in a patient's recovery. Children are
      more susceptible to suffer acute stress as a result of a hospital stay. Stress is often
      quantized using cortisol levels, a substance which increases following stressful stimuli.
      Since stress management is important in a patient's recovery, different therapies are used
      and have been evaluated and proven effective to diminish cortisol levels such as play
      interventions and clown therapy. Nevertheless, they rely on volunteers or trained staff to
      perform them. Nowadays, technology such as augmented reality allow us to provide therapy
      without the need of volunteers. This project aims to test if augmented reality technology is
      effective in lowering salivary cortisol levels in hospitalized children.

      Background: Acute stress produced by hospitalization has a direct impact on the patient's
      recovery. Increased cortisol levels, the biomarker of stress, have been associated to poor
      health outcomes, especially on pediatric patients. Stress management in the hospital
      environment is essential to lower the effects of hospitalization but tend to require
      volunteers or other trained staff. With the advent of augmented reality technologies,
      providing ludic therapies to children without the need of personnel is possible. Augmented
      reality (AR) consists in overlapping digital information over physical objects or places
      creating an unique experience and the possibility of the user to interact with the
      technology. AR has been used in psychological and physical therapy with notable results. AR
      books are available in the market and are seen as a great educational tool for children. The
      aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of AR books as a stress management tool in
      the hospital environment in a randomized cross-over study.

      Sample size: Calculated taking as reference cortisol values reported previously in
      hospitalized children in the morning. With a 90% power and a α value of 0.05, we expect a
      significant difference of 30% of the value before the intervention. For this, a sample size
      of 28 patients will be necessary.

      Recruitment: Patients will be recruited and enrolled in the Pediatrics Department of Cayetano
      Heredia Hospital. After signed consent by parents and written assent by each patient, an
      envelope with a random code will be opened. This code will have information of which
      intervention will be performed first. For AR intervention, a book and an electronic tablet
      will be given to the patient, for the non AR intervention (NoAR) only a book will be given.
      The book at the first intervention will be different than the book at the second
      intervention. Salivary samples will be collected before and after the intervention and a
      visual analogue scale (VAS) will be given to children to self-assess mood. After a 48 hour
      wash-out, the second intervention will take place.

      Statistical analysis plan: The decrease in cortisol levels will be calculated for each
      individual and for each treatment. The difference in the reduction (DIF) of AR group vs. NoAR
      will also be calculated. A simple linear regression model will be used with DIF as dependent
      variable, the independent variable will be the order of intervention. The intercept will be
      the average decrease difference and the confidence interval will establish the statistical
      significance. For the secondary outcomes, the VAS will be associated with salivary cortisol.

      Plan for missing data: Due to the characteristics of the intervention, we do not expect much
      loss to follow up patients after recruitment. However, all missing data will be reported as
      such.
