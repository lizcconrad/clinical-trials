  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of INCB050465 administered
      orally to participants with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) who have decreased hemoglobin
      and evidence of ongoing hemolysis that requires treatment intervention.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of AIHA based on the presence of hemolytic anemia and serological evidence
             of anti-erythrocyte antibodies, detectable by the direct antiglobulin test.

          -  Participants who have disease progression after treatment with standard therapies that
             are known to confer clinical benefit, or who are intolerant to treatment, or who
             refuse standard treatment. There is no limit to the number of prior treatment
             regimens.

          -  Hemoglobin 7 to 10 g/dL.

          -  No evidence of a lymphoproliferative malignancy or other autoimmune-related underlying
             conditions.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2.

          -  Willingness to avoid pregnancy or fathering children.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Concurrent conditions and history of other protocol-specified diseases.

          -  ANC &lt; 1.5 × 10^9/L.

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100 × 10^9/L.

          -  Severely impaired liver function.

          -  Impaired renal function with estimated creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min.

          -  Anti-phospholipid antibodies positive or elevated anti-streptolysin antibodies.

          -  Positive serology test results for hepatitis B surface antigen or core antibody, or
             hepatitis C virus antibody with detectable RNA at screening, consistent with active or
             chronic infection.

          -  Known HIV infection or positivity on immunoassay.

          -  History or presence of an abnormal ECG that, in the investigator's opinion, is
             clinically meaningful.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or severe reaction to INCB050465 or its excipients.
