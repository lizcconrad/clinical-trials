  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single center, minimal risk, physician initiated retrospective chart review.
      An analysis of treatment timelines for patients diagnosed with lung cancer within the St.
      Elizabeth system from January 2013 until study completion. The study investigator and
      designee(s) will review patient electronic medical records, extracting data related to the
      symptom presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of new diagnoses of lung cancer. Collected
      data will focus on dates of encounters, diagnostic imaging/procedures, and treatments, with
      data analysis evaluating time between care encounters and potential delays in care. The data
      will be further stratified based on system-wide changes implemented to improve efficiency,
      patient outcomes, and patient experience.
