    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab for in-stent
      neoatherosclerosis by using optical coherence tomography, in comparison with standard statin
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>

      We investigate to evaluate the efficacy of alirocumab for in-stent neoatherosclerosis. We
      enrolled the patient who performed drug eluting stent implantation and detected in-stent
      neoatherosclerosis by follow up optical coherence tomography, and categorized into two group;
      the patients with alirocumab and rosuvastatin were categorized alirocumab therapy group, and
      the patients with rosuvastatin alone were categorized standard statin therapy group.

      We compare these two group for outcomes.

    <measure>Lipid index change between baseline and 9 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Lipid core arc was measured by every 0.2-mm interval throughout segments with neoatherosclerosis (NA) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings. The mean lipid core arc was calculated for each lesion. Then, the lipid index was calculated by multiplying the mean lipid core arc by the lipid core longitudinal length.</description>

    <measure>Macrophage grade change between baseline and 9 month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Macrophage arc were measured on OCT images with NA every 0.2-mm intervals and divided 4 groups as follows: grade 0, no mac¬rophage; grade 1, localized macrophage accumulation (&lt;30°); grade 2, clus¬tered accumulation ≥30° and &lt;90°; grade 3, clus¬tered accumulation ≥90° and &lt;270°; and grade 4, clustered accumulation ≥270° and &lt;360° . Macrophage grade was evaluated as summation of 0 to 4 grades across all cross section in NA.</description>

        Patients with stent implantation who were performed coronary angiography and optical
        coherence tomography (OCT) follow-up of the coronary arteries were candidate.

        These patients were implanted drug elutingstent including sirolimus-eluting stents (Cypher,
        Cordis, Miami Lakes, FL, USA), paclitaxel-eluting stents (Taxus, Boston Scientific, Natick,
        MA, USA), or everolimus-eluting stents (XIENCE V, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
        The investigators assessed their OCT examination at the follow-up OCT time and patients who
        were detected NA on OCT findings were eligible for the presence study.
