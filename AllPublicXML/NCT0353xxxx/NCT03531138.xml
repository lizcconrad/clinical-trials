    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation candidates will be performed a 3-month hospital-based preoperative
      exercise training. A 6-minute walk test, a 10-meter walking speed test and a 5-times sit to
      stand test will be performed to determine the exercise capacity of the patient. The tests
      will be carried out at the beginning and end of rehabilitation. At each testing session, the
      tests will be performed sequentially by the same physiotherapist, giving 20 minute rest
      periods within the same day. It will be analyzed how the test data correlate with each other
      and how the delta values calculated for each test reflect the rehabilitation outcomes
      calculated after the exercise program.

    <textblock>
      Severe exercise intolerance exists in lung transplant candidates. Completion of the test
      period in the field tests used in determining the exercise capacity of these patients is
      extremely difficult. The exercise capacity, which is considered as an important criterion in
      the decision of the lung transplant decision and in the determination of the clinical profile
      of the patient, necessitates the development of different test methods which are more
      suitable for the application of the measurement in this patient population.

      In this study lung transplantation candidates will be performed a 3-month hospital-based
      preoperative exercise training. A 6-minute walk test, a 10-meter walking speed test and a
      5-times sit to stand test will be performed to determine the exercise capacity of the
      patient. The tests will be carried out at the beginning and end of rehabilitation. At each
      testing session, the tests will be performed sequentially by the same physiotherapist, giving
      20 minute rest periods within the same day. It will be analyzed how the test data correlate
      with each other and how the delta values calculated for each test reflect the rehabilitation
      outcomes calculated after the exercise program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline distance covered in six minute walking test at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>The test was conducted in a 30-meter corridor in line with American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. Patients were told that they should walk as fast as they can walk. Before and after the test, oxygen saturation, heart rate, Borg fatigue rating, and walking distance were recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline 10-meter walking speed test at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient walks without assistance 10 meters (32.8 feet) and the time is measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline 5 times sit to stand test at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient stand up and sit as quickly as possible from a standard chair for 5 times.Introduction: &quot;Stand up and sit down as quickly as possible 5times, keeping your arms folded across your chest. I'll be timing you with a stopwatch. Ready, begin&quot;.The time is measured. Lower times = better scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale score at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>The mMRC Dyspnea Scale is best used to establish baseline functional impairment due to dyspnea attributable to respiratory disease; tracking the mMRC over time or with therapeutic interventions is of less certain clinical utility.The severity of dyspnea is rated on a scale of 0 to 4. &quot;O&quot; means no dyspnea perception, &quot;4&quot; means severe dyspnea perception.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) at 3-months</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>The mouth pressure measurement was performed with the Micro-RPMÂ® instrument from SensorMEDIC. Patient placed a rubber mouthpiece with flanges, on the device, sealed their lips firmly around the mouthpiece, exhaled/inhaled slowly and completely, and then tried to breath in as hard as possible. The patient was allowed to rest for about a minute and the maneuver was repeated five times. Verbal or visual feedback was provided after each maneuver. The aim is that the variability between measurements is less than 10 cm H2O. The maximum value was obtained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) at 3-months.</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>It was conducted by using the Sensor Medics model 2400 (Yorba Linda, CA, USA), and according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline quadriceps femoris muscle strength at 3-months.</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle Strength will measure using a digital dynamometer (J-Tech Commander muscle testing device), wth three measurements make. Best result will be taken.</description>

    <description>All patients will undergo supervised pulmonary rehabilitation program on 2 days per week for 3 months. Apart from that, they will ask to perform the home exercise program which is scheduled as 3 days per week and fill out the exercise follow-up form. Supervised exercise sessions consist of aerobic(treadmill walking, bicycle training, arm ergometer training) and strengthening training(free weights). A 6-min walk test, a 10-meter walking speed test and a 5 times sit to stand test will be performed to determine the exercise capacity of the patient. The tests will be carried out at the beginning and end of rehabilitation. At each testing session, the tests will be performed sequentially by the same physiotherapist, giving 20 minute rest periods within the same day.</description>
