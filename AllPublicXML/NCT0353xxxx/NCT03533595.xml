  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STRATAFIX Symmetric PDS Plus sutures will reduce the time required for fascial closure
      following spinal surgery. A pilot study will aide in the design of a larger randomized
      controlled trial to compare suture closure time of the STRATAFIX Symmetric PDS Plus sutures
      versus traditional Vicryl sutures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective and secure suture is integral in spinal surgery, creating a strong barrier for
      tissue repair and a seal which prevents infection of the surgical site. The goal of any
      suture is to close the wound while minimizing risks of complications such as wound dehiscence
      and surgical site infection . A new type of suture, barbed suture, uses integrated barbs to
      secure the suture to the tissue without requiring knots for fixation. The result is a suture
      that evenly distributes tension along the length of the incision, while requiring less time
      to close . Additionally, STRATAFIX sutures offer a &quot;Plus&quot; antibacterial option for their
      knotless sutures, which further increases the safety and efficacy of this product.

      Barbed suture technologies have been utilized in a variety of specialties, but neurosurgery
      remains unstudied in this respect. The primary aim of this study is to assess the time to
      closure using STRATAFIX technology. Decreased time to closure directly translates into
      decreased operating room time, and thus increased savings, especially for high-volume
      institutions. The secondary aim of this study is to determine the risk for surgical
      complications using STRATAFIX. Previous studies in other specialties have shown no
      significant difference in rate of adverse consequences when utilizing barbed sutures. To
      assess this aim, patients will be evaluated for wound dehiscence, SSI, deep infection, and
      30-day rate of readmission for wound infection.
