  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risk-taking in early adolescence have has been found to be normative and even formative as it
      might fulfill the youth's needs to experiment different sensations, make independent
      decisions and learn from their consequences. Several theoretical models have suggested that
      male and female adolescents differ in risk-taking as a product of individual/contextual
      factors and neocortical functioning; however, the neurophysiological and neuropsychological
      correlates of those differences continue to be underexplored. Informed by Evolutionary
      Neuroandrogenic Theory, the investigators examine the links between gender, risk-proneness,
      gratification delay, self-control, self-efficacy, executive functions and
      neurophysiological-neuroanatomical correlates in early adolescents (age 10-12 years).
      Participants (N=24; 50% females) will complete behavioral measurements on study constructs
      and perform neuropsychological tests using fMRI scanning (e.g., Go/NoGo continuous
      performance, stop-signal reaction time, NIH Cognition Battery, delay discounting). Female and
      male groups will be compared on all outcome measures.
