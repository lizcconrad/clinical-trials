  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the QuikClot® Radial® pad on hemostasis after TRA,
      compared to the standard of care TR Band®, with the goal to hopefully develop a safe and
      efficacious technique to achieve more rapid patent hemostasis after TRA, and improve patient
      care by optimizing radial hemostasis management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The QuikClot® Radial® pad will be applied over the radial artery access site covered with
      either a Coban™ bandage or a Tegaderm™ dressing after TRA. Firm manual compression will then
      be applied over the QuikClot® Radial® pad after the sheath is removed for 5 minutes. The
      Coban™ cohort will then have the Coban™ bandage removed after an additional 25 minutes, then
      be covered with a Tegaderm™ dressing. The Tegaderm™ only cohort will be closely observed for
      25 minutes after release of manual pressure. Both cohorts will remove the Tegaderm™ dressing
      the following morning.

      Consented subjects will be randomly assigned in the cardiac cath lab upon completion of their
      procedure into the following three arms:

      Arm 1 - Standard of Care with a TR Band® Arm 2 - QuikClot® Radial® pad combined with a Coban™
      bandage Arm 3 - QuikClot® Radial® pad combined with a Tegaderm™ dressing

    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Initial successful hemostasis is defined as no evidence of external bleeding from the TRA puncture site or expanding hematoma of the forearm after completion of the above described TR Band® and QuikClot® Radial® pad protocols, without the need for reinflation of air in the TR Band® or reapplication of manual pressure over the QuikClot® Radial® pad secured with either a Coban™ bandage or Tegaderm™ dressing, or use of manual compression over the arteriotomy site.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Time to hemostasis</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Total time to hemostasis will be calculated as the time needed from sheath removal to achieving complete hemostasis, as described below:
For both the QuikClot® Radial® pad + Coban™ bandage and the QuikClot® Radial® pad + Tegaderm™ dressing arms, total time to hemostasis includes the initial 5 minutes of manual compression and 25 minutes of light compression with the Coban™ bandage in the Coban™ cohort and 5 minutes of manual compression and 25 minutes of close observation in the Tegaderm™ only cohort, and any subsequent time needed to obtain complete hemostasis. All additional protocol directed recompression and/or weaning times needed to obtain complete hemostasis will be added to calculate the total time to hemostasis.
For the standard of care TR Band® arm, total time to hemostasis includes the initial 60 minutes of compression plus 60 minutes of weaning, plus any additional protocol directed recompression and/or weaning time needed to obtain complete hemostasis.</description>

    <measure>Radial Artery Occlusion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>RAO will be assessed one hour after completed hemostasis, using the reverse Barbeau's test.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients undergoing CC and/or PCI via the radial artery as part of their standard of
             care treatment

          2. Patients able and willing to give written informed consent

          3. Patient &gt; 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients presenting with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)

          2. Oral anticoagulation therapy as described below:

               1. If on a DOAC (direct acting oral anticoagulants - ie dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
                  apixaban, endoxaban), patients will be excluded if DOAC taken within 48 hours and
                  eGFR &gt; 30 ml/min or DOAC taken within 72 hours and eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min.

               2. If patient is on warfarin, excluded if INR &gt; 1.5

          3. Liver Failure

          4. Life threatening illness that patient would not be expected to live more than 6 months

          5. Major unanticipated event in the cardiac cath lab (i.e. cardiac arrest) of an already
             consented patient, but before randomization, where the operator believes participation
             in this trial is now inappropriate.
