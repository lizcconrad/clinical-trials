  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 30% of individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) fail to respond
      to conventional antidepressant medication which accounts for over 1 million Canadians in
      their lifetime. Treatment resistant depression (TRD) patients also have greater psychiatric
      and medical comorbidity, poorer quality of life and increased suicidal ideation. Yet, there
      are few treatment strategies available to target TRD and there is a significant lack of
      evidence about how TRD differs from treatment-responsive depression. This proposal represents
      the first study to elucidate the neurobiology of TRD with a focus on dopamine receptor
      function throughout the brain, in order to inform treatment development and clinical
      characterization of TRD.The ultimate goal of this unique study is to characterize striatal
      and extrastriatal dopamine D2 and D3 receptor binding potential in patients with TRD,
      non-resistant MDD and healthy controls. The primary hypothesis is that TRD patients will
      exhibit greater D2/D3 receptor binding potential compared to non-TRD patients in the
      following regions of interest: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and
      ventral striatum. Secondarily, non-TRD patients will also demonstrate increased binding
      potential compared to healthy controls in the same brain regions. Whole brain analyses will
      allow us to take an exploratory approach to other brain regions that may differentiate TRD
      from non-TRD patients. Participants will be assessed at St. Michael's Hospital (SMH) and the
      Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), which are within a 10 minute driving distance
      of each other. There will be 3 study visits following written informed consent. Eligibility
      will be confirmed at a screening visit at SMH where demographic information, including age,
      sex, education, and medication history will be obtained, as well as the administration of a
      structured Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) Axis I diagnoses (Sheehan et al, 2015), and an
      HRSD-17. Within two weeks of the screening visit, participants will undergo a structural
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at SMH prior to the positron-emission tomography (PET)
      scan at CAMH. The order of the PHNO scans will be counterbalanced.

        Participants will be recruited from clinics at St. Michael's Hospital and the Centre for
        Addiction and Mental Health as well as from research programs at the two sites, which have
        ongoing MDD clinical trials where patients are required to be unmedicated prior to
        initiating treatment.
