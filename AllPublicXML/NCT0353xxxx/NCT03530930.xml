  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates analgesic, antiinflammatory and metabolic effects of Comarum palustre in
      patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and diabetes mellitus. Patients with osteoarthritis
      will receive Comarum palustre together with conventional treatment of osteoarthritis and
      diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comarum palustre have been shown to exert analgesic properties in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis not responding to diclofenac. In animal models comarum palustre showed
      anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, analgesic, antioxidant, antihistamine, and
      membrane-stabilizing effects. Thus, pleiotropic properties of Comarum Palustre may provide a
      rationale for this use in patients having both osteoarthritis and diabetes mellitus. In this
      group of patients Comarum Palustre may not only relieve OA-related pain but reduce systemic
      inflammation, decrease progression of atherosclerosis and diabetes complications.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS Pain consists of 9 items, which are answered on a 4-point likert scale (0=no problems, 4=extreme problems). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life with the The Short Form (36) Health Survey score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section.Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
