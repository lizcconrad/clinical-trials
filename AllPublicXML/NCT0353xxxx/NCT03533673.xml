      This study will be a prospective, open-label trial designed to objectively assess the safety
      and bioactivity of AAV2/8-LSPhGAA in subjects diagnosed with Pompe disease, which is caused
      by a defect in acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene. AAV2/8-LSPhGAA is intended to enable expression
      of a functional copy of the GAA gene in subject's hepatocytes.
