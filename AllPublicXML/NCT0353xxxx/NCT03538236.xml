      The primary objective of this study is to assess efficacy of intragastric balloon for weight
      loss in obese patients who also concurrently have NASH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a growing and leading etiology of chronic liver
      disease worldwide resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality.

      Given recent data confirming weight loss as an effective treatment strategy for NASH and the
      recent availability of endoscopic bariatric therapies recently described by the American
      Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA), the investigators seek to primarily study efficacy of intragastric
      balloon for weight loss in obese patients having NASH. Secondary objective would be to assess
      whether the use of intragastric balloon combined with lifestyle intervention can improve
      liver histology in NASH with significant fibrosis over lifestyle intervention alone in a
      prospective paired study.

    <intervention_name>Intragastric balloon</intervention_name>
    <description>Intragastric balloon insertion will be performed by an endoscopist under monitored anesthesia care. The Intragastric BalIoon (GB) comes as a deflated balloon pre-loaded on a catheter, which is inserted transorally into the proximal gastric body. An endoscope is then inserted alongside the device allowing for direct visualization of the balloon. Once in place, the intragastric balloon will be filled with saline through an external port. The balloon is inserted for 6 months then retrieved endoscopically</description>

Participants will be instructed to keep a daily food diary and will meet with the nutritionist to reinforce the behavior every 12 weeks for 12 months.</description>
