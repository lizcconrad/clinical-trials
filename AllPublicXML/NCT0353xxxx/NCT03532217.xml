  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study study aims to elucidate the immune responses to a shared antigen vaccine
      (PROSTVAC) and tumor specific antigens generated DNA vaccine in combination with checkpoint
      blockade using nivolumab (anti-PD-1), and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). Additionally, the
      investigators will study the impact of the combination immunotherapy on peripheral T cell
      activation, as well as immune response in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, the
      investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability to this novel personalized
      immunotherapy in combination with checkpoint blockade.

If the node progresses to ≥ 1.5 cm in the short axis, it is pathologic and measurable. Nodes that have progressed to between 1.0 and less than 1.5 cm are pathologic subject to clinical discretion and are nonmeasurable

To better understand the effect of therapy on an individual site of disease, PCWG3 advises the date of progression in all specific sites be reported independently whether it is bone, nodes (pelvic or extrapelvic), visceral (lung, liver, adrenal, or CNS), or other.</description>

    <description>Within 60 days after the last dose of standard of care docetaxel, patients will start a priming dose of PROSTVAC-V as a single agent, and subsequent doses of PROSTVAC- F in combination with ipilimumab (1mg/kg every 3 weeks for 2 doses), and nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 6 doses), taking a total of approximately 17 weeks to complete. This is called Treatment A.
Patients will then receive a neoantigen DNA vaccine with continuous nivolumab treatment. The vaccine will be administered by intramuscular injection for a total of 6 treatments every 28 days +/-7 days with at least 21 days between injection days. Each DNA vaccination will be 4 mg vaccine administered intramuscularly using a TriGrid electroporation device. Patients will receive nivolumab at 480 mg every 28 days concurrently with neoantigen DNA vaccine. This is called Treatment B.</description>

             for eligible injection sites (left and right medial deltoid region) exceeds 40 mm.

          -  Individuals in whom the ability to observe possible local reactions at the eligible
             injection sites (deltoid region) is, in the opinion of the investigator, unacceptably
             obscured due to a physical condition or permanent body art.

          -  Therapeutic or traumatic metal implant in the skin or muscle of either deltoid region.

          -  Any chronic or active neurologic disorder, including seizures and epilepsy, excluding
