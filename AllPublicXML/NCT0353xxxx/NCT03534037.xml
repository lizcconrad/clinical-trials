  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperuricemia is an additional risk factor for cardiovascular disease, associating with left
      ventricular diastolic dysfunction in individuals with metabolic syndrome. The effect of
      urate-lowering therapies on left ventricular diastolic dysfunction remains unclear. The study
      is conducted to investigate whether febuxostat or benzbromarone might improve left
      ventricular diastolic dysfunction in individuals with metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1, July 2018 and 31, Dec 2018, consecutive individuals with metabolic syndrome
      hyperuricemia are candidates of the present study. After the eligible candidates sign the
      informed consent, they will receive blood tests with a fasting time of 8 hours at least. The
      investigators will randomize the study participants by pre-specified random codes with a
      1:1:1 ratio to the three groups. The study medication, febuxostat or benzbromarone, will be
      administered orally on the next day after transthoracic echocardiography is performed. The
      control group will only receive dietary control. All participant will receive transthoracic
      echocardiography and blood tests at baseline and at 3 months. The visit will be scheduled at
      baseline and at the 3rd month. The blood tests include high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
      high-sensitivity interleukin-1 beta, high-sensitivity interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor
      alpha, Dickkopf-related protein 3, galectin-3, ST2, fibroblast growth factor 23, xanthine
      oxidase activity, and thioredoxin.
