  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the third most common mental illness with a lifetime
      prevalence rate of 9.2% in Canada. Depression and anxiety are common comorbidities making
      treatment complex. Currently available treatments for PTSD include medications and talk
      therapies. However, their best combined response rates are around 50%. Our recent pilot
      feasibility study showed potential benefits of a breathing based meditation intervention
      called Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) in PTSD, as an augmentation treatment. The investigators
      seek to now assess the safety and efficacy of SKY intervention compared to an active control,
      Health Enhancement Program (HEP) in a double blind randomized controlled trial. The
      investigators will include PTSD patients with a wide range of trauma experience including
      road traffic accidents, childhood, physical, emotional or sexual abuse, or recurrent traumas
      over the lifespan. Patients will be offered a 12-week program of either SKY or HEP
      interventions as an add-on to their existing treatment schedules. This study will examine if
      patients with PTSD experience a reduction in PTSD symptoms from baseline to 12-week
      follow-up, as measured by the PCL-5 after receiving either HEP or SKY.

      STUDY DESIGN: Single-center, blinded (rater, investigator, and clinician), longitudinal, RCT
      comparing a 12-week SKY intervention to a HEP group.

      STUDY RECRUITMENT: Participants include men and women (n=70), 18-75 years of age, with PTSD.
      The study will recruit via referrals from the General Adult Ambulatory Mental Health Service,
      the PTSD clinical research unit and the Geriatric Mental Health Program of London Health
      Sciences Centre at an expected rate of approximately 1 to 2 participants per week. Referred
      participants will be individuals who in the opinion of investigators or referring physicians
      will likely meet inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      SCREENING AND INITIAL ASSESSMENT: Referred potential participants will be provided with a
      Letter of Information (LOI) to review and consider. Participants will be given a minimum of
      24 hours to review the LOI before being contacted over-the-phone by one of the study Research
      Assistants (RA). During this initial phone call the RA will answer any questions the
      potential participants have, briefly explain the study, and invite potential participants to
      a screening appointment. During the initial screening appointment participants will complete
      the informed consent process which includes an opportunity to ask any questions prior to
      signing the LOI. Participants will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria by a
      trained member of the research team. These patients will have clinically diagnosed PTSD,
      further confirmed through a structured clinical interview, the Clinician-administered PTSD
      Scale for DSM5-past month version (CAPS5). Any additional diagnoses will be screened by the
      MINI (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview). The CAPS5 will also be used to rule out
      severe depersonalization and derealization as per exclusion criteria. If the participant is
      above the age of 65 years of age, they will complete a cognitive screening test using the
      Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE&gt;24 to rule out significant cognitive impairment.
      Participants meeting all study criteria who wish to join the study will be enrolled and
      assigned a unique study identifier e.g. HEPSKY001.

      RANDOMIZATION: Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized to either SKY or
      HEP with equal probability (1:1), stratified by gender, using computer generated
      randomisation numbers. Concealment of randomisation to outcome assessors and investigators
      will be ensured by an independent consultant who will perform the randomization. The
      independent consultant will be responsible for randomization and will provide the RA with
      pre-stuffed envelopes featuring only the participants code on the outside, and information
      about treatment allocation for the participant inside the envelope. Participants will be
      given this envelope at the end of their baseline assessment and instructed not to open it
      until they have left their appointment.

      TRIAL INTERVENTIONS: The investigators will offer the two interventions in groups of 6-8
      participants on a rolling basis 1. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): 1. Participants in the SKY
      group will undergo a 12-week training course conducted by certified teachers of the Art of
      Living Foundation. 2. HEP Intervention: Participants in HEP will learn about health
      promotion, healthy diet, music, and exercise, but will not learn breathing techniques, or
      meditation. HEP will be delivered by trained staff.

      All participants will continue to receive standard care through their providers.

    <description>The Health-Enhancement Program (HEP) controls for group support and morale, behavioural activation, reduction of stigma, facilitator attention, treatment duration, and time spent on at-home practice. HEP is structurally equivalent to a SKY intervention, with similar-sized groups, meeting for 5 days for 2.5-3 hours, and once weekly follow up sessions (90 min/wk) for 3 weeks and then bimonthly sessions for the next 8 weeks. Participants will be asked to complete 25 min/day of course homework. Participants will learn about health promotion, healthy diet, music, and exercise, but do not learn breathing techniques, or meditation. In HEP, which has been manualized, participants get the support of a group and facilitator, and talk through and try to implement positive health-enhancing life changesHEP will be delivered by a trained social worker (or equivalent).</description>

    <description>The SKY PTSD program is a mind-body resilience building program developed for persons with PTSD. Through SKY breathing, interactive discussions, journaling, yoga and guided meditations, the workshop builds a framework for resilience and empowerment, and develops self-awareness, connectedness and community, and a positive outlook. SKY training will take place in group-format (group sizes of 6-8 participants). SKY training involves attending a 5-day course (Mon to Fri) that teaches the basic principles of SKY over 2.5-3 hour daily sessions. This will be followed by once weekly follow up sessions (90 min/wk) for 3 weeks and then bimonthly sessions (every 2 weeks) for the next 8 weeks. In addition, participants will be asked to practice SKY at home daily (25 min/day) throughout the duration of the study period (up to 26 weeks) and log practice frequency and any other</description>
