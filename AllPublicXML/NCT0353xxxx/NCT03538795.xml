    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine a combination therapy for adults with chronic, severe motor
      impairment of an arm after stroke. The intervention will combine brain stimulation with
      physical rehabilitation of the arm on the side of the body more-affected by stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this program of research is to develop a therapy that produces
      meaningful and persistent improvements in function of the more-affected arm in stroke
      survivors with severe, chronic hemiparesis. No treatment with an established evidence base is
      available now for this large group, who have barely perceptible voluntary movement of the
      more-affected fingers and wrist. The lab of E. Taub and G. Uswatte has developed an expanded
      version of Constraint-Induced Movement therapy (CIMT) for this population that has evidence
      of efficacy for improving use in daily life of the more-affected arm from a case series and
      small randomized controlled trial (RCT). The original version of CIMT is a form of physical
      rehabilitation that has evidence of efficacy from multiple RCTs for improving use in daily
      life of the more-affected arm in adults with mild to moderate hemiparesis after stroke. CIMT
      has also been shown to produce neuroplastic changes in both grey and white matter structures.
      Expanded CIMT (eCIMT) combines CIMT with neurodevelopmental techniques (NDT) for managing
      tone. Studies from by J. Szaflarski and by others suggest that priming CNS tissue for
      training by electrically stimulating the brain regions that control the target function with
      excitatory intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) augments the benefits of
      neurorehabilitation. This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of combining eCIMT with
      brain stimulation by iTBS and, on a preliminary basis, will evaluate whether this combination
      therapy boosts treatment outcomes relative to eCIMT alone.

    <description>All will receive eCIMT+iTBS on an outpatient basis for 4 hours/day for 15 consecutive weekdays. eCIMT will include training of the more-affected arm following shaping principles, restraint of the less-affected arm, and the Transfer Package in combination with NDT techniques to reduce tone so that shaping of movement can be carried out. The Transfer Package is a set of behavioral techniques designed to transfer therapeutic gains from the treatment setting to everday life. iTBS will be added to prime the areas of the brain that control movement of the more-affected arm so that the responsiveness of that tissue to motor training is enhanced. Treatment sessions will alternate between 10 minute periods of iTBS (which include time for set-up and transition) and 1-hour periods of eCIMT.</description>
