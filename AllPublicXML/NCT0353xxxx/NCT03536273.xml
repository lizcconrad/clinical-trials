      INTRODUCTION AND AIM: The Pilates exercises were introduced by Joseph Pilates in the 1920s,
      originally called 'centering'. These exercises work on 6 simple principles with or without
      special equipment. These principles are; centering, concentration, tenderness, flow and
      respiration. (Yamato et al., 2016) Functional movement analysis is a screening system
      developed by physiotherapist Gray Cook. Functional deficits of the person are detected by 7
      different movements (Cook, Burton and Hoogenboom 2006a, Cook, Burton and Hoogenboom 2006b).
      In a single study they compared in the literature that assessed the effect of Pilates
      exercises on functional movement, this activity was explored on recreational runners (Laws,
      Williams and Wilson 2017). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 12-week
      pilates group exercise training on functional movement scores in sedentary women.
      Secondarily; posture, depression level and quality of life will be evaluated.

      MATERIAL-METHODS: This study has been reviewed by Ethics Committee of Non-Interventional
      Researches of the University of Medipol in Istanbul and its ethical conformity has been
      approved. (10840098-604.01.01-E.45484). Participants were informed of the voluntary consent
      form and signed the consent form.

      Participants 20 sedentary women were included in the study between 30-50 years of age.

      Evaluations

      Demographic information (Age, Occupation, Height, Weight) of the persons will be
      recorded.Functional Movement Analysis; Postural Analysis, Depression level; Health Related
      Life quality will be recorded.

      Application Pilates exercises will be applied by a qualified physiotherapist with an
      internationally recognized certificate on the subject. Participants will be asked to come up
      with suitable outfits. the exercise room will be set at the ideal temperature and well
      ventilated. The exercises to be done in the form of group exercises will be started with an
      entry level, and the level of the exercises will be increased appropriately in the following
      weeks. Each group will consist of no more than 10 people and the exercises will continue for
      three sessions per week for 12 weeks. The evaluations will be repeated before exercise, at
      the end of 12 weeks of exercise and after 3 months from finish of the exercise period.
