      This study is to compare the efficacy and safety of dabigatran ethidium b.i.d.+ clopidogrel +
      ASA [100 mg q.d. *1 month] and warfarin + clopidogrel + ASA [100 mg, q.d.*1 month] in Chinese
      NVAF patients undergoing PCI with stenting (elective or due to ACS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, randomized, controlled, prospective study.The object of
      this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate combined with dual
      anti-platelet therapy versus warfarin combined with dual anti-platelet therapy in Chinese
      patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention.

      The subjects are randomized into study group and control group using central randomization
      for open-label dosing:(1) Study group: dabigatran etexilate 110 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg qd +
      clopidogrel 75 mg qd. Aspirin is withdrawn 1 month later;(2) Control group: warfarin
      (according to clinical routine monitoring of INR, maintain the therapeutic rang at 2.0-3.0) +
      aspirin 100 mg qd + clopidogrel 75 mg qd. Aspirin is withdrawn 1 month later;All patients
      should receive the study medication for 6 month.

      Primary endpoint:Time to the first occurrence of BARC-defined (grade 2-5) clinically relevant
      bleeding.

      Key secondary endpoint:Time to the first occurrence of net clinical adverse events. Net
      clinical adverse event is composed of major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events
      (all death, recurrent myocardial infarction, ischemia-induced revascularization of the target
      vessel, or stroke/systemic embolism) or BARC-defined (grade 2-5) clinically relevant
      bleeding.

      Secondary endpoints:1) Major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular adverse events 2) Major
      bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding (ISTH definition) 3) Major bleeding (ISTH
      definition) 4) Any bleeding event (BARC-defined grade 1-5) 5) Clinically relevant bleeding
      (BARC-defined grade 2-5) 6) Bleeding (BARC-defined grade 3-5)
