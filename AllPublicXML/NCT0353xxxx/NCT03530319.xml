      A randomized clinical trial comparing treatment effectiveness of azithromycin and doxycycline
      for pediatric Mycoplasma pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounts for 10-30% of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children.
      Proportionally, M. pneumoniae has become the most important pathogen for childhood pneumonia
      after the widespread use of Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines. M. pneumoniae is routinely
      treated with antibiotics, and the macrolides antibiotics are the drug of choice for M.
      pneumonia infection. However, macrolide-resistance rates have increased to 20 and 100% in
      Asia. In previous studies, the most common mutation point, A2063G, was detected from 23% of
      local strains in Taiwan. The evolution and spreading of Mycoplasma in Taiwan and different
      countries are unknown. Genotyping based on multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat and
      resistance analysis (MLVA) will be used to study the classification and possibly the
      evolution of M. pneumoniae strains. While the macrolide-resistance is increasing, the optimal
      therapy remains unclear. Both tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones showed promises in treating
      macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae in adults. However, their use in children is not
      recommended due to safety concerns. Recently, evidence are accumulating that doxycycline,
      unlike other tetracyclines, does not cause staining of teeth. In the current study, the
      investigators are going to carry out a randomized control trial to compare the efficacy and
      safety of doxycycline against macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae. On the other hand, the
      investigators are going to update the macrolide-resistant rates in Taiwan and analyze M.
      pneumoniae strains in Taiwan by MLVA. By using this rapid and highly discriminatory tool, the
      investigators could provide more reliable information about the relationship between
      resistance strains
