    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, registry trial which will enroll women aged 65 and above with early
      stage, low risk breast cancer who will be treated with partial mastectomy and intraoperative
      radiation therapy (IORT). The primary aim is to determine the 5-year risk of in-breast tumor
      recurrence. Secondary aims include identification of acute- and late-toxicity, cosmetic
      result, disease-free survival and overall survival.

    <measure>Late Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Degree of late radiation toxicity will be scored based upon RTOG/EORTC (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/Eastern Oncology Radiation Therapy Consortium) late radiation morbidity scoring schema for subcutaneous tissue as well as cosmetic result.
The RTOG/EORTC late radiation morbidity scoring schema on subcutaneous tissue is as follows:
GRADE 1: Slight induration (fibrosis) and loss of subcutaneous fat
GRADE 2: Moderate fibrosis but asymptomatic; slight field contracture; &lt;10% linear reduction
GRADE 3: Severe induration and loss of subcutaneous tissue; field contracture &gt; 10% linear measurement
GRADE 4: Necrosis</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acute radiation toxicity will be scored at the first follow-up visit after IORT (4-6 weeks after treatment).
Radiation dermatitis will be scored based upon CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v4.03 scale as follows:
GRADE 1: Faint erythema or dry desquamation
GRADE 2: Moderate to brisk erythema; patchy moist desquamation, mostly confined to skin folds and creases; moderate edema
GRADE 3: Moist desquamation in areas other than skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion
GRADE 4: Life threatening consequences; skin necrosis or ulceration of full thickness dermis; spontaneous bleeding from involved site; skin graft indicated
Other acute toxicity will also be scored per the CTCAE v4.03 scale and will be rated on the relation to radiation therapy (definitely related, probably related, possibly related, unlikely related, unrelated)</description>

    <description>All patients will undergo a partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy with the goal of achieving a margin-negative resection while maintaining good cosmetic outcome. Immediately following partial mastectomy and frozen section evaluation of the sentinel lymph nodes, IORT is to be delivered. Intraoperative radiation therapy will involve 50 kV xrays to a dose of 20 Gy during breast conserving surgery. After surgery, patients are followed based on the standard schedule determined by their surgeon for 5 years.</description>
