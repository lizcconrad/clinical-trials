      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dosing frequency of gemtuzumab
      ozogamicin when given in combination with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),
      cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone (GCLAM) and to see how well they work in treating
      participants with acute myeloid leukemia or high-grade myeloid tumors (neoplasms) that have
      not been previously treated. Antibody-drug conjugates, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, act by
      directly delivering toxic chemotherapy to cancer cells. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor
      is a growth factor used to stimulate leukemia cells and render them more sensitive to
      chemotherapy drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine, cytarabine and
      mitoxantrone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving gemtuzumab
      ozogamicin in combination with G-CSF, cladribine, cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      may work better in treating participants with acute myeloid leukemia or high-grade myeloid
      neoplasm.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) when added to
      GCLAM in patients with newly-diagnosed AML requiring induction chemotherapy. (Phase I) II. To
      evaluate the 6-month event-free survival (EFS) rate with GO + GCLAM treated at the MTD.
      (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the toxicity profile of the study
      regimen.

      II. Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, measurable residual disease (MRD) rates
      with GO + GCLAM at the MTD to patients treated previously with GCLAM alone.

      III. Estimate, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the relationship between MRD status
      after induction therapy and relapse risk/time to relapse as well as relapse-free and overall
      survival.

      IV. Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, complete remission rates with GO + GCLAM
      at the MTD to patients treated previously with GCLAM alone.

      V. Compare, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, overall survival rates with GO + GCLAM at
      the MTD to patients treated previously with GCLAM alone VI. Evaluate, within the limits of a
      phase 1/2 study, the impact of GO dosing regimens on the duration of cytopenias.

      VII. Collect biological specimens for use for the future laboratory investigation of
      biomarkers for response to GO.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of gemtuzumab ozogamicin followed by a phase
      II study.

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Participants receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) either as a
      single dose on day 1, or as three doses on days 1, 4, and 7. Participants also receive G-CSF
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5, cladribine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 2
      hours on days 1-5, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV on days 1-3. Patients who do not achieve
      a CR or CRi following the first course of induction are eligible for a second course, which
      is given without gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Participants with a complete remission (CR) or
      complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) may then proceed to Post-Remission
      Therapy.

      POST-REMISSION THERAPY: Participants receive G-CSF, cladribine, and cytarabine as in
      Induction Therapy during course 1, and cytarabine IV every 12 hours on days 1-6 of courses
      2-3. Treatment repeats every month for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for 5 years.

    <description>A two-stage design will be used to evaluate the EFS. Patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from the phase 1 portion of the trial will be used in the phase 2 analysis. If censoring occurs, secondary analyses analyzing 6-month EFS accounting for censoring will be done, including estimating 6-month EFS using the Kaplan-Meier method. The first stage of the two-stage phase 2 design will evaluate 30 patients. If 20 or more of the first 30 patients are alive without event at 6-months after study registration, an additional 30 patients will be enrolled. If 46 or more of the 60 patients treated at the MTD are alive and without event at 6-months after study registration, the study will consider the regimen of interest for further investigation.</description>
