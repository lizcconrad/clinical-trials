  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which type of lumbar stabilization exercise is more
      effective to improve functionality and reduce pain in patients operated with lumbar
      arthrodesis, to guide clinical practice in the rehabilitation of these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine which exercise modality (global, local or mixed)
      is most effective in reducing pain and improving function at 6 and 12 weeks after the
      operation. The methodology will be a randomized experimental clinical trial. The study
      population will be subjects who underwent surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis due to
      decompression and posterolateral fusion. The estimation of the sample size was made on the
      basis of the ANOVA test measures, following the guidelines established by Stevens, for which
      an α = 0.05 and β = 0.2 were used, power = 80% and moderate effect size. As a result, the
      program (GPower) gave us a total sample size of 24 subjects, so we will use a sample of 30
      subjects due to the possibility of departure of some of them abandoning during the process.
      The sample will be taken from a waiting list of lumbar spinal stenosis surgery at the
      Traumatological Institute of Santiago (IT). To measure the level of functionality, we will
      use the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 in Spanish, and for pain, the Visual Analogue Scale, in
      addition to recording general data. For each instrument, 3 measurements will be taken:
      preoperative, 6 and 12 weeks after the operation. To analyze the data, the program of the
      latest version of IBM SPSS Statistics Base will be used, a Shapiro Wilks normality test will
      be performed to confirm a normal distribution and then an ANOVA of repeated measures to
      confirm the hypothesis.
