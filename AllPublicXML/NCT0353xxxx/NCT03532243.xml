  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inspiratory muscle training has been an important part of pulmonary rehabilitation program
      directed at patients with COPD. It can increase respiratory muscle strength, relieve dyspnea
      ,improve the quality of life in COPD patients. However, there is no uniform standard for the
      intensity of inspiratory muscle training. By comparing a series of indexes, such as maximal
      inspiratory pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, degree of dyspnea and exercise capacity
      before and after the training under different intensity, a large number of literatures have
      explored the appropriate intensity of inspiratory muscle training. But to date, there are few
      studies about the effects of different intensity of inspiratory muscle training on
      respiratory physiological mechanism. It has been shown that inspiratory muscle training may
      be more beneficial to improve the pulmonary rehabilitation effect of COPD patients with
      inspiratory muscle weakness. So it is not clear whether there is a difference in respiratory
      physiology between patients with normal inspiratory muscle strength and those with lower
      inspiratory muscle strength. Respiratory central drive, as an important physiological index,
      which can be reflected by minute ventilation volume, mouth pressure, mean inspiratory flow
      and diaphragm electromyography,is closely related to the symptoms and the severity of the
      disease.Therefore,the purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of respiratory
      mechanics and central drive in COPD patients at different inspiratory loads, and at the same
      loads between patients with and without respiratory muscle weakness.That can provide more
      evidential evidence for setting up the intensity of inspiratory muscle training.

      The patients with COPD will be admitted in one intervention groups(performing on threshold
      loading device).Before using threshold loading device, we will measure the relevant
      parameters of lung volume, respiratory flow,diaphragm electromyogram, central drive
      mechanical and other baseline index.Then incremental inspiratory load will be applied to
      investigate the effects of inspiratory load on the above mentioned respiratory mechanics
      parameters.
