  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a condition characterized by slowness, weakness, low physical activity, wasting,
      and exhaustion. Frailty increases the risk for adverse outcomes following transplant such as
      increased length of stay in the hospital, mortality, or graft function. No interventions for
      frailty are known for patients with renal disease, but exercise programs like pulmonary
      rehabilitation have been effective in improving frailty in patients with other diseases, such
      as lung disease. The goal of this study is to test whether exercise will also improve frailty
      among patients who are waiting for a kidney transplant and who are considered frail or
      pre-frail.

      RECRUITMENT: This study will be conducted at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. Patients over 18
      who were approved for kidney transplant and identified as frail or pre-frail during their
      kidney transplant evaluation will be approached for recruitment. Interested patients will go
      through the informed consent process and, if frailty testing was not completed within the two
      weeks prior to consent, patients will complete frailty testing. If patients are considered
      frail or pre-frail, they will be enrolled in the study.

      FRAILTY TESTING: Participants will complete the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and
      other frailty testing at the beginning of the study, 4 weeks after beginning the
      intervention, and 8 weeks after beginning the intervention. Frailty testing will include a
      hand grip strength test, a gait speed test over 15 feet, repeated chair stands, balance
      testing, and a body composition scan. Participants will also be asked to wear an activity
      monitor for 5-7 days at each testing point and to complete a set of questionnaires.

      INTERVENTION: Participants will be asked to complete 2 1-hour exercise sessions per week for
      8 weeks (16 total sessions) under the supervision of a licensed respiratory therapist in
      Rochester, MN on non-dialysis days. The exercise sessions will be based on pulmonary
      rehabilitation and will follow guidelines established by the American Thoracic Society.
      Exercise sessions will include endurance, strength, and flexibility training and will be
      tailored to individual participants.

    <measure>Change in Frailty Status</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty will be determined by Frailty Phenotype (FP) or Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores. FP is determined by the presence of 3 or more of the following: slowness (measured by gait speed), exhaustion (measured with the CES-D), weakness (measured by hand grip strength), low physical activity level (measured with the MLTPAQ and activity monitoring), and wasting (measured through self-report or by tracking changes in weight). The SPPB consists of a gait speed test, balance testing, and repeated chair stands. A score less than or equal to 10 will be considered frail.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength will be measured using a hand-held dynamometer. Frailty is characterized as the lowest 20% by gender and body mass index.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Gait Speed</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Gait speed will be measured over a distance of 15 feet at the patient's self-selected walking speed. Frailty is characterized as the slowest 20% by gender and height. Results will be prorated for 4 meters for the SPPB score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Exhaustion</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will self-report their level of exhaustion using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) which consists of a 4-point scale. Items on the CES-D are scored from minimum to maximum values (1 point to 4 points) which are indicated on the CES-D as &quot;rarely or none of the time,&quot; &quot;some or a little of the time,&quot; &quot;occasionally or a moderate amount of time,&quot; &quot;most or all of the time,&quot; respectively. A higher number of points indicates a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Energy expenditure will be measured using an activity monitor worn on the wrist for 5-7 days. Low activity is defined as activity in the lowest 20% (&lt;383 Kcals/week for men or &lt;270 Kcals/week for women). Patients will also self-report their activity level using the MLTPAQ.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wasting</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Wasting is defined as a decrease in lean body mass or unintentional weight loss of 10 or more pounds in one year.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SPPB Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB consists of a gait speed test, repeated chair stands, and balance testing. Lower scores indicate decreased physical function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life will be measured using the KDQOL-SF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-Transplant Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship between exercise, frailty status, and post-transplant outcomes will be examined for patients who receive a transplant within 1 year of enrolling in this study. The various outcome measures will be aggregated to indicate mortality rate up to one year post-transplant.</description>
