      This study will evaluate DigiKnowIt News, a web-based resource to educate youth about
      pediatric clinical research. Youth will be randomly assigned to one of three groups (1.
      Intervention Version A; 2) Intervention Version B; 3) Wait-list control).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to the high numbers of clinical trials with adults, there are far fewer clinical
      trials with children and adolescents; highlighting the need for more clinical trials with
      pediatric populations. Lacking in the area of pediatric clinical research are resources to
      educate children and adolescents about clinical research in fun, interactive, and
      developmentally appropriate ways. Thus, a web-based resource, DigiKnowIt News, was developed
      for youth aged 8 to 14 years to educate youth about participating in pediatric clinical
      trials. The web-based resource includes video spotlights, investigations, and electronic
      comic books. The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      determine the effectiveness of the web-based resource and examine its impact on youths'
      knowledge about pediatric clinical trials, self-efficacy about making decisions about
      participation in clinical research, and positive attitudes towards participation.

    <description>DigiKnowIt News is an online, interactive, multimedia web-based resource designed to educate youth about participating in clinical trials. Youth will learn general information about clinical trials, their rights in a clinical trial, the good and not so good of participating in clinical trials, communication with others during a clinical trial, and specific types of procedures used in clinical trials (i.e., needles, scans). DigiKnowIt News is web-based and youth can complete it at home, on their own time.</description>
