  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intervention will be use of a smartphone app to support tobacco cessation. The app's main
      features include sending motivational messages, displaying money saved, and allowing the user
      to log cravings.

      The investigators will recruit hospitalized young adult smokers aged 18-30 interested in
      cessation over a six-month period. Patients will all receive a UPMC Tobacco Treatment Service
      counseling session focused on motivational interviewing prior to participation in the study.
      Upon consent, participants will then be randomized 1:1 to either standard patient-initiated
      follow-up or use of the Kwit app. Participants will be stratified by sex because males and
      females are known to have highly variable responses to existing tobacco control
      interventions. Investigators will systematically assess feasibility using established
      Likert-type items factors such as interaction, features, engagement, trust, and impact.

      If a participant consents to the study, they will be given a brief survey to collect general
      information related to their smoking behavior. After 30 days, a follow-up survey will be
      conducted to assess their current smoking behavior. Participants randomized to the
      experimental arm will be asked additional questions about their use of the smartphone app.

    <description>Assessment of feasibility - Descriptive statistics that will be obtained via a follow up survey will be used to assess feasibility. The follow up survey will be administered one month after discharge via email, phone or in-person, determined by the preference of the participant. Specific questions will be asked asking participants to rate the Kwit smartphone application based on helpfulness, frequency of use, ease of use, and to list frustrations and helpful aspects of the application. .
How helpful was the Kwit app? Very helpful Somewhat helpful Neutral Not very helpful Not at all helpful
Was the app easy to use? Very Somewhat Neutral Not much Not at all
Was it frustrating to use? Very Somewhat Neutral Not much Not at all
What, if anything, was helpful about the app? What, if anything, was not helpful about the app?</description>

    <description>Assessment of cessation - Descriptive statistics will be used to assess cessation outcomes. The information will be obtained via a follow up survey with specific questions pertaining to the level of participant smoking as well as their confidence levels on maintaining cessation. Since you left the hospital in (month/year), have you smoked a cigarette (even a puff)?
How soon after you left the hospital did you smoke your first cigarette, even a puff? (In other words, how many days in a row, if any, did you go before smoking a cigarette?) In the past 30 days, have you smoked a cigarette, even a puff?
In the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke (even a puff)?
(On the days you smoked), how many cigarettes on average did you smoke (even a puff)?
In the past 7 days, have you smoked a cigarette, even a puff?
How confident are you that you will be able to stay quit?</description>
