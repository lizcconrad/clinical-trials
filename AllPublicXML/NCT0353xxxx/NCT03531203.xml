  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized controlled trial study. The aim of this study was to determine
      the effect of soursop fruit supplementation on blood pressure (BP), serum uric acid (SUA),
      and kidney function.

      The definition of prehypertension and hypertension was accepted as delivered in The Seventh
      Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) as the systolic BP was 120 - 139 mmHg and
      diastolic BP was 80 - 89 mmHg for prehypertension, while systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic
      BP ≥ 90 mmHg for hypertension.

      Based on the study by Sja'bani (2014), the cut-off point of (SUA) was divided into 3
      categories, which are normal (&lt; 5 mg/dL), high-normal (5 - &lt;7 mg/dL), and high (≥ 7 mg/dL).

      A number of 143 people with essential prehypertension and high normal uric acid level were
      assigned as subject in this study. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups which are
      treatment and control group. For a 3 months period, the treatment group was given 2x100 g
      soursop fruit juice per day and the control group was left without treatment.

      Blood pressure was measured by medical team using Omron HEM-907 (digital automatic blood
      pressure monitoring) every 2 weeks (3 times readings for each) in each subject's home.
      Subjects were examined in sitting position. Evaluation of laboratory examination was taken at
      week 0, 7 and 13.
