  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a curvature of the spine that occurs in 1-2% of
      otherwise healthy children, and requires corrective surgery, posterior spinal fusion (PSF) in
      ~10% of cases. Some studies suggest that pulmonary function is reduced in AIS and that PSF
      improves pulmonary function. The lung is composed of a large number of branching airways that
      terminate in gas exchanging units called alveoli, and the number and structure of these
      alveoli are partially dependent upon lung volume and the forces to which they are
      exposed--two factors predicted to be altered in AIS. This study uses MRI imaging of inhaled
      helium to quantify alveolar structure in children with and without AIS before and one-year
      after PSF. The goals of the study are to determine if alveolar architecture or number are
      altered in AIS and whether PSF impacts these same measures.

      After obtaining informed consent, subjects are trained in a breath holding technique that
      permits obtaining reproducible proton and hyperpolarized helium (HHE) lung images. 3-Helium
      is obtained from a vendor and hyperpolarized using an optical spin transfer device (FDA IND
      122,670) and administered through a valved inhalation device while in the MRI scanner. Images
      are obtained during an ~15 second inspiratory breath hold. Proton MRI images are similarly
      obtained during a breath hold with room air using an ultrashort echo time sequence. From
      these MRI images, lung volumes, alveolar sizes, and estimated alveolar numbers are derived.
      Subjects are reimaged at 1 year to evaluate changes in these parameters during normal lung
      growth (controls) or after PSF (AIS subjects).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be diagnosed with AIS.

          2. Have a Cobb Angle &gt; 50Â°.

          3. Be recommended for PSF.

          4. Be between the ages of 8 and 21 years old (inclusive) at the time of surgery.

          5. Be able to perform the required 10 second inspiratory hold and remain lying still for
             that time period without the need for sedative medication (as assessed at time of
             enrollment).

             from scoliosis (e.g.

             cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma, etc.).

          4. Have a personal history of smoking

             (BiPAP) or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is acceptable provided the
             participant can perform the required breath holds without these devices.

          6. Have been born at &lt;35 weeks gestational age.
