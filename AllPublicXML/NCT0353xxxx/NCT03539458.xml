      This study is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center feasibility clinical study of the
      Tendyne Mitral Valve System for the treatment of subjects with symptomatic, severe mitral
      regurgitation and severe mitral annular calcification. Subjects satisfying the study criteria
      will undergo a procedure to implant the Tendyne mitral valve replacement device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Heart Team determines subject is not a suitable candidate for conventional surgical
             treatment due to degree of Mitral Annular Calcification (MAC) present and, the subject
             will likely benefit from transcatheter valve implantation

          2. Severe, symptomatic mitral regurgitation (as defined in the 2017 ACC expert Consensus
             Decision Pathway on the Management of MR)

             must be ambulatory)

          4. Age 18 years or older at time of consent

          5. Not a member of a vulnerable population per the investigator's judgment

          6. The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of
             the study and agrees to its provisions, including complying with study required
             testing and follow-up visits, and has provided written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of Left Ventricle or Left Atrium thrombus

          2. Subject has a chest condition that prevents transapical access

          3. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) less than 25% assessed by echocardiogram

          4. Left Ventricular End Diastolic Dimension (LVEDD) &gt; 7.0 cm

          6. Prior intervention with permanently implanted mitral device (e.g. MitraClip)

          7. Mitral pathoanatomy and Left Ventricular Outflow tract (LVOT) anatomy deemed not
             suitable for Tendyne mitral valve implantation

          8. Any planned cardiac surgery or intervention that is 30 days prior and 30 days post
             that is not concomitant with the Tendyne procedure
