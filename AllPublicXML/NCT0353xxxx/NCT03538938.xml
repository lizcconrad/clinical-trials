  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate ways to improve outcomes for low-education, uninsured or
      Medicaid-eligible smokers who do not successfully quit with standard telephone quit line
      treatment. The study will use an efficient factorial study design to evaluate four
      evidence-based strategies to improve follow-up care offered by the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit
      Line (WTQL) to socioeconomically disadvantaged callers who report smoking four months
      following initial WTQL treatment comprising a single counseling call and 2-week supply of a
      single nicotine replacement therapy. These strategies include: increasing the intensity of
      nicotine replacement medication (among those medically cleared to use such medications),
      increasing the intensity of WTQL counseling, helping callers enroll in an evidence-based
      smoking cessation texting support program (SmokefreeTXT), and offering moderate financial
      incentives for engagement in counseling and SmokefreeTXT.

      This study seeks to evaluate ways to improve outcomes for low-education, uninsured or
      Medicaid-eligible smokers who do not successfully quit with standard telephone quit line
      treatment. The study will use an efficient factorial study design to evaluate four
      evidence-based strategies to improve follow-up care offered by the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit
      Line (WTQL) to socioeconomically disadvantaged callers who report smoking four months
      following initial WTQL treatment comprising a single counseling call and 2-week supply of a
      single nicotine replacement therapy. The four factors (strategies) to be studied include: (1)
      Quit line counseling intensity (1 vs 4 proactive calls); (2) Nicotine replacement therapy
      (NRT) intensity (Patch for 2 weeks vs Patch+Lozenge for 4 weeks); (3) SmokefreeTXT text
      messages (proactive enrollment vs none); and (4) financial incentives for treatment
      engagement (vs none). The study design is a fully-crossed 4-factor factorial design. The
      primary aim is: Assessment of the main and interactive effects of the four treatment factors
      on biochemically-confirmed 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at the 6-month followup.
      Secondary aims include testing: (1) self-reported abstinence at 12 weeks post-quit; (2)
      continuous abstinence between 1 and 6 months; (3) cost-effectiveness; and (4) moderators of
      treatment engagement and mediators of treatment effectiveness on 6-month abstinence.

    <description>SmokefreeTXT support is a national program offered at no cost to users (apart from data/minute costs charged by cellular providers about which enrollees are advised at enrollment) and is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. This program sends up to 5 messages per day for up to 2 weeks prior to the target quit day and 6 weeks following the target quit day (total duration may be longer if participants elect to change the target quit day). The text messages offer tips to help enrollees achieve their goal of quitting smoking and offer real-time interactive tips when participants text in responses indicating cravings, negative moods, or slips. Participants have the option to reset quit dates and have the option to unsubscribe at any time by texting STOP to the program.</description>

    <ipd_description>The University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW-CTRI) is committed to making final research datasets available to the scientific community in a timely fashion in accord with general NIH policy. The following are the main types of data that will be generated by this grant:
Behavioral, health, and economic data and outcomes for all participants in the primary research.
Data on individual differences and risk factors for treatment acceptance, smoking cessation outcomes, and response to cessation treatments.
In accord with Institutional Review Board (IRB) policies, the UW-CTRI will act under its own auspices as the hub for making de-identified data available. The PI will make the set of final de-identified datasets available by request from other researchers in a timely manner.</ipd_description>
