  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aim to evaluate an endodontic treatment protocol using adjunctive steps for
      disinfection of teeth with primary endodontic infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success of endodontic treatment in teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis
      depends on the reduction of viable microorganisms of root canals by endodontic disinfection
      procedures. This study aims to evaluate by molecular methods the effect of different
      disinfection procedures on reduction, diversity and microbial metabolic activity. Patients
      with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis in single-rooted teeth will be selected.
      Microbiological samples will be taken from root canals after access cavity (S1), after
      chemomechanical preparation with Reciproc System and 2.5% NaOCl (S2), after irrigant
      activation using the XP-Endo Finisher instrument (S3a) and ultrasonic activation (S3b); and
      after intracanal medication with calcium hydroxide for 14 days (S4). DNA and RNA will be
      extracted from root canal samples, and cDNA synthetized using reverse transcription reaction.
      The effect of treatment protocols on total microbiota will be determined by rDNA-based qPCR
      using universal primers for Bacteria domain. RNA of root canal samples will be used to
      determine the diversity of metabolically active microbiota by Reverse Transcriptase Reaction
      (RT), followed by amplification (PCR) and high throughput sequencing of the hypervariable
      region V1-V2-V3 of 16S rRNA gene. The metabolic activity of the most prevalent species / taxa
      will be calculated by rRNA- and rDNA-based molecular methods. The data will be analyzed by
      statistical tests, with 5% significance level.
