  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment improves sleepiness, depression and
      social activities in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This evolution can be
      captured from changes in smartphone usage habits coupled with a mobile-based services. The
      aim of this study is to assess the impact of CPAP treatment on smartphone usage habits in OSA
      patients.

    <textblock>
      Callsas is a prospective study embarking newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea patients
      initiated to CPAP treatment.

      The primary objective is to analyze the modifications in smartphone usage habits before and
      after CPAP treatment.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Correlation between changes in smartphone usage habits and evolution of sleepiness

        -  Correlation between changes in smartphone usage habits and evolution of depression scale

        -  Correlation between changes in smartphone usage habits and evolution of quality of life

        -  Correlation between changes in physical activity measured by smartphones and evolution
           of physical activity objectively measured by actigraphy and gait platform

        -  Correlation between smartphone usage habits and CPAP adherence
