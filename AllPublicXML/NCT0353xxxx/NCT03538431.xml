  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of treatment with the anti-anxiety medicine buspirone on
      driving performance (eye tracking) in individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum
      disorder (HF-ASD).

      The study consists of an Assessment Visit at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), as well as
      two Driving Simulation visits that will take place at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
      (MIT). Subjects will be given buspirone and asked to take the medication for the two days
      preceding the Driving Simulation Visit.
