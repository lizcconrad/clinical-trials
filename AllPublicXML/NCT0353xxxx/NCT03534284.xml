  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common and distressing symptom for patients on hemodialysis (HD), and there is
      evidence for a much larger impact on the health of patients. Chronic insomnia is disrupted
      sleep that occurs at least three nights per week and lasts at least three months.

      The SLEEP-HD study is a randomized open-label clinical trial to compare two types of
      treatment for insomnia in participants who have end-stage renal disease on HD, and who have
      been diagnosed with chronic insomnia. The two types of treatment involved in the study are
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) or treatment with a drug (trazodone vs
      placebo).

      125 participants will be enrolled who are undergoing HD in two study locations (Seattle,
      Washington and Albuquerque, New Mexico).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most HD patients have significant impairments in quality of life, largely from the high
      frequency of disabling symptoms. Insomnia is one of the most frequently reported symptoms and
      studies of HD patients and/or other populations suggest that it is a significant contributor
      to other common symptoms and poor health outcomes. There are unique contributors to chronic
      insomnia in HD patients and these include the biologic effects of residual uremia after
      partial correction as is achieved with current dialysis technology, maladaptation to
      treatment schedules, and patients' napping during treatments.

      There is a compelling need to identify effective treatments for insomnia in HD patients and
      the interventions being studied in this clinical trial, telehealth cognitive behavioral
      therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and trazodone, have a strong scientific premise. If telehealth
      (web-based) CBT-I is effective for insomnia in HD patients, it will make a treatment that is
      presently inaccessible available to patients. Trazodone is widely used but the data on
      efficacy for insomnia are limited; no such data exist for HD patients.

      SLEEP-HD is a parallel group randomized controlled trial wherein 125 HD patients with chronic
      insomnia, treated in community-based dialysis facilities in Seattle and Albuquerque, will be
      randomized 2:2:1 over 31 months to 6-week treatment with telehealth CBT-I, trazodone, or
      medication placebo.
