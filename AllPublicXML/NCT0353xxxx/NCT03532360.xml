  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this study evaluates whether tolerance to peanuts and tree nuts can be induced in patients
      through a process of oral immunotherapy. Participants will be randomized into groups
      receiving oral immunotherapy and a control group that will receive no intervention

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are proposing to initiate a study assessing a common desensitization
      protocol for peanut/tree nut allergy. This study would enable the investigators to better
      determine the potential benefit of desensitization in individuals with peanut/tree nut
      allergy.

      More specifically, the investigators will address the following research objectives:

      Objectives A. To develop a protocols for peanut/tree nut desensitization with high (300mg)
      and low (30mg maintenance dose).

      B. To determine the rate of desensitization to peanut/tree nut. C. To characterize predictors
      of successful desensitization. D. To characterize molecular mechanisms involved in the
      process of desensitization

      These objectives will be evaluated through a randomized controlled trial

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria: Children 6 years and older who satisfy all the following criteria will
        be included:

          -  A history suggestive of immediate allergy to peanut/tree nut . A convincing clinical
             history of an IgE mediated reaction to a specific food will be defined as a minimum of
             2 mild signs/symptoms or 1 moderate or 1 severe sign/symptom that was likely IgE
             mediated and occurred within 120 minutes after ingestion or contact (or inhalation in
             the case of fish and shellfish). Reactions will be considered mild if they involve
             pruritus, urticaria, flushing, or rhinoconjunctivitis; moderate if they involve
             angioedema, throat tightness, gastrointestinal complaints, or breathing difficulties
             (other than wheeze); and severe if they involve wheeze, cyanosis, or circulatory
             collapse.(54-57)

          -  The presence of at least one of the following confirmatory tests:

               -  Positive SPT to peanut/tree nut or its proteins (weal diameter 3 mm larger than
                  that of the normal saline control). The allergens used will be commercial
                  extracts of peanut/tree nut (Omega Labs, Toronto, Ontario).

               -  Detection of serum specific IgE (&gt;0.35 kU/L) to peanut/tree nut or any of its
                  proteins, measured by fluorescence enzyme immunoassay (Phadia, CAP System,
                  Uppsala, Sweden).

               -  Positive oral challenge test to peanut/tree nut. Oral challenges will be
                  performed with raw peanut/tree nut according to the recommendations of the
                  position paper of the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology
                  (58).

          -  Informed consent form signed by the parents or legal guardian

        Exclusion criteria.

          -  Patients who are unstable from a respiratory point of view ..

          -  Patients who present with intercurrent disease at the time of starting
             desensitization.

          -  Non-IgE-mediated or non-immunological adverse reactions to nuts.

          -  Malignant or immunopathological diseases and/or severe primary or secondary immune
             deficiencies.

          -  Patients receiving immunosuppressor therapy

          -  Patients receiving β-blockers (including topical formulations).

          -  Associated diseases contraindicating the use of epinephrine: cardiovascular disease or
