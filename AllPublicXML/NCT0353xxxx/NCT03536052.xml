  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of the new imaging/simulation (&quot;virtual
      heart&quot;) approach for determining the optimal ablation sites in patients with VT, which render
      post-infarction VT non-inducible. The study will test both the acute outcome of the ablation
      procedure, and the effect the use of the predicted targets has upon procedure time.

    <description>If a good quality cardiac MRI is obtained and a virtual heart model with the ablation targets is generated, the operating physician will merge the virtual heart lesion map to the invasive electroanatomical navigation system. After the patient has been catheterized, an attempt should be made to induce VT. The physician should then navigate the catheter to each of the ablation targets specified, and place a lesion as per his or her training and experience, confirming when done that the lesion marker in the mapping system coincides with the target. This will be done for each lesion.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients must be at least 18 years old at the time of enrollment.

          -  A Pre-Op cardiac MRI including late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) must be performed
             prior to ablation. As Johns Hopkins University (JHU) performs MRIs with implantable
             cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker implanted, patients with these devices
             may be enrolled.

          -  Eligible patients must suffer from VT, thought to be secondary to structural heart
             disease (scarring).

          -  Eligible patients must be determined to be suitable candidates for ablation to treat
             VT by their cardiologist and/or electrophysiologists regardless of this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) &lt; 30 mL/min should not be enrolled in
             the study due to the use of intravenous gadolinium as an MRI contrast agent

          -  If a pre-procedure MRI cannot or likely will not be performed for any reason (such as
             claustrophobia), the patient must be excluded.

          -  Pregnant women may not participate in the study because gadolinium MRI contrast is
             contraindicated in these patients.

          -  Any subject that, during the course of the pre-procedure imaging, is discovered to
             have VT not related to scarring, he/she must be de-enrolled from the study.
