  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents may lead to various cardio-vascular adverse
      reactions. This study investigates reports of cardio-vascular toxicities for treatment
      including Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification L (antineoplastic agents,
      endocrine therapy, immunostimulants, and immunosuppressants drugs) in the World Health
      Organization's (WHO) global database of individual safety case reports (VigiBase).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antineoplastic therapies are responsible of a wide range of cardio-vascular side effects.The
      investigators use VigiBase, the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety
      case reports, to identify cases of cardiovascular adverse drug reactions following treatment
      with antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents
