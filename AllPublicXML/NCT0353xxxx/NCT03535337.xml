  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an adaptive adherence intervention, which utilizes two
      mobile health (mHealth) intervention designs, in an effort to promote adherence to
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieve and maintain viral load (VL) suppression in youth
      living with HIV (YLH) while increasing understanding of the context for wide-scale
      implementation of cell phone support (CPS) and text messaging support (SMS), with and without
      incentives.

      The study will consist of two points of randomization. The first step involves randomization
      of participants to receive either CPS or SMS using a 1:1 allocation ratio. Both intervention
      conditions will receive 3 months of intervention (i.e., 12 weeks of CPS or SMS).

      The second step involves a stratified randomization in blocks with 8 possible intervention
      trajectories. Within each condition, participants are categorized into two groups -
      responders with VL&lt;200 (Rsp) and non-responders with VL â‰¥200 (NRsp). Responders in the CPS
      condition will be randomly assigned to receive either 3 months of CPS tapered (CPS-T)
      intervention followed by standard care (SC) or only SC. Similarly, responders in the
      SMScondition will be randomly assigned to receive either 3 months of SMS tapered (SMS-T)
      intervention followed by SC or only SC. Non-responders in both CPS and SMS conditions will be
      randomly assigned to receive either 3 months of incentivized CPS (CPS-I) followed by 3 months
      of CPS-T and 3 months of SC or 3 months of incentivized SMS (SMS-I) followed by 3 months of
      SMS-T and 3 months of SC.
