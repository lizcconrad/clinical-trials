  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff muscles are originates from the scapula and they are primarly responsible for
      the dynamic stabilization of glenohumeral joint. Optimal scapulo-humeral rythm is needed for
      their optimal functioning. However; after surgeries of rotator cuff tears little is know
      about the scapulo-humeral rythm is restored or not. The aim of the study is to investigate
      changes in scapular kinematics after rotator cuff repair surgery.

    <textblock>
      Rotator Cuff (RC) muscles are primary dynamic stabilizers of shoulder joint. Therefore, the
      repair of rotator cuff ruptures is a common procedure. The primarly goals of the
      post-surgical rehabilitation are gaining normal ranges of glenohumeral joint and restoring
      the kinematics of shoulder girdle. The scapular stabilization exercises are important
      fuatures of this process because scapulo-thoracic joint very important for normal kinematics
      of glenohumeral joint and RC muscles. Yet, little is known about the scapular orientations
      after RC repair surgerys. The aim of the study is to investigate mid-term changes in scapular
      kinematics after RC repair surgery
