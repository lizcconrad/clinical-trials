      women candidate for office hystroscopy were randomized to either flushing of the endocervix
      and endometrium with 4 ml lidocaine 2% diluted in 15 ml normal saline or 19 ml normal saline
      before office hystroscopy

      Patients were asked to urinate to evacuate the bladder. Posterior vaginal retractor was
      introduced to expose the cervix and ( embryo transfer catheter was introduced throught the
      cervix passing the internal os and intrauterine and intracervical instillation of to either
      flushing of the endocervix and endometrium with 4 ml lidocaine 2% diluted in 15 ml normal
      saline or 19 ml normal saline.

      After 5 mins the procedure was started A rigid 3.5 mm hystroscope with an optic of 30 degrees
      was used. Normal saline solution was used as distension media, with 120 mmHg intrauterine
      pressure, Vaginoscopic approach, nocervical tenaculum or dilators used.

      Post procedure pain management by optional dose of 75 mg of diclofenac potassium when
      requested.

    <description>pain assessment during hystroscopy using visual analogue scale VAS. is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured.Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10‐cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100</description>
