    <textblock>
      In this study, patients with BCC will be given neoadjuvant treatment with a drug called
      sonidegib. Sonidegib is a daily tablet usually given for BCC that cannot be removed by
      surgery or that has spread through the body. The study aims to see if sonidegib given for 12
      weeks will reduce the size of tumours so surgery results in less scarring or may be avoided,
      with only short term topical treatment required to treat remaining tumour.

      Surgery is the first line treatment for most basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) with cure rates of
      88 to 96%. However, excision of large lesions in sensitive locations such as the face and
      scalp may result in disfigurement and impairment of function. Neoadjuvant drug treatment
      given before surgery aims to reduce tumour size so that surgery and recovery is easier. In
      this study, patients with BCC will be given neoadjuvant treatment with a drug called
      sonidegib. Sonidegib is a daily tablet usually given for BCC that cannot be removed by
      surgery or that has spread through the body. The study aims to see if sonidegib given for 12
      weeks will reduce the size of tumours so surgery results in less scarring or may be avoided,
      with only short term topical treatment required to treat remaining tumour. This approach may
      also reduce the risk of recurrence. To assess response to treatment, we will use a new
      technology for skin tumours called optical coherence technology (OCT). This is like an
      ultrasound scan and is non invasive. OCT can detect the extent and nature of the tumour and
      build a 3D image with great accuracy. OCT will be used together with pathological analysis of
      tumour tissue to determine response to sonidegib.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pilot study which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of short term neoadjuvant sonidegib followed by surgery or imiquimod in the management of basal cell carcinomas in cosmetically challenging locations, assessed by optical coherence tomography and histopathology. The data from this pilot study may lead to the design of larger scale trials of neoadjuvant targeted therapy with the aim to decrease the morbidity of surgical treatment and increase the probability of a curative resection in larger patient populations.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Imiquimod is an immune response modifier that promotes NF-kappa-B-mediated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and other mediators. These immune responses produce cytotoxic effects that are antiproliferative and anti-tumour. Imiquimod treatment requires an extended treatment period of 6 weeks for superficial BCC. Imiquimod is an option for the treatment of small, low-risk superficial BCC when surgery, curettage or cryotherapy are inappropriate. Treatment with imiquimod will be for 5 days a week for a total of 6 weeks.</description>
