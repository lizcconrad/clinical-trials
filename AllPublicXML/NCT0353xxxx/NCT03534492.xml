  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is radical cystectomy, which
      is rarely curative. Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with an improvement
      in Overall Survival (OS), but only a few patients can benefit from this approach. Therefore,
      new neoadjuvant treatments are required for muscle- invasive bladder cancer. In this study it
      will be explored the activity of durvalumab plus olaparib in advanced Transitional Cell
      Carcinoma of the Bladder and therefore may have beneficial outcomes in the neoadjuvant
      setting. Adverse events associated with durvalumab and olaparib is one of the potential risks
      in this study. Participation in this trial, in which 6-8 weeks of preoperative treatment will
      be administered, is not expected to result in delays of surgery for participants. It is not
      foreseen that treatment with durvalumab and olaparib has a relevant impact on operability or
      increases the risks associated with surgery
