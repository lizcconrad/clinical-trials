        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 45% of predicted.

          -  Diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) corrected for hemoglobin ≥
             30% of predicted value

          -  Ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to FVC ≥ 0.70.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Best, acceptable FVC from separate screening spirometry that differ by ≥ 200 mL.

          -  Respiratory exacerbation(s) or hospitalization for IPF exacerbation within 3 months
             before screening.

          -  Anticipated to receive a lung transplant during the subject's participation in the
             study.

          -  Active smoker or smoking cessation within 12 weeks before screening.

          -  Malignancy within the last 5 years, with the exception of curable cancer that has
             received adequate treatment.

          -  Evidence of any unstable or untreated, clinically significant disease or condition
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the interpretation of the
             study or place the subject at increased risk.

          -  Treatment with high dose corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents, unapproved IPF targeted
             therapy, and cytokine modulating agents within 8 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) before screening

          -  Participation in an investigational study with the last dose of investigational
             product occurring within 8 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before
             screening.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Medical history of infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

          -  History of alcohol abuse and/or dependence within the last 2 years.

          -  History within the last 2 years of significant mental illness, or physical dependence
             on any opioid or illicit drugs.

        Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria could apply.
