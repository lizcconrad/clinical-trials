  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 24-week study is to determine whether the &quot;Parent-based Crisis Prevention
      Institute (CPI) physical management training program&quot; (i.e., P-CPI) is effective in
      increasing self-efficacy in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

      Parents of children with ASD deal with more stress, especially if their child demonstrates
      self-injurious and aggressive behavior. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether
      &quot;Parent-based Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) physical management training program&quot; (i.e.,
      P-CPI) for parents of children with ASD helps alleviate some of this stress and increase
      parental self-efficacy, physical management competency, and overall quality of life.

      Participants who meet criteria will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the
      waitlist control group. Participants assigned to the treatment group will be invited to a
      6-hour P-CPI group training session. This parent-based training in CPI's Nonviolent Crisis
      InterventionÂ® will include nonverbal, paraverbal, verbal, and physical intervention
      techniques. Participants assigned to the waitlist group will be encouraged to continue their
      existing medical support, or services, as they typically would. The waitlist group will be
      invited to participate in the P-CPI training at the conclusion of the post-assessment period.

      Baseline measures will be on the day of training for the treatment group and within five days
      of the P-CPI training for the waitlist group. Follow-up measures will be at 2-week, and 1, 2,
      and 3- month post-baseline. The treatment group will also participate in a follow-up group
      interview.
