      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female between 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent.

             Disorders ICSD-2 or ICSD-3 criteria.

          3. At the Screening Visit and the Baseline Visit, subjects who are not on Xyrem at study
             entry must have ESS scores ≥ 11 (as assessed with a look-back period of 1 week).

          4. If currently treated with Xyrem, must have documented clinical improvement of EDS per
             Investigator's clinical judgment.

          5. Average nightly total sleep time of ≥ 7 hours, per subject history. Total sleep time
             will be confirmed by Investigator's review of sleep diaries collected during the final
             2 weeks of the Screening Period.

          6. If currently treated with stimulants and / or alerting agents or nicotine replacement
             therapy, must have been taking the same regimen and dose for at least 2 months prior
             to screening and must agree to take the same dose leading up to and throughout the
             Double-blind Randomized Withdrawal Period.

          7. Have used a medically acceptable method of contraception for at least 2 months prior
             to the first dose of study drug and consent to use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception from the first dose of study drug, throughout the entire study period,
             and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Hypersomnia due to another medical, behavioral, or psychiatric disorder condition.

          2. Evidence of untreated or inadequately treated sleep-disordered breathing.

             behavior disorder, etc.).

          4. Current or past (within 1 year) major depressive episode according to DSM-5 criteria.
             Patients with depression under control are allowed per the judgment of the
             Investigator or the treating physician and the anti-depressant treatment has to be
             stable for at least 6 months prior to Screening and remain stable for the duration of
             the study.

          5. Current suicidal risk as determined from history by presence of active suicidal
             ideation as indicated by positive response to item #4 or #5 on C-SSRS, or any history
             of suicide attempt.

          6. Occupation requiring nighttime shift work or variable shift work with early work start
             times or other occupations that could affect the safety of the subject per the
             judgment of the Investigator.

          7. Treatment or planned treatment with benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics /
             hypnotics / sedatives, neuroleptics, opioids, barbiturates, and medications containing
             valproic acid or its sodium salt (eg, depakene and depakote) within 2 weeks prior to
             enrollment. Discontinuation for the purpose of this study is permitted only if
             considered medically appropriate by the Investigator, and subjects must abstain from
             these medications during the study.

          8. Current or past substance use disorder (including alcohol) according to DSM-5
             criteria, or the subject is unwilling to refrain from consuming alcohol, cannabinoids,
