  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agitation, paranoia, and suicide risk of the psychiatric patients made them difficult to be
      managed when they visited medical emergency services. The prolonged waiting time at medical
      emergency services and the stigmatization of psychiatric medicine also made the psychiatric
      emergency services full of challenges. However, in recent years, the random killings,
      celebrity suicide and other major social events attracted much attention to the emergency
      psychiatry.

      Following the establishment of the National Health Insurance, the law of mandatory admission,
      and the prevalence change of all psychiatric diseases, we are now dealing with totally
      different types of emergent psychiatric conditions, i.e., depression and suicide. However,
      the real epidemiological data need to be updated. Psychiatric emergency is one of the
      entrances of the psychiatric network. A comprehensive review of the psychiatric emergency
      would be needed for the base of further research.

      This study is aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis of patients who
      came to Emergency Department of National Taiwan University Hospital and needed a psychiatric
      consultation. The epidemiological data will be compared to those collected 30 years ago in
      the same hospital to examine the 30-year trend. On the other hand, the visiting time and the
      staying time will be analyzed. The stress of on-duty and the contributing factors will be
      assessed by a 2-hour in-depth interview with psychiatric residents.
