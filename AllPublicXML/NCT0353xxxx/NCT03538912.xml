  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empirical antifungal therapy (EAT) is frequently prescribed to septic critically ill patients
      with risk factors for invasive Candida infections (ICI). However, among patients without
      subsequent proven ICI, antifungal discontinuation is rarely performed, resulting in
      unnecessary antifungal overuse.

      The investigators postulate that the use of fungal biomarkers could increase the percentage
      of early discontinuation of EAT among critically ill patients suspected of ICI, as compared
      with a standard strategy, without negative impact on day 28-mortality.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators designed a randomized controlled open-label
      parallel-group study.

      Patients requiring EAT will be randomly assigned to:

        -  intervention group: a strategy in which EAT duration is determined by (1,3)-B-Dglucan
           and mannan serum assays, performed on day 0 (day of EAT initiation) and day 3. Early
           stop recommendation, provided before day 7, will be determined using an algorithm based
           on the results of biomarkers.

        -  control group: a routine care strategy, based on international guidelines, which
           recommend 14 days of treatment for patients without subsequent proven ICI, and who
           improve under antifungal treatment, or less in other situations.

    <description>Five body sites (among urine, anal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, axillary swabs, gastric aspirates if patients have a nasogastric tube, and tracheal aspirates if patients are intubated or have a tracheotomy) are sampled on day 0 and then once per week for the semi-quantitative determination of yeast colonisation. The number of colony-forming units is scored as follows: score 1, &lt;10 colony-forming units; score 2, 10 to 50 colony-forming units; score 3, &gt;50 colony-forming units; score 4, &gt;50 colony-forming units confluent. Intensity of colonization is determined for each date of sampling, by dividing the sum score for each colonized site by the number of sites sampled giving a mean Candida load. An overall score of &gt;4 is possible in the case of isolation of several Candida species.</description>
