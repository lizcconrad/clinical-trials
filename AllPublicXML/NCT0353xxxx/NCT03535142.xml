  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective non-randomized intervention case control study on patients with a BMI &gt; 35. The
      intervention group/cases (n=600) is comprised of bariatric patients who undergo bariatric
      surgery and the control group (n=600) of age, weight and comorbidity matched patients who
      choose not to undergo bariatric surgery. The overall aim is to examine prevalence of the
      spectrum of fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in these patients and the prognostic significance of
      NAFLD.

    <time_frame>10 years follow up after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Difference NAFLD severity between case and control group after 10 years follow up. Simple steatosis is the mildest form and liver cirrhosis is the most serious manifestation:
Grade 1 steatosis
Grade 2 steatosis
Grade 3 steatosis
Non alcoholic steatohepatitis
Presence of fibrosis Kleiner grade 1-2
Presence of fibrosis Kleiner grade 3
Presence of liver cirrhosis</description>

    <measure>Change in continuous reaction time measurement after bariatric surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years follow up after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous reaction time measurement will measure reaction time instability and is a measure of metabolic encephalopathy. The method is a 10-minutes, computerised registration of a series of motor reaction times to an auditory stimulus, with results reported as the CRTindex (50 percentile/(90-10) percentile) as a parameter of reaction time variability. A CRT index below 1.9 i considerede abnormal a may be a sign of hepatic encephalopathy.</description>

    <measure>Change in EEG after bariatric surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean dominant frequency(MD) on EEG spectral analysis. EEG disturbances in hepatic encephalopathy are (rated by severity)but there is no enough space here to describe it.</description>
