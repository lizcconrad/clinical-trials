  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial to test whether tertiary center-affiliated pediatricians with expertise
      in medical complexity joining medical visits with patients' community primary care providers
      is feasible and acceptable. We will also collect data on a range of patient-centered and
      utilization outcomes to determine effect compared to usual care.
