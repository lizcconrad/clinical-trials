  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators analyzed a group of infertile women treated with Ulipristal Acetate (UA)
      for uterine fibroids at the Humanitas Fertility Center. All the patients' data were extracted
      from the Fertility Center external-audit-anonymized electronic research query system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the recent years several large studies have been published on the efficacy of Ulipristal
      Acetate treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women:
      initially proposed only as pre-surgical treatment, the UA was subsequently also used for the
      long-term treatment of uterine myomas symptoms ( Donnez 2016).

      However, few data are available on the effects of UA in terms of increasing fecundability,
      implantation and pregnancy outcome and safety in the general population, and in infertile
      patients in particular (Luycx 2014).

      This retrospective study aims at describing the correlation between the use of Ulipristal
      Acetate and pregnancy outcome in infertile patients and at comparing the UA plus surgery
      approach to the UA-only treatment in terms of pregnancy outcome.
