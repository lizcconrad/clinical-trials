  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who can not receive cisplatin therapy
      will receive nivolumab or nivolumab/lirilumab before a planned surgical procedure called a
      radical cystectomy (RC) to remove the bladder.

      Nivolumab works by attaching to and blocking a molecule called Programmed Death-1 (PD-1).
      Lirilumab attaches to and blocks a group of molecules called Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-Like
      Receptor (KIR). PD-1 and KIR are proteins present mainly on immune system cells, and each
      controls part of the immune system by shutting it down. It is hoped that by binding to and
      inactivating these proteins, these drugs can enhance the body's ability to detect, attack and
      destroy cancer cells.

      The purpose of this research study is to see whether nivolumab alone or combination of
      nivolumab and lirilumab given before surgery is effective in treating people who have bladder
      cancer, and to examine the side effects, good and bad, associated with nivolumab and
      lirilumab.

    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer (BC) is the 6th most common malignancy in the United States with an estimated
      79,030 new cases and 16,870 deaths in 2017. It is the 4th most common cancer in men and there
      are presently &gt;500,000 BC patients alive in the US. It accounts for about 5% of all new
      cancers in the US. It is also the most expensive cancer to treat from diagnosis to death.
      Almost a third of BC patients present with MIBC.

      This is a Phase Ib open-label clinical trial for patients with cisplatin-ineligible MIBC
      (Stage T2-T4a, N0-N1, M0). Neoadjuvant treatment must start within 8 weeks of transurethral
      resection of the first transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) that showed
      muscularis propria invasion.

      Patients must have sufficient baseline tumor tissue. Tumor tissue content for CD8+ T-cell
      density assessment must be qualified as sufficient (â‰¥ 20% tumor content in the specimen) for
      analysis and must be documented by the local pathologist prior to registration.

      The first 12 patients will be enrolled into Cohort 1 and treated with nivolumab before a
      planned RC.

      In the absence of the occurrence of high rate of treatment related Adverse Events (AEs) with
      nivolumab, the study will proceed with enrollment into Cohort 2 with the combination of
      nivolumab/lirilumab before a planned RC.

      Each group will receive a total of 2 doses (week 0 and 4) of nivolumab (Cohort 1) or
      nivolumab/lirilumab (Cohort 2) therapy followed by RC with bilateral (standard or extended)
      pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).

      Mandatory tumor tissue at Screening (archived tumor tissue from Transurethral Resection of
      Bladder Tumor [TURBT] may be used) and at time of RC. Peripheral blood and urine samples are
      also required.
