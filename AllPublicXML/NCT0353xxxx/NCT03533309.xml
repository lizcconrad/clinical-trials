      PICO P- Horizontal deficient alveolar ridge in Anterior Maxillary Region I- Computer guided
      surgical cutting guide C- Conventional alveolar ridge splitting O- Clinical outcome and
      radiographic outcomes Primary outcome: Accuracy In computer Guided: CBCT will performed
      pre-operative and post-operative for measure the difference of degree in superimposition
      after ridge splitting.

      In conventional method: Ridge mapping will applied in preoperative clinical evaluation, and
      measure in post-operative, the difference in splitting will calculate in millimeter (mm)
      Secondary outcome: Thickness of buccal cortical plate In both technique CBCT will performed
      and measuring the Both Buccal and palatal cortical bone in millimeter(mm)
