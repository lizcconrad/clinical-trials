  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis and current observation is that PFx gases used as contrast agents
      readily provide functional images of the lung airways including important regional
      ventilation information such as ventilation defect severity and gas trapping. This is a pilot
      proof of concept study to demonstrate the non-inferiority of 19F MRI gas Ventilation imaging
      compared to 133Xe ventilation Scintigraphy in subjects with lung disease. The secondary goal
      of the study is to develop sufficient information to adequately power a pivotal trial of 19F
      MRI gas Ventilation imaging compared to 133Xe Ventilation Scintigraphy

      Aim 1: Compare measures of lung ventilation performance obtained using 133Xe Scintigraphy
      with performance using 19F Perfluorinated gas MRI using two independent readers.

      133Xe Scintigraphy will be scored using the methods described in the statistics section and
      19F images will be scored using the methods described in the statistics section. Scores for
      each subject will be earluated for consistency between readers and modalities. 60%
      concordance will be considered equivalent.

      The outcomes of the work proposed is expected to show the non-inferiority of 19F
      Perfluorinated gas MRI to 133Xenon Scintigraphy

    <description>To evaluate the non-inferiority of 19F Perfluorinated gas MRI compared to 133 Xenon Scintigraphy ventilation imaging studies two readers will be selected as having experience reading Xe-133 ventilation scans. Readers will also receive training on interpretation of 19F ventilation images We note that the nature of the images both nuclear medicine and 19F MRI preclude blinding of the readers to the image modality. Images from each modality will be assessed independently and the images will be coded so that readers will not know which image set is from each subject.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment
        into the trial

          1. Outpatients of either gender, age &gt; 18.

          2. Willing and able to give informed consent and adhere to visit/protocol schedules.
             (Consent must be given before any study procedures are performed.)

          3. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test. This will
             be confirmed before participation in this investigational protocol.

          4. Completion of 133Xe ventilation scintigraphy after referral for ventilation imaging
             for any reason in Pro00081987 A Comparison of Technegas® and Xenon 133 Planar Lung
             Imaging in Subjects Referred for Ventilation Scintigraphy. The MRI will be
             accomplished in a timely fashion after the Scintigraphy study based on scheduling
             availability in the Center for Advanced Magnetic Resonance Development (CAMRD).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the trial:

        1. Conditions that will prohibit MRI scanning (metal in eye, claustrophobia, inability to
        lie supine)
