  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if implantable cardiac device leads implanted in
      the His bundle are capable of detecting ventricular arrhythmias.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During routine testing of implanted leads, the His bundle lead will be connected to a
      separate device with all therapies disabled. Testing will be done to see if the His bundle
      lead can detect ventricular arrhythmias.
