    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if cortisone shots in the neck are helpful in
      patients with certain MRI findings. Additionally, the investigators hope to learn if cervical
      facet joint steroid injections are beneficial in the subset of patients with MRI findings
      consistent with facet joint synovitis.
