  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether creative writing in newly diagnosed
      cancer patients and those with recent progression in their disease will have a positive
      impact on their mental health. Using a randomized controlled trial approach, emotion
      thermometers will be employed to evaluate participants' responses on a number of domains,
      such as anxiety, depression, despair, and anger along with a series of survey questions to
      monitor changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms. Open-ended survey questions will be used
      to capture how a creative writing intervention impacts participants' experience of their
      illness. Melissa Greene's Write from the Heart program focuses more on creative writing
      rather than cancer focused topics. Patients in the intervention arm will complete -one and a
      half hour group sessions every two weeks over the span of 3 months. Participants in the
      active control arm will be provided a book (i.e., Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg)
      about creative writing and will be asked to do activities for 1.5 hrs every 2 weeks for a
      period of 3 months.

      Mental wellness before and after intervention in both arms. A validated Emotional Thermometer
      Scales will be used to predict changes in parameters reflecting participants' mental health
      pre- and post-intervention. Survey questions focused on symptoms of depression and anxiety
      will be used to monitor for changes in mental wellness pre- and post-intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized within strata formed by cancer type in order to assure that these potentially important confounding variables are balanced across groups. Patients will be enrolled on a rolling basis over a three-month period, allowing patients in intervention arm to participate in 3 months workshops (workshops would be held once every 2 weeks). Patients in control arm will be provided a book (Writing Down Bones by Natalie Goldberg) about creative writing and will be asked to do activities for 1.5 hours every 2 weeks. After three months, control group participants can join creative writing workshops at their discretion for the remaining period for writing workshops. Both group members will receive follow up surveys twice a month for two months at the completion of the participant's three-month study period.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Mood Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mood scores before (at baseline) and after intervention (after completion of entire sessions - this may vary as some patients may not be able to complete six sessions). A validated Emotional Thermometer Scales will be used to predict changes in parameters pre and post-intervention. The validated Emotional Thermometer Scale (ETS) has five dimensions (distress, anxiety, depression, anger and need help), which are all continuous variables and range from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). Both the individual scores will be analyzed for each dimension as well as an average of the five scores will be collected to represent average mood score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self Reported Somatic Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported somatic symptoms pre and post intervention in two groups. We will use the Somatic Symptom Scale - 8 (SSM-8) to quantify somatic symptom burden. The scale is composed of 8 questions with options to choose a score of 0 (not at all) - 4 (very much) to describe degree of distress caused by individual somatic symptoms. A total of the 8 scores is used as a final value for the SSS-8, with higher scores indicating worse Somatic Symptom severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of depression symptoms before and after intervention between two groups. The validated depression questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), will be used to predict changes. This questionnaire includes 9 questions, that describes individual symptoms of depression and asks individuals to asses how much each depression symptoms has bothered them in the last two weeks, from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score is compiled to represent a final depression severity score, with higher scores indicating worse severity, at a maximum value of 27 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of anxiety symptoms before and after intervention between two groups. The validated anxiety questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 Scale, will be used to predict changes. This includes 7 questions describing symptoms of generalized anxiety, asking individual patients to rate how much those symptoms have bothered the individual in the past two weeks, from a score of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total of the scores will be used to represent anxiety symptoms score, with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 21, with higher score representing increasing severity of anxiety.</description>
