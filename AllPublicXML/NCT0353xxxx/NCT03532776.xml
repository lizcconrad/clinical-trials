      A clinical endpoint bioequivalence (BE) study for a Podofilox Gel 0.5% formulation for the
      treatment of external anogenital warts in comparison to Condylox® Gel 0.5% that follows the
      study design and recommendations according to Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) of U.S. Food and

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, parallel group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial
      with clinical endpoint comparing Podofilox Topical Gel 0.5% to Condylox® Gel 0.5% and a
      matching placebo. The study will be conducted among adult male and female patients with
      external anogenital warts. The Investigator will assess vital signs and perform physical
      examination identifying any clinically significant abnormalities. Laboratory samples will be
      collected, including HIV, Hepatitis B&amp;C, and urine pregnancy tests (UPT) for women of
      childbearing potential. The Investigator will confirm the diagnosis of External Anogenital
      Warts (EAW) and the absence of contraindications specified in the exclusion criterion 4
      during the visual examination. The biopsy of skin lesions will be performed per the
      discretion of the Investigator for microscopic verification of the diagnosis of EAWs if any
      doubts of the diagnosis.
