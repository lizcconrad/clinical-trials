    <textblock>
      External Ventricular Deviation (EDV) is a medical device that provides transient and
      controlled external drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This device can also monitor
      intracranial pressure (ICP). SEV is an emergency measure indicated for acute hydrocephalus
      and / or intracranial hypertension (HTIC). Weaning from a DVE should be considered as soon as
      possible from the moment the patient's clinical condition allows it. There is no consensus on
      how to wean SEVs.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate inter and intraobserver reproducibility of
      the measurement of the 3rd ventricle size by ultrasound in patients receiving a DVE
      withdrawal test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound assessment of the ventricular system, including the size of the 3rd ventricle, can
      be used in severe traumatic brain injury. Ultrasound measurement of the size of the 3rd
      ventricle is used as a marker to monitor cerebral atrophy in neurodegenerative diseases such
      as multiple sclerosis (MS). There is good correlation between brain ultrasound and MRI and CT
      brain imaging to assess the size of the 3rd ventricle. Ultrasound measurement of the size of
      the 3rd ventricle has never been evaluated in weaning external ventricular leads.

      Measuring the size of the 3rd ventricle by ultrasound could be an interesting monitoring
      technique during a SEV withdrawal trial to predict success or failure.

      Weaning is usually based on a clamp test with more or less paraclinical clinical monitoring.
      The recurrence of hydrocephalus and / or HTIC defines a withdrawal failure of the drainage
      device.

      The size of the 3rd ventricle evaluated by cerebral CT in a clamp test is found as a
      predictor of weaning failure of a DVE.

    <description>The surveillance of the clamping test is essentially clinical. No cerebral imaging is performed systematically in our service protocol.The study consisted of including ultrasound measurements during the usual weaning protocol of the service.All patients receiving a SEV withdrawal test will be included. Inclusion begins when the clinician in charge of the patient initiates the withdrawal test. The measurements will be performed blindly by a trained physician who does not participate in the patient's care. Four measurements will be made, with recording of ultrasound loops</description>
