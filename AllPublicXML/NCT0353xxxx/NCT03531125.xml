  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease. The 1-year and 5-year survival rate is approximately
      20% and &lt;5% respectively.

      The treatment options available are limited. Only around 10-20% of patients present early
      enough to undergo surgical resection. Furthermore, chemotherapy for more advanced pancreatic
      cancer leads to limited survival benefit and can cause significant side effects. One of the
      main obstacles to developing new treatments for pancreatic cancer is the limited
      understanding of how pancreatic cancer cells change/evolve/adapt following treatment.

      This study is a pilot study to assess whether the investigators can track gene expression
      (using a technique called RNA sequencing) in pancreatic cancer cells between two separate
      time points. Investigators intend to take a tissue sample (biopsy) of the cancer using
      endoscopy ultrasound (EUS) and compare it with samples taken at the time of surgery in those
      patients with resectable disease. The interval between endoscopy and surgery will be
      approximately 2 to 3 weeks and reflects the standard period of time that patients wait from
      the time point at which the cancer is deemed to be operable (in the multi-disciplinary team
      meeting) to the actual operation.

      If the investigators find that the samples (biopsies) taken at EUS and surgery are comparable
      they plan to develop future clinical trials of similar design but with the addition of drug
      therapy. The investigators will use RNA sequencing to interrogate the effects of novel cancer
      drugs on gene expression within the tumour. This will give them information on how to select
      patients for therapy, how resistance develops to these treatments, and allow the
      investigators to better understand what treatments can be combined on a rational basis.
      However, prior to undertaking such studies it is important to understand how much variability
      there is in gene expression between sampling at 2 different time points at which two
      different techniques are used.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 18 years or above

          2. Patients with radiologically diagnosed pancreatic cancer within the head of the
             pancreas such that the EUS biopsy sites and needle track can be resected surgically

          3. Planned resection of pancreatic cancer

          4. Adequate blood clotting parameters in order to undergo an EUS with biopsies, evidenced
             by the following:

               -  Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109L

               -  International normalised ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5

          5. Patients have given written informed consent and are willing and able to comply with
             the scheduled visits, laboratory tests and study procedures including endoscopy (e.g.
             patients able to lie flat without being breathless and have no evidence of oesophageal
             stricture)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic tumour that is not
             adenocarcinoma

          2. Other psychological, social or medical condition, physical examination finding(s) or a
             laboratory abnormality that the investigator(s) considers would make the patient a
             poor study candidate or could interfere with protocol compliance or the interpretation
             of study results. (Patients with a history of diabetes controlled by insulin or who
             are taking blood thinning medication considered suitable subjects for EUS/biopsy and
             surgery will be eligible)

          3. Positive screening pregnancy test (women of child bearing potential only)
