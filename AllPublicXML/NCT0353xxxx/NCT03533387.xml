      Part 1:

      To compare the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles of two different formulations
      MN-166 50mg, extended release (ER) tablets with MN-166 10mg capsules in a single-dose regimen
      in healthy volunteers; and To choose one of the two MN-166 50mg ER tablet formulations for
      evaluation in Part 2.

      Secondary: To determine the safety and tolerability of the two formulations of MN-166 ER
      tablets in a single-dose regimen in healthy volunteers.

      Part 2:

      To compare the bioavailability and steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of MN-166 50mg ER
      tablet with MN-166 10mg capsules in a multiple-dose regimen in healthy volunteers; and

      Secondary: To determine the safety and tolerability of MN-166 ER tablets in a multiple-dose
      regimen in healthy volunteers
