  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized pilot study to be conducted at Massachusetts General
      Hospital. The purpose of this study is to examine the non-pharmacological impact of Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) on gastroparesis symptoms and other clinical co-comorbidities such
      as pain, depression, anxiety, and catastrophizing. A subset of the CBT trial patients will
      undergo careful phenotyping pre- and post- intervention with brain MRI, autonomic function
      test (AFT), gastric emptying scintigraphy (GES), wireless motility capsule test (WMC), and
      nutrient drink test (NDT) to determine the impact of CBT on these metrics in patients with
      gastroparesis. Patients randomly assigned to a standard medical treatment (SMT) group will be
      treated by the standard of care. Characterization of these relationships or lack thereof can
      help guide future development of more targeted approaches and optimize treatment strategies
      for gastroparesis.

    <description>Patients in the cognitive behavioral therapy group will be asked to undergo a 8-week CBT trial. An online videoconferencing link will be used to deliver CBT virtual sessions that will be approximately 60 minutes in length. Each session will be conducted by a clinical psychology doctoral student, supervised by a licensed psychologist. Patients will also undergo careful phenotyping pre- and post intervention with brain MRI, AFT, WMC, and NDT.</description>

    <description>Treatment sessions will use active, structured techniques to alter distorted thoughts, with a focus on acquiring and practicing cognitive and emotional modulatory skills. In particular, cognitive restructuring is used to help patients recognize the relationships between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Patients learn to identify, evaluate, and challenge negative thoughts. Patients will also learn behavioral strategies to decrease avoidance behavior and increase toleration of physical sensations.</description>
