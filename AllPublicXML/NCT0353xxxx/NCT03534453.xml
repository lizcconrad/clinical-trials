  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, multi-centre interventional study to assess
      the clinical efficacy and safety of olaparib maintenance monotherapy and will be conducted in
      patients with platinum sensitive relapsed (PSR) high grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete response or partial
      response) to platinum-based chemotherapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be those with high grade (serous or endometrioid) epithelial ovarian
      cancer, primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer.

      Patients must have completed 2 previous lines of platinum-based therapy (e.g., containing
      carboplatin or cisplatin) and platinum sensitive relapsed before entry to the study. Eligible
      patients must be in complete or partial response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria following
      the platinum-based chemotherapy prior to enrolment in the study.

      BRCA (Breast Cancer Susceptibility genes) and HRR (Homologous Recombination Repair) mutation
      status should be determined through blood and/or tumour testing when patients are enrolled in
      this study.

      Patients will be assigned olaparib tablets p.o. 300 mg twice daily. They should initiate
      olaparib treatment within 8 weeks after their last dose of platinum-containing chemotherapy
      (last dose is the day of the last infusion).

      Patients must have clinical and objective radiological tumour assessments according to
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria at baseline and every 12
      weeks relative to date of enrolment, until objective radiological disease progression as
      determined by the investigator. Patients could continue to receive olaparib for as long as
      determined by the investigator, until objective radiological disease progression or as long
      as in the investigator's opinion they are benefiting from treatment in relation to other
      clinical assessments and they do not meet any other discontinuation criteria. Once a patient
      has discontinued olaparib she will be managed as per local clinical practice but will remain
      in the study and data will be collected on subsequent treatments, progression, overall
      survival and safety.
