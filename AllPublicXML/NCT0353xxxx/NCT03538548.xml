  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive-behavioral treatments for cocaine abuse could be improved by an increased
      understanding of factors that predict treatment outcomes. The objective of this protocol is
      to conduct a study examining the impact of client characteristics on the effects of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for cocaine abuse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study investigators will recruit treatment-seeking cocaine users (n = 100) from a separate
      protocol (#6912) who will receive a standard 12-week course of cognitive behavioral therapy
      for relapse prevention. Using a variety of self-report questionnaires and computer-based
      tasks, three major domains will be assessed and evaluated as predictors of treatment outcome:
      (1) impulsivity, (2) motivation to change, and (3) learning style. Measures of these factors
      will have been obtained in the #6912 protocol. A better understanding of the impact of
      impulsivity, motivation to change, and learning style on treatment outcome will provide
      critical information to guide the refinement of CBT for cocaine abuse. For example, the
      results of this study may help guide the development and introduction of more targeted
      cognitive remedial strategies or behavioral training components into the framework of
      evidenced-based practices. These additions may help ameliorate the deleterious effects of
      specific participant characteristics on the acquisition and implementation of coping skills,
      which can further improve the efficacy of CBT.

    <description>Participants receive a standard 12-week course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Relapse Prevention (CBT-RP; Carroll, 1998). The treatment protocol will be implemented over 12 weeks, with two 1-hour sessions per week for the first two weeks and one 1-hour session per week thereafter (i.e., a total of 14 sessions).</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>CBT-RP</intervention_name>
    <description>CBT-RP is a time-limited, manual guided intervention that aims to develop behavioral and cognitive skills needed to initiate abstinence and prevent relapse. The treatment will help individuals analyze the decision making process to minimize the influence of more immediate reinforcement, develop cognitive strategies to promote the attainment of longer-term goals, practice behavioral strategies to reduce the influence of socially mediated threats to abstinence, and outline explicit plans for managing situations that threaten their goal of abstinence.</description>
