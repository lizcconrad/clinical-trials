  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is assessing a new drug, duvelisib, in combination with a drug that is
      already FDA approved, venetoclax, as a possible treatment for participants with CLL.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an
      investigational drugs and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      drugs to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are being studied
      together for the first time.

      This phase I study tests the safety of the drug duvelisib when used in combination with the
      drug venetoclax. Since duvelisib is still being studied, the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration) has not approved duvelisib as a treatment for any disease.

      Duvelisib is a drug that is given in capsule form and taken by mouth. This drug is designed
      to stop cancer growth by blocking a protein called phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),
      which is important for the survival of CLL cells. In laboratory studies and in other clinical
      trials that included participants with CLL, duvelisib was effective at killing CLL cells.

      Venetoclax is a tablet that is taken by mouth. Venetoclax targets a protein called BCL-2,
      which helps cancer cells survive. Venetoclax is an effective treatment for many participants
      with CLL who do not respond to chemotherapy or other approved drugs or who have relapsed
      after prior therapy. Venetoclax is FDA approved for participants with CLL who have a genetic
      changes (called a deletion 17p abnormality) and have had their CLL worsen after at least one
      prior therapy for their CLL.

      In the phase I portion of this study, the investigators are looking to determine the dose of
      venetoclax that is safe to give with duvelisib and to see what the side effects are of this
      combination.
