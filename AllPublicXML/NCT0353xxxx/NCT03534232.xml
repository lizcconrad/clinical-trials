  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Diabetes has been associated with many cancers including liver, pancreas, endometrial,
      colorectal, breast and bladder cancer. Excess body fat has also been linked to cancer. One
      reason for this might be resistance to insulin. Researchers want to look for links between
      insulin, diabetes, and certain cancers. They want to study data that has already been
      collected.

      Objectives:

      To study links between insulin, diabetes, and cancers. To study how the links might differ by
      gender, race, and other factors.

      Eligibility:

      People who already participated in 1 of 8 cardiovascular disease studies

      Design:

      Researchers will study data that has already been collected. There will be no active
      participants.

      Participants gave permission to share their data. The data contain no personally identifying
      information. Researchers will look at biomarkers like diet, medicines, and tobacco use. They
      will do statistical analysis of the data

    <textblock>
      There are multiple biological mechanisms that have been proposed for the association between
      obesity and cancer including hormonal disruption (adipokines), inflammation, and growth
      factor stimulation. A common unifying feature of all of these is insulin resistance, which is
      strongly related to overweight and obesity. To extend the insulin and diabetes hypotheses, we
      propose pooling data from eight well phenotyped cardiovascular disease cohorts
      (Atherosclerosis Risk in Community-ARIC, Cardiovascular Health Study-CHS, Framingham study,
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis-MESA, Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young
      Adults-CARDIA, Jackson Heart Study, and Honolulu Heart Program-HHP) to examine associations
      for lung, pancreatic cancers, and possibly other cancers. These cohorts are ethnically
      diverse and have fasting insulin and glucose measured at least 1 time during the study,
      measured anthropometrics (including repeated measures of weight and BMI), lifestyle including
      diet, tobacco, and alcohol use, and health history. Most of the studies have other clinically
      measured biomarkers (e.g. CRP, HBA1c, hematology, and chemistry panel). We estimate that the
      combined cohorts will total approximately 57,000 participants. Although none of the
      individual cohorts have sufficient numbers of lung or pancreatic cancer cases alone, combined
      they will facilitate an adequately powered study. This study uses anonomized data from
      Biolinc.

The other more contemporary cohorts have follow-up between baseline and current times. We will use the followup provided by Biolinc. We will go to individual cohorts via Biolinc for additional follow-up beyond what is in Biolinc.</description>
