  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of physical exercise through active videogame in the
      microcirculation, macrocirculation, cardiorespiratory function and physical fitness in
      overweight adolescents. For that, they will be randomized into two groups, one being a
      control group and the other intervention group. The randomization will be made by school. The
      intervention group will perform the physical exercise through the active video game, three
      times a week, for 50 minutes, during 8 weeks. Reassessments will be performed before and
      after the intervention to evaluate the outcome variables.

    <description>The adolescents will be submitted to physical activity with active video game for 50 minutes, 3 times a week, for a period of eight weeks. The XBOX360® platform will be used with the Kinect accessory (Microsoft®) and Just Dance will be the selected game. The music used for intervention will be previously selected, including those that can lead to moderate intensity, and assembled in blocks of 10. For each week, a new block and challenges must be elaborated to increase the motivation to carry out the physical activity.</description>

    <description>Among the 20 municipal schools, two will be selected between those with 298 or more students (corresponding to the third quartile of the number of students per school). Next will be selected the school in which the adolescents will be submitted to intervention, and the students from the other school will be control. The intervention will aim to promote physical exercise through active video game XBOX 360 with Kinect. The game selected will be Just Dance, to allow the participation of up to four students at the same time. In addition, a gamification protocol will be performed to increase the adolescents engagement in the exercise.</description>
