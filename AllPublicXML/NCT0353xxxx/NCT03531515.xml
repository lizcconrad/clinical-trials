  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reactive or secondary thrombocytosis is defined as abnormally high platelet count (≥4,50,000
      platelets per micro-liter) in the absence of chronic myeloproliferative disease. In
      critically ill patients reactive thrombocytosis is not uncommon during recovery phase and an
      association has been seen with poor outcome and increased risk of subsequent VTE. However,
      not all patients with infection respond with thrombocytosis. No study has enumerated the risk
      factors or predictors of reactive thrombocytosis in critically ill septic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients admitted to intensive care unit of the department of Critical Care Medicine
      during one year period will be screened for possible inclusion in this study. In this
      prospective observational study, demographic and clinical characteristics of all ICU patients
      who fulfill inclusion criteria will be collected along with relevant laboratory tests done
      for patient management routinely. ICU prognostication scores, i.e., Acute Physiologic and
      Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)
      score will also be recorded. ICU survivors will be followed up in their routine ICU follow up
      clinic visits.

      Sample size was estimated at 10% incidence rate of reactive thrombocytes, two sided 95%
      confidence interval and 4.5% margin of error of the incidence rate, sample size came out to
      be 171. Finally in this study investigators have targeted to include at least 180
      participants. Sample size was estimated using software power analysis and sample size, 2008
      (PASS-8).
