  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess whether behavioral science-based interventions can &quot;nudge&quot;
      providers towards more evidence-based care for patients with acute non-cancer pain.

      Aim 1) Among opioid naïve primary care patients with acute non-cancer pain, compare the
      effect of the provider-targeted behavioral interventions (opioid justification and provider
      comparison), individually and in combination, on initial opioid prescription, initial use of
      non-opioid management, and patient-reported pain and function.

      Aim 2) Compare the effect of the 2 provider-targeted behavioral interventions, individually
      and in combination, on unsafe opioid prescribing and transition to chronic opioid therapy.

      Aim 3) Assess provider satisfaction and experience with the provider-targeted behavioral
      interventions.

      Hypotheses:

      Aim 1, H1a: Compared with the guideline (usual care) alone, the addition of the opioid
      justification and provider comparison behavioral interventions will be associated with a
      decreased proportion of opioid prescription and increased proportion of non-opioid management
      at the initial outpatient visit for acute non-cancer pain.

      Aim 1, H1b: Compared with usual care (guideline) alone, the addition of the opioid
      justification and provider comparison behavioral interventions will be associated with no
      difference in patient-reported pain, function, and satisfaction at 1, 6, and 12 months.

      Aim 2, H2: Compared with the usual care (guideline), the addition of opioid justification and
      provider comparison behavioral interventions will be associated with a decreased proportion
      of patients receiving unsafe opioid therapy and a decreased proportion of patients
      transitioning to chronic opioid therapy.

      Study Design: Pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial in 48 primary care clinics.

      Study Population: The patient population will be 10,936 opioid naïve adults who present to
      clinic with acute uncomplicated musculoskeletal pain or headache.

      Primary and Secondary Outcomes: The primary outcome measures will be receipt of an initial
      opioid prescription and unsafe opioid prescribing. Secondary outcomes will be non-opioid pain
      management, and, in 2500 patients, patient-reported pain and function.

      Analytic Plan: The investigators will test for differences in the primary and secondary
      outcomes among the 4 intervention groups.

      Once completed, the project will provide evidence that health systems and other stakeholders
      need to implement interventions to prevent unsafe opioid prescribing.
