  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful treatment of alcohol associated liver disease (AALD) depends primarily on
      abstinence from alcohol. The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial of alcohol
      biosensor monitoring for patients with alcohol associated liver disease to determine if
      monitoring with feedback on alcohol use patterns reduces alcohol consumption and improves
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a 3 month randomized controlled trial (RCT) pilot of alcohol
      biosensor monitoring (ABM)(WrisTAS) for patients with Alcohol Associated Liver Disease (AALD)
      who intend to stop drinking. All participants will wear the ABM device but participants will
      be randomized to receive either personalized feedback on the data recorded on the device
      (n=30) or enhanced usual care without feedback on device data (n=30). The investigators will
      determine whether ABM plus feedback improves outcomes for AALD patients compared to enhanced
      usual care and hypothesize ABM feedback will reduce alcohol consumption, improve motivation
      and self-efficacy for abstinence and improve engagement in treatment. The investigators will
      also conduct research including qualitative data collected from participants who will provide
      opinions on ABM feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Qualitative methods are especially
      useful for understanding the perceived needs, barriers, and preferences for monitoring
      alcohol use and are especially required for future translation of this technology into
      clinical practice.

    <description>The data from the ABM will produce a continuous profile of drinking and changes in drinking. The AMB can create a complete picture of the distribution of drinking days. The temporal pattern, variability, and level of drinking will be determined.</description>

    <description>Stages of Change Readiness &amp; Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES) is a 19-item instrument that measures readiness for change assessing three areas; ambivalence, recognition, and taking steps with change scores assessing the impact of an intervention on these areas. Three subscale scores are produced for;
7 items for recognition of an alcohol problem (scores range from low of 7 to highest of 35)
4 items for ambivalence (range from low of 4 to highest of 20)
8 items for taking steps to make a positive change in drinking (range from low of 8 to highest of 40)</description>

    <measure>self efficacy to remain abstinent</measure>
    <time_frame>Scores determined at initiation, 6 weeks and 3 months of participation</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol Abstinence Self-efficacy (AASE) evaluates confidence in ability to abstain from drinking in situations that represent typical drinking cues. Four subscales with 5 specific situations each are rated on confidence not to drink in each situations on a 5-point Likert scale from 1=not at all confident to 5=extremely confident.
negative affect situations (range from low confidence of 5 to highest confidence of 25)
social/positive situations (range from low confidence of 5 to highest confidence of 25)
physical and other concerns situations (range from low confidence of 5 to highest confidence of 25)
cravings and urges situations (range from low confidence of 5 to highest confidence of 25)</description>

    <description>Qualitative interviews of participants will use a semi-structured script of open-ended stem questions with prompts. The qualitative assessment will cover such topics as patients' perceived need/psychologic barriers (e.g., beliefs in value of ABM in their clinical care and for their relationship with clinicians) and experience with ABM (e.g., wearability, satisfaction, and barriers to monitoring). Transcribed interviews will be thematically coded. The constant comparison method will be used, and subsequent interviews may be modified/informed by findings from previous interviews to explore emerging themes as the analysis proceeds.</description>
