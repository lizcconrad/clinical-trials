  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this balanced-placebo design study is to pilot a larger study to further
      explore the current evidence that stimulant medications are not cognitive enhancers, despite
      this rampant belief in young adults. While the lack of cognitive enhancement from stimulant
      medication has been documented in prior research, this study is the first to utilize
      neuroimaging technology to examine brain regions activated during neurocognitive tasks when
      participants believe they have been administered stimulant medication or placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 X 2 within subjects, balanced placebo design and all participants will experience
      each of the four conditions during four sequential weeks. Medication administered (Adderall
      vs. placebo) is crossed with instructional set (truth vs. deception) and participants'
      performance on neurocognitive tasks is compared across these groups. For example,
      participants are either given stimulant medication or placebo, and are either accurately told
      or inaccurately told that they received stimulant medication or placebo. Neuroimaging is
      being utilized to investigate whether participants' expectations regarding the benefits of
      stimulant medication affects their performance on neurocognitive tasks. The hypothesis of the
      study is that participants' expectations regarding stimulant medication will affect their
      performance on neurocognitive tasks, rather than the actual effect of the medication.

    <masking_description>This will be a double-blind study. Research assistants will administer capsules, and based on package labeling, tell the participant if they are being administered Adderall or placebo. However, researchers and participants will be blind to which medication is actually being administered.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Paced serial addition paradigm</measure>
    <time_frame>12 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be presented with a string of single digits (0-9), one every three seconds, for approximately 12 minutes. The digits will be presented in auditory form via headphones. Participants will be asked to add the two most recently presented digits in their mind, and will respond with a button press each time the two digits add up to 10. The task does not require participants to maintain a running total of all digits, meaning that participants can resume the task at any point in case of set loss. We will measure the accuracy of participants' responses.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained attention task</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A row of 5 left- or right-pointing arrows will be presented on each trial. The participant will be required to indicate the direction of the central arrow (left or right) by pressing one of two buttons. The target arrow in the center of the row will be flanked by two non-target stimuli on either side, which point either in the same direction as the target, the opposite direction, or will be circles. The row of arrows will be presented in rapid succession and the participant is to indicate their response as quickly as possible on each trial by pressing the button.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual version of a paired associates learning task</measure>
    <time_frame>7 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be presented with 50 word pairs on screen, and will be asked to memorize both words in each pair. The pairs will be presented individually, at a rate of one word pair per three seconds. The 50 word pairs will be presented three times in the same order, for a total of 7 minutes and 30 seconds. Words in each pair will be everyday objects of neutral emotional valence, and will be limited to 8th grade reading level (e.g. rose - bag; elephant - glass). fMRI scans will be acquired during the learning phase of this task, although no response is required from participants during this time. Immediately following completion of the learning phase, participants will be presented with the first word from each pair on screen, and will be asked to name the second word in the pair. No brain scans will be acquired during the recall phase, but the accuracy of participants' responses will be recorded by a member of the research team.</description>
