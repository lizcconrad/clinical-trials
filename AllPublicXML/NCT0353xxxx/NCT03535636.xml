  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine sleep structure in refugees with PTSD. Polysomnography
      (PSG) will be carried out to study the occurrence of sleep disorders in patients and healthy
      controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is little knowledge on treatment of sleep disturbances in trauma-affected refugees and
      this study will be the first to record the biophysiological changes that occur during sleep
      in refugees with PTSD. The study is a proof-of-concept study and this will contribute with
      new and potentially crucial knowledge of sleep disturbances in these patients.

      The project is designed as a cross-sectional study with 20 refugees with PTSD referred to the
      specialised outpatient clinic, Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry (CTP), and 20
      healthy control subjects.

      All patients referred to CTP will be invited to an initial consultation with a doctor. During
      this consultation a diagnostic assessment will be performed and the clinical history will be
      obtained. Patients who give informed consent will be invited to participate in the project
      and have sleep measurements performed by PSG. Furthermore self-administered questionnaires
      and semi-structured interviews will be used to collect information on mental health, sleep
      quality, sleep length and nightmares.

      Each patient will be equipped with PSG equipment to do measurements at home for one night (12
      hours). Healthy control subjects will fill out the same CTP standard ratings and have the
      same diagnostic assessment and PSG measurement.

      The hypothesis is that the sleep structure and sleep architecture in refugees with PTSD
      differ from healthy controls. It is suggested that refugees with PTSD have increased dream
      activity as well as increased incidence of sleep disorders such as rapid eye movement (REM)
      sleep without atonia (RSWA), REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), sleep apnea and periodic
      limb movement disorder (PLM).

      The study is performed in collaboration with Danish Centre for Sleep Medicine in Denmark.

    <description>Assessing PTSD symptoms, including their frequency and severity. The gold standard in PTSD assessment. The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview and requires the identification of a single index trauma to serve as the basis of symptom inquiry. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms. Similarly, CAPS-5 symptom cluster severity scores are calculated by summing the individual item severity scores for symptoms corresponding to a given DSM-5 cluster: Criterion B (items 1-5); Criterion C (items 6-7); Criterion D (items 8-14); and, Criterion E (items 15-20). A symptom cluster score may also be calculated for dissociation by summing items 19 and 20. A patient needs to have: at least one Criterion B and C symptom and at least two Criterion D and E symptoms. Criterion F is met (disturbance has lasted one month) and Criterion G is met (disturbance causes either clinically significant distress or functional impairment).</description>
