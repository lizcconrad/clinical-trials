  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) for a 10-week
      mobile phone intervention using principles of Cognitive Behavior Therapy to target general
      and minority stressors and treat anxiety and depression in young men romantically/sexually
      attracted to men.

      Investigators will conduct a double-arm RCT to develop the infrastructure and collection of
      data needed to power a larger RCT (e.g., rates of consent, retention rates). Clinical
      outcomes will be assessed for the purpose of detecting unexpected deterioration.
      Investigators will also collect usability feedback regarding the intervention which may be
      used to refine the treatment. Usage data will be used to identify under-used lessons and
      tools and improve their usefulness/appeal. Compliance with assessments will be monitored and
      used to improve retention protocols.

    <description>RCT participants will be randomized into a 10-week intervention condition during which they will receive the CBT modules through the TODAY! app. In addition to the mobile app, participants will receive coaching from the study Coach who is trained in Motivational Interviewing principles. Participants will complete mood and behavior assessments at 4 time-points over the course of 22 weeks.</description>

    <description>RCT participants will be randomized into a 10-week wait-list control condition and will be provided with and encouraged to use mental health and lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer (LGBQ) referrals and resources in the community. Participants will complete mood and behavior assessments at 4 time-points over the course of 22 weeks. After the 22-week post intervention follow-up, control group participants will have the option to receive the intervention, however they will not be administered follow-up assessments or given coaching.</description>

    <intervention_name>TODAY! App and Coaching</intervention_name>
    <description>The TODAY! app uses the skill building structure of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). The intervention will be divided into &quot;modules,&quot; each devoted to a particular skill. Skills addressed within the intervention include increasing social support, engaging in goal-driven behaviors and reducing mood-driven (i.e., avoidance) behaviors, seeking out positive activities, replacing cognitive distortions with more adaptive thinking styles, improving problem-solving skills, reducing avoidance patterns, and increasing alternate coping strategies. The intervention will be supplemented with brief human contact in the form of a motivational coach. The Coach will be trained on the Motivational Interviewing principles upon which the coaching protocol is based.</description>
