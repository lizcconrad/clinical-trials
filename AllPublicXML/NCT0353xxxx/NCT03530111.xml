  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A method has been developed to measure in vivo adipose kinetics and turnover rates, which is
      a substantive departure from previous indirect and in vitro approaches. This technique
      involves drinking deuterium (2H)-labeled water, with an initial ramp-up to increase body
      water 2H enrichment, followed by daily intake to maintain enrichment values. The 2H from the
      heavy water is incorporated into the DNA of the dividing cells, as well as the lipid
      component, providing measures of cell formation, lipid synthesis, and adipose turnover. The
      objective of the proposed study is to enroll women who are overweight (sedentary or
      physically active) in order to collect 2H-enriched adipose tissue specimens that will be
      utilized to establish this innovative 2H-labeling protocol at Pennington Biomedical Research
      Center. This study will also assess adipose kinetics in individuals with different levels of
      physical activity to better understand the association between in vivo adipose cell kinetics,
      physical activity, and metabolic health in humans.

    <description>Following the consumption of deuterium-labeled water (2H2O; heavy water), adipose tissue biopsies from the subcutaneous abdominal and femoral depots will be collected. The 2H from the heavy water is enriched into the DNA of newly synthesized cells. Measures of DNA synthesis (obtained via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis of 2H-enrichment) denote new adipose cell formation. The primary outcome is to assess adipose cell kinetic rates (i.e. synthesis) in sedentary and very physically active women.</description>

    <description>Following the consumption of deuterium-labeled water (2H2O; heavy water), adipose tissue biopsies from the subcutaneous abdominal and femoral depots will be collected. The 2H from the heavy water is incorporated into the glycerol component of the adipose, providing a measure of new triglyceride synthesis. The secondary outcome is to assess adipose lipid (triglyceride) kinetic rates (i.e. synthesis) in sedentary and very physically active women.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-menopausal women

          -  18-40 years of age

          -  BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2 (+/- 0.5 will be accepted)

          -  Are willing to drink deuterium-labeled water (2H2O) for 6 weeks

          -  Must be willing to comply with all study procedures, including adipose biopsies and a
             DXA scan

          -  If applicable, hormonal contraception must have been started at least 2 months before
             entering the study. If enrolled, subject must also agree to not alter hormonal birth
             control method, dose, or regimen throughout the duration of the study

          -  If not using pharmaceutical (hormonal) contraception (i.e. birth control pills,

             of birth control to prevent pregnancy
