  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliary drainage is the mainstay of the palliative treatment in patients with inoperable
      malignant bile duct stricture. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the
      cornerstone of biliary drainage method in these patients. However, ERCP is sometime
      unsuccessful to perform because of the presence of the high grade biliary stricture, tumor
      invasion of duodenum and ampulla of vater and surgically altered gastrointestinal anatomy.
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biliary drainage has been emerged as an alternative
      procedure to traditional surgical bypass and percutaneous trans hepatic biliary drainage
      after failed ERCP. There were few data to directly compare between ERCP and EUS guided
      biliary drainage and in patients with malignant high grade biliary stricture.

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of this study is comparing the efficacy and complications between ERCP and EUS guided
      biliary drainage in patients with malignant high grade biliary stricture. Malignant high
      grade biliary stricture has not been well defined. The investigators define this malignant
      high grade biliary stricture using these arbitrary number include total bilirubin ≥ 15 mg/dl
      and or bile duct diameter ≥12 mm. based on the investigation's experience.

      The study will be divided patients with inoperable malignant high grade biliary stricture
      into 2 groups, group (A) will be undergone ERCP with biliary stenting and group (B) will be
      undergone EUS guided biliary drainage. If the assigned intervention is not successful, then
      patients will be crossed-over to the another intervention.

    <description>ERCP with biliary stent is performed using a side view duodenoscope of Olympus (TJF-160). Biliary cannulation is performed using a sphincterotome and 0.035 inch jag wire, and cholangiogarm is done to assess common bile duct diameter, and length of biliary stricture. Biliary sphincterotomy is then performed. A straight biliary stent is placed across stricture bile duct.</description>

    <description>EUS guided biliary drainage is performed using a linear echoendoscope of Olympus (GFUCT240). Extrahepatic bile duct was identified from duodenal bulb, then 19 G needle is inserted into bile duct with confirmed with cholangiogram. The fistula tract is dilated using a 6 Fr cystotome (Wilson Cook Medical). A double pigtail stent is placed across biliary-enteric fistula.</description>
