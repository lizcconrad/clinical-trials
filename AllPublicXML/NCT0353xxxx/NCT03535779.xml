      This study is an exploratory single site sample collection study at St Mary's hospital
      campus, Imperial College London. Sixteen participants scheduled to receive routine
      immunizations for Td/IPV (group 1) and HBsAg (group 2) will be recruited overall. Eights
      participants will be allocated to group 1 and eights participants to group 2 depending on
      their immunisation regime.

      The aim of the study is to characterise the maturation of human B cell response to
      immunization with vaccines (HBsAg and Td/IPV) known to induce long-term memory responses.

      The primary objective is to characterize the number and phenotype of memory B cells induced
      by routine vaccination. These responses will be used as a comparison to those currently
      induced in HIV-1 vaccination trials.

      The development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine is highly dependent on our understanding of the
      immune response to HIV-1 infection/vaccination. It is generally accepted that the generation
      of long-lived neutralising memory B cell antibody responses will be critical for an effective
      vaccine against HIV-1. Successful vaccines are capable of inducing long-lived B cell memory
      that can maintain antibodies for decades, typical examples being those induced by Hepatitis B
      (HBsAg) and tetanus vaccination which generates antibodies with a half-life of greater than 5
      years. In contrast, current HIV-1 vaccination typically induces a short-lived B cell response
      with antibodies waning within a half-life of 6 months. Recent observations have shown that
      vaccination does not produce a homogenous population of memory B cell but rather a
      constellation of subsets depending on the type of vaccination.

      We are only beginning to understand the varying and important roles of some of these elusive
      subsets. Therefore understanding potential differential responses of these memory B cell
      subsets to successful licensed vaccines may prove critical in the creation of novel,
      effective vaccines to HIV-1.

      The field has been energised in recent years by the identification of different memory B cell
      subsets. Four of these subsets can be characterised through differential expression of
      surface markers CD27, IgD and IgM, typically: CD27+IgD+IgM+ B cells, CD27+IgD-IgM+ B cells,
      CD27+IgD+IgM- B cells and CD27+IgD-IgM- IgG+/IgA+/IgE+ B cells (Mroczek ES et al, Front
      Immunol. 2014;5:96). Understanding how HBsAg and tetanus (as part of the Td/IPV vaccine)
      modulates antigen specific responses across these four memory B cell subsets will help define
      how we understand the establishment of long-term immunological memory and may help us
      understand how we can induce such memory responses with new HIV vaccine candidates. Data from
      these studies will be used to compare responses elicited by HIV vaccines in current phase I
      studies and determine potential defects in the maturation of vaccine induced memory.

      We therefore wish to obtain blood draws from individuals undergoing routine HBsAg and Td/IPV
      vaccination. This will allow us to isolate memory B cells circulating in the peripheral blood
      and characterise the different memory B cell subsets induced by effective licensed vaccines
      and compare responses to those induced by current HIV-1 vaccination trials, for which we
      already have samples banked.
