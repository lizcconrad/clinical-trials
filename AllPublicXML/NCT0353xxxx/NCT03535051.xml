  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our clinical trial was to find out whether fractional CO₂ laser sessions in
      combination with application of daily topical tacrolimus 0.03% would enhance the action of
      the drug and pose as a possible combination treatment option for stable vitiligo lesions. We
      applied this combination treatment on one side of the body and compared the response to the
      response of the lesions on the other side of the body to daily topical tacrolimus 0.03%
      alone, which we used as control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient included in the study received treatment A on the lesions on one side of his/her
      body, and treatment B on the other side.

      Treatment A included 4 monthly sessions of fractional CO₂ laser on the lesions plus
      application of topical tacrolimus 0.03% (Tarolimus) on the lesions 6 hours after each session
      and twice daily in between the sessions and for 1 month after the last session.

      Treatment B included only the application of topical tacrolimus 0.03% (Tarolimus) on the
      lesions twice daily for 4 months.

      Fractional laser The device used was DEKA, SmartXide DOT (Dermal Optical Thermolysis), Italy
      fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser (fig. 8). This device is an ablative fractional 10,6000 nm
      CO² Laser with variable pulse duration (0.2-2 ms), 350-μm beam spot size, scanner area of
      15x15 mm and penetration depth between 200 to 1,500 μm.

      Tacrolimus ointment 0.03% (Tarolimus) Applied on the lesions treated by fractional CO² laser
      6 hours after each laser session, then twice daily in between the sessions and 1 month after
      the last session.

      Applied on the lesions on the other half of the body (not treated with fractional CO² laser)
      twice daily for 4 months.

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 152 lesions in different areas of the body were evaluated in the study. Seventy six lesions received the combination treatment and 76 received topical tacrolimus alone. Forty six lesions were in the head and neck region, 40 were acral in location, 36 were in the upper and lower limbs, 22 lesions were over bony prominences and 8 lesions were present on the trunk.</intervention_model_description>
