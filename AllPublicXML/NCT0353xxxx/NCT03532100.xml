    <textblock>
      When prescribing a prosthetic foot, clinicians face a dizzying array of choices as more than
      200 different prosthetic feet are available. While these conventional prosthetic feet
      primarily function in the sagittal plane, the intact foot and ankle comprise a complex set of
      joints that allow rotation in multiple planes of motion. Some of these motions are coupled,
      meaning rotation in one plane induces motion in another. One such coupling is between the
      sagittal and transverse planes. For every step, plantar- and dorsi-flexion motion in the
      sagittal plane is coupled with external and internal rotation of the shank relative to the
      foot in the transverse plane. There is no prosthetic foot available for prescription that
      mimics this natural coupling.

      To investigate the need for this coupling, the investigators have built a torsionally
      adaptive prosthesis where the coupling ratio between the transverse- and sagittal-planes can
      be independently controlled with a motor.

      This research has one specific aim: to identify the optimal coupling ratio between
      transverse- and sagittal-plane motions using a novel, torsionally adaptive prosthesis for
      individuals with lower limb amputation. The investigators will conduct a human subject
      experiment wearing the motor-driven and computer controlled torsionally adaptive prosthesis.
      Individuals with lower limb amputation will be asked to walk in a straight line and in both
      directions around a circle while the coupling ratio between transverse- and sagittal-plane
      motions is varied between trials. Participants will be blinded to the coupling ratio.

      The investigators hypothesize that: (1) a coupling ratio exists that minimizes undesirable
      transverse-plane socket torque and (2) there will be a coupling ratio that individuals with
      lower limb amputation prefer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human ankle is a complex mechanism that does not behave like a simple hinge. Instead,
      rotations in all three axes are allowed and some are coupled together. In particular, the
      axis of rotation of the talo-crural joint during ankle flexion is inclined downwards and
      laterally relative to horizontal, and the rotation ranges from 10 to 26 degrees among
      individuals. This rotation couples plantar- and dorsi-flexion motion with external and
      internal rotation of the shank relative to the foot, respectively. This feature of the
      natural limb has not been replicated in prosthetic feet and ankles.

      Lower limb amputees take thousands of steps on their prosthesis each day and none feature
      coupled motion between the transverse- and sagittal-planes. The absence of this natural
      coupling may be related to the high incidence of residual limb soft tissue injuries, the need
      for compensatory gait, and overall dissatisfaction with their prostheses.

      Transverse rotation adapters, consisting of simple torsional springs, are available for
      prescription. These devices can increase transverse-plane rotations and decrease
      transverse-plane torques, but their use is not widespread and if excessively compliant, may
      reduce gait stability. Cost, weight, prosthesis build height, and the inability for the user
      to adjust the stiffness may all play a role in their lack of adoption, but it may also be
      that the transverse-plane rotation is not coupled with the sagittal-plane. With these
      devices, motion only occurs in the transverse-plane when a transverse-plane torque is
      applied.

      This research has one specific aim: to identify the optimal coupling ratio between
      transverse- and sagittal-plane motions using a novel, torsionally adaptive prosthesis for
      individuals with lower limb amputation. The investigators will fit a sample population of
      unilateral transtibial amputees with the motor-driven and computer controlled torsionally
      adaptive prosthesis.

      Participants will walk in a straight line and in both directions around a circle with the
      torsionally adaptive prosthesis set at different coupling ratios (blinded and random order).

      The general hypotheses for this study are: (H1) a coupling ratio exists between 0 (no
      coupling) to 1:2 (one degree of transverse-plane motion for every two degrees of
      sagittal-plane motion) that minimizes transverse-plane socket torque and (H2) an amputee
      preferred coupling ratio will exist within this range.

      This research will discover how best to couple transverse- and sagittal-plane motion in the
      prostheses of lower limb amputees.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will use a within-subject factorial design (3x5) to identify the optimal coupling ratio between transverse- and sagittal-plane motions using a torsionally adaptive prosthesis. Participants will all walk in a straight line, in a circle with their prosthesis on the inside, and in a circle with their prosthesis on the outside (i.e., 3 activity levels). The torsionally adaptive prosthesis can be set to 5 different coupling ratios (transverse:sagittal) including 0:0, 1:6, 1:4, 1:3, and 1:2. Each participant will walk with the torsionally adaptive prosthesis set to the 5 different coupling ratios (random order). Participants will not be blinded to the activity but will be blinded to the coupling ratio.</intervention_model_description>
