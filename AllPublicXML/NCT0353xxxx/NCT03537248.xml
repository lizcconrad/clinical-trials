      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveess of ASP-57
      Multi-Purpose contact lens solution (Test) compared to ReNu® Multiplus Contact Lens Solution
      (Control) when used by habitual contact lens wearers to bilaterally clean and disinfect their
      contact lenses for approximately 3 months (12 weeks).

    <textblock>
      Approximately 330 subjects (660 eyes) will be enrolled in this 3 month (12 week) controlled,
      parallel group, masked, randomized study at approximately 15 investigative sites in the
      United States. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive either Asepticys ASP-57
      Multi-Purpose Solution or ReNu® Multiplus Contact Lens Solution (Control) respectively. Both
      Test and Control solution will be used with a rub care regimen.

             related procedures.

          3. Successful history of wear of the one of the following lens types (toric and
             multifocal lenses of the specified lens type are allowed) in both eyes during the past
             3 months, and history of at least 5 consecutive days of successful daily wear in both
             eyes prior to Visit 1:

               -  All Bausch &amp; Lomb PureVision lens types

               -  All Alcon Air Optix lens types

               -  All CooperVision Biofinity lens types

               -  All Vistakon Acuvue Oasys lens types

               -  Any conventional hydrogel Group IV lens

          4. Vision correctable through spherocylindrical refraction to 32 letters (0.3 logMAR) or
             better (distance, high contrast) in each eye.

          5. Clear central corneas and free of any anterior segment disorders

          6. Habitual use of a Multi-Purpose Solution for cleaning, disinfecting, and storage of
             lenses.

          7. Lens correction in both eyes is required and the same brand of lens is worn in each
             eye.

          8. Agree to wear study lenses in both eyes on a daily wear basis, with lenses removed
             every night (not slept in) throughout the study period and no lens or pair of lenses
             worn for longer than 2 weeks.

          9. Able and willing to comply with all care regimen and follow-up study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females of childbearing potential (not surgically sterilized or postmenopausal) if any
             one of the following conditions are met:

             period. Ongoing use of non-preserved artificial tears up to 4 times daily (with no
             changes in frequency or brand) is allowed. Ongoing use of the rewetting drop the
             subject customarily uses (with no switch in brand or type) is also permitted during
             the study period.

          5. Current systemic disease affecting ocular health or use of topical or systemic
             medications that, in the Investigator's opinion, could affect ocular physiology or
             lens performance.

          6. Ocular astigmatism of 2.00 D or greater in either eye based on the contact lens
             prescription.

          7. Grade 2 or greater finding on any slit-lamp scale and/or corneal infiltrates of any
             grade during slit-lamp examination at Screening.

          8. Any finding during slit-lamp examination that, in the Investigator's opinion,
             interferes with contact lens wear.

          9. Scar or neovascularization within the central 4 millimeters (mm) of the cornea. Minor
             peripheral corneal scarring (that does not extend into the central zone) is permitted,
             if in the Investigator's judgment, it does not interfere with contact lens wear.

         10. Aphakia.

         11. Amblyopia.

         12. History of any corneal surgery.

         13. Allergy to any component of the study solutions.

         14. Participation in any clinical study within the 2 weeks prior to entry into this study.
