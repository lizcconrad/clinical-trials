      Investigating potential of controlling brain metastases in patients with EGFR positive NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with EGFR positive NSCLC with 1-10 brain metastases, we are investigating whether
      we can control the macro brain metastases with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and control
      the micro metastases with targeted agent Osimertinib and avoid whole brain radiation that
      could potentially lead to significant cognitive decline.
