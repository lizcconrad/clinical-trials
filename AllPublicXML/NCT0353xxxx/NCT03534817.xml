    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an outpatient chronic disease management program
      delivering secondary prevention, which is proven to reduce morbidity and mortality. The
      Canadian Cardiovascular Society Access to Care working group recommends patients access CR
      &quot;preferably&quot; within 2-7 days following percutaneous intervention for myocardial infarction
      (MI), but that 30-60 days is &quot;acceptable&quot;. Despite these benchmarks, in practice patients
      access CR up to 90 days post-treatment in Canada. This is disconcerting given the detrimental
      impacts of delayed access to CR. These include ventricular remodeling (i.e., ventricular
      enlargement and reduced pump function), lower CR use, less post-CR exercise, among others.
      Accordingly, EVADE will be the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effects of
      early access CR (1-week post-discharge to first CR visit) compared to standard access CR
      (7-weeks post-discharge to first CR visit) in ameliorating these concerns.

      AIMS &amp; HYPOTHESIS: The primary aim is to compare ventricular remodeling as defined by the
      change in end-systolic volume at 1-year in participants randomized to early versus standard
      access CR. The secondary aims are: (1) to compare post-CR exercise adherence by
      accelerometry, exercise capacity by 6-minute walk test distance, and health-related quality
      of life (HRQL) at 1-year in participants randomized to early versus standard access CR; (2)
      to compare CR program session attendance in participants randomized to early versus standard
      access CR; and (3) to assess biomarkers of ventricular remodeling in participants randomized
      to early versus standard access CR.

      The final aims are to explore more immediate health benefits associated with early versus
      standard access CR. Accordingly, at 6 months following hospital discharge the investigators
      will measure end-systolic volume, exercise adherence, exercise capacity, biomarkers of
      ventricular remodeling, and HRQL. The investigators will also explore hospitalization for any
      cause of death at 1 year in order to inform future research.

      The overall hypothesis is that early access CR will be associated with less ventricular
      remodeling, increased CR attendance and post-CR exercise adherence, increased exercise
      capacity, and greater HRQL.

      DESIGN: EVADE will be a two-centre, 2 parallel-arm, single-blinded RCT. Participants will be
      recruited through coronary care units following treatment for MI from the Royal University
      Hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton. The
      University of Alberta Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) online database will
      randomize (1:1) participants (allocation concealed). A total of 60 participants will be
      enrolled: 30 participants will each be allocated to early access and standard access CR.

      IMPACT: In the first prospective multicentre trial of its kind, EVADE will test an innovative
      post-MI rehabilitation strategy that has the potential to demonstrate the superior benefits
      of early access CR for attenuating ventricular remodeling, and increasing CR attendance,
      post-CR exercise adherence, exercise capacity, and HRQL. The results from EVADE would
      encourage the Canadian CR community to consider early access CR to further enhance readily
      available and existing CR programs. The knowledge gained from EVADE will inform clinical
      decision-making practices, influence future CR guidelines and policy, and will contribute to
      the ongoing goal of improving efficiency and effectiveness of the Canadian health care
      system.
