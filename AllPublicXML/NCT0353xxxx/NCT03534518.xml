  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful ambulation at home and in the community is the main goal of gait training after
      incomplete spinal cord injury. Many different treatment approaches have been recommended to
      achieve this goal. One established intervention to achieve that in a clinical setting is body
      weight supported (BWS) treadmill training. However, recent studies have suggested that the
      most optimal gait training should be conducted overground with appropriate support conditions
      to enable a physiological gait pattern. The training has to be challenging and patients must
      participate as active as possible.

      In addition becoming a functional walker in real world involves a variety of walking skills
      like walking on uneven surfaces, walking up and down slopes, climbing stairs and avoid
      obstacles. It has been shown in humans as well as in animals that greater improvements are
      achieved in walking function if the training is task specific. Thus a constrained task like
      BWS treadmill training may not be the optimal training intervention to become a functional
      community walker.

      Even greater improvements can be expected if patients feel safe during the overground walking
      and train at their individual limits. With FLOAT there is now the possibility to conduct a
      task specific BWS overground gait training in a safe environment. The robotic device allows
      patients to perform different walking tasks like walking overground, avoiding obstacles,
      walking on uneven and sloped surfaces, climbing stairs, walking in narrow spaces. A virtual
      reality setup was integrated into the system that even can simulate specific walking tasks
      like target oriented walking or walking in crowded environment. Based on the promising
      results seen in preclinical and clinical research, the investigators assume that unrestricted
      transparent BWS overground training that allows task specific training of real world walking
      tasks will induce greater improvements than conventional BWS treadmill training.

      The investigators will compare the effect of an intensive 4 weeks unrestricted BWS overground
      gait training to 4 weeks of intensive BWS treadmill training. Not only functional outcome
      like walking speed or capacity will be assessed but also detailed kinematics that will help
      to identify the mechanisms of the underlying improvements in walking function.

    <description>BWS will be provided with the goal to impose the maximal lower extremity weight bearing load without excessive knee flexion during stance phase and/ or toe dragging during the swing phase. The walking tasks will be roughly divided into different domains like skilled walking, balance, dual tasking, walking speed, walking endurance.</description>

    <description>Training will be conducted on a standard treadmill with an overhead BWS system that can provide active BWS. Participants are allowed to hold the rails but weight bearing is not allowed. BWS will be provided with the goal to impose the maximal lower extremity weight bearing load without excessive knee flexion during stance phase and/ or toe dragging during the swing phase. Main walking tasks will be endurance (walking long distances at preferred speed) and speed (walking at maximal possible speed).</description>
