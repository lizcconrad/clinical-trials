  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a multicentre, quasi-experimental design, controlled, before-and-after trial
      to estimate the effectiveness related to the review of mirabegron use and its deprescribing.

      Intervention group: Patients with mirabegron prescription assigned to any of the 17 primary
      health care centers located in the northern area of Barcelona.

      Control group: All the other patients assigned to any of the other 34 health care centers in
      Barcelona belong to Catalan Institut of Health (CIH).

      The structured intervention included initiatives with general practitioners and
      urology/gynaecology specialists, support from health care authorities, and monthly feed-back
      monitoring to general practitioners.

      The follow-up period was 12 months, from January 1st to December 31st, 2017.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental design with before/after measurement and a control group was used.

      The objective was to identify the effectiveness of a training activity on deprescribing
      treatments. In addition, it was proposed to establish the duration of medication in real
      clinical practice, and its prevalence of use before and after the intervention.

      Control group: Usual care

      Intervention:

        -  Initiatives for healthcare professionals: information and training with written
           material, in an infographic format, distributed to all general practitioners.

        -  Initiatives for specialized hospital care: information regarding the intervention for
           urologists and gynaecologists.

        -  Management support with the definition of a structured strategy for all the addresses of
           the PHC and GPs.

        -  Monthly feedback monitoring to general practitioners.

      The intervention consisted of: a) meetings with all the directors of the PHC; b) informative
      meetings and sessions in the PHC; c) distribution of the infographic to all the GPs; d) lists
      of patients with treatment provided periodically from the medication area; and e) review of
      the treatments by the GPs.

      If considered appropriate, and with the consent of the patient, the medication was withdrawn.

      A pharmacist and a clinical pharmacologist acted as consultants in case of any doubts
      regarding specific patients.
