      To assess the efficacy and feasibility of high-dose intensity-modulated radiotheraoy with
      concurrent weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin for patients with localredionally advanced
      esophageal cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RTOG 8501 has established concurrent radiochemotherapy as the standard of care for cancer
      of the esophagus.However, locoregional remain problematic, with 25% of patients having
      persistence and 20% relapse of locoregional disease following the standard dose (50-50.4 Gy)
      chemoradiotherapy . Our previous phase I radiation dose escalation trial established the
      maximum tolerated dose of 86 Gy with concurrent weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin in advanced
      esophageal cancer.The aim of this phase II study is to examine the efficacy of this regimen.
