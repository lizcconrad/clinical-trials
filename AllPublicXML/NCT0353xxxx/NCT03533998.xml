      The ability of genomic biomarkers to Measuring tumour aggressiveness, and facilitate the
      selection of therapies in patients who had salvage radical prostatectomy after focal therapy
      and predict the risk of biochemical recurrence BCR after focal therapy or RP.

      Between 2007 and 2017, 30 patients underwent salvage radical prostatectomy SRP for recurrent
      localized PCa at our institution (Institute Mutual Montsouris). Primary radiotherapy,
      brachytherapy and whole-gland treatments were excluded, as to evaluate the true spectrum of
      morphologic changes caused by the focal emerging ablative modalities. Thirteen SRP after
      focal ablative therapies FAT (cryotherapy or high intensity focused ultrasound- HIFU or
      vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy- VTP) were identified from our prospective collected
      database. Genitourinary pathologists were provided clinical information related to prior
      therapies and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers were used in the diagnosis of limited primary
      PC on needle biopsy when necessary. Prostatectomy specimens were processed and the number of
      tumor foci, size of the dominant focus and pathological stage were recorded. Residual disease
      was graded according to the Gleason grading system. Treatment-related histologic changes were
      examined.
