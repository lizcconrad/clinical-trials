  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both dizziness and neck pain are common complaints in the Norwegian population. The cervical
      spine has a highly developed proprioceptive system, which is involved in head and gaze
      stabilization as well as postural control. Thus, it has been argued that dizziness and/or
      unsteadiness can occur due to loss of or inadequate stimulation of neck receptors in patients
      with neck pain. Still, the notion of dizziness due to cervical dysfunction is a controversial
      topic. However, clinicians report that patients referred for dizziness often complain of neck
      pain, and vice versa.

      This study is a multi-center study including patients referred to 1) a neuro-otologic clinic
      due to dizziness and 2) a rehabilitation clinic due to neck pain. Both clinics are tertiary
      care university clinics. The study explores the prevalence, severity and spectrum of symptoms
      as well as clinical findings in patients with various combinations of dizziness and neck
      pain. The aim is to see if these patient groups differ from each other in terms of clinical
      characteristics, symptoms and quality of life. Additionally, the aim is to examine if there
      is a relationship between neck dysfunction and dizziness, and last, if the symptoms persist
      longer in patients with both dizziness and neck pain.

      This is a longitudinal study with data collected at baseline and after 6 months follow-up.

      Variables collected at baseline include age, sex, symptom variables including Dizziness
      Handicap Inventory, Vertigo Symptom Scale Short Form, Haukeland Dizziness Questionnaire,
      Visual analog scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, RAND-12, dynamic posturography,
      video-based head impulse test, bithermal caloric tests, Neck Disability Index, as well as
      neck examinations including pressure algometry and measurements of the range of neck
      movements.

      Follow-up data after 6 months include the same patient-reported outcomes as at baseline.

        1. Patients referred to the ENT department of Haukeland University Hospital due to
             vertigo with suspected vestibular origin will be divided into two groups depending on
             whether or not they report concurrent neck pain.

          2. Patients referred to the Nordås clinic due to chronic neck pain will be divided into
             two groups depending on whether or not the report concurrent dizziness.

        The healthy controls will be recruited among employees at Haukeland University Hospital.
