  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decision whether to operate an ankle fracture or not is often highly dependent on the
      surgeon's individual judgment. There is consensus that non-displaced Weber A-type fractures
      rarely require operative treatment, and that Weber C-type or grossly displaced fractures are
      unstable and therefore require surgery. The decision for appropriate treatment is less clear
      for minimally displaced Weber B-type ankle fractures, and especially Weber B1 fractures are
      treated either surgically or conservatively at our clinic.

      Conservative management of ankle fractures generally comprises immobilisation in a below-knee
      VacoPed or cast for six weeks to stabilise the fracture and allow osseous and soft tissue
      healing. Surgical treatment involves the reduction (if displaced) of the fractured fragments
      and fixation using various devices such as metal plates, screws, or intramedullary rods.
      While patients show changes in plantar pressure distribution during gait 18 months after
      surgical treatment of ankle fractures, to date the functional outcome regarding ankle joint
      mechanics during daily activities are unknown. Understanding gait function is important
      because compromised function may not only limit a persons daily activities but also may lead
      to secondary conditions such as osteoarthritis at the ankle or at adjacent joints.

      The primary objective is:

      • To compare differences in hindfoot and forefoot kinematics between level and uphill
      treadmill walking in relation to passive range of motion

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To compare ankle biomechanics during overground walking and level and uphill treadmill
           walking between patients with Weber B1 fracture treated either surgically or
           conservatively and healthy control persons.

        -  To determine the relationship between passive ankle range of motion, lower leg muscle
           strength and dynamic ankle range of motion.

        -  To determine the relationship between lower leg muscle strength and balance.

        -  To determine the relationship between dynamic range of motion and the Foot and Ankle
           Outcome Score.

      At the initial assessment, written informed consent will be obtained before participants will
      undergo a clinical exam (inspection and palpation of the foot, measurement of bilateral
      passive ankle range of motion). All participants will complete the Foot and Ankle Outcome
      score and the EQ-5D-5L health questionnaire to obtain pain and functional scores.
      Participants will be able to familiarize with treadmill walking at their preferred walking
      speed. Surface electrodes will be placed bilaterally over the tibialis anterior,
      gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis, soleus, and peroneus longus. Isokinetic muscle strength
      in ankle plantarflexion/ dorsiflexion will be tested using the Biodex system 4 Pro.
      Reflective surface markers will be placed bilaterally on anatomic landmarks according to the
      PlugIn Gait model9 and a specific foot model. These markers are seen by 8 Vicon cameras. Data
      for a standing reference trial will be collected, and participants will be asked to walk back
      and forth on a flat walkway until three valid left and right steps will be recorded (force
      plate hit centrally, approximately 10 minutes). Then, they will be asked to balance on one
      leg for 30 seconds per leg. Participants will be asked to stand on the treadmill (h/p cosmos,
      Zebris), and they will perform three single-limb heel rises with each leg while kinematic,
      electromyography (EMG), and pressure data will be measured. Participants will then walk
      barefoot for 2 minutes at 0% slope while kinematic, EMG, and pressure data will be recorded.
      Subsequently, the treadmill incline will be increased to 15%, and data for 2 minutes walking
      at this slope will be recorded.
