  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among patients with stable ischemic heart disease who are referred for coronary angiography,
      a substantial proportion have non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Ischemia based
      on symptoms or stress testing may be due to coronary microvascular dysfunction in up to 40%
      of these patients. However, the mechanisms and optimal treatment of coronary microvascular
      dysfunction are unknown. Aberrant platelet activity and inflammation have been hypothesized
      as mechanisms of microvascular dysfunction. Investigators plan to evaluate association
      between platelet activity, inflammation, and coronary microvascular dysfunction in stable
      women referred for coronary angiography, and to identify non-invasive correlates of coronary
      microvascular dysfunction in these patients.

      The objectives of this study are to

        1. Investigate platelet activity and inflammation in patients with and without coronary
           microvascular disease who are referred for coronary angiography for the evaluation of
           stable ischemic heart disease and are found to have non-obstructuve epicardial CAD

        2. To identify correlates of coronary microvascular dysfunction in non coronary
           microvascular beds that can be characterized in vivo.

    <description>After diagnostic coronary angiography, invasive measures of coronary microvascular physiology will be obtained. Blood will be collected for platelet activity, inflammation and isolation of coronary endothelial cells. Evaluation of the sublingual microvasculature with a side stream dark field imaging video microscope will be performed.</description>
