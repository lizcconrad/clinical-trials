  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI), or worsening kidney function, is a common complication after liver
      transplantation (20-90% in published studies). Patients who experience AKI after liver
      transplantation have higher mortality, increased graft loss, longer hospital and intensive
      care unit stays, and more progression to chronic kidney disease compared with those who do
      not. In this study, half of the participants will have their body temperature cooled to
      slightly lower than normal (mild hypothermia) for a portion of the liver transplant
      operation, while the other half will have their body temperature maintained at normal. The
      study will evaluate if mild hypothermia protects from AKI during liver transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial of mild hypothermia during liver
      transplantation to provide protection from AKI. Participants will be randomized to
      normothermia (36.5-37.5 °C) versus mild hypothermia (34-35 °C) during a portion of the liver
      transplant operation. The protocol is based on preliminary data from rodent models showing
      that hypothermia protects the kidneys from ischemia-reperfusion injury, as well as studies in
      deceased organ donors showing that cooling improves post-transplant organ function.
      Temperature will be maintained with standard techniques plus a minimally-invasive esophageal
      cooling device that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The investigators
      hypothesize that mild hypothermia will reduce the incidence and severity of AKI after LTx.
      Standard surrogates (e.g., change in serum creatinine, need for initiation of dialysis) and
      biomarkers will be used to assess the severity of kidney injury.

    <description>The EnsoETM (formerly known as Esophageal Cooling Device) is a non-sterile multilumen silicone tube placed in the esophagus for the purpose of cooling or warming a patient while allowing gastric decompression and drainage. It is placed in a manner identical to a standard orogastric tube, which is standard equipment for liver transplant surgery. It is removed at the end of surgery. Control of the patient's temperature is achieved by connecting the EnsoETM to an external heat exchanger (Gaymar Medi-Therm III or similar system). The Medi-Therm III is a standard device used in operating rooms for warming patients with a conductive table warming pad. The Medi-Therm III circulates temperature-controlled water through a closed-loop system via the two outer lumens of the EnsoETM. Water temperature ranges from 4°C - 42°C.</description>

    <description>Cooling will be initiated after induction of anesthesia and maintained throughout the anhepatic phase of liver transplantation. In all feasible cases the surgeon will cover the peritoneal surface over the right kidney, which is exposed during the operation, with ice-cold sponges to enhance cooling of the renal parenchyma. After blood flow is completely restored to the liver, the esophageal cooling device and other standard measures (forced-air, fluid, and table warmers, plus a heated anesthesia circuit) will be used to actively re-warm the patient (expected warming rate ≥ 1 deg C/hour). The goal is to achieve normothermia by case end.</description>
