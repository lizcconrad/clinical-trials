      This is a protocol for a trial carried out from 1999 to 2002. At that time, surgical patients
      received a large volume of intravenous saline during operations on the colon or the rectum,
      often so much fluid that their bodyweight increased by 4-6 kilograms. We hypothesized that a
      restricted fluid regimen could prevent the development of cardiopulmonary complications and
      improve wound healing including the healing of an anastomosis of the gut.

      We designed a clinical randomized assessor blinded multi centre trial comparing a restricted
      fluid regimen to a standard fluid regimen, the difference being the volume of saline
      administered to the patients. Patients undergoing surgery on the colon or the rectum were
      included after informed oral and written consent.

      The restricted regimen aimed at zero-fluid balance with allowance for a body weight increase
      of 1 kg. The standard regimen was a bit &quot;dryer&quot; than the actual standard; our patients in the
      standard group received saline causing a body weight increase of only 3-4 kg. The fluid
      therapy started at midnight the day of operation, went on through the operation and continued
      on the wards until discharge. The patients were encouraged to eat and drink as much and as
      soon as possible after the operation.

      The primary outcome was the number of patients who died or suffered a complication measured
      within 30 days of surgery. We looked at all complications, but especially heart and lung
      complications and complications related to the healing of wounds and anastomosis.

      The patients was examined in the out patient clinic after 30 days, and in addition blinded
      assessors were reviewing the medical files for registration of postoperative complications.

      The results are published in The Annals of Surgery 2003;238(5)641-48. The restricted regimen
      nearly halved the number of patients with complications, and heart and lung complications
      were allmost eliminated.

      Other investigators confirmed the results, and a more restricted approach to fluid therapy to
      surgical patients has been implemented world wide.

      Aim:

      To show the effect of a restrictive fluid regime compared to a standard regime by the
      frequency of complications in patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

      Background:

      Previous studies have risen suspicions of fluid balance, and especially a large amount of
      water and NaCl administration, can be a significant factor in developing postoperative
      complications (1,2).

      In 1990 in Critical Care Magazine, Lowell et al. described that patients who in transferring
      to intensive therapy had an increased weight of &gt; 10% of their preoperative weight, had a
      significantly higher mortality rate of 31,6% than patients with an increased weight of &lt; 10%,
      who only had a mortality rate of 10,3%.

      Some studies, whereof reference 2 will be processed further, have described, how all patients
      undergoing gastroenterological operations increase their body weight by 2-4% of the
      preoperative weight during the first 24 hours following surgery due to the perioperative
      saline intravenously (2,3).

      In reference 2 it is described, that the patients have been given a median of 6-7 L saline
      intravenously during the day of operation. This is fully comparable to other studies (3-5).

      Based on previous guidelines in anaesthesiological departments, a volume of saline of 15
      ml/kg bodyweight was administered during the first hour of surgery, and 7,5 ml/kg during the
      following hours. Furthermore, any blood loss was replaced by 2,5 ml saline per ml blood lost
      (6-9).

      The patients in the nutrition study returned to their preoperative weight after 4-5 days and
      then had an expected weight loss due to the postoperative catabolic condition. In this
      material of 2 x 30 patients, 6 patients developed leakage of the bowel anastomosis. Of these,
      3 died after having undergone several reoperations.

      In addition, 2 patients died on the 3rd postoperative day from AMI and ARDS while 1 patient
      died from sepsis on the 6th postoperative day. Patients in need of reoperation had surgery
      for the first time after 5-7 days, which is consistent with the fact that anastomosis leakage
      is generally diagnosed 4-10 days postoperatively. The nine patients with severe complications
      had a weight gain of 6-14% from the second postoperative day, which as a median exceeded the
      95% confidence interval for the total material. The weight gain increased further on the 3rd
      postoperative day. The nine patients received the same amount of intravenous fluids as the
      rest of the patients during the day of operation, but they received - possibly due to low
      diuresis postoperatively, a greater administration of i.v. fluids during the following
      postoperative days with a further increase in their weight. The postoperative weight increase
      in these patients can therefore only be due to fluid retention.

      The increased postoperative fluid retention results in increased universal edema, which can
      significantly affect the tissue's microcirculation and oxygenation. This may have influenced
      the healing of intestinal anastomoses and the development of cardiovascular and pulmonary
      complications, which typically occurred during the 3rd postoperative day.

      On this background, it is therefore relevant to investigate whether perioperative
      intervention against fluid administration can improve the postoperative course.

      Design:

      Prospective randomized multicenter study with stratification for each center. Block
      randomization with 4 patients per block. It is necessary to incorporate several centers for
      the investigation to be carried out within a reasonable time.

      Material:

      2 x 70 patients scheduled for colorectal resection. The number is determined from previous
      works (1,2) where a total complication rate of at least 30% after colorectal resection has
      been found in post-operatively early-nourished patients. We wish to reduce this to 10%
      (MIREDIF = 20%). The risk of Type 1 error (5%) is set low to avoid overlooking a possible
      gain, while the risk of Type 2 error, i.e. the risk of finding a difference that is not
      actually present is set higher, at 20%, as the consequence of this would be to introduce an
      expected cheaper and simpler perioperative regime, although it does not actually affect the
      complication rate.

      The risk of Type 3 errors, where the null hypothesis is dropped, but where the worst group in
      fact is incorrectly highlighted as the group with the fewest operation complications, is
      estimated to be poor and is included in the above.

      The measurement scale of the effect criterion is the incidence of complications, which is
      binomially distributed.

      As the material is unlikely to meet the normal distribution, the number of participants
      increases to 70 in each group, i.e. a total of 140 patients must be included. In order to
      reduce the variation, each center must include at least 16 patients (which means that up to 9
      centers have to participate).

      Interim calculation: see page 5.

      Method:

        1. Patients are included preoperatively after informed consent (see page 9). An
           investigator at the local center randomize the patients to either standard fluid
           treatment or restrictive perioperative fluid treatment (see Appendix 1). The main
           difference between the two regimes is that less isotonic saline is administered in the
           restrictive regime. Anesthesia and postoperative nutrition regimes are the same in the
           two groups. The patients are classified with ASA and Apache 2 scores (see Appendix 2).

        2. Weight registration: The patient is weighed on the same set of scales at the time of
           hospitalization (entry weight), after bowel cleansing (cleansing weight) and in the
           morning on the day of operation (preoperative weight) (see Appendix 2). Hereafter daily
           weighing every postoperative morning (see Appendices 6a and 6b).

        3. Blood tests: Blood is withdrawn on the day of hospitalization, on the day of operation
           in the morning, on arrival in the recovery ward and the following 7 days (or until
           discharged). Blood samples (a total of 20 ml per time) are withdrawn to determine: Hb,
           hematocrit, leukocytes, platelets, ALAT, LDH, creatinine, carbamide, transferrin,
           albumin, protein, prealbumin, CRP and for storage of plasma (citrate and trazylol) and
           serum for later determination of cortisol and other hormones. A copy of the laboratory
           schema will be added to the logbook.

        4. Anesthesia: Patients must fast for food from midnight before surgery, but they can have
           clear fluids up to 2 hours preoperatively, but max. 500 ml from midnight. Premedication
           is given as a tablet Triazolam 0.125 mg with 50-100 ml of water by mouth. Combined
           epidural and general anesthesia are used. An epidural catheter is inserted corresponding
           to TH10-12, tested with Lidocaine 2% and adrenaline 3-4 ml. After 3-5 minutes this is
           supplemented with refracted doses of Bupivacaine 0.5% until the blockade is sufficient
           (often about 8-12 ml). Continuous infusion of Bupivacain is administered 0.5%, 4-8
           ml/hour. Finally, a bolus injection of 2 mg Morphine is administered. General anesthesia
           is induced with Fentanyl 5μg/kg, Tiopental 3-4 mg/kg and Rocuronium (Esmeron) 0.6 mg/kg
           (all doses are modified according to each patient's needs and cardiovascular condition).
           Anesthesia is maintained with Isoflurane 0.2-0.4% end-tidal concentration in oxygen /
           atmospheric air (inspiratory oxygen concentration 30-35%). The neuromuscular block can
           be reverted with glycopurron / neostigmine when needed.

           Hypotension Diagnosis and Treatment: See Appendices 3a and 3b (reverse). The anesthetic
           form can be adapted to the individual department's routine.

        5. Perioperative fluid treatment: During operation, fluid is submitted and recorded
           according to Appendix 3a and 3b. Liquid status is made at the end of anesthesia.

        6. Monitoring: Standard anesthesia monitoring as recommended by Danish Anesthesiological
           Union (ecg, NIPB (if necessary invasive BT), CVP, SpO2, etCO2, temperature, hourly
           diuresis, neuromuscular block). All patients will be given a CVK routinely after the
           initiation of anesthesia, and central venous pressure (CVP) is measured until the
           patient is discharged from the recovery ward. Arterial blood gases and hematocrit are
           checked immediately after the anesthesia is initiated, immediately after arriving at the
           recovery ward and before the patient is transferred to the surgical ward, as well as for
           clinical needs.

        7. Surgery: The patient is operated according to the department's routines. During the
           surgery, a nutritional feeding tube is inserted in the duodenum (Compat Stayput®
           (Sandoz) nasoduodenal nutritional feeding tube, 9 French), for postoperative enteral
           nutrition. If the nasoduodenal tube can't be brought to the duodenum, it is placed in
           the ventricle. If this placement causes nausea, the tube is removed and the patient will
           consume nutrition according to ability by mouth.

           Antibiotic prophylaxis, bowel cleansing, physiotherapy, etc. according to the usual
           guidelines of the respective departments. Before closing the wound, the surgeon must
           assess the appearance of the intestine with respect to fluid status on a scale of 1-4: 1
           = normal, 2 = allusive edematous, 3 = edematous, 4 = trickling edematous. (See
           Appendices 3a and 3b).

        8. Postoperative fluid treatment and nutrition during the day of operation: Fluid
           recordings are continued from the end of the anesthesia, on the recovery ward and for
           the rest of the day of operation according to Appendices 4a and 4b. On the day of
           operation, 600 ml of Nutri-concentrated 75 is given in the feeding tube.
           Nutri-concentrated 75 contains 200 kcal and 7.5 g protein per 100 ml. A normal need of
           vitamins and minerals is covered by administration of 1000 ml per day.

        9. Fluid treatment and nutrition in the following days: In the 1st to 3rd postoperative
           days Nutri-concentrated 75, 1000 ml / day is administered. Thereafter no nutritional
           supplement is given. The fluid regime in the restrictive group is mainly assessed based
           on the patient's weight, ability to drink independently and blood samples. The standard
           regime follows the department's usual postoperative regime.

       10. Postoperative analgesia: As a basis, epidural infusion of the standard mixture of
           Bupivacain-Morfin (5 mg Morfin + 250 mg Bupivacain in NaCl to the volume of 100 ml) is
           given, 4-8 ml/hour. If needed, epidural bolus injection of Bupivacain may be
           supplemented with 0.25% or 0.5%, 4-8 ml.

           In addition to the epidural treatment, i.v./i.m Morphine 5-10 mg p.n. can be
           administered. If there are no contraindications, Paracetamol or NSAID can be
           administered (peroral, i.v. or rectally). The epidural painrelief is continued
           postoperatively for a maximum of 4 days, after which the epidural catheter is removed.
           In case of a need for analgesics hereafter, then opioid is given by mouth or i.v./i.m.
           as well as PCM and/or NSAIDs.

       11. Anti-nausea may be administered as an adjuvant, Ondansetron (Zofran ®) 4-8 mg i.v. p.n.
           (max 32 mg/day), Cisapride (Prepulphide®) 5-10 mg by mouth/feeding tube 2-4 times a day,
           Metoclopramide (Primperan®) 10-20 mg i.v. p.n. or DHB 0.5-1.25 mg i.v.

       12. Postoperatively care-scores and mobilization (Appendix 6), admission time and resource
           consumption (Appendix 7) incl. outpatient visits are registered. All registrations are
           sent to and collected by the coordinating project doctor/nurse who also makes sure a
           reminder is mailed to the patient, scheduling a postoperative checkup 4 weeks after the
           surgery. Treatment-requiring postoperative complications within the first four
           postoperative weeks are registered (see Appendix 8). The patient attends a check-up in
           the project, along with with a possible routine 4-week check-up in the outpatient unit.

      Statements:

      The two groups are expected to be comparable due to the randomization and stratification, but
      after inclusion of 2 x 12 and 2 x 24 patients, respectively, an interim statement is made
      without breaking the code to ensure equal distribution in the two groups.

      The perioperative flow and weight balance of the two groups is compared to non-parametric
      statistics, Mann-Whitney test. We chose a significance level of 5%.

      The postoperative care score and mobilization are compared between the groups, and
      significance calculations are performed for the two groups. To reduce the number of
      calculations, the area under the curve (AUC) is used.

      Hospitalization time, complications demanding treatment, resource consumption and possible
      mortality is also calculated for the two groups. Here, the Mann-Whitney test is also used
      with a 5% significance level.

      The outpatient checkups will take place either as a routine checkup or in the free time of
      project doctors, and thus do not put any strain on the departments.

      Ethics:

      Participation in the project is voluntary and is subject to informed consent. This can be
      withdrawn at any time without further explanation, and without this affecting the patient's
      treatment in any way.

      There is no risk associated with participation in the project, but discomfort associated with
      additional blood sampling for the project, no more than 4-5 times. However, these blood
      samples will preferably be taken from the CVK, so the patient avoids being stabbed
      unnecessarily.

      In the long term, a treatment benefit is possible and this appears to outweigh the discomfort
      mentioned above.

      The project is registered with the Scientific Ethics Committee (multicenter study) and
      Registry Audit in accordance with applicable guidelines. All person-identifiable data, incl.
      blood / tissue samples is destroyed after the project is completed.

      Laymans Summary:

      Fluid treatment during colon or rectal surgery.

      Aim: To investigate whether a specially controlled fluid treatment regime compared with the
      department's standard regime may reduce the number of complications developed after surgery
      on the colon and rectum.

      Background: Previous studies have suggested, that the fluid balance and, in particular
      administration of water and salt might be a major factor in the development of postoperative
      complications such as breathing difficulties, bowel disorders and infections.

      In a study (1), which examined the value of nutritional supplements soon after the operation,
      it was found that patients who developed severe complications were in a positive fluid
      balance with body weight increase before the complication became known. It has also been
      described (2), that patients transferred to the intensive care unit with complications after
      gastrointestinal surgery have a much higher risk of dying, if there is a fluid accumulation
      of more than 10% of the body weight than if the fluid accumulation is less than 10%. Whether
      this is the result of excessive fluid administration or that especially sick patients
      accumulate fluids for other reasons has not been investigated.

      It is known that early nutrition after surgery reduces the number of infections after surgery
      on the intestine (1), as well as it is known that blood transfusions increase this risk.

      Method: Multicenter study, where 2 x 70 patients scheduled for colon or rectal surgery are
      included after informed consent. They are randomly distributed for treatment with one of the
      two above-mentioned fluid regimes. In both groups, free consumption of food and drink is
      allowed after surgery, and a supplement of a dietary intake through a feeding tube is given
      during the first days. Blood tests are taken daily, preferably the same routine blood tests,
      and fluid balance, weight and possible complications are recorded.

      Ethics: Participation is voluntary and the survey is conducted in accordance with the
      Helsinki II Declaration. All person-identifiable data will be deleted after the end of the
      trial.

      Discomforts for the patient: Blood sampling and outpatient visit 4 weeks after surgery. There
      is no risk associated with participating in the project.

      Economy: Financial support is applied for through the Research Council. There are no special
      interests associated with the survey.

      Addendum to the protocol written during the patient inclusion and before the trial was
      completed.

      Hypothesis:

      Both too little and too much fluid administered intravenously may be harmful to the cardiac
      function (low oxygen supply and congestion) and cause cardiovascular complications:

      • Postoperatively developed arrhythmias, AMI, pneumonia, pulmonary congestion,
      postoperatively developed pleural exudate, pulmonary edema or ARDS.

      Both too little and too much fluid administered intravenously may be harmful to tissue
      healing (low oxygen supply and interstitial edema) and cause complications related to tissue
      healing and infection:

      • Infections of the wound, bursting of the wound (superficial and deeper), leakage from the
      anastomosis and separation of stoma.

      Randomization:

      The investigating surgeon or anesthesiologist perform the randomization by opening
      consecutively numbered opaque envelopes. The randomization is stratified for each center and
      for colonic and rectal surgery the latter by opening an envelope with highest number for
      rectal surgical patients, and with lowest number for colonic patients.

      Blinding:

      Specialist surgeons reading the medical journals censored for all information about
      randomization group, fluid therapy given or bodyweight measurements will perform a blinded
      assessment for the primary outcome.

      Two doctors will evaluate each patient file, and in case of disagreement, a third will decide
      the outcome.

      Plan for analysis:

      An intention to treat analysis will be performed for the primary outcome for all patients
      included in the trial whether or not they met a post randomization exclusion criterion, and
      therefore did or did not receive the allocated treatment.

      A per protocol analysis will be performed for the primary outcome for all patients fulfilling
      the in- and exclusion criteria whether or not they adhered to the protocol.

      Subgroup analysis will be performed for the patients with Major-, Minor-, Cardio-pulmonal-
      and tissue-healing complications.
