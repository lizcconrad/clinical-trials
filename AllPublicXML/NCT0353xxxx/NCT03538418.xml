  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of a
      Wearable Activity Tracker (WAT)-based exercise intervention to increase physical activity
      levels in frail or pre-frail older people. One group of participants will receive a WAT-based
      exercise intervention incorporated with the support of behavioral change techniques (BCTs)
      and technical issues, while the other group will receive only an exercise intervention
      incorporated with BCTs support.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Six community centres, which provide similar types of community care and social support
      services for community-dwelling older people, will be invited by a convenience method to work
      as collaborators in this study. Using computer-generated random numbers, a biostatistician
      not affiliated with this study will randomize the centres in a 1:1 ratio into either: the
      control or the experimental groups (WAT group).

      The WAT group will receive a 3-month exercise programme plus WAT intervention which aims to
      strengthen the participants' motivation to develop the intention to gradually increase their
      physical activity levels to eventually meet the level recommended for older people by the
      American Heart Association (AHA). Two face-to-face sessions followed by weekly to monthly
      telephone sessions offering support on dealing with technical issues and BCTs will be
      arranged for the experimental group. The additional technical support given alongside the WAT
      intervention will be gradually withdrawn from the participants. Eventually, all additional
      measures to support the use of WATs among participants will be stopped. Participants will be
      left to use the WAT on their own for 3 months during the follow-up period. In addition, they
      will receive a weekly 45-60 minute center-based structured exercise programme for 3 months,
      which is designed according to the AHA's recommendations on exercise for older people.

      The control group will receive another 3-month exercise programme with face-to-face, and
      telephone-delivered BCTs follow-up sessions, with the number and timing of all sessions
      similar to that in the experimental group.

    <intervention_model_description>A two-arm parallel (single-blinded) cluster randomized controlled trial involves two groups of participants (the WAT group and the control group). Six community centres, which provide similar types of community care and social support services for community-dwelling older people, will be invited by a convenience method to work as collaborators in this study. Using computer-generated random numbers, a biostatistician not affiliated with this study will randomize the centres into either: the control or the experimental groups. Therefore, duing the trial, participants in one group receive intervention &quot;in parallel&quot; to participants in the other group (control group).</intervention_model_description>

             effort', or 'I could not get going in the last week'; iii) a slow walk time: with an
             average walking speed in the lowest quintile stratified by median body height; iv)
             reduced grip strength: with maximal grip strength in the lowest quintile stratified by
             the body mass index quartile; and v) a Physical Activity Scale for Elderly-Chinese
             (PASE-C) score in the lowest quartile (i.e., &lt; 30 for men and &lt; 27.7 for women). The
             presence of 1-2 indicates pre-frailty, &gt; 3 items indicates frailty.

        Exclusion Criteria are older people who:

          -  have any physical conditions that hamper their performance of the exercise programme
             or use of the WAT, such as visual or hearing problems.

          -  regularly engage in moderately intense exercise (such as hiking, Tai Chi) for &gt; 3
             hours per week.
