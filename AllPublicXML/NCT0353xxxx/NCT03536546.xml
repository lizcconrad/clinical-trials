  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a study to examine the impact of an alcohol peer-mentor
      intervention starting in the emergency department (ED) combined with 6 peer booster sessions
      to reduce hazardous drinking and facilitate primary/specialty care use compared to enhanced
      usual care. Approximately 450 Veterans with hazardous drinking behaviors will be randomized
      to one of these two conditions. Follow-up assessments will occur at 3-, 6-, and 12-month
      post-randomization.

      The objective of the study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the
      efficacy of an alcohol peer-mentor intervention starting in the ED, combined with a
      continuing 6-session program of post-ED strengths-based peer mentorship to facilitate
      reduction in hazardous drinking, and linkage and engagement in primary and/or specialty
      alcohol treatment services and mental health care, if needed. Project Methods: The study will
      screen Veterans Affairs (VA) ED patients for hazardous drinking. Those screening positive and
      who enroll in the study will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) Alcohol Peer-Mentor
      (APM) intervention (n=225), or 2) Brief Advice (BA) comparison condition (n=225). Stratified
      random assignment to conditions will be by sex and presence of AUD (yes/no) defined as a
      score of 14 for men and 10 for women on the AUDIT. Randomization will proceed in blocks of
      10. All participants will also receive written community resource information. Participants
      randomized to the APM condition will receive peer support to reduce hazardous drinking, and
      those who meet alcohol use disorder criteria will be coached by the peer and will assist in a
      warm handoff linkage to addiction treatment.

    <description>Alcohol consumption is measured by Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB). The investigators will administer a 30-day TLFB for finer grained data on participant's self-reported drinking behaviors. Using a calendar, the TLFB is a drinking assessment of retrospective drinking estimates. The investigators will collect participant self-report data on number of drinking days in the past month.</description>

The investigators will administer a 30-day TLFB for finer grained data on participant's self-reported drinking behaviors. The investigators will collect participant self-report data on number of days when the participant demonstrates binge drinking (5+ drinks per day for men; 4+ drinks per day for women).</description>

    <description>The investigators will use the Treatment Services Review (TSR, v6) to measure change in total number of healthcare visits across medical, mental health, and substance use care. The TSR, v6 is a semi-structured interview that gathers specific healthcare utilization information with adequate reliability and validity.</description>

    <description>A Veteran Peer research assistant will have contact with a study participant once in person in the emergency department at enrollment, and up to 6 times after enrollment over the course of 2 months. Participants will receive brief advice from a peer. Brief advice content will be based on strengths-based discussions with participants regarding their drinking and personal goals and preferences. Participants will also receive a resource pamphlet on alcohol and other health issues. Follow-up contact will be made by phone. The content of the follow-up peer intervention will be based on the manual developed by the study team to address strengths-based intervention topics.</description>
