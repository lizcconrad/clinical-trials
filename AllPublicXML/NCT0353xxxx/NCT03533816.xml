  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gamma delta T-cells are part of the innate immune system with the ability to recognize
      malignant cells and kill them. This study uses gamma delta T-cells to maximize the anti-tumor
      response and minimize graft versus host disease (GVHD) in leukemic and myelodysplastic
      patients who have had a partially mismatched bone marrow transplant (haploidentical).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with hematological malignancies require a bone marrow transplant for curative
      treatment. A matched sibling donor is optimal but may not be available. Therefore, a
      partially matched family member (haploidentical) may be a viable alternative. The incidence
      of graft vs. host disease, however, can become more of a significant, even fatal, factor with
      partial matches.

      T-cells have been shown to be the key player in the post-transplant immune phenomena. The
      majority of T-cells are composed of alpha beta T-cells with a small minority of gamma delta
      T-cells, which are known to have the unique ability to kill malignant cells without antigen
      recognition.

      This study proposes to extract, concentrate, and activate gamma delta T-cells from the
      peripheral blood to provide innate anti-tumor effect with minimal risk of GVHD. Safety and
      impact and/or the rate of GVHD will be evaluated.
