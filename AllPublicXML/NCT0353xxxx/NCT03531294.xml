    <textblock>
      Study eyes will be assigned randomly (1:1 ratio) to one of the following 2 treatment arms.
      Randomization of PDR subjects will be limited to 50% of each arm.

      Group 1- Subjects will be seen every month, 28 days (+ 7 days), for 52 weeks. All subjects
      will receive IAI at baseline, after eligibility is confirmed. Week 4 through week 48,
      subjects will be seen monthly and treated with IAI PRN (pro re nata) according to, same day,
      central reading center (CRC) determined DRSS level.

      Monthly treatment with IAI will continue until a greater than or equal to 2 step DRSS level
      improvement is achieved, relative to screening/baseline DRSS based on CRC assessment OPTOS
      fundus photos (FP). Subjects who have baseline proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (DRSS
      Level 61-71) will continue to receive monthly IAI until a greater than or equal to 2 step
      DRSS improvement is achieved as determined by CRC assessment of OPTOS fundus photos relative
      to screening/baseline DRSS, and PDR is quiescent according to the treating investigator.

      Treatment with IAI will be reinitiated if a 1 step worsening of DRSS occurs compared to best
      DRSS score achieved, determined by CRC evaluation of OPTOS fundus photos (this equates to
      less than a 2 step DRSS improvement compared to baseline DRSS). If such worsening is
      detected, the subject would resume monthly IAI until a greater than or equal to 2 step DRSS
      improvement compared to baseline is achieved, as determined by CRC assessment of OPTOS fundus
      photos. In addition, retreatment will also be re-started if new onset neovascularization is
      identified and is continued until the PDR is quiescent according to the treating
      investigator.

      Group 2 - Subjects will be seen every month, 28 days (+ 7 days), for 52 weeks. All subjects
      will receive IAI at baseline, after eligibility is confirmed. Week 4 through week 48,
      subjects will be seen monthly and treated with IAI PRN (pro re nata) according to, same day,
      CRC determination of DRSS initially, and subsequently of leakage index.

      Monthly treatment with IAI will continue until a greater than or equal to 2 step DRSS level
      improvement is achieved, relative to screening/baseline DRSS based on CRC assessment OPTOS
      fundus photos (FP). Subjects who have baseline proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (DRSS
      Level 61-71) will continue to receive monthly IAI until a greater than or equal to 2 step
      DRSS improvement is achieved as determined by CRC assessment of OPTOS fundus photos relative
      to screening/baseline DRSS, and PDR is quiescent according to the treating investigator.

      Leakage index as determined by CRC assessment of OPTOS wide field (WF) fluorescein
      angiography (FA) at the visit at which a greater than or equal to 2 step DRSS level
      improvement is achieved will be considered the threshold. Treatment with IAI will be
      reinitiated if the leakage index increases to 33% above the individual subject threshold
      leakage index level as determined by CRC evaluation of OPTOS WF-FA. If such worsening is
      detected, the subject would resume monthly IAI until the threshold leakage index as
      determined by CRC assessment of OPTOS WF-FA is reached. In addition, retreatment will also be
      re-started if new onset neovascularization is identified and is continued until the PDR is
      quiescent according to the treating investigator.

      If images of insufficient quality are unable to be obtained, in Group 1 or Group 2, subjects
      will undergo treatment with IAI at principal investigators discretion or designee.

      Subjects can have both eyes in the study, if eligibility is met. If both eyes are eligible,
      one eye will be randomized to group 1 while the other is randomized to group 2. If only one
      eye is eligible IAI will be provided for the fellow eye as needed according to the treating
      investigator.
