  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1.1 million children and young people in the United Kingdom (UK) are living
      with asthma, making it the most common chronic disease in children in the UK. Our recent
      observational study found that poor asthma control, poor medication adherence, and a poor
      understanding of asthma were key unmet needs of secondary school children. Following the
      findings from our earlier study, we have developed a preliminary theory-based multi-faceted
      intervention, aimed at improving asthma self-management and control in young people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We have developed a theory-driven self-management intervention for children and young people
      which addresses the barriers to successful self-management, which were identified in our
      earlier study. The intervention will engage asthmatic teenagers and their peers, and will be
      delivered in two components. The first component includes a theatre workshop for all children
      aged 11-13 years in London secondary schools. The aim of this component is to raise awareness
      of asthma in schools among peers. The second component is a series of four self-management
      workshops for children with asthma. The aim of this component is to teach children about
      asthma, using interactive role plays and games. The main topics will include asthma general
      knowledge and understanding; GP communication; asthma triggers and symptoms; medication and
      emergency response; and self-management techniques and goal setting.

The control group will receive usual care during the intervention.</description>
