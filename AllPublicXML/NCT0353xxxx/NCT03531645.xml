  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if fulvestrant and palbociclib can help
      to control low-grade serous ovarian cancer. The safety of this drug combination will also be
      studied.

      This is an investigational study. Fulvestrant and palbociclib are both FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of several types of cancer. Their use in patients
      with low-grade serous ovarian cancer is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 15 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Every study cycle will be 28 days. You will receive treatment in 2 periods: Neoadjuvant
      Treatment (before surgery) and Adjuvant Treatment (after surgery).

      Neoadjuvant Treatment (Cycles 1-4):

      There are 4 cycles in the neoadjuvant treatment period. On Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1
      of Cycles 2-4, you will receive fulvestrant as an injection in your buttocks. On Days 1-21 of
      each cycle, you will take palbociclib tablets by mouth at about the same time each day,
      preferably with food. You will not take palbociclib during Days 22-28.

      Palbociclib should be swallowed whole; not chewed. If a capsule is broken, cracked, or
      otherwise not whole, do not take it.

      Surgery:

      After 4 cycles of neoadjuvant treatment, you will have your scheduled surgery as part of your
      standard care. You will sign a separate consent for this surgery describing the procedure and
      its risks in more detail.

      Adjuvant Treatment (Cycles 5 and beyond):

      After you have recovered from surgery (about 3-6 weeks later), you will begin receiving
      fulvestrant and palbociclib. On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive fulvestrant as an
      injection in your buttocks. On Days 1-21 of each cycle, you will take palbociclib tablets by
      mouth. You will not take palbociclib during Days 22-28.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You will receive the study drug(s) for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after the 30-day follow-up phone call
      (described below).

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will also
           have a pelvic exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, tumor marker, and biomarker
           tests.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected and/or part of this blood sample
           will be used for a pregnancy test.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam.

      On Day 1 of odd-numbered cycles after Cycle 1 (Cycles 3, 5, 7, and so on), you will have an
      MRI or CT scan.

      At your visit before the surgery, you will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the
      disease.

      During surgery, some of the tissue removed will be used to compare to tissue collected from
      you before you received chemotherapy so researchers can learn if the study drugs had any
      affect on the disease. This sample will be stored at MD Anderson for an unlimited amount of
      time for testing related to this study.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After the last dose of study drug(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, tumor marker, and biomarker
           tests.

        -  You will have an MRI or CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after the last dose of study drugs, the study staff will call you and ask how
      you are doing. This call should last about 5 minutes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with clinical or surgical stage III or IV low-grade serous ovarian, primary
             peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinomas who in the judgement of the treating
             physician are unlikely to achieve optimal surgical cytoreduction and have been
             recommended to receive neoadjuvant therapy.

          2. Histological diagnosis must be based on surgical or core biopsy not just fine needle
             aspiration. Biopsies performed at other institutions must undergo pathology review and
             confirmation at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

          3. Tissue from an archival tissue sample or fresh tissue obtained from a core or
             excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion.

          4. Willingness to provide pre- and post-treatment tissue for translational studies.
             Pre-treatment fresh frozen tissue must be available for research purposes. This tissue
             can be collected from preoperative laparoscopy, other diagnostic biopsy, or a
             research-specific biopsy.

          5. Signed informed consent on protocol LAB02-188.

          6. Tissue from an archival tissue sample or fresh tissue obtained from a core or
             excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion.

          7. Patients whose clinical biopsies are found to be insufficient for the planned
             translational studies must be willing to undergo a research biopsy.

          8. Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST v1.1. a. Measurable disease is defined
             at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest
             dimension to be recorded). Each target lesion must be &gt;20 mm when measured by
             conventional techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, CT, and MRI, or &gt;10 mm when
             measured by spiral CT.

          9. Women 18 years of age or older.

         10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1.

         11. Abnormal organ function is permitted. However, patients must have: a. absolute
             neutrophil count &gt;/= 1500/mL b. platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mL c. hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dL d.
             estimated creatinine clearance &gt;/= 60 ml/min as calculated using the method standard
             for the institution e. total serum bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 X ULN f. aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) &lt;/= 3 X ULN
             (&lt;/= 5 X ULN in patients with bone or liver metastases)

         12. Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior therapy or surgical procedures to
             National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE 4.03 Grade &lt;/= 1

         13. Women of child-bearing potential (intact uterus) MUST have a negative serum or urine
             human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first
             dose of study medication. Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not
             been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. If the
             urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will
             be required.

         14. Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference
             Section 7.7). Patients of childbearing potential are those who have not been
             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately

         15. Pre/perimenopausal women must be amenable to be treated with goserelin. All patients
             will be rendered post-menopausal secondary to concomitant administration of goserelin.

         16. Ability to understand and willingness to sign informed consent form prior to
             initiation of the study and any study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:
