  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to measure the effect of intragastric balloon on gastric function,
      particularly gastric accommodation and pace making, and the possible underlying changes in
      autonomic function
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intragastric balloon is a space-occupying device that is hypothesized to function by
      inducing early satiety. Additionally, insertion of an intragastric balloon causes delayed
      gastric emptying; longer gastric emptying times after balloon insertion are correlated with
      more weight loss. The exact mechanism of function, however, is not clear and likely
      multifactorial. The investigators hypothesize that the intragastric balloon causes weight
      loss by affecting gastric and autonomic function, including pace-making and accommodation,
      and that the difference in responsiveness among patients may be mediated by differences in
      gastric function.

    <measure>Gastric slow waves</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A noninvasive method similar to electrocardiography, called electrogastrography, will be used in this study to assess the effects of intragastric balloon on gastric slow waves</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastric accommodation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A noninvasive nutrient drink test will be performed and accommodation will be assessed using a symptom (fullness, nausea, belching of air, cramps in the abdomen, bloating, and pain) scale 0 to 3 points with higher values indicating more and/or greater symptoms</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Autonomic function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The ECG will be recorded simultaneously with the Electrogastrograph (EGG) and will be used to noninvasively assess the vagal and sympathetic activities as well as the sympathovagal ratio</description>
