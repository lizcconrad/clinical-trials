      Infertile men due to oligoasthenospermia with non-tense hydroceles are subjected to ICSI
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty male infertile patients with Oligoasthenospermia were recruited from outpatient clinic
      of Urology Department, Tanta University. Patients were selected according to inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were: (a) infertile couples due to male factor (b)
      Oligoasthenospermia (c) Normal hormonal profile (serum free and total testosterone,
      prolactin, Estrogen and LH), (d) presence or absence of non-tense vaginal hydrocel. The
      exclusion criteria were: (a) Presence of varicocele, (b) History of recent testicular trauma,
      (c) History of recent or old testicular inflammation, (d) Tense vaginal hydrocele and (e)
      presence of potential female pathologies.

      Sample size calculation: With H0 denoting higher success rates for ICSI in absence of
      non-tense hydrocele and confidence level of 95% and interval of 5 the sample size was 30. The
      program used was Epi info 0.7.

      Randomization and allocation: Enrolled patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups. The
      first group (n=30) who have oligoasthenospermia with non-tense vaginal hydrocele (Study
      group) and the second group (n=30) who have oligoasthenospermia with no hydrocele group
      (Control group). Randomization was done by computer-generated serial numbers where each
      number was enveloped. Each number denotes a certain allocation group. Allocation was by
      alternate method and envelope opening did not change allocation.

      Methods: Males were assessed by genital examination, ultrasound and scrotal Doppler. Female
      partners were given long agonist stimulation protocols, Ovum pickup fertilization by sperms
      and then embryo transfer on day 5. Demographic data of both couples, duration of infertility,
      seminal parameters (WHO-2010) and results of ICSI in these couples were recorded.
