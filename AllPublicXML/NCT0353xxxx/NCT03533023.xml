  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of its kind to assess and test an intervention to improve biological
      rhythms and general health of shift workers, specifically first responders with San Diego
      Fire and Rescue. In a randomized control trial, investigators intend to measure the health
      impact of Time Restricted Feeding in emergency responders who work a 24-hour shift schedule.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to a control group of behavioral nutrition counseling
      (standard of care) or the intervention group of standard of care with the addition of
      adopting a 10 hour eating window for one year (TRF). For the first 3 months of intervention,
      participants will be monitored closely by the research team. For the following 9 months,
      participants will be in a self-monitored intervention period. Investigators will evaluate the
      impact of TRF on blood glucose levels, biomarkers, sleep/mood, and weight loss. These
      assessments will be made at baseline, at the end of the 12-week monitored intervention
      period, and every 3 months (months 6, 9, and 12) during the self-monitored intervention
      period for one year. Food/drink intake, activity, and sleep will be monitored with the
      smartphone myCircadianClock application (&quot;mCC app&quot;) throughout the study. A glucose monitor,
      a wrist-worn actigraphy device, and questionnaires will also be used during the study.
