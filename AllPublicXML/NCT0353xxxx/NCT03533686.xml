  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for single-sided deafness and conductive hearing loss includes bone
      anchored implants. Such devices have been well established as safe and effective, however
      require surgical procedure and lifelong use of an implant. Similar results can be achieved
      using the same auditory processors from the implantable system coupled to a headband with the
      processor worn at the impaired mastoid. While non-invasive, the use of a headband is
      complicated by discomfort with longterm use and stigma associated with the visibility of the
      device. The Adhear bone conduction system (MEDEL Corp) uses a novel longwear adhesive to
      allow for non-invasive use of the audio processor without the discomfort or stigma associated
      with traditional headband use. Bone conduction hearing systems have the ability to provide
      immediate and sustainable benefit in these specified hearing loss populations, but have seen
      varying levels of adoption and acceptance because of the limiting factors surrounding the
      need for surgery or use of a large and uncomfortable headband. This study will investigate
      the hearing outcomes and adoption and acceptance of the Adhear bone conduction system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Arms 1 and 2

          -  Adult English speaking patients

          -  Parents of English speaking subjects who do not speak English will not be specifically
             excluded. Due to the high incidence of English speaking children in Spanish speaking
