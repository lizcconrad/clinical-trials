  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study utilized a randomized controlled trial, conducted in a real-life setting,
      to determine whether, how, under which conditions, and for whom, infusing various levels of
      human-animal interaction (HAI) in a 4-week, university-based stress prevention program
      provides an effective approach to prevent negative ramifications of university students
      stress, promote student executive functioning and learning, while safeguarding animal
      welfare. This study will examine effects of sole exposure to evidence-based stress prevention
      content, hands-on HAI with registered PET Partner teams, or combinations thereof on students'
      moment-to-moment well-being and longer-term functioning in socioemotional, cognitive and
      physiological domains.This study will also develop a comprehensive coding system and measure
      the dynamic nature of behavior of participants, handlers and animals during university- based
      animal assisted activities, as well as the HAI environment. The data and analyses will then
      be utilized to inform the development of a quantitative measure to capture of the quality of
      human animal interaction in various settings to experimentally determine causal pathways
      underlying program effects on humans and animals.
