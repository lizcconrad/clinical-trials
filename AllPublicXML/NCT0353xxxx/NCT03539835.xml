      This study will begin to fill a knowledge gap by determine whether changes in kynurenine
      metabolism occur following Resistance Training (RT) and relate to reductions in inflammation
      and improved behavioral and physical function as this may identify potential targets for
      interventions to promote cancer recovery.

    <textblock>
      Interventions that reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines with resultant stimulation of kynurenine
      metabolism may be increasingly important in Breast Cancer Survivors (BCS) to prevent
      susceptibility to cancer associated fatigue, depression, and declines in muscle mass and
      function.

      There is emerging evidence that supports exercise as a non-pharmacological therapy to prevent
      cancer recurrence, sedentary behaviors, and obesity during cancer survivorship . It seems
      that interventions that include resistance training (RT) are most efficacious at reducing
      fatigue in BCS This study will begin to fill a knowledge gap by determine whether changes in
      kynurenine metabolism occur following RT and relate to reductions in inflammation and
      improved behavioral and physical function as this may identify potential targets for
      interventions to promote cancer recovery.

    <measure>Change in fatigue assessed by Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following dimensions: General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. Each scale contains four items for which the person had to indicate on a seven-point scale to what extent the particular statement applies to him or her. An equal number of items is worded in a positive and in a negative direction to counteract response tendencies.</description>
