    <textblock>
      Brief Summary: LM001 is a recombinant human Follicle Stimulating Hormone (r-hFSH) Injection,
      which is proposed for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). This is a randomized,
      open-label, two-period, two-crossover study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of
      recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone injection (LM001), compared with Gonal-F®,
      both given subcutaneously.
