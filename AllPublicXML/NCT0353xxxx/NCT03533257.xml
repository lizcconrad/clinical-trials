      The study is a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, multi-site, placebo-controlled study in
      volunteers with late mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early dementia due to Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, drug target
      engagement and neurobiological effects of treatment with AMX0035 over 24 weeks. The study is
      designed to yield deep phenotyping insight for the purposes of demonstrating the effects of
      AMX0035 on mechanistic targets of engagement and disease biology. The study will evaluate
      diverse disease-relevant markers and produce an informative dataset that will allow for
      evaluation and correlation of imaging-based markers, neurobiological changes, functional
      measures, and cognitive outcomes.
