  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of high grade glioma (HGG) surgery is to achieve gross total resection (GTR)
      without causing new neurological deficits1-8. Intraoperative navigated high resolution
      ultrasound (US) is a promising new tool to acquire real-time intraoperative images to
      localize and to resect gliomas9-12. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
      intraoperative guided surgery leads to a higher rate of GTR, when compared with standard
      non-ultrasound guided surgery.

      Study design:

      The US-GLIOMA study is a randomized controlled trial with blinded primary outcome measure.

      Study population:

      Fifty patients with newly diagnosed contrast enhancing presumed high grade glioma on first
      MRI scan.

      Intervention:

      The study consists of two treatment arms: non-ultrasound guided glioma resection
      (conventional treatment) versus ultrasound guided glioma resection (intervention) .

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

        -  Gross total resection (yes/no)

        -  Extent of resection (%)

        -  Neurological outcome (Karnofsky Performance Status)

        -  Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20 quality of life questionnaire)

        -  Surgery associated neurological deficits (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale)

        -  Adverse events (classified according to the US National Cancer Institute common toxicity
           criteria version 4.0)

        -  Survival time (days)
