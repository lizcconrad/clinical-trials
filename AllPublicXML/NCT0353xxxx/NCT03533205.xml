  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension occurs often and is associated with adverse patient outcomes such
      as stroke, myocardial infarction and renal injury.

      The aim of this study was to test the accuracy of a physiology-based machine-learning
      algorithm using continuous non-invasive measurement of the blood pressure waveform with the
      Nexfin® finger cuff during surgery.

        All adult patients undergoing surgery in the AMC were included in the study. Subjects were
        only excluded when technical problems or strong local vasoconstriction (i.e., cold fingers)
        prevented the Nexfin® non-invasive blood pressure finger cuff measurement. Subjects were
        not excluded for any other reason besides technical failure.
