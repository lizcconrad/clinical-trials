  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this investigation is to compare the effectiveness of the AAC Generative
      Language Intervention approach to an AAC Standard of Care condition on preschool sentence
      productions. All children will use existing AAC iPad applications.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis is that preschoolers receiving AAC Generative Language Intervention
      will create longer, more grammatically complete sentences compared with the Standard of Care
      condition. Specific Aim 1 compares these interventions for preschoolers with severe speech
      impairments and typical receptive language, and Specific Aim 2 does the same for children
      with Down syndrome. Specific Aim 3 tests for possible moderation of the intervention effect
      by age, dynamic assessment scores, sentence type, receptive language abilities, prior AAC
      use, sex, mental age, and disability. Aims 1 and 2 will be accomplished using randomized
      controlled trials.
