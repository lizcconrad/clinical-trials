  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This innovative research will address a gap in the literature involving the evaluation of the
      impact of an individualized family-centered mHealth application to enhance daily
      post-discharge communication following pediatric transplant. This proposal lays the
      foundation for future research with myFAMI (self-management intervention) at multiple
      pediatric transplant centers and builds the science from which to consider post discharge
      monitoring and decrease cost of care in other pediatric chronic illness populations.

    <description>All participants will receive the standard discharge education from their transplant and inpatient care team.
Patients who are assigned to the myFAMI group will also have the smartphone application downloaded onto either the family member's smartphone or a study-provided smartphone. Following discharge from the hospital, participants will use the smartphone application to answer nine daily questions regarding tracking family coping, transplant symptoms, family management of child transplant symptoms, and family-management difficulty with medication and follow-up regimen daily for the first 30 days following discharge.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Pediatric patients:

          1. Has undergone a heart, kidney, or liver transplant being discharged home from the
             hospital

          2. Has two eligible family members available to answer questions about the patient

        Family members will be eligible for participation upon meeting the following inclusion
        criteria:

          1. is English speaking (to date the instruments being used have been validated for
             English speaking participants only)

          2. is 18 years of age or older

          3. has a pediatric family member (&lt; 18 years old) who has undergone a heart, kidney, or
             liver transplant being discharged home from the hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria for the family members are:

          1. presence of significant communication or cognitive impairment that would preclude
             completion of questionnaires based on self-report; or

          2. the pediatric family member has experienced a previous transplant based on self
             report.

        Participants unable to speak and read English will be excluded due to the lack of resources
        to develop the app and communicate via FaceTime in different languages. We will recruit
        family members from three types of transplant populations to allow for sufficient sample in
        a limited time frame for this complex pediatric surgery and high-risk population.
