  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to combine epacadostat with radiation therapy (RT),
      avelumab, and bevacizumab in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). The investigators
      hypothesize that this combination provides a powerful synergy between RT and immune
      modulators to produce more robust anti-tumor immune response, induce tumor regression and
      improve overall survival.

    <measure>Safety run-in only: Safety and tolerability of the regimen as measured by dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in cycle 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of cycle 1 for all patients in Safety Run-In (estimated to be 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>6 patients will be enrolled at the 100 mg BID dose of epacadostat during the safety run-in
DLT will be defined as any of grade ≥3 non-hematological AEs considered at least possibly related to the drug regimen that occur during the first cycle of treatment, with severity graded according to the NCI/CTCAE 4.0, with the following exceptions (provided they are manageable with medication):
Rash
Fatigue
Diarrhea
Nausea</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II Cohort A only: Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>-Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of treatment start to date of first documented death event (death due to any cause) or date of censoring. If a patient has not had an event, OS will be censored at the date of last follow up</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II Cohort B only: Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>-Overall survival is defined as the time interval from date of treatment start to date of first documented death event (death due to any cause) or date of censoring. If a patient has not had an event, OS will be censored at the date of last follow up</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II only: Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 2 years after completion of treatment (estimated to be 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of time from start of treatment to radiographic progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first
Radiographic progression will be assessed using the RECIST 1.1. If the disease recurrence/progression assessment involves more than one date, the earliest date will be used as the event date. A patient will be censored at the date of the last radiographic disease assessment indicating a lack of disease progression, if any of the following occurs before documented disease progression: alive and lack evidence of progression at the end of study or at the time of analysis data cut-off, disease progression or death occurs right after missing data for a scheduled radiographic disease assessment, patient receives non-protocol treatment, or equivocal findings of recurrence - treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If recurrence is confirmed at the next scheduled assessment, the date of recurrence should be the earlier date when recurrence was suspected</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II only: Neurologic functions as measured by the NANO scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>Neurologic Function in Neuro-Oncology (NANO) scale is a scoring assessment based on direct observation and testing performed during clinical evaluation
There are 9 domains (gait, strength, ataxia, sensation, visual fields, facial strength, language, level of consciousness, and behavior
The score defines overall response criteria
Each domain is subdivided into 3 or 4 levels of function with scores based on discrete quantifiable measures. Thus, levels of function for each domain range from 0 to 2 or 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates normal function, while the highest score indicates the most severe level of deficit for that domain. Levels of function are distinguished by significant and measurable differences in order to avoid misinterpretation of subtle or nonspecific changes</description>

             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
