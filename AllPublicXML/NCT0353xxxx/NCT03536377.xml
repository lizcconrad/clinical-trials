  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complications associated with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are numerous;
      reducing the quality of life for the patient and consuming a considerable portion of
      healthcare finances.

      The Health of the Nation (HotN) 2011 study reported that 50% of the Barbadian population
      &gt;65years old had a diagnosis of T2DM and that two-thirds of the population were overweight -
      which is a risk factor for the development of T2DM.

      Encouraged by the success of the Counterpoint study in the United Kingdom (UK), the Barbados
      Diabetes Reversal Study 1 (BDRS1) was established using a similar protocol; the aim of which
      was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a very low calorie diet to reverse T2DM in
      Barbados. At the end of the 8-week intervention period, the 25 participants had achieved an
      average weight loss of 10.1kg (22lbs). This was accompanied by an increase in the number of
      participants whose fasting blood sugars were now within normal range despite being off of
      their diabetes medication; and a decrease in the number of participants taking blood pressure
      medication. Participants transitioned to a solid diet over a 4-week period, with guidance on
      health dietary habits and regular exercise routines. The benefits accrued during the
      intervention phase were preserved at the end of the transition period.

      We now propose the Barbados Diabetes Remission Study 2 (BDRS2) as a sustainable community
      intervention - utilizing the local church as the community site. We hypothesize that this
      will enhance reach while reducing the cost of the study and will also facilitate the
      structures necessary for the social support of the participant.
