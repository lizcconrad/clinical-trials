      Prospective multicenter observational clinical study on a dietary regimen in obese patients
      scheduled for bariatric surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study population: 25 patients with morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg / m2) or severe obesity (BMI
      35 to 39.9 kg / m2) , with two or more comorbidities, scheduled for bariatric surgery within
      3 months, and who will start treatment with the multidisciplinary weight loss program (PnK
      Method) based on diet, exercise and psychological support.

      Patients will be followed-up for 3 months, with the following controls: pre-selection,
      baseline, month 1, month 2, month 3, and control when hospital discharge.

      The treatment schedule in these patients will be as follows: a very low calorie ketogenic
      diet for at least 1 month or until losing 10% of the weight, and then, a low calorie diet
      with gradual reintroduction of natural foods for 2 months, until surgery.

      The investigators will obtain retrospective data from 25 patients treated with the standard
      diet who met the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as the patients in this study and who
      similarly resemble in age, sex and BMI, for comparative analysis (control group).
