      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term
      treatment with 30 mg/kg of casimersen or golodirsen in patients with Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy (DMD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Completed a clinical trial evaluating casimersen or golodirsen, per protocol.

          -  Is able to understand and comply with all the study requirements and, if under 18
             years of age, had as (a) parent(s) or legal guardian(s) who is (are) able to
             understand and comply with all the study requirements.

          -  Is willing to provide informed assent (if applicable) and has (a) parent(s) or legal
             guardian(s) who is (are) willing to provide written informed consent for the patient
             to participate in the study.

          -  If sexually active, agrees to use a male condom during such activity for the entire
             duration of the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. The sexual
             partner must also use a medically acceptable form of contraceptive (example, female
             oral contraceptives) during this time frame.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A medical condition that could, in the Investigator's opinion, adversely affect the
             safety of the patient, make it unlikely that the course of treatment would be
             completed, or impair the assessment of study results.

          -  Any patient who, in the Investigator's opinion, seems unable/unwilling to comply with
             the study procedures.
