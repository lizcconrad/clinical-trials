      Rationale: Serum eye drops (SEDs) are used to treat patients with severe signs and symptoms
      of dry eyes and other corneal defects. Serum is used in severe ophthalmic cases where
      conventional treatment and/or eye drops (artificial tears) have insufficient effect. The use
      of SEDs in dry eye patients usually has a rapid effect. Most patients claim the effect to be
      instantaneous, and most symptoms improve within 48-72 hours.

      There is evidence suggesting that substances in serum may help in the healing of epithelial
      defects, such as epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, fibronectin, and/or
      vitamin A. However, the precise serum factor responsible for alleviating the patient's
      complaints is currently not known.

      SEDs are considered as a blood product under EU blood legislation (Directive 2002/98/EC), as
      well as in New Zealand and Australia. Commonly, autologous SEDs are used, but they are
      replaced more and more by allogeneic SEDs prepared from donor serum. Allogeneic SEDs are
      derived from healthy voluntary, non-remunerated male donors with blood group AB, and have the
      benefit of blood bank controlled quality. They can be delivered from stock and are therefore
      quickly available for each patient.

      For application of eye drops, generally administration systems with a drop size of 40 to 50
      µl are used, further on referred to as conventional sized eye drops. From previous studies
      done with medicinal eye drops, it has been shown that smaller eye drops, so called micro
      drops, can be just as effective and sometimes even superior to conventional drops for
      treatment of eye disease. If micro drops are just as effective or maybe even superior to
      conventional sized eye drops is currently unknown for the use of SEDs. This study will
      compare the feasibility and effectiveness of allogeneic serum micro eye drops using the
      mu-Drop applicator to the conventional sized allogeneic eye drops using the Meise applicator.
      Both systems have a closed manufacturing system.

      Objective: The main objective is to determine whether the administration of allogeneic serum
      micro eye drops is non-inferior in terms of effectiveness and safety as compared to the
      conventional sized drops.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the improvement in OSDI score by
      using SEDs (OSDI score after treatment minus OSDI score before treatment), independent of the
      drop size, showing non-inferiority for the use of micro drops as compared to conventional
      sized drops.

        Subjects with severe signs and symptoms of dry eyes. Age 16 years or older. Punctate
        staining of the cornea. Expected to benefit from SEDs. Not previously treated with SEDs.
