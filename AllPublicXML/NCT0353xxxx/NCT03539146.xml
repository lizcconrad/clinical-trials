  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coffee processing byproducts, such as coffee cascara (outer skin and pulp of the coffee
      berry), have potential health promoting properties due to the presence of bioactive
      compounds. Its use as a novel food ingredient is a means of valorizing this fractioin in the
      elaboration of functional yogurts. The addition of cascara extract in yogurt affects its
      texture quality. The addition of dietary fiber can help regain the structure of the yogurt's
      gel. However, secondary gastrointestinal effects associated with acute fiber ingestion must
      be considered.The aim of this clinical trial is to study the gastrointestinal tolerance,
      satiation and sensory acceptance of yogurts containing both coffee cascara extract and
      different doses of commercial soluble dietary fiber.

      Forty healthy volunteers will be recruited and distributed into 4 groups following a
      randomized, blind, crossover design. Yogurt formulations will be administered two hours after
      the ingestion of a standardized breakfast, as a snack. Yogurt formulations include:

        -  Control cascara yogurt with 0% dietary fiber.

        -  Cascara yogurt with 3% dietary fiber.

        -  Cascara yogurt with 7% dietary fiber.

        -  Cascara yogurt with 13% dietary fiber.

      The study will be conducted in 4 sessions, with at least 48h of washout period between
      treatment days. Data on gastrointestinal tolerance, satiation and sensory acceptance will be
      taken on the same day of the treatment using online surveys.

    <intervention_model_description>Forty volunteers will be randomly distributed in 4 groups that will follow a sequence of treatments according to a balanced latin square design. Treatment days involve the ingestion in acute conditions of a yogurt formulation with a different dietary fiber dose:
Cascara control yogurt with 0% dietary fiber.
Cascara yogurt with 3% dietary fiber.
Cascara yogurt with 7% dietary fiber.
Cascara yogurt with 13% dietary fiber.
Subjects will have a 48h washout period between treatment days to avoid carry-over effects.</intervention_model_description>
