      Cosmeceuticals are an emerging market within dermatology and the growth of natural products
      and derivatives of natural products has accelerated in use within the field. Here the
      investigators aimed to study the microbial and cosmetic effects of Synoxyl AZ, the trade name
      for topical acetyl zingerone (AZ), a novel compound designed based on Zingerone and curcumin.

      Cosmeceuticals are an emerging market within dermatology and the growth of natural products
      and derivatives of natural products has accelerated in use within the field. Here the
      investigators aim to study Synoxyl AZ, the trade name for topical acetyl zingerone (AZ), a
      novel compound designed based on Zingerone and curcumin.

      Both curcumin and Zingerone are from the Zingiberacea family of plants (also known as the
      ginger family). Both have been widely studied and noted to have antibacterial effects and
      promote skin health effects. Curcumin has been studied widely in recent years due to various
      microbial effects. AZ is a derivative that is similar to both Zingerone and curcumin and has
      been noted to have many different activities including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and
      antioxidant functions. However, there are no studies looking at how it modulates the skin
      cosmetically or the superficial microbiome.

      The aim of this study was to compare the cosmetic effects of AZ to a vehicle over an 8-week
      period.
