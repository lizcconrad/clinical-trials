  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, explorative phase II study
      is to identify the impact of (neo)adjuvant denosumab on the systemic immunity and local
      immunologic microenvironment in postmenopausal patients with HER2 negative non-metastatic
      primary breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, postmenopausal patients with stage T1c + grade 3, stage II or III,
      HER2-negative breast cancer, which are planned to undergo surgery followed by adjuvant AC-T
      chemotherapy, are randomized between no denosumab, denosumab low dosing and denosumab high
      dosing. Denosumab administration will start one week before surgery and continue until the
      last chemotherapy cycle.
