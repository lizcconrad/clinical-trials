  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research is to conduct a small matched cluster control trial of
      an intervention designed to address reproductive coercion and unintended pregnancy (ARCHES -
      Addressing Reproductive Coercion within Healthcare Settings) adapted to the Kenyan cultural
      and family planning healthcare context (ARCHES Kenya) so as to provide initial data regarding
      acceptability, feasibility and efficacy in this high-need LMIC context.

      The project consortium will implement the ARCHES Kenya model across 6 Family Health Options
      Kenya clinics in Nairobi, Kenya. A matched-pair cluster control design including 600 female
      FP clients ages 15-49 years (inclusive of 360 clients age 15-24 years) will be utilized to
      evaluate this intervention. Baseline data will be collected prior to routine FP service
      delivery, with a short exit survey conducted immediately following the clients' FP
      appointment (ARCHES or standard FP counseling will be provided during this visit). Follow-up
      data will be collected at 3 and 6-months post-intervention. Qualitative data will be
      collected from intervention providers (n=12) regarding implementation via weekly technical
      assistance sessions during the first three months, and then monthly, regarding acceptability
      and feasibility of integrating ARCHES into routine FP counseling, including barriers and
      facilitators to implementation, and any issues with maintaining fidelity to the ARCHES model.
      Structured interviews with select providers (n=12) will also be conducted at 3-months
      post-training to delve further into these issues. Structured interviews with intervention
      participants reporting experience of RC in the past 3 months on the baseline survey (20
      participants ages 15-24, 15 ages 25-49; total n=35) will be conducted at 3-months follow-up
      to assess their experience of the intervention; perceived utility of the messages, care and
      materials; barriers to utilizing messaging and materials; and suggestions for improvement.
      Analyses specific to participants ages 15-24 will provide findings to guide consideration of
      ARCHES as an effective strategy to improve reproductive health and reduce GBV among
      adolescents in the region. The project consortium will engage Government of Kenya officials,
      IPPF executive directors and IPPF member associations across the federation to pave the way
      for the future roll out of this approach in other low and middle-income country (LMIC)
      contexts.

    <intervention_model_description>The ARCHES Kenya study will take place in six IPPF-affiliated Family Health Options Kenya (FHOK) clinics in Nairobi, Kenya or surrounding smaller cities for all clients receiving voluntary FP counseling. The intervention study will involve a matched cluster control trial. Three clinics will serve as the intervention sites and three other clinics matched on client volume and demographics, clinic structure and staffing will serve as matched comparison sites and will not receive the intervention.</intervention_model_description>
