  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to find one's way in the world is known as wayfinding. Many older adults who live
      in senior communities, such as independent living and assisted living residences, find
      wayfinding very challenging. Often times, these communities are not designed in a way that
      helps people find their way very easily. When people cannot find their way, they can get
      lost, be dependent upon others for getting out and about, or even be afraid to leave their
      rooms. The purpose of this study is to find out if distinctive signs and decorative elements,
      along with a special type of education called Spaced-Retrieval education, help residents in
      these communities find their way more effectively. Twelve senior communities will be assigned
      by chance to one of three conditions, including: 1) control - no change (the community stays
      the same); 2) signs and decorative elements enhanced; and 3) signs, decorative elements, and
      special education added. After agreeing to be in the study, the participants will be asked to
      find their way to certain places in their community four times over a year. Some people will
      be asked to participate in educational sessions on wayfinding. In addition, some people will
      be asked to wear a location tracker, (like a fitness tracker), for four weeks during the
      year. How well people find their way, along with how much they travel about within the
      communities, will be compared between the three groups. It is hypothesized that those in the
      communities with special signs and decorative elements will find their way more effectively
      than those in the control communities. It is also hypothesized that participants in the
      communities with the special education intervention will find their way better than those
      without the education. Finally, it is hypothesized that participants in the communities with
      signs and cues and education will travel about further distances than those in the control
      communities. The results of the study can help people who have a tendency to get lost find
      their way more effectively in their community, and this could result in more independence.

    <textblock>
      The ability to locate and travel successfully to a destination, known as wayfinding, is a
      significant problem for older adults with cognitive disorders. Relocating to a new residence
      such as independent or assisted living is a time in which older adults with cognitive
      problems are most vulnerable to experiencing wayfinding problems. Often these communities are
      not designed to facilitate wayfinding as they are complex, confusing, and lack
      distinctiveness. Wayfinding problems can cause individuals' worlds to shrink, leading to a
      smaller life space (the spatial extent of travel within the community), decreased engagement,
      and dependence upon others for activities of daily living. The overall goal of the proposed
      project is to assess the contribution of salient visual cues and Spaced Retrieval (SR) on
      wayfinding ability and life space in older adults with wayfinding problems who live in senior
      communities. Salient cues, such as vivid pictures, statues and bright, distinctive signage
      can make senior residential communities more memorable and distinctive. This study has three
      specific aims: a) to examine the effect of salient cues with and without SR on wayfinding
      ability initially and over time in older adults who have wayfinding deficits in senior
      communities; and b) To determine the effects of salient visual cues and SR on life space; and
      c) to determine subject characteristics that are most amenable to the intervention; wand
      which subject characteristics place persons at risk for less responsiveness to the
      intervention so that the intervention can be appropriately targeted. There are three arms to
      the clinical trial to which nine care communities will be randomly assigned, including Arm 1
      (control; no change to the care community); Arm 2 (colorful and familiar objects and signage
      placed within the care community); and Arm 3 (Arm 2 cues plus SR). Participants will be
      individuals within the communities who exhibit problems finding their way. They will be asked
      to find their way repeatedly to specific destinations over a period of a year. Wayfinding
      performance, including how fast the participants find the test location and the errors they
      make compared between study Arms. Life space will also be measured and compared between Arms.
      It is hypothesized that individuals who are in care communities which are enhanced with
      salient cues will improve wayfinding when compared to care communities without salient cues.
      In addition, Spaced Retrieval, which is an evidence-based memory strategy, is hypothesized to
      positively influence subjects' use of the cues and improve wayfinding performance. Finally,
      it is hypothesized that wayfinding ability will correlate with life space. The long term
      goals of this research are to test an evidence based intervention to enhance senior
      residences so that older adults who have wayfinding problems can more easily learn and
      remember their environments so that they can maintain independence.

    <measure>Change in Wayfinding Speed at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Wayfinding speed is a single value, and is calculated using the following formula: v=(total distance) / (total time) for the subject to find his/her way from the starting to end point of the route. Wayfinding speed will be compared between baseline and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in wayfinding errors at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Wayfinding errors are calculated by dividing the number of wrong turns (errors) made on a route by the number of possible turns. This value will be compared between baseline and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Life Space at 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Life space is defined as the spatial extent of mobility within an environment, and varies from a small life space (limited to one's room) to a large life space (travels outside of the care community). Life space will be measured using a modified version of Tinetti's Nursing Home Life-Space Diameter and scores will be compared between baseline and 12 months.</description>

    <description>For a sub-sample, an electronic monitoring device will provide data regarding the life space of participants. The location of the participants will be mapped onto Tinetti's life space zones and the extent of life space will be compared between baseline and the end of the study at 12 months.</description>

    <description>Salient cues are those that capture the individual's attention. Information that is complex, novel, and difficult to identify takes more processing resources than those that are simple and familiar.

    <ipd_description>The proposed research will include data from approximately 138 subjects from nine senior living communities. The final dataset will include de-identified data, including certain demographics, wayfinding data, and cognitive tests. We will make the data and associated documentation (code book, description of variables) available to users in Scholarworks. ScholarWorks@GVSU is an open-access repository maintained by the Grand Valley State University (GVSU) Libraries. It is anticipated that the data would be available after the PI has published the final results, or within two years of the completion of the study. The repository will have the de-identified data set, along with a description of each variable and any statistical formulas used to create the variable.</ipd_description>
