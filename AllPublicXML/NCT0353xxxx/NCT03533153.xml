  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemia/reperfusion injury in myocardial infarction can induce mass release of oxygen free
      radicals, trigger inflammatory reaction, and ultimately lead to myocardial remodeling and
      irreversible cardiac function decline. Microvascular obstruction (MVO) and haemorrhage are
      common pathological alternations in myocardium post primary PCI, which provide strong
      prognostic information for STEMI patients. Till now, there is no treatment to be used in
      clinical practice to reduce myocardium MVO and haemorrhage. With the deep research on stem
      cells, it is found that the benefits of MSC transplants for myocardium infarction may be
      achieved by its paracrine effect. Meanwhile, the immunoregulatory effect of MSC has been
      widely reported in multiply immune disease. Therefore, the applicant proposed the hypothesis
      that MSC can play an effective role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory response,
      inhibiting microvascular obstruction and haemorrhage. Intravenous injection of MSC will be
      used in patients with STEMI within 12 hours post primary PCI. The primary endpoint and safety
      endpoint are recorded in the one year follow up to assess the clinical outcome of intravenous
      MSC treatment.

    <time_frame>at Day 4 to Day 7 after PCI.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) at Day 4 to Day 7 after presentation with STEMI on a 3.0-T scanner.The change in Microvascular obstruction (MVO) and intramyocardial hemorrhage would be followed up. MVO was defined (and quantified) as hypoenhancement within infarcted myocardium, as determined from LGE images, and was included in the total infarct size. Myocardial oedema was quantified using semi-automatic thresholding, defining AAR as enhancement within myocardium of signal intensity &gt; 2 standard deviations (SDs) above that of a region of interest contoured in remote myocardium. Hypoenhanced areas within the AAR were regarded as intramyocardial haemorrhage (IMH). The MSI was calculated as 100 × [(AAR - infarct size)/AAR]. Infarct size, MVO, AAR and IMH were expressed as %LVM and LV volumes were indexed to body surface area.</description>

    <description>Laboratory of Stem Cell of Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical School, is able to provide types of Good Manufacture Practice (GMP) level stem cells and stem cell-based medicinal products. Clinical-grade WJ-MSC primary cells are cultured to 4~ 8 passages, and the surface markers (CD90+, CD105+, CD45-, CD31-, CD117-) are identified by flow cytometry. WJ-MSC cells are trypsinized and resuspended in the wash buffer of CTSTMD PBS (+Ca2+, +Mg2+). Within 2 hours after enzyme digestion, WJ-MSC cells are shipped to coronary care unit (CCU) and injected into the body.</description>
