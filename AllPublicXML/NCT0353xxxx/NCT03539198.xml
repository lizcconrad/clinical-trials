    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR) using iRECIST 1.1 criteria for locoregional arm</measure>
    <time_frame>From start date of immunotherapy to disease progression; up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using iRECIST 1.1 criteria, and will be evaluated for both the lesion(s) treated with SBRT, referred to as &quot;Target lesion (+SBRT+Nivo), as well as the lesion(s) not treated with SBRT (if applicable), referred to as &quot;Target lesion (+Nivo only)&quot;, per the prescribed treatment. The primary endpoint for the locoregional arm will be considered met if the assumption and desired outcome are achieved for ORR in the &quot;Target lesion(s) (+SBRT+Nivo)&quot;. Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation, recorded between the start date of immunotherapy and the date of progression using iRECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>

    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using iRECIST 1.1 criteria, and will be evaluated for both the lesion(s) treated with SBRT, referred to as &quot;Target lesion (+SBRT+Nivo), as well as the lesion(s) not treated with SBRT, referred to as &quot;Target lesion (+Nivo only)&quot;, per the prescribed treatment. The primary endpoint for the metastatic arm will be considered met if the assumption and desired outcome are achieved for ORR in the &quot;Target lesion(s) (+Nivo only)&quot; since these are the lesions we hypothesize will have an augmented response from proton SBRT through the abscopal effect. Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation, recorded between the start date of immunotherapy and the date of progression using iRECIST 1.1 criteria.</description>

          -  Known HIV, hepatitis B or C infection.

             therapy apart from the prescribed treatment per protocol.

          -  Other active non-head and neck malignancy &lt;1 year prior to registration. If there is a
             history of prior distinct malignancy, they must not be receiving chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, or immunotherapy for their other disease at the time of protocol
