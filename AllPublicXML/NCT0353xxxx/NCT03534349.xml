      The investigator investigated the effect of lower limb flexibility on functional performance
      of children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

    <textblock>
      Thirty children whose functional levels were in 1 or 2 according to the Brooke Lower
      Extremity Functional Classification Scale were included in the study. Flexibilities of
      hamstrings, hip flexors, tensor fascia latae, and gastrocnemius muscles were evaluated in
      dominant lower limb. Popliteal angle test, hip flexor flexibility test, tensor fascia latae
      flexibility test and gastrocnemius flexibility test were used for flexibility asssessments.
      Functional performance was assessed with 6 Minute Walk Test (6 MWT) and Timed Performance
      Tests. The correlation between the flexibility of lower limb muscles' and performance tests
      were examined.

    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is a standard test recently used to evaluate functional capacity in neuromuscular diseases, and found to be a safe and valid test that can be performed in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Performance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Timed performance tests such as 10 m walk, Gower's (from supine position to stand up), ascending/descending 4 steps were also performed. During these tests, the child's performance was recorded in seconds.</description>
