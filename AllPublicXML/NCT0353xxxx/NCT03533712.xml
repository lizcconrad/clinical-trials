  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2016 WHO antenatal care guidelines stated that pregnant women in undernourished
      populations should receive fortified balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplements to reduce the
      risk of stillbirth and small-for-gestational-age birth. However, acceptable supplements and
      delivery channels must be determined for different contexts.

      The present proposal therefore will 1) perform a formative study to identify the most
      suitable (acceptability and utilization) BEP supplement for pregnant women in rural Burkina
      Faso (phase 1 and 2) and 2) evaluate the efficacy of this supplement to improve birth weight,
      fetal and infant growth (phase 3). The nutritional composition of the BEP supplement was
      established during an expert convening at the BMGF in September 2016. Private sector partners
      will prepare the supplements in the selected forms with the recommended nutrient composition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy remains a challenging period in the life of many women in low- and middle-income
      countries. Maternal mortality remains high and many newborns suffer from premature delivery
      and /or gestational growth retardation both in length and in weight accumulation.

      The 2016 WHO antenatal care guidelines stated that pregnant women in undernourished
      populations should receive fortified balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplements to reduce the
      risk of stillbirth and small-for-gestational-age birth. However, acceptable supplements and
      delivery channels must be determined for different contexts.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a fortified BEP supplement for
      pregnant and lactating women to improve birth weight, fetal and infant growth.

      This research includes 3 phases:

        -  Phase 1: Formative research to identify preferred product types of a fortified BEP
           supplement;

        -  Phase 2: Formative research with an 8-week home-feeding trial to determine the
           acceptability of a fortified BEP supplement for longer-term consumption.

        -  Phase 3: A community-based, individually randomized efficacy trial of the fortified BEP
           food supplement including 1,776 pregnant and lactating women aimed at testing 2
           hypothesis: supplementing pregnant and lactating women with a fortified BEP supplement
           will improve fetal growth; improving fetal growth will have a positive effect on health
           and growth during infancy.

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention study will be an individually randomized efficacy trial. Pregnant women will be individually and randomly allocated to an intervention and a control group using a pre-defined randomization schedule. The intervention group will receive daily a fortified BEP supplement to be consumed under supervision for the duration of pregnancy. Both control and intervention group will receive the standard iron and folic acid tablet through the regular ante natal care program. After birth, mothers will be re-randomized individually to either a lactation supplement group or a control. The participants of the intervention and the control group will be assigned to intervention and control to have a balanced allocation.</intervention_model_description>
