          -  Participant has a positive test result for alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cocaine metabolites, opiates, cannabinoids, or cotinine, at Screening
             or Check-in.

          -  Participant has a positive screening test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C
             antibody, and/or human immunodeficiency virus antibodies.

          -  Participant has any surgical or medical condition that, in the judgment of the

             excretion of the study drug.

          -  Participant has used any medication (prescription or over-the-counter [OTC], including
             health supplements and herbal remedies, with the exception of acetaminophen (as
