      This study seeks to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NA-83 in subjects with mild cognitive
      impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment (&quot;MCI&quot;) is defined as the &quot;symptomatic pre-dementia stage&quot; on the
      continuum of cognitive decline. Currently, no medications have proven effective for MCI.
      Preclinical experiments indicate that NA-831 is an endogenous small molecule that exhibits
      neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and cognitive protective properties across a range of disease
      models. NA-831 has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers. This study
      seeks to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NA-83 in 126 subjects with mild cognitive
      impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease
