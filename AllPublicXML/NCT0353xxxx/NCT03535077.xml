      The goal of the SFI is to provide non-invasive information about tissue remodeling occurring
      during melanocytic transition and atypia development in the skin. SFI analyzes the topical
      staining of the skin surface using the ORL-1 dye to reveal the presence of remodeling in the
      skin, together with the visible feature characteristics. The system provides a biometric
      score corresponding to the dye staining, a structural score, and a composite SFI score to
      quantify the presence of tissue remodeling and the process of melanocytic transition in the
      skin.
