  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

      To test a new intervention for sleep disturbance among hematopoietic cell transplant
      survivors. About 50 hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivors will participate in this
      intervention.

      Preliminary Steps: To conduct qualitative interviews with patients, caregivers, and
      clinicians regarding sleep disturbance in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivors and
      on preferences for a new mHealth intervention for sleep disturbance. About 30 individuals (10
      HCT survivors, 10 caregivers and 5-10 clinicians) will participate in this part of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will collect qualitative interview data from HCT survivors, caregivers, and
      clinicians to inform the development of a new mHealth intervention. Then, this new
      intervention will be developed by adapting existing interventions that were originally
      designed for other cancer and non-cancer populations.

      Next, HCT survivors will be randomized to one of two online interventions for sleep
      disturbance: To the mHealth stepped-care intervention - or - To the educational control
      condition.

      Intervention participants will complete a baseline survey via the internet about their
      demographics, health, and well-being. The baseline survey also includes questions about their
      sleep and will take about 20 minutes to complete.

      Both interventions are delivered online via a tablet device. Participants will be asked to
      complete a follow-up survey via the internet about their sleep at 30 and 60 days after
      starting the intervention. They will wear a small actigraph device on their wrist throughout
      the 60-day intervention period. Participants will be provided with an actigraph charging
      cable and dock as well as a small telemetry device that will be used to download the
      actigraph data.

      After the intervention, participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire to provide
      feedback on the intervention and participate in a post-intervention interview with a member
      of the study team.

    <description>The study will be considered acceptable if 50% of eligible patients approached for study participation sign consent and if &gt; 50% of the mHealth stepped-care intervention group participants report that they are at least &quot;mostly satisfied&quot; with the intervention on a validated satisfaction scale. That is, at least half will report an average score of ≥ 3 on a scale of 1 to 4 on this instrument.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Sleep Disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep disturbance will be operationalized by scores on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and sleep efficiency (the percentage of time spent in bed that is spent asleep). For secondary efficacy analyses participants will be categorized as having sleep disturbance if their Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score is ≥ 5 (for subjectively-measured sleep disturbance) and if their sleep efficiency is &lt;85% (for objectively-measured sleep disturbance).</description>

    <description>Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) survivors, caregivers and clinicians will participate in this part of the study. HCT survivor participants will be asked to nominate and provide contact information for the person who was their primary caregiver before, during, or after their HCT hospitalization. All participants will be asked to participate in either an in-person or telephone interview that will last approximately 1 hour. The interview will be digitally audio-recorded and will ask questions on the trajectory of sleep disturbance in HCT recipients and strategies to manage common barriers to quality sleep, as well as discuss the planned intervention for sleep disturbance in HCT survivors.</description>
