  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of a 0.03% chlorhexidine (CHX) and 0.05% cetyl pyridinium
      chloride (CPC) mouth rinse, as an adjunct to professionally and patient-administered
      mechanical plaque removal, in the treatment of peri-implant mucositis.

      Material and Methods: Patients displaying peri-implant mucositis in, at least, one implant
      were included in this randomized, double-blinded, clinical trial. Subjects received a
      conventional professional prophylaxis (at baseline and 6-month visits) and were instructed to
      regular oral hygiene practices and to rinse, twice daily, during one year, with a 0.03% CHX
      and 0.05% CPC mouth rinse, or a placebo. Clinical, radiographic and microbiological data were
      recorded at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Disease resolution was defined as the absence of
      bleeding on probing (BOP). Repeated measures ANOVA, Student-t and chi square tests were used.
