  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, dose-ranging
      study to characterize the efficacy and safety of BNZ-1 administered by slow IV push weekly
      for 3 months to adults diagnosed with moderate to severe alopecia areata, defined as having a
      &gt;50% loss of terminal hair on the scalp. The study has three periods:

        -  30-Day Screening Period

        -  3-Month Treatment Period

        -  3-Month Follow-up Period The study will be conducted at approximately 15-20 clinical
           sites in the United States.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must have a diagnosis of moderate to severe AA defined as the presence of ≥50% total
             terminal hair loss at baseline as measured using the SALT score for &gt; 6 months, but
             &lt;10 yrs. Includes Alopecia Totalis and Alopecia Universalis

          2. Patients may be naïve to treatment or have been treated with intralesional (IL)
             steroids or other treatments for AA, with a washout of at least 30 days or 5 times the
             elimination half-life prior to Day 1.

          3. Prior treatment with a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (e.g., tofacitinib, ruxolitnib) is
             allowed, but patients considered refractory to a JAK inhibitor are excluded from this
             trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        e subjects from this study if any of the following criteria are met:

          1. Clinically relevant hepatic, neurological, pulmonary, ophthalmological, endocrine,
             renal, or other major systemic disease making implementation of the protocol or
             interpretation of the study results difficult, or that would put the subject at risk
             by participating in the study in the opinion of the Investigator. Other active
             dermatologic conditions, including but not limited to vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, or
             non-scalp psoriasis are not exclusionary.

          2. Patients with active inflammatory skin disease on the scalp, including but not limited
             to psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis or folliculitis, which cannot be adequately
             controlled prior to screening.

          3. Ongoing treatment with an immune system modulator or suppressant that cannot be
             discontinued prior to screening and at least 30 days or 5-times the elimination
             half-life prior to treatment.

          4. Any ongoing topical treatment for alopecia areata

          5. History of or currently active primary or secondary immunodeficiency.

          6. Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial infection, or other infection
             (including latent tuberculosis [TB] unless treatment is documented or atypical
             mycobacterial disease [but excluding fungal infection of nail beds, minor upper
             respiratory tract infection, and minor skin conditions]), or any major episode of
             infection that required hospitalization or treatment with IV antibiotics within 60
             days of study drug administration or oral antibiotics within 30 days prior to study
             drug administration.

          7. Received other investigational products or therapy in the 60 days prior to study drug
             administration.
