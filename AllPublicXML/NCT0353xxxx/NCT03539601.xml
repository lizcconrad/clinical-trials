  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4-week study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of crisaborole ointment 2%;
      crisaborole vehicle; topical corticosteroid and topical calcineurin inhibitor, applied twice
      daily (BID) in subjects who are at least 2 years of age with mild-moderate AD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 600 subjects will be enrolled in the study, of which at least 150 subjects aged
      2-6; at least 140 subjects aged 7-11; at least 120 subjects aged 12-17 and up to 90 subjects
      will be adults. Subjects must have mild-moderate AD involving at least 5% treatable %BSA
      assessed on baseline/Day 1. Treatable %BSA will be defined as the percent of a subject's
      total body surface area that is AD involved, excluding the scalp.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized at the Baseline/Day 1 visit. Randomization will be
      stratified by eligibility for TCS or TCI treatment as per national approved labels. Cohort 1
      will be for subjects who are eligible for TCS therapy, and Cohort 2 will be for subjects who
      are not eligible for TCS therapy but eligible for TCI therapy. The investigational products
      will be applied BID for 28 days to the Treatable body surface area (BSA) identified at
      Baseline/Day 1.

      The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline in the Eczema Area and
      Severity Index (EASI) total score at Day 29.

      For the efficacy comparison of crisaborole versus vehicle, subjects from both Cohort 1 and
      Cohort 2 are included in the analysis, adjusted for cohort effect. For the efficacy
      comparison of crisaborole versus TCS, only subjects from Cohort 1 are included in the
      analysis. For the comparison of crisaborole versus TCI, only subjects from Cohort 2 are
      included in the analysis.

      Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at the investigator site by a clinical
      assessor blinded to treatment assignment.

      Scheduled study visits for all subjects will occur at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, Day 8, Day
      15, Day 22, Day 29 (End of treatment/Early termination). A follow up telephone call will be
      made by site staff to the subjects/subject's legally acceptable guardian(s) on Day 36 and Day
      60.

The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life.

    <description>The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) quantifies the severity of a subject's AD based on both severity of lesion clinical signs and the percent of body surface area (BSA) affected. EASI is a composite scoring of the degree of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored separately) for each of four body regions, with adjustment for the percent of BSA involved for each body region and for the proportion of the body region to the whole body. Time to improvement in EASI75 is defined the time interval between the administration of first dose of study drug till improvement of ≥75% in EASI score.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Childrens Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) (for Subjects 4-15 years and older, completed by the subject with the help the caregiver, if needed), by scheduled time points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 (end of treatment/early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>The CDLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question is evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>
