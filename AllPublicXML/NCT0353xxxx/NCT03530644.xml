      Subjects will be optical screened at baseline visit. Study comprises two in-clinic visits.
      Subjects will arrive in a fasting state and and oral glucose bolus will be administered.

      Subjects will during each of two study days be subjected to optical readings on two different
      device prototypes. During each of the study days, FGM readings, capillary blood samples and
      arterialized venous blood samples will be collected.

    <description>Two in-clinic visits each of a duration of 7-8 hours are scheduled for each subject. Subjects will enter clinic in fasting state and will receive an oral glucose bolus. Glucose excursion is followed with frequent capillary and venous blood samples along with FGM readings. In parallel, optical glucose data from two different prototypes of the investigational medical device will be collected.
Optical glucose readings will be masked to the subjects.
Collected data will be used to generate individual calibration models capable of predicting tissue glucose. Models from the two devices will be validated on independent data sets using MARD, ISUP and Consensus Error Grid endpoint measures.</description>
