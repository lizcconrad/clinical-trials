      This clinical trial aims at studying the budesonide metabolism of women. The objective is to
      identify analisis strategies to detect oral administration of Budesonide in women. This is
      done in order to use them in the accredited laboratories of the Worl Anti-Doping Agency
      (WADA).

      This study will also help defining the referential levels of this way of administration.
      Also, it will be used to test the safety and tolerability of the medication used.

      For this, will be collected at precise times after the oral administration of the medication,
      the concentrations in urines of the metabolit o budesonide : the 6bêta-hidroxi-budesonide, of
      budesonide itself, of other metabolites. This concentrations will then be comparated to the
      ones in the basal samples of subject's urines.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female volunteers aged from 18 to 45 years.

          -  Understand and accepting the procedures of the trial and sign an informed consent.

          -  Have a history and physical exams that show that there is no organic or psychatric
             issue.

          -  The ECG and the general blood and urine analyses done before the trial, have to be in
             the normal limits. Ponctual or minor variations outside limits could be accepted if,
             according to the Main Investigator and regarding the state of science, they don't have
             clinical impact, can't present a risk for the subjects and don't interfere in the
             medication evaluation. These variations and their non-relevance will be specifically
             justified in writting.

          -  The subjects must weigh between 50 and 75kg, with a BMI between 19 and 27 kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Don't fulfiling one or several inclusion criteria.

             the beginning of the trial.

          -  Medical history or clinical evidence of cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic,

             such as herpes or varicella.

          -  Having regularly taken medication during the month preceding the study, excepted
             vitamins, herbal medication or dietetics complementation that, according to the Main
             Investigator or collaborators designated by him, could present a risk for the subjects
             or interfere in the study objectives. The intaking of a single-dose symptoms
             medication during the previous week will not be an exclusion criterion if it is
             considered as completely eliminated the day beginning the experimental session.

          -  Smoke more than 20 cigarets per day during the last 3 months before the study.
