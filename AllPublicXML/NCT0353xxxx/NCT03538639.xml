      Background:

      Some genetic diseases put increase the risk of heart and blood diseases, which are the number
      one cause of death and disability in the U.S. Researchers want to study diseases of the heart
      and/or blood vessels. They want to collect data and specimens from affected people, their
      family members, and healthy people.

      Objective:

      To study diseases of the heart and/or blood vessels.

      Eligibility:

      People age 2 and older who may have genetic disease affecting the heart and/or blood vessels
      Their relatives

      Healthy volunteers

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exams, and imaging tests.
      Participants may have a few visits or visits for 2 weeks or more. This will depend on their
      age and disease status. Visits may include:

      Photographs of the face and body

      Heart tests

      Samples taken of blood, urine, saliva, skin, and/or tissue

      Scans. For some, a dye may be injected into a vein.

      A six-minute walk test

      Lung tests. For some, participants will blow into a tube. For others, they will breathe in a
      gas from a mask, have a small injection, then have a scan.

      Stress tests while walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike

      Ultrasound of veins and arteries

      Devices outside the body testing the stiffness and function of arteries

      Eye exam and eye tests. For some, a dye may be injected in a vein.

      Blood pressure tests

      Measurements of blood flow under the skin and in the arms and fingernail blood vessels

      Devices outside the body testing flexibility of the blood vessels and skin, and skin
      temperature...

      The NIH provides a unique opportunity for research scientists to participate in the
      bench-to-bedside process, which is essential for the full implementation of translational
      medicine programs. The study of rare monogenetic and undiagnosed diseases is a complex
      bedside-to-bench-to-bedside endeavor. Recent studies show that rare genetic variants are more
      likely than common variants to have deleterious effects on protein structure, function,
      and/or expression, possibly leading to clinically relevant events. Studies of large patient
      populations offer the opportunity to identify rare genetic variants underlying human disease
      and will have impactful implications for human health. We propose to characterize the
      etiology and natural history of rare and orphan diseases with vascular phenotypes. We will
      also study rare genetic modifiers and identify novel disease mechanisms contributing to
      common vascular diseases. Subsequent disease-related protocols may be developed based on
      findings from subjects enrolled in this protocol for further intensive natural history
      studies and potential innovative therapeutic studies. In addition to its role in
      investigating individuals who are of interest to the Translational Vascular Medicine Branch
      (TVMB) of the NHLBI, this protocol can provide a possible avenue for admitting subjects from
      other NIH programs, such as the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the Center for Human
      Immunology Trans-institute program or other NIH protocols where subjects exhibit vascular
      phenotypes.

        We expect to enroll an unlimited number of subjects. The study population will be divided
        into groups that reflect both the potential studies that may be performed in distinct
        groups and the risk to benefit analysis for these groups. The appendices at the end of the
        protocol describe possible procedures and risk profiles for all the study subjects.
        Vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, children and cognitively impaired
        persons, may participate in this study.@@@The groups include:@@@1.Adult index cases
        (affected) and relatives (affected and unaffected)@@@2.Child index cases (affected) and
        child relatives (affected and unaffected)@@@3.Healthy adult volunteers

          -  Affected or unaffected adult and child cohorts (including genetic carriers or
             non-carriers as reference biospecimen) are eligible.

             referred with a known or suspected pathology, if they are a relative of an index case
             with a known or suspected pathology.

          -  Healthy pregnant and nursing women may participate as healthy volunteers for minimal
             risk procedures

          -  Healthy adult volunteers must be 18 years of age or older, must agree to have blood or
             tissue samples studied and potentially stored for future research.

             and/or tissue studies or who do not consent to have samples stored for future research
             may be excluded from this study.

          -  Healthy volunteers who are pregnant or nursing will be excluded from procedures that
             would expose them to more than minimal risk as well as to radiation exposure.

             subjects.
