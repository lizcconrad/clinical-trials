  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in preoperative anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Before premedications, 20 minutes after premedications, in operating room, at anesthesia induction.</time_frame>
    <description>Preoperative anxiety will be evaluated by mYPAS (modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale) The mYPAS consists of 22 items in five categories (activity, emotional expressivity, state of arousal, vocalization and use of parents). The highest behavioral level observed in each of the five mYPAS categories is the score for that category. Partial weights were calculated and then added to a total score that ranged from 0 to 100. Cut off points were set to classify: a score of 23.4 to 30 for no anxiety, any score greater than 30 for anxiety.
Change in preoperative anxiety from premedication to 20 minutes after premedication, from 20 minutes after premedication to entrance to the operating room at anesthesia induction will be evaluated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mask acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>At anesthesia induction</time_frame>
    <description>Anaesthesia will be induced with sevoflurane 8% and N2O 50% in oxygen. The child's reaction to the mask will be evaluated by a Mask acceptance scale. Mask Acceptance Scale:
Excellent: not scared, accepts mask easily
Good: slightly scared of mask, could be calmed down easily
Moderate: scared of mask, could not be calmed down
Poor: crying, movement of arms and legs, struggling</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emergence agitation</measure>
    <time_frame>Postoperative every 10 minutes from entrance to the recovery room until discharge. If there is not a problem, patients are watched 20 minutes in our hospital's recovery room.</time_frame>
    <description>Emergence agitation will be evaluated by PAED scale (pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium) The PAED scale involves five items: eye contact, purposeful actions, awareness of the surroundings, restlessness, inconsolability. First three items are scored as follows: 4= not at all, 3= just a little, 2= quite a bit, 1= very much, 0= extremely. Last two items are scored as follows: 0= not at all, 1= just a little, 2= quite a bit, 3= very much, 4= extremely. The scores of each item will summed to obtain a total score. PAED scale score of 10 or more will be defined as emergence delirium.</description>
