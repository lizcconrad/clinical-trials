  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn patients which skin has been lost a rapid growth of the skin is a foremost in their
      treatment. Due to the injury, burn patients undergo a systemic inflammation that helps the
      skin heal faster. However, several studies have shown that this inflammation increases the
      levels of several inflammatory molecules that impairs skin growing, which further delays the
      recovery of burn patients. As such, by inhibiting these inflammatory molecules with the
      administration of a medication called pirfenidone burn patients might present faster rates of
      skin growth and recovery. Thus, patients suffering from a burn injury will be recruited at
      the emergency department of the Hospital University in Monterrey Mexico. Afterward, patients
      will be randomized to either receive pirfenidone 600 mg orally once per day or usual care
      consisting of covering the wound with hydrocolloid dressings. To assess the amount of newly
      growth skin investigators will take a small piece of the skin to further evaluate it through
      a microscope.
