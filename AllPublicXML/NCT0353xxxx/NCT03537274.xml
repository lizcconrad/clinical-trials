    <textblock>
      This study will determine the efficacy of PEG-Intron (SCH 54031) in participants with chronic
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have not been previously treated with interferon.
      Participants are randomized to receive one of three doses of PEG-Intron (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5
      mg/kg) or Interferon Alfa-2B for 48 weeks. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of PEG-Intron (compared to Interferon Alfa-2B) with respect to response based on
      loss of detectable HCV ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) and normalization of alanine transaminase
      (ALT) level after 24 weeks of therapy and at 24 weeks of follow-up.

             antigen (HBsAg) at entry.
