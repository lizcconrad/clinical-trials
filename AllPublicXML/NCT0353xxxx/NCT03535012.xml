  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 10 years, there have been substantial improvements in breast reconstruction by
      plastic surgeons, and much has been achieved in aesthetic restoration after mastectomy.
      Advances in both microsurgery and implants have allowed for a wider variety of surgical
      methods, and procedural skills that minimize donor site complications have been developed.

      With such satisfactory aesthetic results, interest has recently increased not only in breast
      reconstruction but also in sensory recovery. Due to the growing expectation of patients,
      sensory discomfort may decrease overall patient satisfaction with breast reconstruction
      despite good aesthetic results. Hence, for qualitative improvement of breast reconstruction
      surgery, efforts must be made to restore sensation in the reconstructed breast. There has
      been little research on the mechanism of sensory recovery despite its clinical importance.
      This study aimed to compare the degree of sensory recovery in the reconstructed breast using
      various reconstruction methods as well as to evaluate the status of neural regeneration with
      harvesting the tissues when nipple reconstruction is performed.

        This study will be conducted by dividing the subjects into two groups(25 per each arm)
        according to the method of reconstruction: implant vs. abdominal tissue. It is difficult to
        determine a sample size that can establish statistical significance based on previous
        studies. Therefore, the number of targeted subjects was estimated based on the number of
        patients that can generally be recruited during the study period.
