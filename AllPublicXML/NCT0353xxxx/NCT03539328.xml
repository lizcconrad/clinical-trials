      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, designed to assess the therapeutic
      efficacy and toxicity of the combination chemotherapy with pembrolizumab in recurrent,
      platinum resistant OC patients. The main objective is to test whether the therapeutic
      intervention benefits the patients evaluating the increase in overall survival with respect
      to chemotherapy alone.

      Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive:

      ARM A:

      Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 40 mg/mq iv q 28 Weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq d 1,8,15 q 28
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq d 1,8 q 21 At physician' discretion or

      ARM B:

      Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin 40 mg/mq iv q 28 Weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq d 1,8,15 q 28
      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq d 1,8 q 21 plus Pembrolizumab 200 mg d1 q 21 iv infusion in 30 minutes
      In both arms patients will receive treatments until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity of patient's refusal. Patients will receive at least 6 to 8 cycles of chemotherapy
      at physician's discretion. In the experimental arm patients who stop chemotherapy for
      toxicity reasons and whose disease is at least in stabilization, may continue treatment with
      Pembrolizumab as single agent.

      Patients will be stratified according to the number of previous chemotherapy lines (1 vs &gt;1)
      and measurable/evaluable disease.

             will be required;

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course

             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment;

          2. Has received &gt;2 previous CHT lines;

          3. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any

             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier;

          7. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent:

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study;

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

             other solid tumors within the last 2 years;

          9. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability;

         10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment;

         11. Has an history of, or any actual evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis that
             required steroids treatment;

         13. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator;

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial;

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within the projected
             duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120
             days after the last dose of trial treatment;

         16. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent;

         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies);

         18. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected);

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and

             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
