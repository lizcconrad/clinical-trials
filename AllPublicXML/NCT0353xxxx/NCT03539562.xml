    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective study on obstetric and neonatal outcomes in women who accept and
      women who decline morphine as a form of pain management in labor. The study will also
      investigate patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness in these two groups of patients. Half
      of the participants will be those who accept morphine and the other half will be those who
      decline morphine for pain control.

      Objective: Therapeutic rest in labor involves administration of parenteral analgesics in
      early or prodromal labor to relieve the patient's discomfort and allow for progression of
      labor while the patient rests. No prospective studies exist which examine the safety and
      clinical utility of therapeutic rest in early labor, and no published studies examine the
      potential benefits of therapeutic rest from the perspective of either patient satisfaction or
      cost-effectiveness. The investigators aim to determine whether therapeutic rest using
      morphine and promethazine is associated with variations in obstetric or neonatal outcomes,
      patient satisfaction, or costs of labor admission.

      Methods: This will be a prospective cohort study. Women who are eligible for therapeutic rest
      (reactive non-stress test, normal amniotic fluid, in prodromal or early labor as defined by
      obstetric provider, and plan to discharge home after evaluation) will be recruited for the
      study. Participants will receive routine obstetric care by providers who are unaware of
      patient enrollment. A research assistant will then approach all participants in the
      postpartum period, prior to discharge from the hospital, to complete a questionnaire
      including standard demographic questions and patient satisfaction items. Chart review will be
      performed to determine differences in hospital stay and common obstetric and neonatal
      outcomes to compare these data among women who do and do not choose to receive therapeutic
      rest. Finally, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. These results will provide
      insight into a common clinical practice, helping to not only guide management at institutions
      where therapeutic rest is commonly utilized but also potentially encourage its initiation at
      hospitals were therapeutic rest is not available.
