  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of insomnia in caregivers is needed given that 60% of Alzheimer disease caregivers
      report sleep complaints, and insomnia may add to the burden of AD caregiving and contribute
      to morbidity and mortality risk. This is the first intervention trial in AD caregivers to
      target insomnia and also evaluate two mechanisms of chronic disease risk, inflammation and
      cellular aging

      This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the non-inferiority of Mindful Awareness
      Practices for Insomnia (MAP-I ) vs. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) on
      outcomes of insomnia, cellular and genomic markers of inflammation, and cellular aging in
      older adult AD spousal caregivers with insomnia (N=150) over one-year follow-up. The specific
      aims of this project are:

      Primary Aim 1: Determine the effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on subjective and objective
      dimensions of insomnia.

      Secondary Aim 1: Evaluate the effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on cellular and genomic markers of
      inflammation.

      Secondary Aim 2: Evaluate the effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on markers of cellular aging.

      Exploratory Aim 1: Explore moderating effects of caregiver stress (Stress and Adversity
      Inventory, STRAIN, number &amp; experienced intensity of stress exposure) on insomnia outcomes,
      and effects of MAP-I vs. CBT-I on caregiver stress, health functioning, chronic medical
      morbidity and related medication use at follow-up.

    <description>The Mindful Awareness Practices (MAPs) is a validated and curriculum-based meditation similar to Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, with the exception that MAPs does not include a day-long retreat or yoga and hence takes a more practical and accessible approach that focuses specifically on the practice of mindfulness and its application in everyday life. (http://marc.ucla.edu) MAP for Insomnia (MAP-I) is a modified version of MAPs that incorporates practice prior to bed, use of practice in the bed during night-time awakenings, and daily body scan.</description>
