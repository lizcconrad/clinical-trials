    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn if a new combination of chemotherapy, in
      combination with low-dose radiation, will be safe for the patient, and at the same time
      provide the best opportunity to cure the bone marrow cancer. The combination of chemotherapy
      and radiation described in the study is considered 'low intensity.' Although the chemotherapy
      agents used in this study and for transplant are FDA approved, the chemotherapy treatment and
      conditioning regimens or combinations listed in this consent are not yet FDA approved.

      The CliniMACS device is FDA approved for one type of T cell depletion (positive selection of
      the stem cells) but not approved yet for other type of T cell depletion, which is being
      studied on this protocol. This pilot study, along with other studies will serve as the basis
      for FDA approval, if outcomes are favorable.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pilot study to assess engraftment of a T cell depleted (TCD) graft following a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC). The conditioning regimen will include total body irradiation (TBI), Fludarabine, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and post transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy). The graft will be TCD and will be composed of a TCR-α/β+ lymphocyte depletion stem cells and CD34+ selected stem cells.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Transplant conditioning will consist of: ATG (2 mg/kg/day IV on days-9 and -7), fludarabine (30 mg/m^2/d on days -5 through -2), TBI 400 cGy (day -1) and high dose cyclophosphamide given post stem cell infusion (50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4). One dose of Rituxan (200 mg/m^2) will be given to reduce the risk of EBV viremia. The donor stem cell product will be derived from the peripheral blood with a target cell infusion of ≥8X10^6 CD34 cells per recipient kg. Patients will receive post-transplant G-CSF starting on day +7. Patients will undergo donor/recipient bone marrow and peripheral chimerism studies at 30, 100 and 180 days, and 12, 18 and 24 months post allo HCT and thereafter, at the discretion of the treating clinician. Immune function and disease restaging will be performed at day 100 and 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months and as otherwise clinically indicated by the treating physician.</description>
