      This study will evaluate the effects of radiofrequency on pelvic floor strength and the
      change in associated symptoms through direct measurement and patient reporting. The patients
      will undergo two separate evaluation appointments then receive two treatments. One group will
      receive a sham treatment and the other will receive the treatment. The sham group will be
      offered treatment at the end of the study.
