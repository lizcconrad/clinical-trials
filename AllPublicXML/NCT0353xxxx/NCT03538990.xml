  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to examine the effect of nutritional intake on hemodynamic,
      cardiometabolic, and inflammation markers in advanced heart failure patients with implanted
      hemodynamic monitoring device (CardioMEMS), using a one-group pre-post test design feeding
      trial. The pre-test condition is represented by participants' self-selected diet, and the
      post-test condition is represented by a prescribed Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
      (DASH) diet.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Pulmonary Artery Pressure between Calibration and DASH Diet Intervention Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure will be calculated between calibration and intervention phase. All patients will be instructed to take daily PA home readings for the duration of the study. By patient, the baseline average for the first 21 days of PA pressure home readings (calibration phase) and the average for daily PA pressure home readings during the intervention phase (21 days) will be calculated and compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cardiometabolic Markers between Calibration and DASH Diet Intervention Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare the change of the following cardiometabolic marker values between calibration and intervention phase: fasting lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c, basic metabolic panel (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide (CO2), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N terminal proBNP, troponin 1, mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), soluble somatostatin receptor 2 (sST2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Inflammation Markers between Calibration and DASH Diet Intervention Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare the change of the following inflammation marker values between calibration and intervention phase: interleukin (IL)-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functional Exercise Capacity between Calibration and DASH Diet Intervention Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare the change in functional exercise capacity using the American Thoracic Society 6-minute walk test between calibration and intervention phase.</description>

    <description>The DASH eating pattern meals prepared for study participants will strictly follow DASH meal planning guidelines published by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Participants will exclusively consume prepared meals and provided beverages which will be delivered to participants' homes. Meals will be planned and prepared based on individual participant energy needs and dietary restrictions by a Registered Dietitian at the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance (CTSA) Bionutrition Unit located at Emory University.</description>

    <description>The DASH diet is a heart-healthy eating pattern that is focused on adequate consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetables oils while emphasizing limited intake of foods containing saturated fat, such as fatty red meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils, such as coconut, palm kernel, and palm oils, as well as sugar-sweetened beverages and sweets.</description>
