  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the causes of Complicated Grief (CG) in
      those who experience the loss of a loved one. This study aims at learning more about the
      sleep patterns and emotions in participants with CG as compared to those who have lost a
      loved one but do not have CG.

      This study will consist of two aims:

      Aim 1: Approximately 10 complicated grief (CG) patients and 10 controls (without a current
      psychiatric diagnosis) will complete a 3-day home polysomnography (PSG) sleep assessment in
      addition to several self-report sleep and psychiatric measures.

      Aim 2: Approximately 10 CG patients (subsample from Aim 1) will complete 16 weekly sessions
      of complicated grief therapy (CGT) in addition to completion of repeated PSG assessments and
      self-report sleep and psychiatric measures.
