      A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Dose-Ranging Study to Evaluate
      the Safety and Efficacy of CCX140-B in Subjects with Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis
      (FSGS) to be conducted in the North America, Europe and Australia. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the effect of treatment with CCX140-B, a selective antagonist of C-C chemokine
      receptor type 2 in subjects with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on urinary protein
      excretion as assessed by changes in urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR)
