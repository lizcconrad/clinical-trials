  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of two drug interventions called rosuvastatin
      and enoxaparin as a possible preventative measure against developing venous blood clots (such
      deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). .

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Rosuvastatin, also known as Crestor

        -  Enoxaparin
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data from clinical trials show that drugs called &quot;statins&quot;, which is a family of drugs that
      includes rosuvastatin, can prevent blood clotting in both cancer and non-cancer participants.
      Rosuvastatin is currently approved by the FDA for the primary prevention of blood clotting in
      the arteries of individuals without a history of cardiovascular disease.

      With this trial, the investigators hope to determine if it is reasonable to conduct a study
      in the future that determines the efficacy of blood clot prevention (prophylaxis) using
      rosuvastatin in combination with enoxaparin following surgery for ovarian cancer.

      Surgery and cancer are both known to increase the risk of blood clots. This study is being
      conducted to determine if there are better ways to reduce this risk. This research study is a
      Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining how rosuvastatin in
      combination with enoxaparin affect certain factors in the participant's blood, which have
      been identified as having a link to increased risk of blood clotting.

      Rosuvastatin is an anti-cholesterol medication that is FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration) approved to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of arterial blood clots.
      There is evidence that rosuvastatin can lower the risk of venous blood clots in healthy
      individuals but the FDA has not approved rosuvastatin for prevention of blood clots following
      ovarian cancer surgery.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved enoxaparin for prevention of
      blood clots following abdominal or orthopedic surgery and in medical patients with restricted
      mobility during acute illness.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking at differences between the levels of
      certain small particles that are thought to cause blood clots (thrombosis) in participants
      who receive a combination of rosuvastatin and enoxaparin compared with enoxaparin alone (or
      standard of care therapy). A protein called tissue factor is commonly present on ovarian
      cancer cells and cancer cells are thought to release particles in the blood containing tissue
      factor. The levels of these particles circulating in the blood have been linked to an
      increased risk of blood clots in people with cancer

          -  The effects of rosuvastatin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason
             and because statins used in this trial are thought to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to enoxaparin or atorvastatin

          -  Active bleeding or high risk of bleeding (e.g. known acute gastrointestinal ulcer)

          -  History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Any history of significant hemorrhage (requiring hospitalization or transfusion)
             outside of a surgical setting within the last year.

          -  Elevated creatine kinase &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Presence of coagulopathy defined as:

               -  PT &gt; 1.3 x upper limit of normal

               -  PTT &gt; 1.3 x upper limit of normal

          -  Familial bleeding diathesis

          -  Known diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation

          -  Currently taking statin (i.e. rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin) or fibrates

          -  Currently receiving anticoagulant therapy

          -  Current use of aspirin (&gt;81 mg daily), Clopidogrel (Plavix), cilostazol (Pletal),
             aspirin-dipyridamole (Aggrenox).

          -  Known Asian descent (including Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese or
             Asian-Indian origin) due to altered metabolism of statins.

          -  Concomitant use of the following drugs: cyclosporine, fibrates, niacin, gemfibrozil,
             ketoconazole, spironolactone, cimetidine, warfarin, erythromycin, or protease
             inhibitors

          -  Known recent history of heavy alcohol use

          -  History of rhabdomyolysis while on statin therapy.

          -  Known history of Hepatitis C or active Hepatitis B infection

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Participant must be able to swallow pills.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic
             effects on the human fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to the treatment of the mother with rosuvastatin,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued. These potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study.
