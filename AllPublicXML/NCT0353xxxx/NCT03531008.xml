      The HEP2 study is designed to better understand the challenges of living with focal seizures
      that do not respond to medication, by following 200 people with medication-resistant focal
      epilepsy over two years to measure changes in health status, healthcare costs, quality of
      life, and biomarkers of epilepsy severity and treatment response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Epilepsy Foundation is launching a partnership, called the Human Epilepsy Project, in
      collaboration with the Epilepsy Study Consortium. This study (which is called HEP2 for short)
      is designed to better understand the challenges of living with focal seizures that do not
      respond to medication. The HEP2 study will follow 200 people with medication-resistant focal
      epilepsy (with seizures that occur at least 4 times per month) over two years to measure
      changes in their seizure frequency, treatments used, adverse events experienced, presence of
      co-morbidities like depression and anxiety, healthcare costs, and quality of life. Blood
      samples will also be collected in order to look for biomarkers of epilepsy severity and
      treatment response.

      Participants can join the HEP2 study at any one of recruiting study centers. These study
      centers were selected because they are epilepsy centers with track records of conducting
      high-quality research in epilepsy and efficiently recruiting participants into studies. The
      designated sites for the HEP2 study are located in New York, California, Minnesota,
      Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. The study has one international site in Finland. A
      participant may enroll in the HEP2 study but continue to receive their standard epilepsy care
      with their current physician, as long as the participant is willing to share his or her
      medical records, and travel to the study center for 3 in person visits at the beginning of
      the study, after the first year, and a final visit after the second year.

      Blood samples will be collected at the first visit and the final visit. A third sample may be
      collected from those participants who experience a seizure-free period of three months or
      more during the study period. All blood samples will be retained indefinitely, for use in
      future research. The specific details of future studies are unknown at this time, but will
      include genomic, proteomic, metabolomic and transcriptome analyses.

          1. Age ≥ 16 years and ≤ 65 years at time of enrollment

          2. Diagnosed with focal epilepsy with prior vEEG confirmation; if no VEEG confirmation,
             but in the opinion of the investigator the seizures are definite, the case can be
             reviewed and adjudicated by the consortium

          3. Failure of adequate trials of 4 AEDs, with at least 2 due to failure of seizure
             control, including current AEDs

          4. Have a seizure frequency of ≥ 4 focal seizures/month, including auras, and at least 2
             observable seizures/month, that are countable by the subject and/or caregiver for the
             3 months prior to enrollment
