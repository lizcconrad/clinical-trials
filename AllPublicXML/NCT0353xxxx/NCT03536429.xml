  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial evaluating the effect
      of preventive acetazolamide intake on the postural control in lowlanders older than 40 years
      travelling to altitude. Participants living in the Bishkek area, Kyrgyzstan (760m), will be
      transferred by car within 4h to the Tuja Ashu high altitude clinic (3'100 m), and stay there
      for 2 days. Acetazolamide 375mg/day (or placebo), will be administered before departure at
      760 m and during the stay at altitude. Outcomes will be assessed during the stay at 3'100 m.

      An interim analysis will be carried out when 80 participants will have completed the study or
      after the first year. The Peto's method will be used and the trial will be stopped when
      pre-specified futility boundaries were crossed.
