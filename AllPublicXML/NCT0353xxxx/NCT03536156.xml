  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the case of unitary edentulousness, a dental implant is a prosthetic device fixed in the
      bone which makes it possible to receive a fixed dental prosthesis (crown). Peri-implant soft
      tissues (gums) play an essential role in the integration of the crown. Indeed, the implant
      gingival emergence profile provides an aesthetic integration mimicking that of a natural
      tooth. This implant emergence profile (EIP) is modeled during the surgical and / or
      prosthetic phases.

      The problem comes from the labile character of the EIP (Emergence Implant Profile). If the
      literature evokes this problem, the instability of the volume of the EIP during the
      impression phases has never been measured. Moreover, the three-dimensional behavior of the
      EIP over time (kinetic) during the acquisition phases is not known.

      Objective study of the mobility of gingival tissues of the implant emergence profile (IEP),
      using an intra-oral optical camera, would scientifically measure the labile aspect of the IEP
      and improve the procedure of registration of peri-implant soft tissues

      Objective study of the mobility of gingival tissues of the implant emergence profile (IEP),
      using an intra-oral optical camera, would scientifically measure the labile aspect of the IEP
      and improve the procedure of registration of peri-implant soft tissues.

      The main objective is to study the effect of removal of a healing abutment on the closure of
      the EIP volume at 5 minutes.

      This non-interventional study is a prospectively recruited research of the participants and a
      cross-sectional measure of the judgment criteria (during a single visit). The study is
      mono-centric, it will take place in the odontology department of Toulouse Hospital.

      The question is to know if the decrease in the volume of the PEI is significant during the
      preparatory phase of the implant impression where the PEI is no longer supported by the
      healing screw over a period of 5 minutes.

      Optical impressions are designed to record adjacent implant site teeth and peri-implant soft
      tissue PEI using a Optical Camera. The optical camera works like a camera and does not come
      into contact with the patient's mucous membranes or teeth. The images obtained are saved in
      STL format on an anonymized file.

    <description>Calculation of the volume of the PEI at T0 min from T5 min :
They will be named respectively:
- Flight T0 min : The reference volume is the volume of the PEI at T0 min, it corresponds to the volume of the healing screw created during the mucosal healing phase and which must be kept for the production of the crown of use. It will be called: Vol T0 min. Hypothesis H0 is that Vol T0 min is fixed over time.
If a volume change of 10% is observed, it is assumed that the clinical consequences are real and that the IEP volume will be undersized compared to the reference IEP. This will have aesthetic and functional consequences.
The measurement tool of the study is the intraoral scanner.</description>
