  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP) present important limitations for the performance of
      daily living activities. The aims of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and effects of
      an intensive goal training protocol for adolescents with CP. He hypothesize that adolescents
      submitted to the studied protocol will present improvements in performance and satisfaction
      of prioritized functional goals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a feasibility study to assess the implementation and the possible effects of
      an intensive individualized goal training with adolescents with CP. Adolescents will select
      up to 5 functional goals to be trained during a 2 weeks, 3 hour-daily training, totalling 30
      hours across 2 weeks. Moreover, they will be asked to daily practice these activities at home
      along the intervention period.

    <description>Intensive goal training of relevant activities reported by adolescents in the beginning of the study. Therapists will grade the level of complexity of the proposed activities, considering the relevant movements, task demands and contextual factors involved in the performance of each task. Adolescents will be asked to practice these activities at home (1 hour/daily) and to discuss their difficulties and improvements with the therapists. The intervention will be provided in a day-camp model.</description>
