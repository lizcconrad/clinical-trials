  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel group, double-blind, randomized clinical trial with two arms. The primary
      aim is to assess the efficacy of Fermented Soy vs. placebo in 72 adults with prostate cancer.
      This study has 1 primary aim and 3 (1a thru 1c) sub aims. Aim 1 is to assess the effect of
      Fermented Soy (QC) on PSA (prostate specific antigen) In parallel, in Aims 1a-1c will assess
      tumor-specific effects of QC:

      Aim 1a: Identifying the anti-tumor effects of QC. This will be done by culturing multiple
      human cancer cell lines with QC at a range of concentrations, followed by readouts at
      different time points, of tumor cell apoptosis, proliferation, and senescence.

      Aim 1b: Identify a hierarchy of tumors that are responsive to QC. From the data in aim one an
      attempt will be made to identify a hierarchy of anti-tumor effects.

      Aim 1c: Investigate the signaling pathways in tumor cells that are modified by QC. To do
      this, full genomic profiling will be conducted for breast and prostate tumor cell lines, and
      will be done in conjunction with analysis of the relevant signaling pathways, and will
      include P53 and P21 activation pathways.

    <measure>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PSA test measures the level of PSA in a man's blood. For this test, a blood sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results are usually reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood.</description>

    <measure>Prostate Gland Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Pathological investigation of the removed prostate gland will include determining the volume of gland.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of Biopsy-Proven, Index Lesion</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Pathological investigation of the removed prostate gland will include the assessment of biopsy-proven, index prostate cancer lesion.
(From WebMD) ... this scoring system assigns a number from 2 to 10 to describe how abnormal the cells appear under a microscope. A score of 2 to 4 means the cells still look very much like normal cells and pose little danger of spreading quickly. A score of 8 to 10 indicates that the cells have very few features of a normal cell and are likely to be aggressive. A score of 5 to 7 indicates intermediate risk.</description>

    <measure>Gleason Score Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Pathological investigation of the removed prostate gland will include the assessment of biopsy-proven, index prostate cancer lesion will lead to the analysis of any modulation of PCa grade (Gleason score) compared to preoperative biopsies.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PCa Tissue Telomeric DNA Length</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of telomere length in research samples of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells reveals that telomere length decreases with increased replication of cells, reflecting the replicative history of those cells.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA-S) Score Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Post surgical/post intervention CAPRA score will be used for comparison with baseline (screening) value. The CAPRA score can range from 0 to 10 where: a score of 0 to 2 indicates low-risk, 3 to 5 indicates intermediate-risk, and 6 to 10 indicates high-risk.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cell Cycle Progression Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of prostate cancer mRNA can be determined from PCa tissue. Cell cycle progression score assessment of PCa mRNA is a novel RNA expression-based assay that directly measures tumor cell growth characteristics in order to stratify patients with localized PCa according to disease aggressiveness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than or equal to 4 weeks (up to 10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life assessment for men with PCa will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P v4Â©). The FACT-P contains 27 items that use a 0-4 rating scale. The total score is an indication of overall quality of life where the higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Daily Fermented Soy (two 12.5g packets/day) (~1 ounce/day) taken between the time of enrollment and radical prostatectomy (RP). Clinical assessment of both groups will take place 1) at baseline, and 2) just prior to RP, estimated at between 4 and 10 weeks from baseline/enrollment. Length of time in the study will vary for each subject, depending on how far out their prostatectomy will occur; all prostatectomies will be scheduled to occur between 4-10 weeks post-baseline.</description>
