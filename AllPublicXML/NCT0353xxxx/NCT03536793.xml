  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the levels of uTF and Endo180 in patients with pancreatic cancer, and
      also in patients with pancreatic cysts in which cancer may be suspected, to determine the
      accuracy of these tests in detecting early stage pancreatic cancer. The effective diagnosis
      of pancreatic cancer is often quite challenging, due to a lack of disease-specific symptoms,
      resulting in the majority of patients presenting with advanced disease, with an associated
      dismal prognosis. Earlier detection of pancreatic cancer, at a stage where surgery is
      feasible, would greatly increase the 5-year survival rate. Detecting pancreatic cancer early
      is therefore vital to improve the prognosis for these patients.

      Precancerous pancreatic cysts are an early indicator of malignant transformation. The ideal
      screening test would be capable of detecting pancreatic cancer at these initial stages.
      Current procedures for pancreatic cancer diagnosis are invasive, uncomfortable and costly,
      and can be considered unnecessary in those cysts found to be benign.

      The investigators propose two potential markers of early pancreatic cancer: urinary tissue
      factor (uTF) and Endo180. ELISA tests have been developed to measure the levels of TF in
      urinary microvesicles and Endo180 concentration in urine, serum and cystic fluid samples.

    <description>Samples (urine, serum and cystic fluid) will be taken from 50 patients with pancreatic cysts on follow-up.

        Potential participants will be identified through the pancreatic multidisciplinary team
        (MDT) meetings or outpatient clinic. Once eligibility has been confirmed, they will be
        approached by a member of the research team.

        The majority of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer will be inpatients and therefore
        will be approached by a member of the research team on the hospital ward. Patients with
        non-resectable pancreatic cancer will be approached at their scheduled outpatient clinic
        appointment.

        Participants with pancreatic cysts and those that will be in the benign/ control cohort
        will also be approached during outpatient clinic appointments.
