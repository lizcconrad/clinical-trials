  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent decades, the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically in the United States.
      Obesity has been associated with an increased risk of the metabolic syndrome, which is
      characterized by a cluster of metabolic derangements, including insulin resistance, high
      blood sugar, high triglycerides, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, high
      blood pressure, and inflammation. Lifestyle interventions, including dietary modification,
      physical activity, and weight loss, form the basis of treatment for individuals with the
      metabolic syndrome. However, the optimal composition of the diet is not known at this time.
      Furthermore, due to hormonal and metabolic changes that accompany weight loss, most people
      find it very difficult to maintain significant weight reductions over time. As a result,
      weight regain is exceedingly common.

      Several dietary patterns, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension study diet
      (the DASH diet) and the low glycemic index diet (low GI diet), may be useful in the treatment
      of individuals with the metabolic syndrome, even if body weight stays the same. Novel
      findings from our own pilot study suggest that these dietary patterns may improve insulin
      resistance and some other features of the metabolic syndrome, even after just two weeks and
      in the absence of weight loss. In this important follow-up study, the metabolic effects of
      the DASH diet and the low GI diet will be compared to those of an Western-style control diet.
      At least 39 overweight, insulin-resistant volunteers with the metabolic syndrome will be
      studied during a 32-day inpatient admission. All food will be provided, and body weight will
      be kept stable throughout the study. Subjects will first undergo testing after consuming a
      Western-style diet for two weeks. They will then be randomized to one of three study diets:
      the DASH diet, the low GI diet, or the Western-style diet. Testing will again be conducted
      after 2 weeks of weight stability on the study diet. Testing will include the assessment of
      insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters, such as blood sugar and cholesterol
      levels, blood pressure, and inflammation. This study will provide important information about
      the effects of these promising dietary patterns on features of the metabolic syndrome, in the
      absence of weight loss.

          8. Willingness to avoid the use of all over-the-counter or prescription vitamins, dietary
             supplements, and herbal products during the study. At the PI's discretion, other

             (especially angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
             blockers, which may affect levels of inflammatory markers) at the same dose and
             schedule throughout the study,unless a change is advised by the subject's primary care
             provider or the study investigators

         10. Willingness to avoid the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS),

             BP is at least 115/75 mmHg but &lt; 145/90 mmHg on these agents and 2) they agree to
             remain on the same medications (and same dosages) during the study, unless otherwise
             advised by a primary care provider or study investigators (e.g. the dosage may be
             reduced or the medication may be stopped if signs or symptoms of hypotension develop
             during the study)

          5. Fasting glucose &gt; 165 mg/dL, glycosylated hemoglobin &gt; 8%, or any treatment with oral
             hypoglycemic agents, insulin sensitizing agents (e.g. metformin or

         14. Known infection with HIV or confirmed positive test for HIV antibody

         15. Inflammatory bowel disease, active cancer, or any other medical condition that may
             cause significant acute weight loss or gain

         16. Sustained weight loss &gt; 5% of body weight in the previous two months, or sustained
             weight loss &gt; 10% of body weight in the previous six months

         18. Chronic or acute renal disease

         23. History of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, as defined in the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV), or a history of
             medical or psychological treatment for an eating disorder

         24. Severe binge eating disorder, as defined as a Binge Eating Scale score of 27 or more.
             Individuals with scores of 18-26, which may be indicative of moderate eating
             disturbances, will be evaluated further to determine whether moderate to severe eating
             pathology actually exists. This evaluation process will be based on the DSMIVresearch
             criteria for binge eating disorder. Individuals with scores of 18-26 who meet the
             DSM-IV research criteria for binge eating disorder will be excluded, whereas those
             without significant eating pathology may be included in the study.

         25. Untreated moderate to severe depression, as evidenced by a Beck Depression Inventory
             score of 20 or higher at screening. Subjects with a remote history of depression or
             stable, treated depression may be included in the study at the discretion of the
             Principal Investigator

         26. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the previous two years

         27. History, physical, or laboratory findings suggestive of any other medical or
             psychological condition that would, in the opinion of the principal investigator, make
             the candidate ineligible for the study.

         28. Any social or behavioral condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             interfere with adherence to study requirements
