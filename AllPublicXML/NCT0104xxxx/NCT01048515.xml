  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigated the effect of caffeine on physical performance in healthy citizens
      aged over 70 years following eight hours of abstinence from caffeine containing drinks and
      foods. The main hypothesis was that 6 mg/kg caffeine would improve cycling endurance at 65%
      of expected maximal heart rate.

    <textblock>
      It is well documented that caffeine ingestion increases the endurance of young people
      exercising at 60%-85% of their maximal oxygen uptake (13;15;47). It also seems to improve
      endurance as measured by repeated sub-maximal isometric contraction (42), and decreases the
      rate of perceived exertion during exercise (6;9;46). Typically, doses of approximately 6
      mg/kg caffeine were used in these studies.

      With a growing number of elderly with a physical active lifestyle and many elderly
      participating in rehabilitation programs the endurance enhancing effect of caffeine is of
      increasing interest in this age group. We therefore conducted a study of healthy 75 year old
      citizens to investigate whether 6 mg/kg caffeine improved physical performance and reduced
      the perceived effort during work in healthy citizens aged â‰¥ 70 years. The main hypothesis was
      that caffeine would improve cycling endurance at 65% of expected maximal heart rate. The
      study showed that compared to placebo caffeine increased endurance by 25 % (p&lt;0.0001) and
      isometric sub-maximal strength with 54 % (p&lt;0.0001), reduced perceived exertion after 5
      minutes of biking by 11 % (p=0.002), but in 21 of 30 participants there was reduced postural
      stability (with eyes open). In the above described study participants abstained from caffeine
      containing drinks and foods for 48 hours prior to each test. Half of the participants
      reported withdrawal symptoms. Such a long caffeine abstinence period would infer with daily
      life for many people. We therefore invited the participants from the above study to a
      repetition of the above study to test whether similar results would be obtained if
      participants only abstained from caffeine containing drinks and foods for 8 hours prior to
      each test.
