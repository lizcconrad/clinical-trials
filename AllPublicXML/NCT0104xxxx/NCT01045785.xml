      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aspirin resistance has impact on
      cardiovascular event in dialysis patient.

      Dialysis patient inevitably suffered from uremic bleeding although improvement of dialysis
      care in the past decades. Physicians used to check bleeding time as a surrogate marker for
      uremic bleeding. However, bleeding time isn't accurate and as well known, is poorly
      correlated with clinical bleeding such as surgical bleeding. Platelet function assay (PFA) is
      a newly developed method to measure platelet aggregation in vitro and is validated in many
      sorts of platelet disorders. Recently, PFA was also used to evaluate aspirin responsiveness
      in patients who had taken aspirin. Our study is aim to investigate uremic thrombocytopathy
      via PFA of dialysis patient in Taiwan. Furthermore, we will study aspirin resistance in
      dialysis patient.
