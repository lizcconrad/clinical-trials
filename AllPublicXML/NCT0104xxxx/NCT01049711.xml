  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the cost utility analysis of Erythropoietin (EPO) for maintaining the different
      hemoglobin (Hb) target levels in anemic hemodialysis patient in routine clinical practice.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Thailand, the studies that were conducted to find the most useful target Hb have not
      included the cost effectiveness and/or cost utility analyses. The level at which quality of
      life is maximized and risk is minimized would be the optimal target. Dialysis patients carry
      higher risk of death than general population. Anemia is the common complication found in
      dialysis patients that could lead to mortality. Risk of anemia is occurred in HD patients
      more than CAPD patients because blood loss is less marked and residual renal function maybe
      better preserved in patients who receive peritoneal dialysis.Although EPO has been included
      in the National List of Essential Drugs (NLED) for the treatment of anemia caused by end
      stage renal disease for maintaining the target hemoglobin but the cost of EPO is so
      expensive. Cost utility analysis is economic technique for assessing the efficiency of
      healthcare intervention measuring combined outcomes as the effectiveness, i.e., survival and
      quality of life in combination as quality adjusted life years (QALYs).This study is a benefit
      measure at the care giving level by using as a part of planning patient management program
      and at the policy level for decision making.
