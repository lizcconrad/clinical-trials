    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 of each period</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma 5-HMT concentration data pre and post reflectometry following multiple doses of fesoterodine 4 mg OD and fesoterodine 8 mg OD. Day 7 mean for each treatment period was calculated as the mean of the three measurements taken post-dose on Day 7 of each treatment period separately. Summary statistics were to be calculated by setting concentration values below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ = 0.02 ng/mL) to zero. Summary statistics were not to be presented if number of observations above lower limit of quantification (NALQ) = 0.</description>

        <description>Plasma 5-HMT concentration data pre and post reflectometry following multiple doses of fesoterodine 4 mg OD and fesoterodine 8 mg OD. Day 7 mean for each treatment period was calculated as the mean of the three measurements taken post-dose on Day 7 of each treatment period separately. Summary statistics were to be calculated by setting concentration values below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ = 0.02 ng/mL) to zero. Summary statistics were not to be presented if number of observations above lower limit of quantification (NALQ) = 0.</description>
