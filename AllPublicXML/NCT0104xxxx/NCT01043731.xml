      Transvaginal hybrid procedures are of interest as an available NOTES-Procedure for the
      clinical routine. Few authors have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of such procedures
      (e.g. cholecystectomy) in selected patient collectives. In 2008 Lacy at al. published the
      experience with a transvaginal sigmoidectomy as a first in human report. The aim of this
      prospective data collection is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the transvaginal
      hybrid anterior resection in the clinical routine.

      Therefore all patients giving the informed consent to the transvaginal hybrid anterior
      resection will be included and assessed concerning feasibility to perform the transvaginal
      approach and complete the operation transvaginally.

    <description>Transvaginal Hybrid Anterior Resection: three 5mm trocars are placed transabdominally (one trans-umbilical, the other two in the lower abdomen). Identification of the inferior mesenteric vein and artery. Clipping of the vein. Then placement of a 12mm trocar through the posterior fornix of the vagina for stapling of the inferior mesenteric artery. After mobilisation of the colon descendens and the splenic flexure stapling of the proximal rectum through the 12mm trocar placed vaginally. Afterwards the colpotomy is performed and the mobilised left hemi-colon is extracted transvaginally. The proximal colonic resection is performed extracorporeally in the conventional fashion with placement of a purse-string suture and insertion of the circular stapling anvil into the proximal end of the bowel. The bowel is then replaced into the abdominal cavity. The colpotomy is then closed. A circular stapler is inserted transanally and the end-to-end anastomosis is performed.</description>
