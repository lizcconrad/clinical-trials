      We propose an observational study to assess the ability of intensivists to evaluate for deep
      vein thrombosis using 2 point compression ultrasonography.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep vein thrombosis is a common problem in the intensive care unit and diagnosis is often
      delayed due to limited availability of a formal duplex ultrasound. Physician performed 2
      point compression ultrasonography has been shown to have reasonable accuracy when performed
      in the emergency department and outpatient setting, but has not been studied on patients in
      the intensive care unit. We propose an observational study to assess the ability of
      intensivists to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis using 2 point compression ultrasonography.

        The study population will consist of adult patients admitted to the intensive care units at
        University hospital who have a duplex ultrasound of the lower extremities for detection of
        deep vein thrombosis ordered by the primary team.
