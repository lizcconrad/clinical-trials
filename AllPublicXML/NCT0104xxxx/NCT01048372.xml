      Primary Objective: To determine the mechanism of Cytolin's effect on HIV replication from
      blood drawn from HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals after exposure to Cytolin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial phase of this in vitro study regarding the potential mechanisms of action of
      Cytolin was completed in January 2011. Given the data set to date, a decision has been made
      to extend the study. The extension will allow the Company to further confirm and extend the
      initial findings regarding the potential mechanism of action of Cytolin.
