  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the research cohort is to facilitate patient access to clinical trials
      testing new therapeutic interventions, or access to second- line treatments.

      Secondary objectives of the research cohort study are to obtain detailed clinical phenotyping
      and immunological analysis of blood samples, aiming to identify and validate biomarkers of
      disease activity and response to treatment and prognostic markers.
