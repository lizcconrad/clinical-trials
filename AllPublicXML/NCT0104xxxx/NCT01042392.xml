    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The arm in which the highest sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each study visit, after leaving the patient to rest 5 minutes in a sitting position, the blood pressure (BP) was measured three times with an oscillometric device. The measurements were performed at 1-2 minute intervals. The mean BP was calculated from the 3 readings. The analysis of covariance included treatment factor and baseline mean sitting SBP as covariable.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The arm in which the highest sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each study visit, after leaving the patient to rest 5 minutes in a sitting position, the blood pressure (BP) was measured three times with an oscillometric device. The measurements were performed at 1-2 minute intervals. The mean BP was calculated from the 3 readings. The analysis of variance included treatment factor and baseline value of mean sitting DBP as covariable.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Controlled Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The arm in which the highest sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each study visit, after leaving the patient to rest 5 minutes in a sitting position, the blood pressure (BP) was measured three times with an oscillometric device. The measurements were performed at 1-2 minute intervals. The mean BP was calculated from the 3 readings.
Controlled blood pressure (BP) is defined as mean office systolic BP/ diastolic BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg.</description>

    <measure>Number of the Participants With More Than 55 mmHg Difference Between the Mean SBP Measured at the Morning Surge and the Mean Minimal SBP Measured During the Night</measure>
    <time_frame>After 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) over 24 hours was performed for all patients on the day before visit 4, the device attached to the ambulatory blood pressure non-dominant arm of the patient. The BP morning surge was defined as the average of the measurements taken during the first 2 hours after waking the patient. The minimal night blood pressure was defined as the average of the two lowest BP measures (the lowest hourly average) recorded during night time.</description>

    <measure>Change in msSBP and msDBP From Visit 2 (Baseline) to Visit 3 (at 4 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The arm in which the highest sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each study visit, after leaving the patient to rest 5 minutes in a sitting position, the blood pressure (BP) was measured three times with an oscillometric device.

    <measure>Difference Between the Maximal and the Minimal Mean-hour SPB Measured Between 1 and 8 am at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) over 24 hours was performed for all patients on the eve of visit 4 (week 8), the device attached to the ambulatory blood pressure non-dominant arm of the patient. The difference between mean-hour maximum SBP mean-hour minimum SBP between 1 am and 8 am was measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting DBP and SBP in Specified Sub-groups From Visit 2 (Baseline) to Visit 4 (at 8 Weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The sub-groups were: &quot;Riser&quot; = patients with &gt;= 55 mmHg difference between the mean SPB measured at the morning surge and the mean minimal SBP measured during the night. The &quot;Non-risers&quot; in whom the difference is &lt;55 mmHg. Patients called &quot;dippers&quot; in whom there was a decrease in average nocturnal SBP ≥ 10% compared with average daytime SBP, in contrast to patients &quot;non-dippers &quot; in whom this difference was &lt;10%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) and Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP) From Last Active Dose Taken to After a One-day Missed-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>From 8 weeks to 48 hours after week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change in blood pressure was measured between visit 4 (end of the period of double-blind active treatment which was at week 8) and visit 5 (48 hours after the last active dose taken) in the group of patients who received aliskiren or placebo and those who received ramipril or placebo. The analysis of covariance included treatment factor and baseline mean sitting SBP and mean sitting DBP as covariables.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number Patients Reported With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Death (Period II and Period III)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks + 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP)</title>
        <description>The arm in which the highest sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each study visit, after leaving the patient to rest 5 minutes in a sitting position, the blood pressure (BP) was measured three times with an oscillometric device. The measurements were performed at 1-2 minute intervals. The mean BP was calculated from the 3 readings. The analysis of covariance included treatment factor and baseline mean sitting SBP as covariable.</description>

        <population>Intent to treat population included all randomized patients who had received at least one dose of study drug. It also excluded all those patients from centers that reported more than 90% of BP measurements rounded to 0 or 5.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP)</title>
        <description>The arm in which the highest sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each study visit, after leaving the patient to rest 5 minutes in a sitting position, the blood pressure (BP) was measured three times with an oscillometric device. The measurements were performed at 1-2 minute intervals. The mean BP was calculated from the 3 readings. The analysis of variance included treatment factor and baseline value of mean sitting DBP as covariable.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Intent to treat population included all randomized patients who had received at least one dose of study drug. It also excluded all those patients from centers that reported more than 90% of BP measurements rounded to 0 or 5. Patients with observation at both time points were included in this analysis.</population>

          <description>Ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) over 24 hours was performed for all patients on the eve of visit 4 (week 8), the device attached to the ambulatory blood pressure non-dominant arm of the patient. The difference between mean-hour maximum SBP mean-hour minimum SBP between 1 am and 8 am was measured.</description>
          <population>Intent to treat population included all randomized patients who had received at least one dose of study drug. It also excluded all those patients from centers that reported more than 90% of BP measurements rounded to 0 or 5. Patients with ABPM measurements over 24 hours were included in this analysis.</population>
