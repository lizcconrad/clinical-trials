  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, cross-over study evaluated the effect of tocilizumab (TCZ) on
      the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a common oral contraceptive (OC) in female
      patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in healthy female volunteers of child
      bearing age. The RA patients received OC in combination with TCZ, whereas the healthy
      volunteers received OC only. The RA patients received OC in 3 cycles of 21 days each; TCZ 8
      mg/kg was administered once as an intravenous infusion on the first day of Cycle 2. The
      healthy volunteers received OC for only one 21-day cycle.

    <description>Blood samples were collected prior to the administration of Ortho-Novum® 1/35 on Day 21 of each cycle. Serum levels of progesterone were quantitatively determined using the ADVIA Centaur and ADVIA Centaur XP systems (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Tarrytown, NY, USA).

          <title>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) of Ethinyl Estradiol and Norethindrone</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected prior to and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12 and 24 hours after administration of Ortho-Novum® 1/35 on Day 7 of each cycle. The concentrations of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were determined in human heparinized plasma according to a validated gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. The apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was derived from the plasma concentrations using a non-compartmental method and computed as dose/AUC0-24 with the software WinNonlin Enterprise version 5.2 (or above).</description>

The area under the serum concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUCinf) was derived from the serum concentrations using a non-compartmental method with the software WinNonlin Enterprise version 5.2 (or above). AUCinf was computed using the linear trapezoidal rule to tlast plus Clast/Kel, where tlast is the time of the last measurable concentration, Clast is the last measurable concentration, and Kel is the apparent elimination rate, computed as the magnitude of the slope from the log-linear regression of the apparent terminal elimination phase of the serum concentration-versus-time curve.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at the end of infusion of tocilizumab on Day 1 of Cycle 2. Additional blood samples were collected on Days 2, 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, 21 of Cycle 2, and Days 1, 7, and 21 of Cycle 3. The concentration of tocilizumab was determined in serum samples using a validated ELISA. The apparent volume of distribution (Vz), computed as CL/Kel where CL is clearance and Kel is the apparent elimination rate, was derived from the serum concentrations using a non-compartmental method with the software WinNonlin Enterprise version 5.2 (or above).</description>
