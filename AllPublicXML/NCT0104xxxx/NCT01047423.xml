  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholesterol and blood pressure lowering tablets have been shown to be of benefit in patients
      with established high blood pressure. High blood pressure is a very common medical condition
      that can lead to vascular complications i.e. problems with the blood vessels in the body. One
      way of detecting early changes in these blood vessels as a result of high blood pressure is
      to measure their compliance/flexibility with a noninvasive technique known as ultrasound and
      with a simple blood test. The investigators are trying to establish whether these early
      changes in blood vessels can be significantly improved by the use of both a cholesterol and
      blood pressure lowering tablet at an earlier stage than is currently advised. The
      investigators hope that the early combination of these tablets will prove more effective than
      the use of a blood pressure lowering tablet by itself and therefore possibly reduce the risk
      of long term complications developing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible for the study, all of the following criteria must be met:

               -  All patients must have a diagnosis of essential hypertension with off treatment
                  systolic pressure &gt;140 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure &gt;90 mmHg, measured at rest
                  in the seated position on at least two separate occasions, at least 2 weeks
                  apart.

               -  Patients will be &lt; 50 years for men and &lt; 60 years for women.

               -  Female patients of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted
                  means of contraception (that is, interuterine device, oral contraceptive,
                  implant, DepoProvera or barrier devices). Female patients of childbearing age
                  will be screened with a pregnancy test.

               -  Patients will be typically already on antihypertensive therapy.

               -  Patients must have a level of understanding sufficient to complete all tests and
                  examinations required by the protocol and are able to understand and give
                  informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

               -  A history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease,
                  hypertensive retinopathy, hypertensive nephropathy, left ventricular hypertrophy
                  or hyperlipidaemia warranting treatment as defined by the latest NICE guidelines
                  which recommend an age based treatment strategy rather than one driven purely by
                  lipid levels in isolation.

               -  Abnormal baseline liver function (defined as AST or ALT &gt; 3 times upper limit of
                  normal), raised baseline creatinine kinase (CK) (defined as CK &gt; 200 mmol/L),
                  severe renal impairment (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;
                  30 mls/minute) or previous adverse event relating to either an ARB or statin in
                  the past.

               -  Female patients will be excluded if they are pregnant, intend to be pregnant or
                  are lactating. Female patients of childbearing age will be screened with a
                  pregnancy test.
