      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of
      Photocyanine injection in photodynamic therapy of malignant tumor (especially skin cancer and
      esophageal cancer).

      Projected accrual: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photocyanine injection is a type of cyanine compound, which was invented in Fuzhou university
      by Professor Chen; it's maximum absorption wave is 670 nm. Patients receive intravenous
      injection of Photocyanine injection, and 24 hours later, patients undergo photodynamic
      therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Photocyanine Injection and photodynamic
      therapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 1 of 3 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Three additional
      patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 2 weeks.
