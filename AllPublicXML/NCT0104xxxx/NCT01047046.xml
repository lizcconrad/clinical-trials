  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective chart review including all patients who received surgical
      placement of a SNM device with Dr. Noblett from 2001 to the present.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following data will be collected from patient charts: age at time of surgery,
      gravidity/parity, body mass index, pre-existing medical conditions/surgical history, current
      medications, menopausal status, form and severity of OAB symptoms, other previously or
      currently used interventions, method of SNM device placement, observed motor/sensory
      response, percent improvement of symptoms, follow-up OAB symptoms, frequency of InterStim
      settings adjustments, adverse events, significant changes in health, and incidence/reason for
      drop out.

    <description>Patients who have undergone a placement of a SNM device to treat refractory OAB. A retrospective chart review will be performed on all patients who underwent a one or two-stage placement of an SNM device, which includes an implantable pulse generator (IPG), for refractory urge incontinence and urgency frequency symptoms. The patients will be those of Dr. Karen Noblett, having their device placed after 2001.</description>
