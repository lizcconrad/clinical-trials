    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter phase 2 open-label single-arm study that will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of TAK-700 in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) without
      radiographic evidence of metastases who have a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA).
