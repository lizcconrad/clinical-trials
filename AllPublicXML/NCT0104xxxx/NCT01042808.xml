      This survey is conducted for preparing application materials for re-examination under the
      Pharmaceutical Affairs Laws and its Enforcement Regulation, its aim is to reconfirm the
      clinical usefulness of Isentress through collecting the safety and efficacy information in
      usual practice according to the Re-examination Regulation for New Drugs.

      Post-marketing surveys are not considered applicable clinical trials and thus the results of
      this survey will not be posted at its conclusion. The results will be submitted to public
      health officials as required by applicable national and international laws.
