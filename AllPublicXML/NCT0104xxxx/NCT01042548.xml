  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a case control study involving comparisons of tissue interstitial fluid
      from breast cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissue as well as that from benign breast
      lesion and its adjacent non-diseased tissue for a distinguishable breast cancer profile. The
      purpose of this research is to collect fresh breast nodule/cancer and surrounding
      non-cancerous tissue for proteomic studies of the interstitial fluid to identify a profile
      distinguishing breast cancer which will also permit future research on stored interstitial
      fluid, blood or tissue samples. Specific markers identified from interstitial fluid study
      will be investigated in blood samples to develop serum markers for breast cancer diagnosis
      and prognosis. Additionally, we will perform both prospective and retrospective research on
      breast cancer involving clinical, demographic, epidemiologic information, treatment,
      follow-up and outcomes on breast nodule/cancer cases collected.

      Subjects will be asked to allow us to collect an extra 2 tablespoons of blood at the time of
      pre-operative blood work. For those subjects with cancer who undergo surgery, a follow-up
      blood sample will be collected prior to chemotherapy, radiation, or hormonal therapy, and
      every six months afterwards at the time of their standard clinic/office visit for two years,
      then once a year for year 3-5. This will allow researchers to examine the samples to
      determine if blood changes over time after surgery, and what type of result may indicate a
      risk for recurrence.

      Any remaining blood samples not used for the study will remain in the laboratory for future
      research.

        All patients who are receiving or seeking medical care at the UPMC St. Margaret for breast
        cancer will be invited to participate in the research study. Patients undergoing surgery
        for breast nodules suspected of being cancer or high risk lesions will also be asked to
        participate.
