      The Automated Telephone Nutrition Support (ATNS) study investigates the effect of automated
      telephone nutrition support on diet and glycemic control among Spanish-speaking diabetics in
      Oakland.

      The Automated Telephone Nutrition Support (ATNS) study is a joint effort between the
      University of California at San Francisco, La Clinica de la Raza, and patients living with
      diabetes in Fruitvale (Oakland). Our goal is to see if motivated people with diabetes are
      able to get their blood sugar under better control by choosing a healthier diet. Since it's
      hard to eat a healthy diet, one of the ways we are trying to help is by calling people,
      having them record what they've eaten, and reminding them of the right foods to eat. The
      innovative part is using an automated telephone system to call them to have them record their
      dietary choices and giving them feedback immediately regarding what to modify as appropriate.

    <description>Patients in the intervention group will receive automated telephone calls at regular intervals twice a week. The system will be programmed to call them at these intervals until contact. The ATNS system will solicit information from them in a culture specific manner, inquiring as to what foods they are eating each meal, each day, and each month. The ATNS system will then make proactive suggestions regarding low glycemic index foods, giving encouragement and feedback as appropriate.</description>
