    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the overall effect of pH and fluoride concentration of liquid
      dentifrices in the control of children dental caries of a fluoridated area, through visual
      inspection and the quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) method. Toenail F
      concentration of a subsample of the children enrolled will be evaluated, in order to assess F
      bioavailability from these formulations and the evaluation of the concentration of fluoride
      incorporated into the biofilm will be done 6 months after initiation of the dentifrices use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dentifrices have been recognized as one of the contributors in the increased prevalence of
      dental fluorosis, due to the fact that children in early childhood usually eat lots of them
      during brushing. As an alternative to the reduction of fluorosis have been suggested to
      reduce the concentration of fluoride toothpaste, however, its efficacy is not well
      established, increasing when the pH of the toothpaste is acidic, with a greater diffusion of
      F in the enamel. Therefore, this study aims to assess the overall effect of pH and fluoride
      concentration of liquid dentifrices in the control of children dental caries of a fluoridated
      area. A randomized double-blind study will be conducted with approximately 360 children aged
      2 to 4 years old at public daycare centers located in a fluoridated area. Children will be
      examined by two examiners and classified according to caries activity. For 12 months,
      children will use 3 times a day, one of the toothpaste to be tested, with different
      concentrations of fluoride and pH. At the end of this period, children will be examined by
      the same examiners to check the progression of lesions. Clinical examinations should be
      performed by 2 calibrated examiners (kappa 0.8) at baseline and after 12 months. The
      diagnostic criteria of caries activity (active, inactive) and integrity of the surface of the
      lesion will be used. There will be a quantitative assessment of carious lesions fluorescence
      with a portable QLF equipment. In half of the sample, nails and plaque will be collected 6
      months after initiation of the dentifrices use. Samples of plaque will be analyzed for
      fluoride using an ion-specific electrode after diffusion with
      hexamethyldisiloxane-facilitated disiloxane (HMDS). The presence of nails F will be analyzed
      as described above. For statistical analysis will be used ANOVA and test for individual
      comparisons.

    <description>The lesions' progression or regression was evaluated by the data from the examinations at baseline and after 12 months. The net increment was calculated from the difference between lesions' progression and regression. The lesions were considered to have progressed when a sound surface or inactive noncavitated (INC) caries lesion was reevaluated after 12 months as an active noncavitated caries lesion (ANC) or cavity (untreated cavity or filled tooth). The lesions' regression was considered when an ANC lesion was reevaluated after 12 months as INC lesion or sound surface.</description>

    <description>The white spot lesions' progression was also determined by the QLF in a subsample of 75 caries-active children. The images were captured from the deciduous teeth which had at least one smooth surface with a clinically visible ANC. For every lesion, the fluorescence change (∆F in %) and the area of the lesion (mm^2)(baseline - 12 months)were calculated by the software at the QLF threshold of 5%. A negative ∆F value indicates caries regression.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This randomized, double-blind clinical trial was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Bauru Dental School (protocol 016/2009). It involved 2 to 4-year-old children that attended five public primary schools, each localized in a different geographical region of Bauru, São Paulo, Brazil (0.6–0.8 ppm F in the drinking water).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>From 876 children of the 5 selected schools, 487 did not fill the informed consent. From those who filled the informed consen, 74 missed the clinical examination day or filled the exclusion criteria (had participated in other researches in the last 3 months or children using orthodontic appliances). The total number of children enrolled was 315.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Caries Progression in Caries-active Children After 1 Year, According to the Type of Dentifrice Used</title>
        <description>The lesions' progression or regression was evaluated by the data from the examinations at baseline and after 12 months. The net increment was calculated from the difference between lesions' progression and regression. The lesions were considered to have progressed when a sound surface or inactive noncavitated (INC) caries lesion was reevaluated after 12 months as an active noncavitated caries lesion (ANC) or cavity (untreated cavity or filled tooth). The lesions' regression was considered when an ANC lesion was reevaluated after 12 months as INC lesion or sound surface.</description>
        <time_frame>baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
        <population>The sample size was based on a previous trial (Lima et al., 2008). Accordingly, 24 children per dentifrice treatment resulted in a 85% power (α=0.05) for detecting difference of 0.23 and 0.65 in caries increment in the caries-inactive and caries-active groups, respectively. All the children that remained in the study after 12 months were analyzed.</population>

        <title>Caries Progression in Caries-active Children After 1 Year, According to the Type of Dentifrice Used Assessed by the Quantitative Light Induced Method (QLF)(Fluorescence Change (∆F in %))</title>
        <description>The white spot lesions' progression was also determined by the QLF in a subsample of 75 caries-active children. The images were captured from the deciduous teeth which had at least one smooth surface with a clinically visible ANC. For every lesion, the fluorescence change (∆F in %) and the area of the lesion (mm^2)(baseline – 12 months)were calculated by the software at the QLF threshold of 5%. A negative ∆F value indicates caries regression.</description>
