  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy to the whole brain is standard treatment for cancer that has spread to the brain
      (brain metastases) as it treats both the metastases that can be seen on scans and the brain
      metastases that are too small to be seen on scans.

      This study will use a novel radiotherapy technique, called volumetric modulated arc therapy
      (VMAT), to treat patients with brain metastases. This technique allows delivery of both a
      standard radiation dose to the whole brain as well as a higher radiation dose to the brain
      metastases at the same time.

      The study will assess the effectiveness of using VMAT in treating brain metastases, and
      examine its potential side-effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II prospective clinical trial. Following registration, patients will be
      required to undertake a baseline questionnaire assessment of daily living activities using
      the Modified Barthel's index, as well as cognitive assessment using MMSE.

      Patients will undergo MRI scan of the brain for radiotherapy planning purposes. During
      radiotherapy planning and for each of the five radiotherapy fractions, patients will be
      immobilised in a custom fitted stereotactic mask system, to minimise head movement. During
      treatment, patients will have daily online setup corrections to ensure treatment accuracy.

      Patients will be treated with WBRT/SIB using VMAT, delivering a total of 20 Gy in 5 fractions
      to the whole brain and 50Gy in 5 fractions to the brain metastases, delivered once daily on
      working days. Anti-nausea and anti-inflammatory medication will be prescribed to minimise
      acute toxicity.

      Following therapy completion, patients will be seen every 3 months for the 1st year, then
      every 6 months thereafter. At each clinic visit, clinicians or study investigators will
      monitor for toxicity from therapy, document neurologic symptoms and signs and performance
      status as well as Modified Barthel's index and cognitive assessment.

      Patients will have contrast-enhanced MRI brain at 3 months and 1 year, and contrast-enhanced
      CT brain at 6 months and 9 months in the first year and every 6 months after the first year.
      Serum creatinine levels will be done prior to each scan to ensure safety of intravenous
      contrast administration.
