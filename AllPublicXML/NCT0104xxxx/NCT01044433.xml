    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving capecitabine together with lapatinib ditosylate may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine and lapatinib
      ditosylate together works in treating patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and
      neck.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Overall survival (OS) will be the primary endpoint.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival (PFS). II. Time to disease progression and sites of progression.
      III. Response rate. IV. Toxicity of the combination in this population. V. Quality of life.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-21 and oral capecitabine
      twice daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3
      months for up to 5 years.
