    <description>The study will involve up to 20 patients to be enrolled using the GARDEX system during clinically indicated percutaneous intervention of SVG and followed through 30 days post procedure. Patients will be enrolled at up to 3 investigative sites. The study is a prospective multi center registry with sequential enrollment of qualified patients who consent to participate and meet the eligibility criteria.</description>

    <description>GARDEX is an embolic protection system to contain and remove embolic material (thrombus/debris) during cardiovascular interventions.
The diameter of the vessel at the site of filter basket placement should be between 3.5 mm to 6.0 mm. The GARDEX Embolic Protection System may be used with commercially available 0.014&quot; guide wires.</description>

             diphenhydramine and/or steroids.

          -  Myocardial infarction with documented total CK&gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal
             within the past 24 hours, or currently experiencing an acute myocardial infarction.

          -  A stroke or transient ischemic attach (TIA) within the past 2 months.

          -  A history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.
