      Aliskiren is a potent direct renin inhibitor and has been recently shown to have favorable
      neurohumoral effects in patients with heart failure (HF) Objective：To study the effects of
      add-on aliskiren treatment in patients with HF on components of arterial load, from central
      aorta to peripheral arterioles and biomarkers Methods：Patients with NYHA Class II to IV HF,
      who have been treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin
      receptor blocker (ARB) and beta-blocker are randomized to 6 months of treatment with placebo
      or aliskiren (150mg per day) treatment. Components of arterial load, from central aorta to
      peripheral arterioles as well as a wide-range of biomarkers, including inflammatory
      biomarkers, N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, arterial remodeling markers
      (procollagen, matrix metalloproteinase) will be measured before, 2 months and 6 months after
      treatment.

      What is New or Innovative in this study? The importance of central hemodynamics and biomarker
      changes in patients with HF has been shown in observation studies. This is the first
      randomized control trial that examines comprehensively the effects of a direct rennin
      inhibitor on central hemodynamics and biomarkers in HF patients who are receiving standard
      heart failure therapy.
