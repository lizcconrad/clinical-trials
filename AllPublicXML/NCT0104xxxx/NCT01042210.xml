  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is focused on the investigation of possible associations between plasma/serum
      levels of agouti related peptide (AgRP) and its genetic background in healthy women with
      physiological pregnancy (non-preeclamptic) and women with preeclampsia, in the postpartum
      period, and in their offspring.
