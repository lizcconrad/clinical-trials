    <description>Number of participants who were a success with regard to worst post-baseline tolerability assessment scores in each category of the tolerability assessments from baseline to week 3. Tolerability assessments (erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning) are evaluated on a scale from 0 - 4 (0 = None, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, 3 = Severe) with 0 being best and 4 being worst. Success for each category was defined as a tolerability score of 0.</description>
