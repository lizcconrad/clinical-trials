  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A substantial body of evidence implicates the endogenous opioid system, and the mu opioid
      receptor (MOR) in particular, in the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse, including
      nicotine. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the mu opioid receptor gene (OPRM1 Asp40)
      is associated with the ability to quit smoking, as well as nicotine reward and withdrawal
      symptoms. However, the precise mechanism through which this SNP influences nicotine
      dependence remains unresolved. This positron emission tomography (PET) study will examine
      whether this OPRM1 SNP alters MOR binding in response to nicotine in human smokers.
      Specifically, we will use [11 C]carfentanil PET imaging to assess the effects of intravenous
      (IV) nicotine versus saline (within-subject) on MOR binding potential in 24 chronic smokers
      genotyped prospectively and stratified by OPRM1 genotype.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a mixed factorial design with one between subject factor (OPRM1 genotype_:
      Asn40/Asn40 vs. Asn40/Asp40 or Asp40/Asp40) and one within-subject factor (IV nicotine vs. IV
      saline) to examine genotype by nicotine interactions on MOR binding potential (BP_ND )
      assessed via PET imaging with [11 C]carfentanil. Twenty-four smokers (12 male, 12 female; 12
      from each genotype group) will participate in two 90 minute PET sessions following overnight
      (14-hours) abstinence from nicotine. Genotype groups will be matched for age and sex . One
      week prior to the first PET session, there will be an adaptation session during which
      participants will receive IV saline followed 30 minutes later by IV nicotine (1 mg/70 kg) to
      ensure that they tolerate the procedure. In the PET sessions, participants will receive
      either IV nicotine (1 mg/70 kg) or saline (within-subject, double blind, counterbalanced).
      The primary outcomes will be BP_ND in ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
      Normally menstruating women will be scheduled for their sessions during the early follicular
      phase. Sessions will be separated by 1 month for all participants to reduce variability in
      MOR binding due to hormonal changes during females menstrual cycles. Participants will
      complete subjective measures of nicotine reward and craving at each session.

      The samples that shall be collected for this study are as follows:

        1. A 2ml saliva sample will be collected for DNA extraction using the Oragene™ kit at the
           Medical screening session for genetic analyses.

        2. An additional saliva sample (~ 5ml) will be also be collected at Medical screening and
           will be used to analyze baseline nicotine metabolites (i.e., cotinine and
           3-hydroxycotinine).

        3. All participants will provide two tubes of blood (10 ml each) to measure plasma
           estradiol &amp; cortisol levels before each PET scanning session. They will also provide two
           tubes of blood (10 ml each) at the end of the scan to measure plasma nicotine and
           cortisol levels.
