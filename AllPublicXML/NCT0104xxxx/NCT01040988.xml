  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) has
      substantially changed the medical and surgical management of patients with cardiac rhythm
      disease. In the case of patients with ICDs, these devices are programmed to deliver a strong
      electrical shocks. In adults, multiple studies have suggested that patients at risk of
      receiving shocks from their device have an increased prevalence of anxiety and depression.
      Very few studies have looked at this question in children. We propose to evaluate a cohort of
      patients age 6 to 20 with ICDs, compared to a cohort of patients with pacemakers, assessing
      each group for the presence of depressive and anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD).
