      This is a single-center open label study of the IL-1 transfusion protein rilonacept in
      subjects with Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), or Schnitzler syndrome (SchS) in Germany.
      Prospective subjects will be recruited from a patient population previously characterized in
      an observational study, and from referrals within the German CAPS community; SchS subjects
      will be recruited through the Charité Patient pool.

      The Baseline phase will begin with the Screening visit (day -21 = Visit 1) and continue for
      three weeks; DHAFs (Daily Health Assessment Forms) will be collected from all subjects from
      Day - 21 to Day 0. DHAF information including MWAS (Muckle-Wells Activity Score), or SCHAS
      (Schnitzler Activity Score) values from this period will be used for the baseline phase
      evaluation. Inclusion to receive rilonacept will occur on day 0 (= Visit 2).

      On day 0 eligible subjects will receive a loading dose of two subcutaneous (S.C.) injections
      of rilonacept for a total of 320 mg. Subsequent study drug injections of rilonacept 160 mg
      will be administered once a week for four weeks. After subjects complete this initial 4-week
      treatment phase, they will be eligible to receive rilonacept 160 mg once weekly for 48 weeks
      during the extended treatment phase.

      DHAFs will be used to assess symptoms throughout the study. Overall a max. of 12 subjects
      with either MWS or SchS will be enrolled.
