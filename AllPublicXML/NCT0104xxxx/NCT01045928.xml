      RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving lenalidomide together with rituximab
      may be an effective treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide
      when given together with rituximab as maintenance therapy in treating patients with B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      The study was originally intended to be Phase I/Phase II but it terminated early because of
      toxicity of treatment and therefore never moved to the Phase II portion of the study.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of
      lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in subjects with B-cell NHL following ASCT. (Phase
      I) II. To evaluate the tolerability of maintenance therapy with lenalidomide and rituximab
      after ASCT in subjects with B-cell NHL. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate the progression-free survival of subjects with B-cell
      NHL receiving maintenance therapy with lenalidomide and rituximab after ASCT. II. To examine
      whether potential effects of lenalidomide and rituximab on progression-free survival after
      ASCT, compared with historical controls, vary according to histologic subtype of B-cell NHL.
      III. To correlate potential associations between peripheral blood levels of lymphocyte
      subsets including NK, T, and B cells and progression-free survival after ASCT in enrolled
      subjects. IV. To evaluate potential associations between progression-free survival after ASCT
      and polymorphisms at position 158 of FCgammaRIIIa receptor in enrolled subjects.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21of all courses and
      rituximab IV on day 1of courses 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.
