    <textblock>
      This is a 3 months single centre clinical patient-oriented study to evaluate the prevalence
      and impairment in QOL of dermatologic diseases in patients hospitalised in internal medicine.

      Up to 200 patients hospitalised at the division of internal medicine for any reason are going
      to be offered participation by a patient information form given to patients at the time of
      admission, as well as oral information about the study. Written informed consent will be
      obtained by the investigators after patients have had adequate time to consider their
      participation in the study.

      Participating patients will be examined clinically for dermatologic pathologies at a single
      visit. In the case of signs of dermatologic disease, investigators are going to recommend
      further diagnostic procedures to the physician in charge and/or the referring physician,
      depending on the urgency of the suspected diagnosis. This procedure is meant to avoid giving
      referring physicians the impression that active patient acquisition for the department of
      Dermatology is an aim of this study. Diagnostic procedures that are performed upon suspicion
      of a specific dermatologic disease at the Division of Internal Medicine are going to be
      performed during the hospitalisation period. All other diagnostic or operative procedures are
      going to be advised to the referring physician.

      Study participants are going to be interviewed by the investigators about impairment in QOL
      of their illnesses. Two separate questionnaires are going to be filled in by each
      participant. For measurement of general QOL, the widely used SF-12 questionnaire (8
      questions) is going to be used. To measure specific impairment in QOL by dermatologic
      disease, participants are going to be asked to fill in the DLQI (Dermatology life quality
      index, 10 questions). Photographic documentation of specific identified lesions will be made
      and pictures stored exclusively in the secured electronic patient file (KISIM). Medication
      and all identified diseases will be noted. All diagnostically useful information is going to
      be recorded in the patient file and transmitted to the referring physician in the discharge
      letter.
