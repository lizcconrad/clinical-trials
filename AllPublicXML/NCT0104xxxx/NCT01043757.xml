  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be employees of Genzyme who volunteer to participate in a study on
      motivating healthy behaviors, involving giving them goals for taking a certain number of
      steps per day, and increasing that number over time. Participants will wear pedometers and
      upload their data to a website that allows them to monitor their progress, and have the
      opportunity to win money based on meeting their step goals.

      Interested employees will schedule a day and time to complete a health screening at a &quot;Health
      Fair&quot; at their place of employment, to ensure that they are healthy enough to participate; at
      this time participants will also complete the investigators baseline dependent measures, and
      receive a pedometer. After a one-week baseline period during which they wear the pedometer
      and the investigators establish their typical number of steps per day, eligible participants
      will then be assigned to one of four treatments - a &quot;no incentive&quot; control condition, and
      three conditions in which they are entered into different kinds of monetary lotteries if they
      have met their step goals for that day. Participants' initial goal will be based on their
      steps during the baseline period, and the goal will increase by 250 steps each week, for a
      total of 12 weeks. After these 3 months, the incentives portion of the experiment ends, but
      participants continue to wear their pedometers and upload their data for an additional 6
      months. At 3 months, 6 months, and then at the study end at 9 months, participants again
      complete the investigators dependent measures at follow-up Health Fairs at their place of
      employment.

    <description>Receives control intervention plus are incentivized to attain their daily step goals through daily lotteries:
Each day, we will draw a two-digit number. If the first digit OR the second digit of this daily number matches the participant's lucky number, they win the small jackpot. If both digits match, they receive the large jackpot. Participants who meet their step goal for the day and who upload their data will be entered into the same lottery each day, where the small jackpot is $10 and the large jackpot is $100.</description>

Each day, we will draw a two-digit number. If the first digit OR the second digit of this daily number matches the participant's lucky number, they win the small jackpot. If both digits match, they receive the large jackpot.
Participants can increase their daily jackpots by meeting their step goals. Those who meet their goal for the first day of the week and who upload their data will be entered into a lottery where the small jackpot is $4 and the large jackpot is $40; if they successfully meet their step goal on the first day of the week, the jackpots for the second day increase to $6/$60, and so on such that if they reach their goals each day, the jackpots on day seven will reach $16/$160.</description>

    <description>Receives control intervention plus incentivized to attain daily step goals through lotteries:
Daily drawing procedure same as Ascending condition; structure of incentives is different: Participants can decrease their daily jackpots by failing to meet their step goals. Those who meet their goal for the first day of the week and who upload their data will be entered into a lottery where the small jackpot is $16 and the large jackpot is $160; if they successfully meet their step goal on the first day of the week, the jackpots will remain at $16/$160; if they do not meet their goal the jackpots will decrease to $14/$140, and so on such that if they fail to reach their goals each day, the jackpots on day seven will decrease to $4/$40.</description>

    <description>Throughout the 12-week intervention, participants will receive step goals. The step goals will increase by 250 steps per week, The intervention will last a total of 12 weeks. After each seven-day week, step goals will increase by an additional 250 steps - thus over the 12 weeks, participants will be asked to increase their daily step count by 3,000. Participants will receive financial incentives to attain these step goals; the incentive schemes differ according to intervention arm.</description>
