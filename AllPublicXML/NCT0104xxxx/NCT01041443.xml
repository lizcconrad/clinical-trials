  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine
      (FdCyd) when given together with tetrahydrouridine (THU) in treating patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). FdCyd may inhibit cancer cell
      growth by increasing the production in cells of compounds that suppress growth or by
      otherwise killing cells. Although FdCyd is stable as a drug solution, it is rapidly
      inactivated by an enzyme present in people. THU is included in the treatment to inhibit the
      enzyme, prolonging the time FdCyd remains in the body

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FdCyd administered with a fixed
      dose of THU in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS), once daily on days 1-10 of a 21-day treatment cycle. II. To describe the toxicities of
      FdCyd/THU in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS). III. To document all clinical responses and hematologic improvement in patients
      treated with FdCyd/THU. IV. To obtain preliminary information regarding the effect of
      FdCyd/THU on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells and bone marrow aspirates, including malignant myeloid cells; the ratio of gamma- to
      beta-globin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in blood cells; and serum cytokines. OUTLINE:
      This is a dose-escalation study of FdCyd. Patients receive FdCyd intravenously (IV) over 3
      hours and THU IV over 3 hours on days 1-10. Courses repeat every 21days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients
      are followed up for 4 weeks.
