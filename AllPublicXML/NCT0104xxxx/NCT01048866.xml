    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study is to demonstrate the analgesic efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg
      lozenge compared to its vehicle lozenge and to demonstrate the safety of the flurbiprofen
      lozenge throughout the course of treating sore throat due to acute pharyngitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Per randomization to the treatments and under double-blind conditions, patients were
      instructed to suck 1 sugar-based, flavoured flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge or 1 sugar-based,
      flavoured matching vehicle control/placebo lozenge and remained at the study center for a
      2-hour observation period to assess their responses to the study medication during the
      initial 2-hour post-dose period. Patients were allowed a dose of rescue medication
      (acetaminophen 650mg), as needed, post-treatment dosing during the study.

      After the initial 2 hours in the research center, patients were discharged with an outpatient
      diary to continue (while awake) to document hourly assessments of Sore Throat Pain Intensity
      Scale (STPIS), Difficulty Swallowing Scale (DSS), and Swollen Throat Scale (SwoTS) through 24
      hours. They used the assigned lozenges as needed every 3-6 hours, up to 5 lozenges over 24
      hours. A Follow-Up Visit was conducted for the 24-hour assessments.

      Patients received additional study lozenges for use as needed (up to 5 lozenges per 24 hours)
      over the following 6 days, rescue medication (acetaminophen 650 mg) and a Diary to document
      their safety and efficacy assessments immediately before and postdose after each as-needed
      use of a lozenge for the remaining days in the 7-day treatment period. At the end of the
      7-day trial, patients returned to the research center for final assessments, review of
      adverse events over the week, and discharge from the study.

    <measure>Time Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) in Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS) Over the 24 Hours Post-baseline (STPIS SPID24)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (pre-dose), post-dose - hourly up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>STPIS measures sore throat pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale completed by participants. A mark at 0-mm indicates no pain upon swallowing and 100-mm indicates severe pain. SPID24 was calculated as the sum of the time weighted pain intensity differences from baseline until 24 hours. The full range was -104412 (complete pain relief within 1 hour of dosing that lasts 24 hours) to 27588 (maximum pain within 1 hour lasting 24 hours) using the mean baseline STPIS.
Participants with a last recorded time point &lt;21 hours were considered Not Evaluable. If a participant used rescue medication, all post-rescue STPIS values in the 24-hour interval were assigned the baseline value for STPIS. Missing scores of STPIS with non-missing STPIS scores at earlier and later assessments were imputed using linear interpolation assuming the time of the missing assessment to be the nominal time since initial dose.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 2-7</time_frame>
    <description>The time weighted summed differences over 2 hours after taking a lozenge after the initial 24-hours post-baseline.
STPIS is a validated 100-mm visual analog scale completed by participants that measures &quot;pain on swallowing&quot; (odynophagia). A mark at 0-mm indicates no pain and 100-mm indicates severe pain. SPID2 was calculated as the sum of the time-weighted pain intensity differences from a measurement taken prior to taking a lozenge and at hours 1 + 2 after taking the lozenge during Days 2-7. Data for multiple doses/days were averaged to obtain the values used for calculating SPID2. The full range for SPID2 was -5843 to 6157 with negative values indicating improvement in pain intensity. Assessments were summarized using a repeated measures mixed model, with treatment and center as a fixed effect, time since Baseline as a covariate, and a random effect for participants.</description>

        <title>Time Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) in Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS) Over the 24 Hours Post-baseline (STPIS SPID24)</title>
        <description>STPIS measures sore throat pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale completed by participants. A mark at 0-mm indicates no pain upon swallowing and 100-mm indicates severe pain. SPID24 was calculated as the sum of the time weighted pain intensity differences from baseline until 24 hours. The full range was -104412 (complete pain relief within 1 hour of dosing that lasts 24 hours) to 27588 (maximum pain within 1 hour lasting 24 hours) using the mean baseline STPIS.

          <title>Time Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) in Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS) Over the 24 Hours Post-baseline (STPIS SPID24)</title>
          <description>STPIS measures sore throat pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale completed by participants. A mark at 0-mm indicates no pain upon swallowing and 100-mm indicates severe pain. SPID24 was calculated as the sum of the time weighted pain intensity differences from baseline until 24 hours. The full range was -104412 (complete pain relief within 1 hour of dosing that lasts 24 hours) to 27588 (maximum pain within 1 hour lasting 24 hours) using the mean baseline STPIS.
Participants with a last recorded time point &lt;21 hours were considered Not Evaluable. If a participant used rescue medication, all post-rescue STPIS values in the 24-hour interval were assigned the baseline value for STPIS.

          <title>Time Weighted Summed Differences in Swollen Throat Scale (SwoTS) During the Initial 24 Hours From Baseline</title>
          <description>SwoTS measures how swollen a participant's throat felt using a 100-mm visual analog scale completed by participants. Participants were instructed to swallow and &quot;Place a line on the scale that best characterizes how swollen your throat feels now.&quot; A mark at 0-mm indicated not swollen and 100-mm indicated very swollen.
The full range of the sum of the time-weighted swollen throat differences from baseline until 24 hours was -100320 (throat did not feel swollen at all within 1 hour of dosing and lasted 24 hours) to 31680 (maximum swollen throat reported within 1 hour and lasting 24 hours) using the mean baseline SwoTS. Negative values for differences indicate improvement.</description>

        <title>Time Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) in Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS) Over the 2 Hours Post-baseline (STPIS SPID2)</title>
        <description>STPIS measures sore throat pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale completed by participants. A mark at 0-mm indicates no pain upon swallowing and 100-mm indicates severe pain. SPID2 was calculated as the sum of the time weighted pain intensity differences from baseline until 2 hours post dose. The full range was -9492 (complete pain relief within one hour of dosing that lasts 2 hours) to 2508 (maximum pain within 1 hour lasting 2 hours) using the mean baseline STPIS.
If a participant used rescue medication (acetaminophen 650mg was allowed as needed post dose), all post-rescue STPIS values in the 24-hour interval were assigned the baseline value for STPIS. Missing scores of STPIS with non-missing STPIS scores at earlier and later assessments (recorded or derived due to rescue) were imputed using linear interpolation assuming the time of the missing assessment to be the nominal time since initial dose.</description>

        <description>STPIS measures sore throat pain intensity on a 100-mm visual analog scale completed by participants. A mark at 0-mm indicates no pain upon swallowing and 100-mm indicates severe pain. For the subgroup of patients with moderate/severe pharyngeal inflammation at baseline, SPID24 was calculated as the sum of the time weighted pain intensity differences from baseline until 24 hours. Taking inclusion criteria into account, the full range was -115695 (no pain at any post-dose time (0) – average baseline) to 28505 (maximum possible pain (100) – average baseline).
Participants with their last recorded time point &lt;21 hours were considered Not Evaluable.

        <title>Post 24 Hour, Multiple Dose Results: Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) Over 2 Hours for the Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS SPID2)</title>
        <description>The time weighted summed differences over 2 hours after taking a lozenge after the initial 24-hours post-baseline.
STPIS is a validated 100-mm visual analog scale completed by participants that measures “pain on swallowing” (odynophagia). A mark at 0-mm indicates no pain and 100-mm indicates severe pain. SPID2 was calculated as the sum of the time-weighted pain intensity differences from a measurement taken prior to taking a lozenge and at hours 1 + 2 after taking the lozenge during Days 2-7. Data for multiple doses/days were averaged to obtain the values used for calculating SPID2. The full range for SPID2 was -5843 to 6157 with negative values indicating improvement in pain intensity. Assessments were summarized using a repeated measures mixed model, with treatment and center as a fixed effect, time since Baseline as a covariate, and a random effect for participants.</description>

        <description>The time weighted summed differences over 2 hours after taking a lozenge for all lozenges taken after the initial 24-hours post-baseline.
To measure the functional effect on pharyngitis, the participant was asked to evaluate his/her difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) using a 100-mm visual analog scale prior to dosing, and 1 hour and 2 hours post dose. The participant was instructed to swallow and “Place a line on the scale that best characterizes how difficult it is to swallow now.” A mark at 0-mm indicated not difficult and 100-mm indicated very difficult. Data for multiple doses/days were averaged to obtain the values used for calculating DSS2. The full range for differences was -5626 to 6374 with negative values indicating improvement in pain intensity.
