  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer diagnosis is a rapidly expanding research field, whose early-stage detection
      may reduce the burden of the disease and permit more effective treatment. It is well
      documented that tumor growth requires specific conditions for its development from the
      occurrence of a mutation to a clinically detectable cancer. It has been shown that living
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have different ability of cytosolic enzymes
      (esterases) to convert hydrophobic substrate fluorescein diacetate (FDA) into hydrophilic
      fluorescent fluorescein. It depends on PBMC cycle stage, size, surface state, physiological
      states, such as activation and apoptosis.

      The important step of breast cancer genesis is the early change of functional activity of
      cytosolic enzymes (esterases) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such transformations in
      PBMC may be detected accurately by an existing device Flowcytometer (FACS™ MultiSET™ System,
      company &quot;Becton Dickinson&quot; GmbH, USA), where measurements of fluorescence polarization and
      enzymatic hydrolysis of FDA substrate are recorded. A conclusion about presentation of breast
      cancer among examined women is achieved by &quot;CDT&quot; (cancer detection technology) software,
      which analyzes mathematically the results of fluorescence polarization and enzymatic
      hydrolysis.

      Moreover, the combined biochemical model together with additional prognostic parameters (such
      as age, ethnic group, gynecological and obstetric anamnesis) increases the validity
      (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) of the diagnostic conclusion.

      Diagnostic Solution of the CDT:

        1. Mathematical processing of specific blood analysis in device Flowcytometer.

        2. Mathematical evaluation of specific prognostic parameters

        Breast cancer patients over age 40 before treatment. Healthy women recruited in Check Up
        institute from asymptomatic women over age 40, referred to screening mammography and
        received the negative result of mammography.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria for Breast Cancer Patients for Experimental Group:

          1. Patient is over the age of 40.

          2. Patient is willing to participate as evidenced by signing the written informed consent
             form.

          3. Patient referred to the Department of Oncology/ Surgery for operative treatment of
             breast cancer with previously detected disease. Positive conventional tests finding
             can include (but not limited to) the record of screening or diagnostic mammography,
             blood oncomarkers, breast ultrasound, breast CT, biopsy.

          4. Non-treated patients (w/o previous chemotherapy, hormonal drugs and radiotherapy).

          5. Patient without other cancer locations

        Inclusion Criteria for Presumably Healthy Subjects for Control Group:

          1. Subjects over the age of 40.

          2. Subjects who are willing to participate as evidenced by signing the written informed
             consent form.

          3. Subjects who are presumably healthy and without breast pathologies' symptoms and
             family history of breast cancer, i.e., breast disease (except history of functional
             breast problems, e.g., mastitis within lactation period) has been ruled out based on
             physician anamnesis

          4. Subjects with negative results of screening mammography.

          5. Subjects without taking of any hormonal medicines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with any known cancer in other internal organs or systems.

          2. Subjects with high fever presentation (more than 38.5).

          3. Subjects with known breast disease undergoing treatment for the disease.

          4. Pregnant or lactating women
