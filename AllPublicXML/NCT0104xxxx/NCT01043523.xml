  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical records are reviewed to obtain information about the use of a MRI diagnostic imaging
      agent (contrast agent) called Primovist/Eovist in children older than 2 months and less than
      18 years. Data that has been recorded in the child's medical records relating to the
      injection of Primovist/Eovist will be collected. Information will be collected from up to 2
      weeks before the child received Primovist/Eovist until 12 months after the child received
      Primovist/Eovist. Copy of the child's MR images that were taken right before and after the
      child received Primovist/Eovist and all other reports (laboratory reports, other imaging
      reports, etc) that are part of the child's medical records during that time period will be
      collected.
