  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reports of the use of intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech) for the reduction of
      neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy have demonstrated significant
      regression in the number of new vessels. Reducing the vascularity of neovascular
      fibrovascular tissue can potentially reduce bleeding intraoperatively and thus facilitate the
      vitrectomy procedure. The investigators chose to investigate the potential benefit of the use
      of preoperative bevacizumab in the management of these most complex cases.

      PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of preoperative intravitreal bevacizumab as an adjunct to
      vitrectomy in the management of severe diabetic eye disease.

      SETTINGS: Kasr El-Aini Teaching Hospital - Cairo University from 2007 to 2008. METHODS:
      Twenty eyes of 19 patients with severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy were recruited into
      the study. All eyes underwent a single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab 1.25 mg in 0.05
      ml one week prior to vitrectomy for tractional (14), combined tractional/rhegmatogenous
      retinal detachment (4), and fibrovascular tissue covering/distorting the macula (2).
      Exclusion criteria were: previous vitrectomy, neovascular glaucoma, and dense media opacity
      (dense cataract and vitreous hemorrhage) precluding fluorescein angiography (FA) that was
      done pre- and 1 week post injections. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), anterior segment
      with dilated fundus examinations, and intraocular pressures (IOP), were done pre-, 1 week
      post-injections, 1 day, 1 week and monthly for 3 months post-vitrectomy. Intra- and
      post-operative bleedings were recorded.
