  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in industrialized countries, and is
      the most common indication for liver transplantation. In the Western world, the absolute
      majority of cases of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection are related to the use of injectable
      narcotic drugs. Most injecting drug users contract HCV infection within the first years after
      starting injecting drug use. The aim of this study is to study hepatitis C in a cohort of
      patients registered in clinics providing maintenance therapy for opiate dependence in three
      metropolitan areas of Sweden. The cohort is defined as all patients registered in these three
      clinics at the date of study initiation. The study contains four parts:

      Part I: the first part of the study aims to evaluate the prevalence of HCV exposure in the
      cohort and the proportion of anti-HCV positive participants with chronic infection.

      Part II: Patients with chronic HCV infection will be offered further investigation of chronic
      liver disease, including liver biopsy, for selection of candidates for antiviral therapy and
      identification of risk factors for development of severe liver disease.

      Part III: Based on the results of these investigations, patients will be considered for
      antiviral therapy. Indications for such therapy will mainly be clinical and/or histological
      signs of chronic liver disease with fibrosis. All patients will receive weight-based doses of
      pegylated interferon-alfa-2b and ribavirin.

      Part IV: Study of pharmacokinetic interactions between ribavirin and opiate substitution
      molecule (methadone or buprenorphine) in patients receiving antiviral therapy according to
      part III.
