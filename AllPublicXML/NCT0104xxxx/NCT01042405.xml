      The aim of the study is to develop a simple computer program, evaluating nutritional status
      of HD patients. The programming will enable to perform a nutritional screening, based on
      biochemical measures, taken as part of HD patients' routine care every month. The program
      will identify patients at risk of malnutrition, define the degree of malnutrition, and
      identify patients who at risk for increased morbidity and mortality.

      30 patients will randomly be selected for SGA examination and comparison to the MARK results
      every month. Frequency and duration of hospitalizations within the 5-month collection period
      will documented, mortality will be documented as well. Effect of different nutritional
      supplementations or IDPN will be assessed. The MARK nutrition screening will be used for all
      patients at the beginning of every month. Monthly Biochemical data using a blood sample taken
      immediately before dialysis will be used to calculate a value between 0-100 showing patient's
      monthly nutritional status. Data for the SGA will be collected for the same dialysis patients
      randomly selected at the same month. The nutritional state of the patients according to the
      SGA will be assessed by two investigators. A statistical test will be held for agreement
      between observers (Cohen's k concordant coefficient).
