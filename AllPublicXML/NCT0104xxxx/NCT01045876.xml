  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many drugs are used to prevent nausea and vomiting and pain after surgery. In this study the
      investigators will be looking at a drug, dexamethasone, which is commonly used to prevent
      nausea and vomiting and pain after surgery but has other side effects. Dexamethasone is a
      man-made drug that is commonly used during surgery but also can affect naturally occuring
      hormones. In this study the investigators will be looking at dexamethasone's effect on a
      number of naturally occuring hormones over a twenty four hour period after thyroid surgery.
      The investigators hypothesize that plasma cortisol levels will be decreased following
      administration of dexamethasone.

      Purpose To examine the effect of dexamethasone, on plasma cortisol levels, postoperative
      pain, nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing thyroid surgery.

      Hypothesis That dexamethasone administered at induction of anesthesia will result in reduced
      plasma cortisol levels, postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting.

      Justification Dexamethasone is a synthetic steroid medication used routinely to prevent
      nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing general anesthetic. Administration of exogenous
      steroids can suppress production of endogenous steroids including cortisol.

      Currently, no data exists describing the degree of suppression of cortisol production by a
      single preoperative dose of dexamethasone. This information would guide physicians
      prescribing dexamethasone in the perioperative period.

      Objectives To compare plasma cortisol levels in patients receiving dexamethasone versus
      placebo at induction of anesthesia. To investigate the effect of dexamethasone on
      postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting.

      Research Methods A prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study conducted at a
      single center. Thirty patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to dexamethasone or
      placebo groups, in accordance with sample size calculations. A placebo group is necessary to
      eliminate the effects of potential confounding factors.

      Statistical Analysis An interim analysis will be conducted to confirm the sample size
      calculation. Plasma cortisol level will be analyzed using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
      Secondary outcome measures will be analyzed with appropriate parametric or nonparametric
      methods.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female adult patients

          -  Undergoing thyroid surgery
