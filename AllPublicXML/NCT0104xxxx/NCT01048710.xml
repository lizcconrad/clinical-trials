  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective multicenter study is to assess whether the
      functional outcome measured with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) for
      patients with medial unicompartmental osteoarthritis and osteonecrosis of the knee treated
      with open wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO) using the TomoFix™ Small is better than the
      functional outcome after conservative treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee (gonarthrosis) is a common medical condition and causes pain
      and disability. By 65 years of age, the majority of the US population has radiographic
      evidence of OA and 11% have symptomatic OA of the knee. In Japan, OA of the knee is more
      common due to the common sitting style with maximally flexed knees and parallel position of
      both legs.

      High Tibial Osteotomy (HTO) for knee OA is a standard procedure in orthopedic surgery. Six
      years ago, HTO using TomoFix™ was introduced. Because Asian people have different geometric
      dimensions of the tibiae, an adaptation of size and shape was necessary, and the new TomoFix™
      Small was developed. Although there is widespread literature concerning osteotomy for
      treating knee OA, literature assessing patient outcome after open wedge HTO using TomoFix™ is
      rare and for TomoFix™ Small, this data is still nonexistent. Therefore, the primary aim of
      the present multicenter study is to evaluate patient functional outcome using the KOOS. Since
      a proportion of patients with the indication for HTO refuse surgery and opt to receive
      conservative treatment, the functional results of patients treated with HTO using TomoFix™
      Small will be compared with these patients.

    <description>In the control group, patients who refused to have surgery will be allowed to be treated using different options of conservative treatment. The frequency of applications depends on the hospital and will therefore be documented in the study. An arthroscopy is not obligatory under this treatment group, but is permitted.
The following conservative treatment methods are allowed:
Physical therapy
Specific exercises for the muscles
Injections into the knee joint
Brace
Medication
No therapy</description>
