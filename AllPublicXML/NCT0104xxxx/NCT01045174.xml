  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Breath-Actuated Nebulizer is a newer type of nebulizer device that creates aerosol only
      when a patient is inhaling, rather than creating aerosol continuously. It is thought that
      breath-actuated nebulizer devices may deliver asthma rescue medications to patients' lungs
      more effectively and therefore lead them to recover from asthma attacks faster than
      conventional continuous-output nebulizer devices. This study compares outcomes including
      hospital admission rates, number of nebulized treatments required, and patient/family
      satisfaction when a breath-actuated nebulizer device versus a conventional continuous-output
      nebulizer is used to deliver asthma medications to pediatric asthma patients in the emergency
      department.
