      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ridaforolimus including the area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC[0-infinity]) and maximum concentration (Cmax) after
      administration of a single dose of ridaforolimus in patients with moderate hepatic
      insufficiency and healthy matched control subjects.
