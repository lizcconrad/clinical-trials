  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of 2 drugs, perifosine in
      combination with temsirolimus in children with solid tumors. Neither drug is currently part
      of the standard treatment of solid tumors in children. Both drugs have been tested alone to
      treat solid tumors in children with little success. There is now new insight that if given
      together, perifosine and temsirolimus may work together to stop the growth of solid tumors
      and may also make them shrink. The doctor wants to find out what effects; good and/or bad,
      perifosine in combination with temsirolimus has on the patient and the cancer. The doctors
      are testing four different dose schedules of perifosine with temsirolimus and the patient
      will be asked to partake in one of the dose schedules. The dose schedule will be lower for
      those enrolled early in the study.

    <description>This is a single arm, phase I study. Eligible patients will receive a loading dose of oral perifosine on the first day, followed by a maintenance dose starting on the second day until progression. Each patient is assigned to a group according to their body surface area (BSA). Temsirolimus will be combined with perifosine at four dose levels to determine the MTD for the combination therapy. Temsirolimus dosing will start on the same day as the perifosine load.</description>

    <description>The patient will take oral tablets of perifosine at a dose and frequency to be determined their height, weight and time when they enter the study as those entering early will be treated with lower dose levels (dosing frequency will vary from once a week to daily). The patient will receive an intravenous injection of temsirolimus once a week at a dose to be determined by their height, weight and time when they enter the study as those entering early will be treated with lower doses. In addition they will be asked to keep a medicine diary.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any solid tumor that has failed standard therapy

          -  Patient must have evidence of tumor by CT, MRI, MIBG scan, serum markers, or tissue
             sampling.

          -  Age ≤ 21 years (age ≤ 35 years for biopsy proven medulloblastoma or neuroblastoma)

          -  Karnofsky/Lansky performance status ≥ 50% (Karnofsky score for age&gt; 16 years and
             Lansky score for age ≤ 16 years)

          -  ANC≥ 1000 at least 24 hours off GCSF

          -  Platelets ≥ 100K at least one week off platelet transfusions

          -  Patients must have cholesterol level &lt; 350 mg/dl and triglycerides level &lt; 400 mg/dl
             because temsirolimus can induce hyperlipidemia.

             clearance or nuclear GFR ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73 m2.

          -  HIV-Positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study due to possible retro-viral drug interactions. HIV testing not required.

          -  Patients must not be taking EIAEDs. If patients were previously on EIAEDs that have
             been discontinued, patients must have been off the agent for at least 2 weeks prior to
