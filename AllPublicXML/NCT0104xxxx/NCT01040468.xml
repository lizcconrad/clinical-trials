      This research study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of weight loss surgery for
      overweight persons with type 2 diabetes. Eligible patients will undergo one of 2 types of
      weight loss surgery, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, or
      an intensive lifestyle modification. Participants will be closely followed for one year to
      compare the effects of these treatments on diabetes remission.

    <description>Intensive lifestyle modification program for weight loss. Participants randomized to this condition will receive an weekly individual treatment of 30 minutes for the first 6 months and every-other-week sessions from months 7 to 12. Treatment will be provided by a behavioral psychologist or registered dietitian following a structured curriculum used in our prior studies. During the first 4 months, participants will be prescribed a 1000-1200 kcal/d diet that provides four daily servings of meal replacement products (liquid shakes, cereals, meal bars, etc), combined with an evening dinner entree. Each serving of the meal replacement (HMR 170; Boston, MA) will provide 170 calories, with 16 g of protein, 22 g of carbohydrate, and 2 g of fat. Dinner entrees (containing at least 20 g of protein and approximately 220-260 kcal) will be consumed with a garden salad and a serving of fruit (and other vegetables allowed ad libitum throughout the day).</description>

             preoperative glycemic control, as indicated by a HbA1c &gt; 6.5 - ≤ 8.5 or HbA1c &gt; 8.6 -
             &lt; 9.5 (individuals with this HbA1c value will require medical clearance and approval

             women)

          -  Conditions that may falsely elevate or decrease HbA1c values, including hemolytic or
