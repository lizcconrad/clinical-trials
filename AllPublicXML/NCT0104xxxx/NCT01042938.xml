  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ionizing radiation is a toxic agent and widely accepted form of treatment for various types
      of cancer. Despite advances in medical technology, radiation therapy still causes severe
      early and late skin effects. Radiation-induced dermatitis occurs in approximately 80% of
      patients. Important consequences of radiation-induced dermatitis include impairment of the
      quality of a patient's life due to pain and premature interruption of radiation treatment,
      which in turn, may be impair good local control of disease. The biological pathways
      responsible for acute radiation-induced dermatitis remain unclear. Currently, there is no
      standard treatment for the prevention of radiation-induced dermatitis with demonstrated
      effectiveness. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study is to
      assess the effectiveness of curcumin for the prevention of acute radiation-induced dermatitis
      during postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer. We hypothesize that curcumin, a natural
      phenolic compound found in both turmeric and curry powders, can prevent or alleviate
      radiation-induced skin reactions in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy.

      Specifically, this clinical pilot study will develop data necessary to calculate a sample
      size for a larger study to be conducted through the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community
      Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) mechanism. Specifically, this pilot project will
      investigate: 1) if curcumin can prevent or alleviate radiation-induced skin reactions in
      cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and 2) if skin pigmentation, as well as pain and
      psychophysiological factors, can predict the severity of radiation-induced dermatitis.
      Potential future research studies may be conducted to identify the biological mechanisms
      involved in radiation-induced dermatitis and the radioprotective function of curcumin.

    <measure>Severity of Dermatitis in Radiation Treatment Site in Breast Cancer Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>4-7 weeks (prescribed course of radiation)</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of radiation dermatitis was measured using the Radiation Dermatitis Severity (RDS)Scale which ranges from 0.0 to 4.0 with increments of 0.5. The RDS scale is a revised form of the NIH Common Toxicity Criteria to account for color and subtle texture changes in the skin. The worst dermatitis (i.e., highest RDS score) at the end of treatment was used for the primary analysis of severity of radiation dermatitis in each treatment group. Additionally, we performed repeated measure analyses to examine the severity of dermatitis over time in each arm.</description>

    <measure>Moist Desquamation at Radiation Treatment Site</measure>
    <time_frame>4-7 weeks (prescribed course of radiation)</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of moist desquamation at the end of radiation treatment was examined between curcumin and placebo treatment groups. We compared the number of participants (or percentage) with moist desquamation between each treatment group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Redness at Radiation Treatment Site</measure>
    <time_frame>4-7 weeks (prescribed course of radiation)</time_frame>
    <description>Redness at radiation treatment site was measured using a CR-400 Colorimeter (Konica Minolta). The colorimeter uses the L*a*b* color scale. We used a* values (redness) which range from 0.0 to 20.0. The lower the number value, the lower amount of redness. Therefore, high number values represent large amounts of redness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain at Radiation Treatment Site</measure>
    <time_frame>4-7 weeks (prescribed course of radiation)</time_frame>
    <description>The McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form (MPQ-SF) was used to determine the participants pain at treatment site. The MPQ-SF contains three subscales: affective pain, sensory pain, and perceived pain. This outcome measure compared the total pain score (range 0 to 50)and subscale scores (sensory subscale range 0 to 33; affective subscale range 0 to 12; perceived pain subscale 0 to 5) at the end of radiation therapy between the two treatment arms.</description>

        <title>Severity of Dermatitis in Radiation Treatment Site in Breast Cancer Patients</title>
        <description>The severity of radiation dermatitis was measured using the Radiation Dermatitis Severity (RDS)Scale which ranges from 0.0 to 4.0 with increments of 0.5. The RDS scale is a revised form of the NIH Common Toxicity Criteria to account for color and subtle texture changes in the skin. The worst dermatitis (i.e., highest RDS score) at the end of treatment was used for the primary analysis of severity of radiation dermatitis in each treatment group. Additionally, we performed repeated measure analyses to examine the severity of dermatitis over time in each arm.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The primary limitation of this clinical study is the small sample size. This study was a pilot trial to generate an effect and sample size for a larger confirmatory trial. We accrued patients to this study until we had 30 fully evaluable patients.</limitations_and_caveats>
