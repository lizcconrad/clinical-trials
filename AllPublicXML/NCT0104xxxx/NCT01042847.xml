    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that our immune system can help fight cancer. This has stimulated
      interest in the development and application of tumor vaccines for several human solid tumors,
      including epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). A major obstacle to the development of these
      vaccines is that there are specialty cells called regulatory T cells that prevent the immune
      system from attacking all of our organs. These regulatory T cells also prevent our immune
      system for attacking cancer cells.

      Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that degrades an essential amino acid tryptophan
      that is necessary for T cells to multiply, however regulatory T cells are less susceptible to
      low levels of tryptophan, and can still multiply. This allows cancer growth and progression.
      This may be explained by genetic polymorphisms (changes) in the IDO gene, which may alter its
      function. Five of these changes in the IDO gene have been described. In this research
      project, we are asking if you would donate a small piece of your tumor and ascites to see if
      we can examine your IDO gene in the tumor cells and see if any of these gene changes are
      present. We hope that this will help us understand how the immune system works in EOC.

      We hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms within the IDO gene alter its enzymatic activity
      and affect the outcome of ovarian cancer patients. These findings have the potential to
      translate into a method for predicting successful immunotherapy.
