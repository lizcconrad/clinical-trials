  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-marketing surveillance study is to evaluate the safety of Synflorix™
      when administered according to the local Prescribing Information to healthy Filipino infants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Local authorities no longer require routine PMS studies;GSK does not believe the study would
    add meaningfully to the safety data already available for Synflorix

    <description>Subjects receiving Synflorix™ according to local Prescribing Information. Subjects were administered with Synflorix by investigators in the course of their normal clinical practice. The vaccination schedule consisted of three doses/two doses/one dose or the booster dose of 10Pn-PD-DiT to be administered as per the local PI. First dose of the vaccine could be administered to infants as early as 6 weeks of age and minimum interval between subsequent primary doses was 4 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/Legally Acceptable
             Representative(s) (LAR(s)) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Filipino male or female subjects whose age at the first vaccination with Synflorix™ in
             this PMS should not be less than 6 weeks of age.

          -  Filipino male or female subjects who enter the PMS at the second dose should not be
             less than 10 weeks of age.

          -  Filipino male or female subjects who enter the PMS at the third dose should not be
             less than 14 weeks of age.

          -  Filipino male or female subjects who enter the PMS at the booster dose (i.e. if they
             have received Synflorix™ in the previous dose/s outside the PMS) should not be less
             than 10 months of age. The time interval between the primary vaccination and booster
             dose should be at least 6 months. For the booster dose, subjects who received
             PCV-7/-13 or Synflorix™ in their primary vaccination series will be allowed to take
             part in the PMS.

          -  Written and signed informed consent obtained from the parents/LAR(s) of the child.
             Where parents/LAR(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by a
             witness.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccine administration.

          -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C (99.5°F) on axillary, infrared or tympanic
             setting.

          -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory
             infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  History of chronic condition(s) requiring treatment such as cancer or autoimmune
             diseases.

          -  Hypersensitivity to latex (found in syringe-tip cap and plunger).

          -  Any contraindications as stated in the Prescribing Information.
