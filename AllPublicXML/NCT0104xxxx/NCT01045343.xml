    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the potential benefits of a new heart
      failure diagnostic system for heart failure patients with implanted cardiac resynchronization
      therapy devices. This system consists of patient tools, a new heart failure risk score and a
      new clinician website. This study will evaluate this new system as a whole and establish the
      feasibility of implementing it into clinical practice.
