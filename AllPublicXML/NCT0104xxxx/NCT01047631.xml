    <textblock>
      Diastolic heart failure is now being recognized as a key form of heart failure in older
      people. The focus of this research is to study ways to improve and maintain physical activity
      and functioning. This knowledge may improve the health and well-being in people with
      diastolic heart failure.

      The purpose of this project is to better understand how endurance and fatigue relate to
      performing daily activities and how we might better improve endurance and reduce fatigue
      through an exercise program.

    <description>Tests are performed at the beginning, and repeated after 12 and 24 weeks:
Measure general fitness levels such as walking, strength and balance.
Walk on a treadmill to measure your maximum fitness while wearing a mask to analyze your oxygen use.
Blood and urine tests and a heart ultrasound.
Questionnaires &amp; activity measures.
Group assignment for 12 weeks:
-Exercise classes &amp; activity guidance: Twice-weekly class that focuses on exercises that are similar to daily activities, such as walking and carrying objects. Obtain customized information and education to help you exercise and follow a low salt diet.
Follow-up:
-Monthly phone calls during the 12 week follow up period.</description>
