      Type-2 diabetes mellitus is a public health concern. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      are at high risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Diabetic patients are two to
      four-times more likely to develope cardiovascular disease. The mortality of diabetic patients
      with cardiovascular disease is much higher than in non-diabetic matched patients with
      cardiovascular disease. Recently, it has become apparent that not all anti-diabetic drugs
      have the same effect on the progression of atherosclerosis and on cardiovascular outcomes.
      There is a great need to understand the potential protective mechanisms of the various
      anti-diabetic drugs in order to decrease their risk for cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. In addition to increasing insulin sensitivity, Pioglitazone (PIO) has
      anti-inflammatory properties. However, the underlying mechanisms of these anti-inflammatory
      (and probably anti-atherosclerotic) effects of PIO are unknown. We have shown in the rat that
      3-day pretreatment with PIO increases myocardial cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) activity and levels
      of both 6-keto-PGF1a, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI2) and 15-epi-lipoxin A4, a
      lipid mediator with a strong anti-inflammatory properties. Prostacyclin inhibits platelet
      aggregation and causes vasodilatation. Increased levels of 6-keto-PGF1a and 15-epi-lipoxin A4
      may thus be the explanation for the anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerosis effects of
      PIO. Several clinical studies have shown that COX2 inhibition is associated with increased
      cardiovascular events. Thus, augmenting COX2 activity and the production of prostacyclin and
      15-epi-lipoxin A4 may have potential favorable effects. The purpose of the study is to test
      whether PIO therapy is associated with an increase in serum and/or urine levels of
      6-keto-PGF1a and 15-epi-lipoxin A4 in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2.

      Type-2 diabetes mellitus is a public health concern. According to the World health
      organization (WHO), diabetes mellitus affects more than 180 million people worldwide. Type 2
      diabetes mellitus accounts for 80-95% of diabetes cases in developed countries and a higher
      proportion in developing countries (IDF 2006). Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at
      high risk of developing cardiovascular complications. Diabetic patients are two to four-times
      more likely to develope cardiovascular disease. The mortality of diabetic patients with
      cardiovascular disease is much higher than in non-diabetic matched patients with
      cardiovascular disease. Recently, it has become apparent that not all anti-diabetic drugs
      have the same effect on the progression of atherosclerosis and on cardiovascular outcomes.
      There is a great need to understand the potential protective mechanisms of the various
      anti-diabetic drugs in order to decrease their risk for cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. In addition to increasing insulin sensitivity, Pioglitazone (PIO) has
      anti-inflammatory properties. Several studies have suggested that PIO decreases serum markers
      of inflammation including C-reactive protein (CRP). However, the underlying mechanisms of
      these anti-inflammatory (and probably anti-atherosclerotic) effects of PIO are unknown. We
      have shown in the rat that 3-day pretreatment with PIO increases myocardial cyclooxygenase-2
      (COX2) activity and levels of both 6-keto-PGF1a, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin (PGI2)
      and 15-epi-lipoxin A4, a lipid mediator with a strong anti-inflammatory properties.
      Prostacyclin inhibits platelet aggregation and causes vasodilatation. Increased levels of
      6-keto-PGF1a and 15-epi-lipoxin A4 may thus be the explanation for the anti-inflammatory and
      anti-atherosclerosis effects of PIO. Several clinical studies have shown that COX2 inhibition

      and/or urine levels of 6-keto-PGF1a and 15-epi-lipoxin A4 in patients with diabetes mellitus
      type 2.

Pioglitazone: Patients will receive PIO 15 mg/d for one month, then 55 patients will continue with the same dose for one additional month, and in 55 patients the dose will be increased to 30 mg/d for an additional one month. While on PIO, other non-diabetes drugs should not be changed, unless emergency. Other hypoglycemic agents, including insulin may be adjusted, if clinically indicated. NSAID, COX2 inhibitors, aspirin &gt;162 mg/d, steroids and prostaglandin analogs will be prohibited. At baseline, and after 1, and 2 months of treatment the following samples will be taken: 1. Serum for lipid profile, ALT, AST, CK, creatinine, BUN, glucose, HbA1c (the biochemistry laboratory at UTMB) 2. Serum for 6-keto-PGF1a and 15-epi-lipoxin A4 3. Serum for hs-CRP 4.
