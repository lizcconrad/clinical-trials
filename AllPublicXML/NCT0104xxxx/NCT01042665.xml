      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the relationship between IOP fluctuation,
      RGC dysfunction, and optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness changes in
      patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension receiving latanoprost 0.005% versus placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been hypothesized that intraocular (IOP) variability is an independent risk factor for
      the progression of glaucoma. IOP variability includes 24 hour IOP fluctuation during the
      waking period (diurnal fluctuation) and sleep period (nocturnal fluctuation) as well as
      longitudinal IOP variability measured in the diurnal period over the course of multiple
      office visits.

      Latanoprost has been clinically used to lower eye pressure in glaucoma and ocular
      hypertension for almost 10 years. Latanoprost 0.005% has been demonstrated to provide
      superior ocular hypotensive efficacy compared with timolol 0.5% in pivotal phase 3 clinical
      trials (Alm et al. 1995; Camras 1996).

      The Pattern Electroretinogram (PERG) is a non-invasive technology that objectively measures
      the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) function (Porciatti and Ventura 2004). A recent study has
      demonstrated that the RGC function can be improved following IOP reduction in glaucomatous
      eyes with early visual field defects (Ventura and Porciatti 2005).

      The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the relationship between IOP fluctuation,
      RGC dysfunction, and optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness changes in
      patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension receiving latanoprost 0.005% versus placebo.
