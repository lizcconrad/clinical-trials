  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PCI has been one of the most common choice of treatments for patients with coronary artery
      disease, and studies indicated that intensive statin treatment before PCI could reduce
      adverse events as comparing to the placebo. In China, statin with regular dose is currently
      applied to the patients admitted for Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Here we
      hypothesize that intensive statin treatment with arovastatin before PCI could further reduce
      clinical adverse events.
