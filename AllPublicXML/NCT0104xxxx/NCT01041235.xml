  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, including the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD), of ATI-1123 a liposomal formulation of docetaxel, in the treatment of cancer
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of advanced stage human cancers are fatal if not treated promptly and
      aggressively. Standard treatments include chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery.
      Docetaxel, the active ingredient in ATI-1123 and the FDA approved drug Taxotere, is a
      chemotherapy given by IV to patients to treat various types of cancers.

      Docetaxel is a poorly water soluble semi-synthetic taxane analog commonly used in the
      treatment of a variety of solid tumors including non-small cell lung, prostate, breast,
      gastric and head and neck cancer. Because of its poor water solubility it is formulated with
      co-solvents that can potentially contribute to treatment related adverse events such as
      hypersensitivity. Current taxane formulations often complicate drug delivery and can alter
      both pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles.

      Results from nonclinical evaluations show that ATI-1123 retains the antineoplastic activity
      of docetaxel while removing the need for unwanted solvents like Tween 80. The administration
      of ATI-1123 versus other docetaxel chemotherapy formulations is expected to reduce
      hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching at the infusion site), eliminate the
      requirement for premedications, have a broader therapeutic index, and enhance systemic
      docetaxel exposure.
