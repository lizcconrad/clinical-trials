    <textblock>
      Carbapenems are a class of antibiotic agents which kill a broad spectrum of bacteria.
      Infections due to gram-negative bacteria which have acquired resistance to carbapenems are
      increasing, especially with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa . The optimal treatment of such infections is not known. Antibiotics like
      polymyxin, tigecycline and rifampin are used alone or in combination with other antibiotics.
      The outcome of using these new and old drugs is not well studied. This observational study
      aims to study the clinical and microbiological outcomes of these infections and treatment at
      our institution.

      Objectives

        1. To define the demographic and risk factor profile of patients acquiring CRGNB infection.

        2. To define the characteristics of CRGNB infection.

        3. To report the different treatments employed for CRGNB infection.

        4. To report the microbiological and clinical outcomes of different treatment options

             -  a. Microbiological outcomes: frequency of microbiological success. Microbiological
                success will be defined as two successive negative cultures from the same site as
                from where the CRGNB was originally isolated.

             -  b. Clinical outcomes: clinical success (clinical cure), adverse effects of
                treatment especially the nephrotoxicity in relation to the use of polymyxin, ICU
                length of stay (if applicable), hospital length of stay, ICU mortality (if
                applicable), hospital mortality and in-hospital recurrence of infection. Clinical
                success will be defined as resolution or improvement of clinical symptoms and signs
                of infection and discontinuation of the antibiotics.

      Study duration:

      We plan to collect the data for a one year period. Based on the current prevalence rate at
      our institution, we anticipate having data for 300 patients.
