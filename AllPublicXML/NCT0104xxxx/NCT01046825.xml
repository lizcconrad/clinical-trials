  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III clinical trial using risk-adapted therapy. Treatment outcomes for
      children with B-cell NHL are excellent. Further improvements in outcome will likely be
      achieved through more focused study of the biology of the tumors and prospective studies of
      the late effects of treatment. Toward this end, this study features a spectrum of prospective
      biologic and late effect studies performed in patients treated with a modified regimen
      derived from the very successful LMB-96 regimen.

      1. This study will perform analysis of newly diagnosed mature B-cell lymphomas (e.g.
           Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, DLBCL, and MLBCL) obtained from participants in different
           parts of the world.

        2. This study will describe the types and frequency of mutations in the ARF-HDM2-TP53
           pathway, in B-cell lymphomas in the United States and that found in selected geographic
           regions of the world.

        3. This study will describe the expression of ARF-HDM2-TP53 and PUMA-associated pathways in
           B-cell lymphomas in the United States and that found in B-cell lymphomas of other
           selected geographic regions of the world.

        4. This study will describe the pattern and frequency of XLP gene mutations presenting with
           B-cell lymphomas in the United States and selected geographic regions.

        5. This study will describe the frequency of EBV-positive B-cell lymphomas in the United
           States and selected geographic regions of the world: and will describe the pattern of
           EBV protein and gene expression (e.g., EBNA 3) in EBV-positive lymphomas and the study
           will compare patterns of EBV protein and gene expression with clinical, laboratory and
           outcome data.

      Secondary Objective:

      To estimate the complete response rate, event-free survival, and overall survival rates in
      patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), Burkitt leukemia/B-cell acute leukemia (B-ALL) and
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with a stage-adapted regimen based on the St.
      Jude B-cell II protocol.

        Objectives:

          1. Participants known to be HIV positive (for therapeutic part of protocol, HIV
