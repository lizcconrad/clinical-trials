      The purpose of this study is to test a simple meditation program that is easy to learn;
      inexpensive; easy to practice; non-religion based; and has wide applicability to multiple
      medical conditions. This program has been developed by the Complementary and Integrative
      Medicine Program at the Mayo Clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress is a ubiquitous problem and a mediator of symptoms for a variety of medical
      conditions. Most medical diagnoses, procedures, and physician visits are associated with
      considerable stress. Excessive stress is associated with adverse medical outcomes, unhealthy
      coping mechanisms, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and overall a poor quality of life. No
      specific pharmacologic treatment is available for treating stress. Further, it is often
      difficult or impossible to change the reality of circumstances causing stress in an
      individual. Thus increasing individual coping mechanisms and ability of a person to handle
      stress, rather than changing the stressors itself, might be a more feasible approach towards
      reducing stress.

      Meditation is a widely used and increasingly popular intervention that positively affects the
      individual at cognitive, physical, emotional, behavioral, and spiritual levels. A practice of
      meditation has been shown to reduce symptoms of stress and improve overall quality of life.
      Several meditation programs exist, however most are limited by considerable expense, need for
      elaborate training, lack of widespread availability, or incorporation of ideas and practices
      unique to a particular culture.
