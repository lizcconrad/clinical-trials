  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevention of cardiovascular disease by moderate
      cholesterol lowering therapy, pitavastatin 1mg/day or aggressive cholesterol lowering
      therapy, pitavastatin 4mg/day in patients with stable coronary artery disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It was already demonstrated by previous clinical trials that statins lower the incidence of
      death and cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. However, whether
      aggressive cholesterol lowering therapy, using high dosage of statins, is more effective than
      moderate cholesterol lowering therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients
      with coronary artery disease has not been studied in Japan.
