      The investigators propose to evaluate efficacy and safety of gemcitabine in the adjuvant
      treatment of cholangiocarcinoma after potentially curative treatment with surgical resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma is a highly fatal disease with poor prognosis. While Cholangiocarcinoma is
      generally rare in Western countries, it is more common in Korea, with an estimate of 3500
      cases diagnosed annually. Currently, surgical resection remains the only potentially curative
      treatment, but many patients develop recurrence. Thus, effective postoperative adjuvant
      therapy is required to prolong survival in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. However, no
      standard postoperative treatment has been established yet.

      Among several different new anticancer drugs currently being investigated in the treatment of
      advanced biliary tract cancer, gemcitabine has generated particular interest. The nucleoside
      analogue gemcitabine has been reported to be active against advanced unresectable
      cholangiocarcinoma including cancer of the gallbladder, intrahepatic, and extrahepatic bile
      duct. So this is expected to be investigated in the adjuvant setting.
