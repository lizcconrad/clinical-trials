    <textblock>
      Virtual high dose rate (HDR) CyberKnife (CK) prostate treatment has comparable morbidity and
      efficacy compared with actual prostate HDR treatment, but does it without the catheters and
      hospital admission. As such, it is a more &quot;patient friendly&quot; treatment method compared with
      actual prostate HDR brachytherapy as currently practiced. Related, as has previously been
      reported with actual prostate HDR treatment, Virtual HDR CyberKnife prostate treatment should
      have a high efficacy but with lower acute and chronic morbidity compared with other local
      prostate cancer treatment methods such as permanent seed prostate brachytherapy.

      Brachytherapy is a form of treatment where a radioactive isotope is implanted directly into a
      tumor volume to deliver a lethal dose of radiation. High Dose Rate (HDR) Prostate
      brachytherapy is a particularly elegant brachytherapy dose sculpting method that is
      effectively used in the curative treatment of prostate cancer; however, it requires hospital
      admission and many temporarily implanted transperineal catheters to deliver the radiation
      source to the target volume, resulting in significant patient discomfort. CyberKnife delivers
      a form of radiation treatment that is so precise, it appears capable of reconstructing HDR
      prostate radiation dose sculpting, without the hospital admission and without the catheters.
      The CyberKnife device is also used for classic radiosurgery, with accuracy comparable to the
      Gamma Knife, but unlike the Gamma Knife, has the capability to target lesions anywhere in the
      body with similar accuracy. The aim of this study is to compare CyberKnife morbidity and
      efficacy with that of HDR and other local treatment methods such a permanent seed prostate
      brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.
