  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of a low glycemic index (GI) diet has been shown to improve glycaemic control in
      type 2 diabetics(Brandâˆ’Miller et al., 2003; Jenkins et al., 2008). In addition to the
      benefits for glycaemic control there is some evidence for acute improvements in cognitive
      performance after consumption of low GI foods compared with high GI foods in both adults
      (Benton et al., 2003; Kaplan et al., 2000) and adolescents (Ingwersen et al., 2007; Smith and
      Foster, 2008).

      Given these findings it is possible that low GI focused dietary interventions designed to
      improve glycaemic control and health outcomes for diabetic patients could also improve the
      cognitive function of these patients. This is of particular relevance in light of the
      evidence associating type 2 diabetes with cognitive decrements (Awad et al., 2004; Stewart
      and Loilitsa 1999; van Harten et al., 2006). To date two studies with type 2 diabetics have
      reported that a low GI breakfast was associated with increased verbal memory performance
      compared to a high GI breakfast (Greenwood et al., 2003; Papanikolaou et al. 2006). Further
      research should investigate the benefit of low GI foods to cognition.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of high and low glycaemic index breakfast on
      cognitive performance in adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants will perform a battery of
      cognitive tests after consuming 3 different breakfasts (high GI, low GI, and water) on 3
      different tests days. The participants will be recruited from the general public and from the
      Leeds Teaching Hospital diabetes clinic.

      This research can benefit the development of specific dietary behaviours aimed at reducing
      diabetes related cognitive decline. This research is part of a PhD funded by the Economic and
      Social Research Council and the University of Leeds.

      The study will conform to a randomised mixed design. Both the diabetic experimental group and
      the control group will take part in three conditions whereby participants will receive a high
      GI, a low GI, or a water breakfast delivered in a counterbalanced order. Participants will
      then perform the battery of cognitive tests on 2 occasions throughout the morning; 30 minutes
      after breakfast and 180 minutes after breakfast. Blood glucose will be measured from
      capillary finger-prick blood samples using diabetic glucose meters throughout the morning.

        Participants will be recruited from the general population using emails and posters. These
        will be distributed throughout the University of Leeds, Leeds Metropolitan University, and
        NHS sites in Leeds. GP's and diabetes specialist doctors and nurses will be asked to inform
        potential participants of the nature of the study. Ideally spouses, siblings or other close
        friends/relatives of the experimental group will be recruited for the control group in an
        attempt to control for education, social class and general lifestyle.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to give informed consent

          -  Type 2 diabetes

          -  White British or White North American ethnicity and native English speakers

          -  Not previously received or currently received subcutaneous insulin as part of their
             diabetes treatment.

          -  Vision sufficiently good to complete the cognitive testing (using glasses and/or
             lenses).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dementia (as indicated using the Mini Mental State Examination &lt;26)

          -  Current (or recent i.e. in last 6 months) cigarette smoker

          -  Neurological disorder

          -  Previous stroke

          -  Medication other than diabetes treatment medication that has a direct effect on the
             brain and is likely to influence cognitive function.

        Co-existent diabetic complications will not be considered exclusion criteria unless they
        result in inability to complete the cognitive testing (e.g. insufficient vision).

        These exclusion criteria have been chosen on the basis that these are factors that can
        affect cognitive performance. Given that the cognitive tests involve learning English
        words, only participants who have English as their first language can be included because
        different cognitive processes are used when learning in a non-native language (Wong et al.,
        2004). Ethnicity can influence glucose regulation and risk of diabetes. Given that part of
        this research is examining the relationship between glucose regulation and cognition it is
        important that potential confounds such as ethnicity/genetic propensity to diabetes are
        controlled for.
