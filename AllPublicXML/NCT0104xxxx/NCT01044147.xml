  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With over half of the US population currently overweight and 31% of adults now obese, the
      primary care setting may represent an important source of weight-loss support, in the
      interest of cardiovascular prevention. Yet, although the US Preventive Services task force
      recommends that physicians screen all adult patients for obesity and offer intensive
      counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss for obese adults,
      the recommendation has not been widely implemented. The Internet may help overcome many of
      the barriers that have prevented intensive obesity counseling in the clinical setting. The
      aim of this study is to examine whether Internet-based interventions for developing healthier
      lifestyles can improve preventive health care in a cost-effective manner.

      The study, Online counseling to enable lifestyle-focused obesity treatment in primary care,
      aims to translate an evidence-based lifestyle intervention into the primary care setting,
      using information technology to enable clinical lifestyle counseling. While the US Preventive
      Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that clinicians screen all adult patients for obesity
      and offer intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss
      for obese adults, multiple barriers to intensive lifestyle counseling exist and the
      recommendation has not been widely implemented. By requiring physician referral, augmenting
      the health care team's access to behavioral expertise, and encouraging physician feedback to
      participating patients, we aim to integrate lifestyle issues into routine preventive
      medicine. We will examine change in weight, waist circumference, physical activity, quality
      of life, and will calculate intervention cost-effectiveness. We will ensure sustainability by
      using recruitment and adherence strategies that can be replicated in routine practice, and
      counseling staff who are representative of the educators employed in primary care practice.
      If an online strategy is effective, the extensive network of the University of Pittsburgh
      Medical Center Health System provides excellent infrastructure for supporting dissemination
      in the region. As such, this study may facilitate wide-spread adoption of current
      evidence-based preventive medicine guidelines recommending incorporation of intensive
      lifestyle interventions into primary care practice.
