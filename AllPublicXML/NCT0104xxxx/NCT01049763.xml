  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is planned to characterize the pharmacokinetic properties of oseltamivir and the
      active product--oseltamivir carboxylate--in obesity in order to provide clinical guidance for
      the optimum oseltamivir treatment regimens for severe influenza. It is also a prompt response
      to a new era influenza plan along with recognition of growing numbers of obese persons.

      The study findings will be available for a future management plan in dealing with this virus
      that is transmitted easily from person to person and has shown substantial antigenic changes
      over time.

      The primary focus of statistical analysis is to verify the effect of obesity on
      oseltamivir/oseltamivir carboxylate pharmacokinetics as measured by oseltamivir carboxylate
      Cmax, AUC (0-12), AUC (0-24), C12, λz, and t1/2 and oseltamivir Cmax, AUC (0-12), and C12.

      This is an open-label, cross-over, randomized pharmacokinetic study conducted in
      approximately 12 obese and 12 non obese adult subjects at one study center in Thailand.

      Subjects will receive 2 regimens in a random sequence for 2 visits.

        1. Regimen A; 75 mg single dose.

        2. Regimen B; 150 mg single dose. All dosing will be supervised and documented. Subjects
           will have 2 hospitalizations to complete visit 2 and visit 3 in their assigned sequence
           within each. Each visit will require hospitalization for about 40 hours (2 nights and 2
           days). The subject will be randomized to receive either regimen A or B on first
           admission (visit 2). Treatment allocation will be performed using computer-generated
           list of random permutations of AB sequence.

      Subjects who received regimen A will receive regimen B on second admission and vice versa,
      with more than 3 days wash out period in between. Subjects will return to the study centre
      for a follow-up visit 7-10 days after completing the last dosing assessments or withdrawing
      from the study. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 4 weeks from
      screening through follow-up.

      Assessment of the safety profile will be done after each admission by the investigating team
      before proceeding to the other regimen.

             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  Subjects with unstable medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator
             would compromise their participation in the trial
