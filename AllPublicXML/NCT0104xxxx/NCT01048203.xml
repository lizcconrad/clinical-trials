      This is a single site, open label, single dose, non-randomized study in healthy male and
      female subjects. The subjects will be evaluated for plasma, urine and feces levels of
      14C-ABR-215050 during 21 days.

      As a part of the pharmacokinetic documentation, the metabolism and mass balance of
      14C-ABR-215050 will be studied in healthy subjects. Female healthy subjects are included in
      the study in case of expanding the indication to female forms of cancer. In this study a
      single dose of 1.0 mg of the study drug will be administered orally as a solution under
      fasted conditions. The absorption and safety profiles for the oral water solution will also
      be documented.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 40-65 year old male and female subjects.

          2. Healthy according to medical history, physical examination and clinical chemistry,
             urine and hematological laboratory tests.

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-30.

          4. Negative screen for Hepatitis B / C and HIV-infection.

          5. Be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.

          6. Women of childbearing potential must be neither pregnant nor breast-feeding.
             Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a pregnancy test
             before the single dose and at study end. Fertile women must be willing to practice
             reliable methods of contraception. Medically accepted safe methods of contraception
             for the purpose of this study will include surgical sterilisation, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, or condom with spermicide. As interaction studies
             between ABR-215050 and hormonal (oral or depot) contraceptives have not yet been
             performed, women using such devices must also use a complementary contraceptive
             device.

          7. Have given written signed informed consent, prior to start of any study-related
             activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Gastrointestinal disorders that may affect drug absorption.

          2. Any vaccination within 30 days before start of this study and throughout the study.

          3. Blood donation within 90 days before start of this study and for 90 days after the
             study.

          4. Participation in other clinical studies or who have received other investigational
             drugs within 90 days prior to enrolment. Additionally, subjects previously included
             into this study and then are withdrawn from the study is not to be re-entered into the
             study.

          5. Perform any planned surgery

          6. Any use of nicotine within three (3) months before start of this study and throughout
             the study.

          7. Known or suspected history of alcoholism or drug abuse.

          8. Intake of alcoholic beverages for 24 hours prior to the administration of
             investigational product and for 24 hours after the dose.

          9. Intake of caffeine containing beverages 10 hours prior to the administration of
             investigational product and for 6 hours after the dose.

         10. Medication including herbal remedies (vitamins and paracetamol excluded) within 14
             days before and throughout the study.
