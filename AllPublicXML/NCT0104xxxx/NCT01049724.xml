  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure tear lacritin and heparanase levels before and
      following surgery using a minimal risk procedure to collect tears from patients undergoing
      PRK or LASIK.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lacritin is a naturally occurring tear protein with antimicrobial activity that is capable of
      stimulating mitogenesis in human corneal epithelial cells and promoting production of tears
      in lacrimal gland acinar cells. A recently developed immunoassay for lacritin may help
      characterize the lacritin response following refractive surgery with the possible development
      of recombinant lacritin as a novel therapeutic agent for wound healing. Heparanase (HPSE)
      acts as a regulator for lacritin by cleaving heparan sulfate chains and allowing lacritin to
      bind. We aim to measure both tear lacritin and HPSE pre- and post-operatively to elucidate
      lacritin and HPSE's response in patients undergoing PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) and
      LASIK (Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis) at the Walter Reed Center for Refractive
      Surgery.

        Active duty military aged 21 to 55 with myopia up to -10.00 diopters eligible for care at
        Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active duty US Army Soldiers eligible for care at FBCH

          -  Undergoing PRK or LASIK

          -  Male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old and not older than 55 years old
             at the time of the tear collection. The lower age limit of 21 years is intended to
             ensure documentation of refractive stability.

          -  Appropriately aged individuals who report that their eyes are &quot;normal&quot; and who have no
             active eye illness as determined by the principal investigator or sub-investigator.

          -  Ability and willingness to understand and provide informed consent to participate in
             this study.

          -  Up to -10.00 diopters of myopia.

          -  Subject must expect to be located in the greater Washington DC area for a 12 month
             period post-operatively.

          -  Consent of the subject's command (active duty) to participate in the study.

          -  Access to transportation to meet follow-up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any reason to be excluded for PRK or LASIK

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant during
             the study. Female subjects will be given a urine pregnancy test prior to participating
             in the study to rule out pregnancy. [Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindications
             to refractive surgery in general, including PRK, whether participating in this study
             or not]

          -  Patients with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the
             medications used in the post-operative course.

          -  Any physical or mental impairment that would preclude participation in any of the
             examinations.

          -  Anterior basement membrane dystrophy

          -  History of recurrent epithelial erosion

          -  Significant dry eye (symptomatic with Schirmer &lt;5mm at 5 minutes)

          -  Other corneal epithelial disorder or healing abnormality

          -  Individuals with any infectious or inflammatory ocular conditions (e.g. have &quot;pink
             eye&quot; or uveitis).

          -  Individuals diagnosed with dry eye or other ocular surface condition, including but
             not restricted to neurotropic keratitis, anterior basement membrane dystrophy, and
             recurrent corneal erosions.
