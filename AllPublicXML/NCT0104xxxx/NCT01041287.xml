  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common disease that affects many Americans, and
      can lead to devastating consequences such as heart attack, stroke, and death if not treated.
      Nebivolol is a medication that has been recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      hypertension. Nebivolol has an unusual profile compared to other medications, in that its
      effects may be related to release of a substance called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is
      released from the cells lining the blood vessels, and nebivolol may stimulate these cells to
      release more nitric oxide. Our study will investigate whether treatment with nebivolol, as
      compared to another medication called metoprolol, in hypertensive subjects will be more
      effective in protecting blood vessels against the harmful effects of high blood pressure. The
      mechanisms we will investigate include oxidative stress markers and circulating levels of
      endothelial progenitor cells.

    <description>Subjects were randomized to nebivolol for 3 months. They &quot;crossed over&quot; to take 3 months of metoprolol succinate. The initial 5 mg daily dose of nebivolol was titrated to 10 mg daily after 2 weeks if their BP remained &gt;125/80, and subsequently titrated to 20 mg daily after another 2 weeks if the BP remained &gt;125/80. Similarly, the initial 50 mg daily dose of metoprolol succinate was titrated to 100 mg daily after 2 weeks if BP remained &gt;125/80, and further increased to 200 mg after 2 weeks if BP remained &gt;125/80.</description>

        <description>The pulse wave velocity (PWV) system measured the velocity of the blood pressure waveform between the carotid and femoral arteries using a single-lead electrocardiogram and tonometer to measure the pressure pulse waveform sequentially at the two peripheral artery sites. PWV is calculated as PWV=distance (d)/time (t) and the unit of measure is reported as meters per second (m/s).</description>
