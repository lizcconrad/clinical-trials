    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this trial is to
      investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (the rate at which the
      trial drug is eliminated from the body) of NNC 0070-0002-0453 in overweight/obese, but
      otherwise healthy male and female volunteers. Selected subjects will continue in a follow-up
      period of up to 5 years.
