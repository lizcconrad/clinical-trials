        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who has had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biological therapy within 4 weeks
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to the first dose of study drug or who
             has not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier

          -  Patient with a known primary central nervous system tumor
