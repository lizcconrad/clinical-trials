  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, cardiovascular disease causes over one-third of all deaths and vitamin
      D deficiency is an epidemic. An increasing body of data suggests that low vitamin D status
      adversely impacts the cardiovascular system. It is our fundamental hypothesis that vitamin D
      deficiency is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease by causing endothelial dysfunction.
      Moreover, we hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation will restore endothelial function,
      thereby reducing cardiovascular disease risk.

      This pilot research will be conducted in 64 post-menopausal women participating in an
      existing study of vitamin D supplementation (32 will receive vitamin D3 2,500 IU daily, the
      others matching placebo) and will explore the effects of vitamin D on endothelial function
      and arterial reactivity. Post-menopausal women aged 55-65 years are chosen due to their
      highest risk for development of a subsequent new cardiovascular disease diagnosis. All study
      participants will have fasting laboratory and noninvasive vascular ultrasound studies
      performed at baseline and four months later. The primary outcome measure of this pilot study
      is change in markers of endothelial function and arterial stiffness with vitamin D3 therapy.
      If our hypotheses are correct, our long-term goals include investigation of the effect of
      vitamin D repletion on subclinical atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events.

             allowed.

          -  Willing to utilize sunscreen of SPF-15 or higher when sun exposure for more than 15
             minutes is expected.

          -  Willing to fast for 12 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current hypercalcemia (serum calcium &gt; 10.5 mg/dl) or untreated primary
             hyperparathyroidism.
