  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aquatic intervention had been applied in children with neuromotor impairment for years, yet
      there has been little progress toward objective identifications of therapy goals,
      interventions, and outcomes. Thus, we attempt to design aquatic intervention activity for
      children with cerebral palsy to evaluate the effect of hydrotherapy.

      Purpose:

      To evaluate the effects of pediatric aquatic therapy on motor performance, daily activity and
      social participation in children with spastic cerebral palsy.

      Method:

      The study enrolled 27 children with spastic cerebral palsy aged from 4 to 12 years old.These
      children were dived into two groups: traditional rehabilitation therapy (control group), and
      hospital based pediatric aquatic therapy program. We evaluate the motor performance, daily
      activity and social participation before and after the intervention and compared the
      difference in improvement between groups. The measurements include modified Ashworth score,
      Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM -66), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) , and
      Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire for Children (CPQOL).

      Expect effect:

      We suppose pediatric aquatic therapy in spastic cerebral palsy children could improve motor
      function and daily activity.Children could improve self-esteem and we hypothesize this could
      improve social participation.

      -  We conducted a well-designed study to investigate the effectiveness of PAT on motor
           function, activities of daily living (ADL),and health related quality of life(HRQOL)
           perspectives for children with CP.

        -  A convenience sample of 27 children was recruited for the study from the outpatient
           clinics of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation of two tertiary
           hospitals: Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and Taipei Veterans General Hospital.

        -  The study was designed as a single blinded, prospective, case control study.

        -  The pediatric aquatic therapy group got more improvementon motor performance measured by
           GMFM-66.

    <description>The GMFM is a standardized observational instrument designed and validated to measure change in gross motor function over time in children with cerebral palsy. The scoring key is meant to be a general guideline. However, most of the items have specific descriptors for each score. It is imperative that the guidelines contained in the manual be used for scoring each item. The score ranges from 0 to 100 and the higher represent the better gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy</description>

    <description>Vineland Adaptive Behavior scale was developed by Sara et al at 1984 and was used to measure adaptive and maladaptive behavior in children age form 3-12 years-old. The daily living subscale range from 0 to 198 and the higher the score represent the better captive behavior.</description>

    <description>This questionnaire was developed for Children and was a condition-specific quality of life (QOL) questionnaire for children with cerebral palsy aged 4 to 12 years. It contains social , functioning, participation , emotional ,access, pain and disability, and family health components. Participation is the main component in this study. This sub score ranges from 0 to 81 , higher scores represent better participation</description>

        <description>The GMFM is a standardized observational instrument designed and validated to measure change in gross motor function over time in children with cerebral palsy. The scoring key is meant to be a general guideline. However, most of the items have specific descriptors for each score. It is imperative that the guidelines contained in the manual be used for scoring each item. The score ranges from 0 to 100 and the higher represent the better gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy</description>
