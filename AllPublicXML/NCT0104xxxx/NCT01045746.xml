  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to test whether in the elderly population there are acute
      long-term improvements in both the static and dynamic balance, reaction time and mobility
      with the use of WBV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise therapy plays an important role in health promotion, preservation of physical
      function and in preventing loss of independence among the elderly. They work beside an
      improvement in balance, a positive effect on metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, reducing
      falls, osteoporosis, colon cancer, breast cancer, depression, anxiety, and the general
      well-being. There is preliminary evidence to indicated that balance, and strength can be
      trained in the elderly using whole-body vibration (WBV) therapy. The use of WBV in the
      elderly population has shown to be a simple and effective treatment in the areas of balance
      and mobility. It would be very desirable to investigate these factors further in order to
      provide evidence for the delivery of sustainability of training methods.
