    <textblock>
      This research is being done because melanoma in the brain is very difficult to treat because
      it does not respond to radiation or to chemotherapy, such as temozolomide. One of the reasons
      for this is that the melanoma can make chemicals that signal the brain to provide new blood
      vessels for the tumor. The main signal is called VEGF. Bevacizumab is an antibody that blocks
      VEGF. The investigators want to see if the combination of bevacizumab and temozolomide will
      stop the melanoma from growing.

      This study proposes the use of a combination of temozolomide and bevacizumab in a carefully
      selected group of patients with metastatic melanoma to the brain. This combination has been
      tested in primary brain tumors and in melanoma not involving the brain. The 6-week on, 2-week
      off low-dose schedule proposed in this trial capitalizes on preclinical data demonstrating
      that temozolomide inhibits angiogenesis at low, non-toxic doses that correspond to the plasma
      concentrations achieved by an oral administration, a so-called 'metronomic' scheduling. The
      precise mechanism of its antiangiogenic action remains to be elucidated. This potential
      synergistic mechanism, together with the bulk of evidence for activity presented above
      suggests that the combination will be well-tolerated, safe and possibly more effective.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant melanoma and
             clinical evidence of metastatic disease to the brain. Mucosal and ocular melanomas are
             included.

          2. Untreated asymptomatic brain metastases ≤ 2 cm in maximal diameter, with mild or
             minimal edema, without associated hemorrhage or midline shift.

          3. Progressing brain metastases of any size, not amenable to surgical resection and/or
             progressing through radiation therapy but without evidence of active associated
             hemorrhage. Treatment with bevacizumab may not be initiated until 4 weeks after
             surgical resection or radiation therapy completion.

          4. Hemorrhagic metastases that have resolved after previous resection or radiation
             therapy do not exclude patients with new non-hemorrhagic metastases meeting the
             criteria described above from participating.

          5. Patients must have measurable metastases to the brain, defined as at least one lesion
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be
             recorded) as &gt;10 mm in the brain MRI with gadolinium. For disease outside the brain,
             tumors must be &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan.
             Measurable disease outside the brain is NOT required.

          6. Patients with any number of previous systemic therapies are eligible. Previous
             temozolomide treatment given on a different schedule is allowed, as long as it had not
             been given in combination with VEGF-targeting drugs.

          7. Age &gt; 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of bevacizumab in patients &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this
             study.

          8. Life expectancy of 8 weeks or greater.

          9. ECOG performance status &lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt; 60%).

         10. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/µl

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µl

               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/µl

               -  Total Bilirubin ** Within institutional upper limit of normal

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine* Within institutional upper limit of normal*

                    -  If creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal, a creatinine clearance &gt;/= 60 ml/m2
                       is required

                    -  Except for patients with known Gilbert's syndrome

         11. The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because the anti-angiogenic agent
             used in this trial may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control)
             prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately.

         12. Concomitant use of steroids to treat cerebral edema is allowed.

         13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease-Specific Exclusions Patients with metastatic disease to the brain not fitting
             the inclusion criteria. Patients with leptomeningeal disease are not excluded.

          -  General Medical Exclusions

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are ineligible for study entry:

          1. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.

          2. Life expectancy of less than 8 weeks

          3. Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned
             participation in an experimental drug study other than this study.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to bevacizumab or temozolomide.

          5. Patients must not exhibit any clinical evidence of coagulopathy. The INR must be &lt; 1.5
             and the values for PTT must be within normal limits. Anticoagulation is not allowed.

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, untreated
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with bevacizumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this
             study.

          8. Otherwise well HIV-positive patients will be permitted to enroll on this trial.

        Bevacizumab-Specific Exclusions

          1. Previous treatment with bevacizumab.

          2. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure 150 and/or
             diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg on antihypertensive medications)

          3. Any prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy

          4. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure (see
             Appendix E)

          8. Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease

          9. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

         10. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to study enrollment or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during
             the course of the study

         11. Core biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular
             access device, within 7 days prior to study enrollment

         12. History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess

                  on dipstick urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24 hour urine collection and
                  must demonstrate ≤ 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).
