      The primary purpose of the project entitled: Multidisciplinary Approach to Reduce Injury and
      Substance Abuse, which is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (5R01DA026088-02),
      is to compare the effectiveness of brief intervention, brief intervention plus a booster, and
      brief advice for adult patients who abuse drugs and present to a trauma department for
      treatment of an injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multidisciplinary Approach to Reduce Injury and Substance Abuse is a randomized clinical
      trial evaluating the effectiveness of brief advice (BA), brief motivational intervention with
      feedback (BMI), and brief motivational intervention with feedback and booster (BMI+B) in
      injured patients with drug problems.

      The setting is a level 1 Trauma Department, which serves a large and diverse patient
      population. Injured patients are screened for eligibility in the project based on a positive
      toxicology screen or self reported drug use in the past 90 days. The primary outcome of
      interest will be patients' subsequent drug use. Other outcomes of interest include:
      HIV-related risk behaviors, improved health outcomes (including injury reduction), increased
      employment, decreased engagement in illegal behavior, increased substance abuse treatment
      utilization, and enhanced quality of life at three, six, and twelve month follow-ups.

      This study will also examine the potential moderating and mediating effects of patient
      readiness to change, use of experiential and behavioral processes of change and decisional
      balance considerations. In addition, this project will examine implementation factors at the
      organizational level and the cost effectiveness of BA, BMI, and BMI+B.

      Study participants and their related identifying information will be collected during the
      time they are admitted to the recruitment hospital trauma department. Study participants must
      be 18 years or older, speak English or Spanish, have been admitted to the recruitment
      hospital trauma department, and test positive for illegal drugs or admit to illegal drug use
      when verbally screened. Additional information will be collected from participants in the
      in-person assessment interviews at three, six, and 12 month follow-up periods.

    <description>The American College of Surgeons (ACS) recently mandated standards of care for all level I trauma centers and currently defined standards of care at the collaborating institution requires that assessment and referral are included in treatment as usual. Therefore, our treatment as usual, or BA, consists of an initial interview conducted by study staff, a recommendation to abstain from drug use, provision of educational material supporting that recommendation, referral to hospital or community treatment resources most likely to be beneficial to the patient and information about relevant community health care agencies.</description>
