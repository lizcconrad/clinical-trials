      All study related procedures, restrictions, duration, dates and timings, information on the
      study formulation and confidentiality of subject data were explained clearly to the
      volunteers by clinical personnel at the time of obtaining informed consent. Volunteers who
      signed the consent form and showed&quot;their willingness to participate in the study were
      enrolled. Volunteers who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and found to be
      healthy on physical examination with laboratory investigation values within reference limits
      were considered eligible to be admitted into the study.
