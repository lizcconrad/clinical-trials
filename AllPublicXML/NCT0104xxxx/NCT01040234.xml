  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study of 30 patients with severe postoperative pain following abdominal
      surgery, in which the dual TAP block technique has been used successfully to achieve pain
      relief. A description of ultrasound technique, effectiveness, duration and potential side
      effects of the pain treatment, with possible recommendations for future use.

      This prospective cohort study is designed to describe a novel ultrasound-guided bilateral
      dual transversus abdominis plane (BD-TAP) block and to evaluate the postoperative analgesic
      efficacy in a selection of patients having undergone major abdominal surgery under general
      anaesthesia where neuraxial anaesthesia and/or intravenous administration of analgesics had
      failed or was unwanted by the patient, or if the placement of an epidural catheter was deemed
      impossible by the anaesthetist in charge. 30 consecutive patients planned for the study.
      BD-TAP to be performed bilaterally with a high frequency linear ultrasound probe, with
      bupivacaine. Success rate, decline in VAS score, postoperative demand of opioids and block
      performance time to be recorded.
