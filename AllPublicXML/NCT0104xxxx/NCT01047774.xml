  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of chronic pain after breast cancer surgery (CPBCS) is high in women diagnosed
      with breast cancer. Similar to other chronic postoperative pain conditions, existing
      treatments for CPBCS do not always work. Adopting the concept of using pain relieving
      measures prior to surgery rather than after it, may lead to decreased postoperative pain
      levels. Soy has been shown to have pain-relieving properties and may reduce the risk for
      developing chronic post-surgical pain. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects
      of adding soy protein to the diet before surgery on the development of chronic pain.

    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies indicate that soy consumption suppresses the development of pain behavior
      and hyperalgesia following nerve injury. The pain-suppressing properties of soy protein have
      been shown to be predominately the result of soy pre-operative consumption.

      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for women diagnosed
      with breast cancer and scheduled to undergo breast cancer surgery. The trial will comprise
      two phases: 1. A 2-week preoperative dietary manipulation phase, and 2. A one-year
      postoperative follow up period. In the first phase eligible candidates will undergo a basic
      dietary evaluation followed by stratification into 4 study groups, based on their pre-vs.
      postmenopausal status and the planned type of surgery, i.e., formal mastectomy vs.
      breast-conserving surgery. Women in each group will be randomized to receive either powdered
      soy protein in the experimental group or milk protein in the control group. During the
      second, post-surgical phase women will resume their normal diet. If shown to be beneficial,
      this simple dietary manipulation may prevent one of the most severe sequelae of breast
      cancer.
