  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells
      are destroyed, resulting in poor blood sugar control. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the safety and effectiveness of islet transplantation, combined with
      immunosuppressive medications and medications to support islet survival for treating type 1
      diabetes in individuals experiencing hypoglycemia unawareness and severe hypoglycemic
      episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is commonly treated with the administration of insulin, either by multiple
      insulin injections or by a continuous supply of insulin through a wearable pump. Insulin
      therapy allows long-term survival in individuals with type 1 diabetes; however, it does not
      guarantee constant normal blood sugar control. Because of this, long-term type 1 diabetic
      survivors often develop vascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease
      that can cause poor vision and blindness, and diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disease that can
      lead to kidney failure. Some individuals with type 1 diabetes develop hypoglycemia
      unawareness, a life-threatening condition that is not easily treatable with medication and is
      characterized by reduced or absent warning signals for hypoglycemia. For such individuals,
      pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation are possible treatment options. Insulin
      independence among islet transplant recipients tends to decline over time. New strategies
      aimed at promoting engraftment of transplanted islets are needed to improve the clinical
      outcomes associated with this procedure.
