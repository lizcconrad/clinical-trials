  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today, haemodialysis is a recognized standard treatment for patients with chronic kidney
      disease stage 5. During the haemodialysis treatment session, blood passes from the patient
      through the extracorporeal circuit and is then returned. The dialyzer represents the greatest
      surface are of the extracorporeal circuit, as dialysis treatment is essentially based on the
      removal of small molecular weight solutes down along a concentration gradient, and this
      depends upon surface area. The ELISIO-H dialyzer differs in design to our current standard
      dialyzer, the FX100, by having fibers of a greater internal diameter, which potentially
      allows more internal haemofiltration, leading to an improved clearance of larger molecular
      weight solutes. It is now thought that these so called &quot;middle molecular weight&quot; solutes are
      more important in contributing to the clinical condition termed azotaemia, rather than
      smaller solutes such as urea.

      The investigators therefore wish to study the clearance of middle sized molecules between the
      different dialyzers.

      Stable chronic kidney dialysis patients, currently dialyzing on the main Royal Free hospital
      dialysis unit will be asked to participate in the study. It is aimed to recruit 15 patients
      currently dialysing using the Fresenius FX100 dialyzer, who have used Fresenius polysulphone
      membranes for &gt; 3 months.

      During a mid week dialysis session, dialysis adequacy will be assessed by on line clearance,
      and samples of both blood and dialysate taken to assess, both clearances and
      bio-compatibility.

      Thereafter patients would be switched to dialyse using the ELISIOTM-H dialyzer, but continue
      with the same dialysis prescription, and after 3 months, measurements repeated

      Assessments Primary Clearances : on-line Kt/V, dual pool Kt/V, phosphate, b2microglobulin,
      cystatin C Secondary Serum :isoprostane generation complement activation platelet activation
      - coagulation activation - thrombophilic markers - Other Anticoagulation requirements &amp;
      clotted circuits erythropoietin requirements, phosphate control therapy CRP
