      Our aim is to Test the influence of a new multichanel Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      stimulator (Multiway) on motor excitation, in comparision to a wildly used Magstim Super
      Rapid 2 single channel stimulator.

      Each of the 20 Healthy subjects that are inticipated to inrole to the study wiil undergo 6
      simple procedures which are designed to compare the motor threshold obtained by diffrent
      combination of TMs coils (figure 8, double cone coil,H coil array) and stimulators (Multiway,
      Super Rapid 2).

      The entire length of the procedures is about 4 hours and all subjects will be paid for their
      participation in the study.

      Our main hypothesis is that the motor threshold obtained by the multichanel stimulator will
      be significtly lower then the single chanel stimulator.
