  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the predictive diagnostic accuracy of SonoMedica's
      CardioSond digital electronic stethoscope in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD)
      in patients without known disease who are referred to cardiac computed tomography angiography
      (CT scans).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CardioSond is a completely noninvasive medical device which detects heart sounds and
      murmurs using ultrasensitive acoustic technology. The CardioSond produces a flow micro bruit
      score which is used to determine the likelihood of coronary artery disease.

      The CardioSond exam will be given to patients who agree to participate in the study upon
      signing of an informed consent form and prior to the administration of beta blocker agents
      and / or vasodilators as part of the normal cardiac CT angiography protocol.

      CardioSond data will be sent to an independent acoustic core lab which will determine data
      quality and produce a flow micro bruit score. CT angiography data will be analyzed by staff
      at North Shore University Hospital.

      A data review panel lead my the principal investigator will examine the results of both the
      CardioSond and CT angiography data to determine the accuracy of the CardioSond in detecting
      CAD in the study population at large and in specific patient subgroups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are undergoing routine screening coronary CT angiography

          -  Willingness to sign informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to provide informed consent form

          -  Age less than 21 years

          -  Any contraindications to coronary CT angiography

          -  Known atherosclerotic heart disease, including a history of prior myocardial
             infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery
             or an established diagnosis of CAD by prior X-ray or CT angiography

          -  Supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias that would be expected to affect
             CT-angiography image quality (e.g., atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular
             tachycardia, bigeminy, and trigeminy). Patients with isolated premature atrial
             contractions and premature ventricular contractions may enroll.

          -  Use of intravenous vasodilators

          -  Any pulmonary conditions that would create abnormal physical findings that would
             interfere with the fidelity of the cardiac sound recording (e.g., obstructive
             pulmonary disease, such as asthma or COPD, with audible wheezing).

          -  Presence of audible aortic or pulmonic diastolic murmurs, tricuspid or mitral flow
             diastolic murmurs, or continuous murmurs
