  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present trial is to evaluate the local and general safety of the
      intratumoural electrotransfer of increasing doses of Plasmid AMEP in patients suffering from
      advanced or metastatic melanoma and to identify doses that could be effective on cutaneous
      lesions in man.

    <textblock>
      In this open, multicentre, dose escalation study, successive cohorts of 3 patients suffering
      from advanced or metastatic melanoma will be electrotransferred increasing doses of Plasmid
      AMEP into cutaneous melanoma lesions in 2 divided doses at one week interval.
