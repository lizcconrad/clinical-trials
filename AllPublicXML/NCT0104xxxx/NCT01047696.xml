    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether reduced exposure to indoor air pollution
      would reduce ALRI incidence in children &lt;18 months of age. Households were randomized to
      receive a chimney stove (intervention group) or continue using an open fire for cooking and
      heating (control group).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are the chief killer of children. Most cases are
      pneumonia and the majority occur among poor children under five years in developing
      countries. Poverty might be said to be the primary cause, which manifests as malnutrition,
      including micro-nutrient deficiencies, and lack of access to medical care. Another attribute
      of poverty is household indoor air pollution (HAP) from use of unprocessed solid fuels such
      as biomass (wood, animal dung and crop wastes) and coal in simple stoves. A meta-analysis of
      published observational studies found that young children exposed to smoke from household
      solid fuel use had a rate of ALRI twice that of children not exposed or where clean fuels
      were used. Recent studies have shown similar ALRI risks associated with short-term air
      pollution measurements and other indicators of exposure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Households were invited to participate in the study if they met the following inclusion
        criteria:

          -  Used only an open fire for cooking and heating

          -  Had a pregnant woman or child &lt; 4 months residing in the home

          -  Identified as Mam (the regional ethnic group), and had

          -  Minimal summer migration (less than 12 weeks per year)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Households were excluded from participating if:

          -  The household was already using a chimney stove for cooking

          -  There was no child &lt;4 months of age or a pregnant woman residing in the home

          -  Seasonal migration required the family to move to another region for more than 12
             weeks of the year
