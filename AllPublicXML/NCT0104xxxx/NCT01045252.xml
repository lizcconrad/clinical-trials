      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hemodynamic values of neonates that are healthy
      and those with various congenital heart diseases and sepsis by using echocardiography and
      USCOM.

    <textblock>
      Echocardiography is a diagnostic tool for congenital heart disease.However,it requires
      skilled specialists to perform it and is a little expensive.Besides,it is too big to move to
      the bedside easily.USCOM is another newly choice to evaluate hemodynamic values in recent
      years.This study will compare the hemodynamic values of neonates that are healthy and those
      with congenital heart diseases and sepsis by using echocardiography and USCOM.
