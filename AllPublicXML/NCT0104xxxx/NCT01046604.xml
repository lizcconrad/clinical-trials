  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the absence of treatment, severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) results in left atrium
      (LA) dilatation and hypertrophy, followed ultimately by left ventricular dysfunction and
      heart failure. One promising intervention for the prevention of the deleterious effects of
      pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure is dietary supplementation
      with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). However, the molecular targets and mechanisms
      by which n-3 PUFAs exert their effects are not completely defined. A possible target of n-3
      PUFAs is the mitochondrial membrane which has broad implications given that mitochondrial
      dysfunction and altered metabolism have been associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart
      failure. The investigators have recently identified significant mitochondrial dysfunction in
      the LA of patients with severe MR, as compared to their non-hypertrophied right atrium (RA).
      However, the investigators have not addressed the possibility that intervention with purified
      n-3 PUFAs (Lovaza) could improve mitochondrial function. From a mechanistic perspective, the
      investigators have observed in vitro that n-3 PUFAs accumulate predominately into the
      mitochondrial membrane of cardiomyocytes where the investigators believe they exert their
      effects on the biophysical organization of the membrane. Therefore, the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is
      that administering Lovaza to patients with severe MR will reduce apoptosis and improve
      mitochondrial function in LA (Aim 1). This change in mitochondrial function will be driven by
      significant biochemical and biophysical remodeling of the mitochondrial membrane (Aim 2).
