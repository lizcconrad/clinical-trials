    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidal disease is a common entity in the general population and in clinical practice.
      The basic pathological factor in hemorrhoids is the dilation of the anorectal venous
      plexuses. In the acute bleeding of internal hemorrhoids, one of the pathogenic processes
      implicated is the stagnation and stasis of blood in the vascular plexuses of the prolapsed
      anal cushions. Euphorbia prostrata extract is found to have antihemorrhoidal activity and is
      useful in ameliorating signs and symptoms associated with hemorrhoids.
