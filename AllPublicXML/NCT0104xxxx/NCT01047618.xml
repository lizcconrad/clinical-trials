  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis
      (DVT), is a common complication and leading cause of death in cancer patients. Large,
      population-based studies have shown that patients with cancer have four- to seven-fold
      increased risk of developing VTE compared with patients without cancer. VTE would be frequent
      in patients with advanced gastric cancer, especially associated chemotherapy. However,
      relatively few studies have been conducted regarding the incidence of VTE in Asian cancer
      patients. According to previous review, Asian patients significantly lower risk of developing
      VTE. The rate of VTE with advanced gastric cancer, and associated chemotherapy is not known
      in Asian patients. In addition, the impact of VTE on overall survival has not been documented
      in these patients.
