      This will be a prospective, single-arm, single-center, open-label study to evaluate the
      preliminary safety and accuracy of the ActiSight™ Needle Guidance System in patients
      undergoing CT-guided percutaneous aspiration and RF Ablations The procedure will be performed
      by a trained physician. Subjects will be screened for inclusion in the study. Following
      signing of informed consent, screening procedures will be performed including demographic and
      medical history, vital signs, anthropometrics), chest radiography, if applicable and CT
      scanning, blood samples for coagulation indices (PT, APTT), if applicable, and pregnancy test
      in women of child-bearing potential.

      Within an 18-day screening period, eligible subjects will be enrolled into the study and
      undergo percutaneous aspiration or percutaneous biopsy or RF ablation utilizing the
      ActiSight™ Needle Guidance system using CT to guide the needle. Subjects will be followed-up
      for at least one hour at the clinic for safety and preliminary accuracy evaluations. An erect
      chest radiograph will be performed within 90 minutes of observation after chest aspiration if
      performed to detect the majority of post procedure pneumothoraces for biopsies in the chest.
      Post procedural CT will be performed according to the physician's consideration. ** Note **
      If any complications are observed while using the ActiSight System, the investigator will
      revert to using standard procedure.
