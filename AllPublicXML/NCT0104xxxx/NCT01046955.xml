    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe in a randomized prospective study the effectiveness
      and toxicity of Thymoglobulin vs. Campath-1H used for induction therapy in recipients of
      living donor (LD) kidneys, compared with the investigators standard treatment protocol of
      Zenapax® and maintenance immunosuppression.

      To observe in a randomized prospective pilot study the effectiveness and toxicity of
      Thymoglobulin vs. Campath-1H used for induction therapy in recipients of living donor (LD)
      kidneys, compared with our standard treatment protocol of Zenapax® and maintenance
      immunosuppression (vide infra).

      To determine the effect different antibody induction regimen on the lymphoid cell subsets of
      the immune system in kidney allograft recipients peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirates
      will be tested at surgery before transplantation and at intervals post operatively.

      To treat renal transplant patients successfully in the absence of long-term calcineurin
      inhibition to determine if there are beneficial effects on the prevention of chronic
      allograft nephropathy.
