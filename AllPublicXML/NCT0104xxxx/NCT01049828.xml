  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the occurrence of an auditory sensation without the presence of an acoustic
      stimulus. Approximately, 50 million people in the United States experience chronic tinnitus
      and 15 million of these people have bothersome tinnitus. Several studies have shown that
      people who are bothered by their tinnitus have difficulty in concentration and focus. Through
      imaging modalities we have deranged neural networks responsible for attention. Only 20
      percent of patients diagnosed with tinnitus are severely bothered. We seek the following:

        1. Match a group of non-bothered tinnitus patients on age and hearing status to an existing
           cohort of bothered tinnitus patients.

        2. Assess the resting-state neural connectivity in patients with non-bothersome tinnitus.
           Findings from the comparison of functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging
           (fcMRI) from subjects with bothersome tinnitus in our current rTMS clinical trial to
           normal age-matched controls without tinnitus demonstrates that subjects with bothersome
           tinnitus have dramatic alterations in cortical attention and control networks. Our
           hypothesis is that the fcMRI-defined changes in the attention and control networks
           reflect the impact of excessive auditory stimulation in patients with bothersome
           tinnitus and explains the difficulty with concentration, short-term memory, and other
           common problems. To fully test this hypothesis we need to obtain fcMRI of the attention
           network among subjects with tinnitus but without bother and compare the status of their
           neural networks with those of tinnitus subjects with bother and with normal controls.

        3. Compare the resting cortical networks in subjects with non-bothersome tinnitus to
           subjects with bothersome tinnitus and subjects without tinnitus Our null hypothesis is
           that there are no differences in the resting-state cortical networks, especially the
           attention and control networks, between tinnitus patients who do not experience bother,
           tinnitus patients who do experience bother, and subjects without tinnitus. Through
           fcMRI, we will examine correlations in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals in
           established auditory, attention, control, and other brain regions in the resting brain
           and compare these findings to already collected fcMRI scans of bothered tinnitus
           patients, and controls (patients without tinnitus).

        20 adults between the ages of 45 and 60 years, age and hearing level-matched to the
        bothered tinnitus cohort from the on-going research at Washington University. Subjects will
        be recruited from an institutional tinnitus database, from Washington University
        Otolaryngology Clinics, as well as the general public through poster advertisement on the
        Washington University grounds.
