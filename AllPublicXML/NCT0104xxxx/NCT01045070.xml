  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease&quot;. The hypothesis of an infectious burden as
      trigger or initiator of the inflammatory process in atherosclerosis has been extensively
      discussed in the past years. One part of this discussion is focused on the infectious agents
      responsible for periodontitis. Several studies have found an association of periodontitis
      and/or bacteria related to this disease and atherosclerosis. However, a study focussing on
      the prognostic relevance of these factors is missing.

      The hypothesis of this study is that periodontitis is a prognostic relevant risk factor for
      patients with angiographically proven coronary heart disease. Furthermore, the infectious
      pathogen burden by PCR-detection of periodontal pathogens will be evaluated as a prognostic
      factor.

      960 consecutive patients with angiographically proven coronary heart disease will be included
      in this study. After inclusion of patients an extensive periodontal examination including
      PCR-sampling for 11 bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivitis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,
      and others) will be performed. After 12 months patient will be follow up for any major
      adverse events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke).

      If this study will find a relation of periodontitis or its microbiological agents to
      cardiovascular outcome of patients with coronary heart disease, further studies are necessary
      to investigate potential therapeutic consequences for patients with CHD and periodontitis.
