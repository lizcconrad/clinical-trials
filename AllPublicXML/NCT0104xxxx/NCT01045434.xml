      An open label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, single dose,
      crossover oral bioequivalence study of Omeprazole Magnesium 20 mg DR capsules of Dr. Reddy's
      Laboratories Limited, India and Prilosec OTCTM 20 mg (Omeprazole Magnesium DR Tablets)of
      Procter and Gamble, Cincinnati, Sweden in 38 healthy, adult, human subjects under fed
      conditions.

      This study used a crossover design consisting of 2 treatments, 2 sequences and 2 periods.
      Study Period-I and IT were separated by a washout period of 14 days. Use of a crossover
      design is appropriate since it enables comparison of treatments within the same subject using
      intrasubject variability thus improving the precision of treatment comparisons. Also use of
      14 days of washout period between successive drug administrations eliminates chances of
      residual drug being present at preceding period (i.e Period 1) to next period (i.e Period
      II).
