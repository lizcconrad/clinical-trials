      Study Objective: Training physicians in new skills via classroom-based teaching has inherent
      costs and time constraints. We sought to evaluate whether web-based didactics result in
      similar knowledge improvement and retention of basic ultrasound principles and the EFAST
      (Extended Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) compared with the traditional
      method.

      Methods: Physicians from two German emergency departments were randomized into a classroom
      group with traditional lectures and a web group that watched narrated lectures online. All
      participants completed a pre- and post-test, and a second post-test eight weeks later. Both
      groups underwent hands-on training after the first post-test. A control group completed the
      two initial tests without didactic intervention.
