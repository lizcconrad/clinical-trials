  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a newly developed endoscopic technique. The most
      commonly used fluorescent substance is Fluorescein sodium.The plasma half-life of ﬂuorescein
      is 11 minutes. A recent test estimated that ﬂuorescein-based CLSM(confocal laser scanning
      microscopy) of the upper-GI tract of pigs delivers the best contrast and image quality within
      the ﬁrst 8 minutes after injection of ﬂuorescein .However, despite its increasing use in
      clinical examination,there are no data on contrast dynamics and image quality over time after
      injection of the ﬂuorescein sodium in the inspection of gastrointestinal tract of human
      being.
