  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of this study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of XL147 when given in
      combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and in combination with trastuzumab and paclitaxel.
      After the MTD is established for each combination (Phase 2), subjects will be enrolled to
      evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of these combinations in metastatic HER2
      positive breast cancer. Both trastuzumab and paclitaxel are used in the treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but patients can develop resistance.

      The link between PI3K mutations and trastuzumab resistance has been seen in breast cancer
      patients. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/PTEN pathway may have the potential to
      restore sensitivity to trastuzumab. Similarly, introduction of activated mutant forms of PI3K
      has been shown to transform and confer paclitaxel resistance to immortalized breast
      epithelial cells. XL147 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3K and inhibits
      phosphorylation of multiple downstream components of PI3K/PTEN signaling. Therefore, XL147
      may have utility in the treatment of trastuzumab resistant/refractory and HER2-positive MBC
      when administered in combination with trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab and paclitaxel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has pathologically and radiologically confirmed metastatic HER2 positive
             breast cancer (Stage IV disease). Subjects must have received and progressed on at
             least one prior trastuzumab-containing regimen for metastatic disease. For subjects in
             Arm 2, they must also have received at least one prior taxane-containing regimen.

          -  The subject has at least one lesion that is not within a previously radiated field and
             measurable on computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI)
