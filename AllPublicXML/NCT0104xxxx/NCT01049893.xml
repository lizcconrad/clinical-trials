      AC220 will be administered as a once daily oral solution given continuously as 28-day
      treatment cycles, without food and without any rest periods, as long as there is no evidence

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females age ≥18 years

          2. Understand and voluntarily sign the informed consent form for this study

          3. Available for periodic follow-up at the investigative site

          5. ECOG performance status of 0 - 2

          6. Histological diagnosis of a primary solid tumor malignancy that meets the following
             criteria:

               -  Evidence (radiographic or tissue confirmation) that the disease is metastatic
                  (locally advanced disease is allowable only if no surgical or local therapeutic
                  option exists); and

               -  Disease which has progressed on or following currently available standard
                  therapies or for which no curative therapy exists (Prior adjuvant, neoadjuvant,
                  and investigational therapies are permitted.)

          7. Measurable disease by computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             scans per RECIST.

          8. Prior anticancer therapy, radiotherapy, hormonal, and immunotherapy are allowed.
             Patients must have recovered from toxicity of prior therapy (ie, toxicity has resolved
             to Grade 1, or to pre-treatment baseline, or is deemed irreversible). At least 4 weeks
             must have elapsed since the last systemic therapy (6 weeks for nitrosoureas,
             mitomycin-C, and liposomal doxorubicin), immunotherapy, or radiotherapy and the
             beginning of study drug administration. For participants with GIST on approved
             tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), at least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the last
             dose of TKI.

          9. Adequate bone marrow function, defined as:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (neutrophils and bands) ≥1.5 x 10^9 cells/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9 cells/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

         10. Adequate hepatic function, defined as:

               -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x the
                  institutional ULN

         11. Adequate renal function, defined as:

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the institutional ULN

         12. Prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time (PT- PTT) ≤ 1.5 x the ULN

         13. Serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels should be at least within institutional
             normal limits, and every effort should be made to keep potassium concentrations above
             4.0 mEq/dL, magnesium concentrations above 1.8 mg/dL, and serum calcium at normal
             concentration with the administration of oral/IV potassium and/or magnesium and/or
             calcium replacement during the study. If this is not possible, potassium and magnesium
             (and calcium) concentrations should at least be kept within institutional normal
             limits.

         14. Fully recovered (≤ Grade 1 or returned to baseline or deemed irreversible) from the
             acute effects of prior cancer therapy before initiation of study drug administration.

         15. Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 45% (or ≥ institutional lower
             limit of normal if institutional lower limit of normal is below 45%) as assessed by
             2-dimensional ECHO or MUGA as per institutional practice. If repeat LVEF assessment is
             required, the same modality should be used throughout the duration of study, whenever
             possible.

         16. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for at least 3 months after
             the study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. WOCBP includes any
             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical
             sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is
             not post menopausal (defined as amenorrhea &gt; 12 consecutive months; or who is on
             hormone replacement therapy [HRT] with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone
             [FSH] level &gt; 35 mIU/mL). Additionally, premenopausal women who are using oral,
             implanted or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products such as an
             intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent
             pregnancy, are practicing abstinence, or whose partner is sterile (eg, vasectomy),
             should be considered to be of childbearing potential.

         17. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L
             or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) within 72 hours prior to
             the start of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable contraceptive method to avoid
             pregnancy for the entire study period and for at least 3 months after the study.

          2. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          3. WOCBP with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment prior to study drug administration

          4. Men who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control if their
             sexual partners are WOCBP for the entire study period and for at least 3 months after
             completion of the study

          5. Patients with known untreated, symptomatic or uncontrolled brain or central nervous
             system (CNS) metastases. Patients with treated brain or CNS metastases that are
             radiographically stable for 3 months or longer are eligible.

          6. A serious uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection which would impair the
             ability of the patient to receive study drug

          7. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including:

               -  A myocardial infarction within 12 months prior to study entry

                  patients with history CHF NYHA class 3 or 4 in the past, unless the screening
                  ECHO or MUGA within 14 days prior to study entry results in a LVEF that is ≥ 45%
                  (or ≥institutional lower limit of normal)

               -  Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome

               -  Any history of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias (such as

             of informed consent

         11. Investigational agents during or within 4 weeks prior to the start of study drug

         12. Use of drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing prolonged QTc
             and/or TdP and/or are CYP3A4 inhibitors. Patients who have discontinued any of these
             medications must have a washout period of at least 5 days or at least 5 half-lives of
             the drug (whichever is greater) prior to the first dose of study drug and should not
             be allowed to take these medications during the study drug dosing.

         13. Medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance
             that, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator or Sponsor, could jeopardize
             patient safety or interfere with the objectives of the study.
