  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will utilize a set of imaging modalities including computed tomography (CT), positron
      emission tomography (PET), and a suite of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tools, to
      investigate the changes in the human brain resulting from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit mTBI subjects and control subjects. Each subject will undergo the set of
      imaging modalities, and the results will be analyzed for differences at the structural,
      physiological, and molecular levels. The long term goal of this research is the development
      of a method to diagnose mTBI based on physical markers. This is a phased project beginning
      with a pilot study followed by future studies with larger sample sizes.
