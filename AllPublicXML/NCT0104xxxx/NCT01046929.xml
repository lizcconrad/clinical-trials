    <textblock>
      Limonene is a major component in the essential oils of citrus fruits. It has demonstrated
      promising breast cancer preventive and therapeutic effects in preclinical model systems. This
      early phase clinical study will evaluate the distribution of limonene to the breast tissue
      and its associated biological activities after 2 to 6 weeks of limonene dosing in women with
      a recent diagnosis of early stage breast cancer. This study will help evaluate the potentials
      of developing limonene as a breast cancer preventive agent.
