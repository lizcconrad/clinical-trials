      The main research objective is to work out the optimal doses of the novel combination of
      gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and imatinib mesylate (glivec) in patients with advanced pancreatic
      cancer that has progressed during or after treatment with first-line gemcitabine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using the phase I study design, the dose of gemcitabine will be escalated in several steps to
      identify the highest tolerable dose that can be given safely. Based on pre-defined
      dose-limiting toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose of the combination will be identified and
      a safer dose for further evaluation of this regimen in pancreatic cancer selected. The
      primary objectives are therefore based around safety of the drug combination.

    <description>The starting dose of gemcitabine will be 400 mg/m2 on day 1 of a two-week cycle.
Gemcitabine is given on day 1 every two weeks according to the dose escalation schedule below:
Dose level -1 200mg/m2 Dose level 1 400mg/m2 Dose level 2 600mg/m2 Dose level 3 800mg/m2 Dose level 4 1000mg/m2 Dose level 5 1000mg/m2 It is administered as an intravenous infusion, the lyophilized powder being diluted in normal saline, at a fixed dose of 10 mg/m2/minute.</description>

    <description>Oxaliplatin is given by intravenous infusion on day 2 every 2 weeks according to the dose escalation schedule below: Dose level -1 - 4 85mg/m2 Dose level 5 100mg/m2 Oxaliplatin should be diluted in 250 to 500 ml of 5% glucose solution to give a concentration not less than 0.2 mg/ml. It must be infused via a central venous line or peripheral vein over 2 hours. In the event of extravasation, administration must be discontinued immediately and the extravasation managed according to local procedures.</description>

    <description>Imatinib is given for 7 days every cycle starting 2 days before the gemcitabine is given, including administration on days 1 and 2 when gemcitabine and oxaliplatin are given, and for 3 days afterwards (i.e. days -2 to +5). It is thus given on a 7 days on and 7 days off intermittent dosing schedule. The dose will be fixed at 400 mg daily in tablet form and taken once daily with food.
Imatinib should commence either in the morning or lunchtime of day -2 and be taken at the same time daily for seven consecutive days in total.</description>
