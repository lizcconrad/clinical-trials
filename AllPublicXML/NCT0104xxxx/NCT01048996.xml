  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and the more severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are a
      significant problem in Pediatric Intensive Care Units, affecting up to 16 of every 1000
      children admitted to these units. These disorders carry with them high mortality rates as
      well as numerous long-term effects for the surviving children. As the effects of these
      diseases have significant social and economic ramifications for affected children and their
      families, research on the development of ALI/ARDS could significantly change how physicians
      understand the disease and treat patients.

      There are a wide range of problems which make certain PICU patients more likely to develop
      either ALI or ARDS. This research aims to determine which of these children are at the
      greatest risk for ALI/ARDS by examining differences in plasma biomarkers and in DNA of a
      large number of PICU patients. We are hypothesizing that significant differences in the level
      of specific plasma biomarkers or in the frequency of specific DNA variants exist in children
      who develop ALI/ARDS.

        Subjects will be recruited concurrently with subjects recruited for the &quot;RESTORE&quot; sedation
        study. All patients who have been admited to a Pediatric Intensive/Critical Care Unit and
        on mechanical ventilation will be screened for eligibility at the participating
        institutions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Consecutive intubated pediatric patients (≥ 2 weeks of age and ≥ 42 weeks corrected
             gestational age and ≤ 18 years of age) supported on mechanical ventilation for acute
             pulmonary parenchymal disease enrolled in the RESTORE study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             considered futile)

          -  Enrolled in any other sedation clinical trial concurrently or within the last 30 days

          -  Known allergy to any of the study medications
