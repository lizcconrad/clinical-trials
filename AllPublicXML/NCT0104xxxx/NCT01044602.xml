      Best medical management and gastric bypass surgery is a way to treat diabetes as part of
      regular medical care (standard of care). However, gastric bypass surgery is not a way to
      treat diabetes as part of regular medical care (standard of care).

      Best medical management and gastric bypass surgery are ways to treat obesity as part of
      regular medical care (standard of care). Best medical management is a way to treat diabetes
      as part of regular medical care (standard of care). However, gastric bypass surgery is not a
      way to treat diabetes as part of regular medical care (standard of care). But, studies
      suggest that diabetes gets better or goes away after gastric bypass surgery. This study is
      being done to find out if diabetes gets better or goes away completely after a patient has
      gastric bypass surgery as part of regular medical care (standard of care).
