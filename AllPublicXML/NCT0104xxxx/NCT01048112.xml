  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to continue to develop a model of infection with Campylobacter
      jejuni, a bacterium that causes food and water-borne disease (mainly diarrhea). The
      objectives are to 1) determine if healthy subjects develop short-term (&lt;6 month) protection
      to reinfection with C. jejuni; and 2) characterize the immune responses to C. jejuni
      infection. Information obtained will be used in development of a vaccine against
      Campylobacter infections.

      Volunteers will be screened for eligibility within 60 days prior to enrollment. Screening
      will include obtaining informed consent prior to any study procedure. This will be followed
      by medical history, physical examination, review of current medications, blood samples for
      safety labs (WBC, Hct, Hgb, platelet count; chemistry panel; screening for HIV, HLA-B27, HBV,
      and HCV); urine pregnancy testing for females. Stool will be tested for infection.

      Eligible volunteers will be enrolled in the study and admitted to the GCRC on Day -1. They
      will drink a measured dose of C. jejuni on Day 0, and followed for approximately 9 inpatient
      days, during which time the investigators expect at least 75% to develop a diarrheal illness,
      which will be promptly treated with replacement fluids (oral or IV, as indicated) and
      antibiotics. During the inpatient period, subjects will be assessed for any adverse events,
      and blood and stool specimens will be analyzed for markers of infection and markers of immune
      response. Subjects must have resolved or resolving symptoms and two negative stool cultures
      ≥12 hours apart to be eligible for discharge, and will be seen in outpatient follow-up at 21,
      28, 35, 60, and 90 days for additional AE assessments and blood and stool analysis.

      Eight subjects will return for redosing approximately 98 days after the initial dose, with
      the same inpatient and outpatient follow-up as above. Few or none should develop a diarrheal
      illness. Four naïve (previously unexposed) subjects will also receive the dose on Day 98 to
      confirm a 75% illness rate with this dose. They will be followed as the initial group was.
      All participants will be assessed by phone 6 months after the final dose they received.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age, inclusive.

          -  General good health, without significant medical illness, abnormal physical
             examination findings or clinical laboratory abnormalities as determined by principal
             investigator or principal investigator in consultation with the medical monitor and
             sponsor.

          -  Demonstrate comprehension of the protocol procedures and knowledge of Campylobacter
             illness by passing a written examination (pass grade ≥ 70%)

          -  Willing to participate after informed consent obtained.
