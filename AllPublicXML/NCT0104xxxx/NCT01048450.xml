      end stage degeneration in the big toe joint.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hallux rigidus is a degenerative process that occurs in the first metatarsophalangeal joint
      (MTPJ). There are a variety of surgical treatment options available for its treatment
      including joint sparing and joint destructive procedures. Patients with end stage arthritis
      are often given several surgical options for the treatment of the first MTPJ. The procedures
      are correlated to the patient's age, type of shoe gear, activity level, Body Mass Index,
      degree of arthritis, desire for joint mobility and bone density. This proposal outlines a
      retrospective study on the long-term efficacy of joint resection, joint fusion, and
      hemi-metallic first MTPJ implants. A multi-center study of 300 subjects who received surgical
      repair for end stage arthritis of the first MTPJ will be evaluated. Subjective assessment for
      pain, function and alignment as well as objective radiographic evaluation will be performed.
      Further, the frequency and types of adverse events associated with the three surgical
      techniques will be assessed. The results of this study will provide valuable information to
      foot and ankle surgeons in making appropriate decisions regarding the treatment options for
      end stage hallux rigidus.
