      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of n-3 fatty acids on taxane-induced
      neuropathy and neurotoxic inflammatory agents in patients suffering from invasive breast
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Chemotherapy with taxanes in patients
      with breast cancer causes some complications and neuropathy is one of the most frequent that
      is dose limiting and even may cause to stop the therapy. n-3 fatty acids have very
      significant role in improvement the function of the neurons.n-3 fatty acids decrease the
      demyelination and toxicities resulting from taxanes. They also lower the level of of the
      neurotoxic inflammatory agents. So,n-3 fatty acids improve the quality of life in this
      patients. 52 patients with invasive breast cancer will be randomized in a double-blind
      placebo-controlled manner to receive either 640 mg oil fish pearls( 54% DHA, 10% EPA) 3 times
      a day or placebo( corn oil pearls) for 3 months(during the chemotherapy with taxanes).
      Neuropathy (using EMG-NCV test)and the level of IL-1,IL-6, TNF-alpha, hs-crp and serum level
      of EPA and DHA fatty acids will be measured before chemotherapy with taxanes and at the end
      of the therapy (after 3 months).
