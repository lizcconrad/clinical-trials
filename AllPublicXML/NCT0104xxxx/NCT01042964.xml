      Primary objective:

      To evaluate safety and tolerability, adverse events (AEs), vital signs, ECG, bleeding time,
      evaluation of antibody titer and safety laboratory tests

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (platelet aggregation)of six ascending
      single intravenous doses of PR-15 in healthy volunteers

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate safety and tolerability by using adverse events (AEs), vital signs including
      blood pressure/pulse rate (BP/PR), electrocardiographic examinations (12 lead ECG), bleeding
      time, evaluation of antibody titer and safety laboratory tests (biochemistry, hematology,
      coagulation, urinalysis)

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (collagen-induced platelet
      aggregation)of six ascending single intravenous doses of PR-15 in healthy, male volunteers

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, male Caucasians between 18 and 45 years of age.

          -  Normotensive subjects (systolic BP &lt; 140 mmHg and diastolic BP &lt;90 mmHg;

          -  Body weight of 70 to 90 kg (BMI 20 - 25.

          -  Negative results in HIV antibody, HBs antigen (HBsAg) and HCV tests;

          -  Signed Informed Consent Form.

          -  Normal coagulation function (aPTT between 24 and 35 seconds, PT between 70 and 130%,
             INR between 0.85 and 1.15.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are taking or have taken any prescription medication within the last 14
             days or any non-prescription medication, especially, anti-platelet drugs, within the
             last seven days prior to the administration of trial medication on Day 1.

          -  Intake of any investigational drug within three months prior to the administration of
             study medication on Day 1.

          -  Concomitant use of any other medication including over-the-counter preparations.

          -  History of hypersensitivity, contraindication or serious adverse reaction to
             inhibitors of platelet aggregation or hypersensitivity to related drugs
             (cross-allergy) or to any of the excipients in the study drug.

          -  A history or clinical evidence of any cardiac, cardio- or cerebrovascular, hepatic,
             renal, pulmonary, endocrine, neurological, infectious, gastrointestinal,
             haematological, oncological or psychiatric disease or emotional problems or any other
             clinically relevant condition, physical finding, ECG- or laboratory test abnormality,
             which - in the opinion of the investigator - would pose a significant risk for the
             subject, invalidate the Informed Consent or limit the ability of the subject to comply
             with study requirements or interfere otherwise with the conduct of the study.

          -  Any laboratory value outside the normal laboratory reference range at Screening and
             before randomization, unless approved by the investigator.

          -  Subjects known to have experienced elevated liver enzyme values will also be excluded.

          -  History of alcohol and/or drug abuse (verified by drug screening).

          -  Blood loss of 450 ml or more during the last three months before Screening.

          -  Subjects who smoke more than 5 cigarettes per day and/or are unable to abstain from
             smoking during the entire in-house period.

          -  Subjects who were previously enrolled in this trial or who have received PR-15 in a
             previous trial.

          -  Subjects who have participated in other clinical trials in the last 3 months.
