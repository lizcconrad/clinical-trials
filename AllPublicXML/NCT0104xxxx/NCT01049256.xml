  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to test our method for measuring chemosensitivity (the ventilatory response to a
      change in carbon dioxide), which uses sinusoidal carbon dioxide stimuli.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Carbon dioxide sensitivity is dependent on the cycle time over which we administer the
           gas (frequency).

        -  Chemoreflex gain decreases as deadspace increases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will apply a new method for the measurement of chemosensitivity (how sensitive a person is
      to changes in carbon dioxide), which is one of the principle determinants of whether people
      with heart failure develop abnormal breathing patterns We have shown in a pilot study that
      administering sinusoidal patterns of inspired carbon dioxide produces similar sinusoidal
      responses in ventilation. We aim to test our method for measuring chemosensitivity, which
      uses sinusoidal carbon dioxide stimuli (similar to those that drive the oscillations in
      ventilation found in periodic breathing). We aim to show that how the cycle time of carbon
      dioxide administered affects the resulting ventilatory oscillations and therefore that when
      measuring the chemoreflex clinically, it is important to deliver carbon dioxide stimuli that
      replicate the cycle time of oscillations in carbon dioxide seen in periodic breathing
      (typically approximately one minute).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Heart failure subjects with stable cardiorespiratory control to be recruited from our
             institution's specialist heart failure clinic.

          -  Normal healthy volunteers, with normal systolic function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will exclude patients with chronic respiratory disease (every patient will have
             formal lung function testing on entrance into the study) or unstable coronary artery
             disease (myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the past 3 months).

          -  In addition any subjects receiving treatment with morphine and derivatives,
             theophylline, oxygen, benzodiazepines or acetazolamide will be excluded as these
             affect chemosensitivity.
