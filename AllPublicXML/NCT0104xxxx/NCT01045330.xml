        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 65 year and older

          -  Length of Stay is over 6 days

          -  Able to communicate verbally or in writing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Coma

          -  Mechanism ventilation

          -  Aphasia, if communication ability is severely impaired

          -  Terminal condition with comfort care only, death imminent

          -  Combative or dangerous behavior

          -  Severe psychotic disorder that prevents patient from participating in interventions

          -  Severe dementia (e.g. unable to communicate; MMSE=0). For patients with severe
             impairment (e.g. MMSE&lt;10), decision to enroll will be made on a case-by-case basis
             depending on their ability to participate in intervention.

          -  Respiratory isolation (e.g. tuberculosis). Patients on contact isolation (e.g.
             vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) or droplet precautions will be enrolled.

          -  Discharge firmly anticipated within 6 days of admission. Enroll if discharge date
             unsure

          -  Refusal by patient or family member.

          -  Others. Reason to be well documented.
