  <brief_title>Pulse ACTH vs. MP for MS</brief_title>
  <official_title>Comparison of Monthly Pulse ACTH (Acthar Gel) Therapy With Methylprednisolone (MP, Solumedrol) for Long-Term Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) as an Add on Therapy to Beta-interferons (Avonex, Betaseron or Rebif)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that corticotropin or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), administered as
      Acthar GelÂ® (MANUFACTURER NAME) is effective in the control of clinical disease activity as a
      pulse therapy for relapsing-remitting MS when added to standard treatment with
      beta-interferon.

      We wish to determine whether ACTH, when administered as clustered monthly intramuscular
      injections (monthly pulse therapy) as add-on to beta-interferons, may be a safe and effective
      alternative to monthly pulse therapy with MP. In addition, we hypothesize that pulse therapy
      with ACTH alters immune function to favor a regulatory, rather than a pro-inflammatory T cell
      environment.
