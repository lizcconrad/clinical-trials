      Hypothesis

      There is no difference in the incidence of pin tract infection and pin loosening in case of
      lower extremity external fixators when self-drilling schanz pins are used with or without
      pre-drilling.

      Primary Objective

      The primary objective is to determine whether pre-drilling holes for external fixation pin
      insertion is superior to not pre-drilling holes for external fixation pin insertion in
      regards to the incidence of pin tract infection and pin loosening.

      Secondary Objective

      If any difference is found between the two techniques then, we will quantify and qualify
      those differences. The incidence of pin site infection and pin loosening in general will be
      determined and will also be stratified for site and size of pin. An attempt to identify risk
      factors for pin site infection will be made by observing the effect of secondary prognostic
      factors like mode of injury, diabetes, smoking, compartment syndrome, peripheral vascular
      disease, neurovascular injury. Interobserver reliability of the grading system for pin
      infection will also be determined.

      Background

      The application of external fixation is a commonly performed emergency procedure in
      orthopaedics for temporary stabilization as well as definitive treatment of fractures.
      External fixation requires that metal pins be placed into the bone on either side of the
      fracture. The pins are then connected to an external frame, thus stabilizing the fracture.
      There is debate over the optimal technique for the insertion of these pins in regards to the
      need to pre-drill a pilot hole prior to pin insertion.

      The technology behind external fixation has evolved greatly over the past thirty years. The
      original external fixation pins, &quot;Shanz pins,&quot; were essentially metal rods with threads and a
      trocar point. A pilot hole was needed because these pins did not have the capability to
      create their own hole or path in the bone. Recent advances have lead to the creation of
      self-drilling/self-tapping pins, which have decreased the number of steps necessary to place
      the pins and thereby decreased operative time. The external fixators are usually placed as a
      temporary measure to allow for improvement of soft tissue condition before definitive open
      reduction and internal fixation. Since many external fixation devices are placed in patients
      who are critically ill, decreasing operative time is very important.

      While saving operative time is essential it is also important that the device serves its
      purpose without leading to complications in the short term. The major complications related
      to external fixation are pin site infection and pin loosening. The literature is clear that
      high temperatures created during pin insertion leads to bone necrosis surrounding the pin,
      increased infection, and increased rates of loosening. It is unclear if the new generation
      self-drilling pins create the same amount of necrosis as the older generation of pins. Lab
      studies have shown increased temperatures with direct drilling with these pins as compared to
      pin insertion after drilling pilot holes with dedicated drill bits. It is unclear if this
      increased temperature results in increased rate of loosening or pin site infection in
      clinical practice.

      A thorough literature search has revealed no randomized controlled studies to support the use
      of these pins without drilling pilot holes before insertion. The current standard of care is
      undefined and left to surgeon preference. Our study aims to provide guidelines for schanz pin
      insertion for external fixator application, which may help to reduce the number of pin tract
      infections suffered by patients and improve outcomes.

      Study Design and Treatment Plan

      This will be a prospective, randomized, within-subject, single-blind trial to be conducted at
      Temple University Hospital. Patients who are determined to require an external fixation
      procedure of the lower extremities due to fracture or dislocation will be considered for
      enrollment according to the above inclusion criteria. Standard of care for treatment of their
      fractures will be provided. Once patients have provided informed consent for enrollment in
      the study, their pins will be randomized in a paired design according to a computer generated
      randomization schedule. There will be two types of pins, pre-drilled and non pre-drilled. A
      standard external fixation device requires two pins on each side of the fracture. Each pair
      of pins will have one each of pre-drilled and not pre-drilled pins, according to the
      randomization schedule. Therefore, each patient will have two pre-drilled pins and two pins
      inserted without pre-drilling. Some surgeons may prefer three pins on each side of the
      fracture/dislocation that is to be immobilized. We will have a randomization protocol for
      these situations as well.

      The computer generated randomization algorithm will be placed in a secure location in sealed
      opaque envelopes. The operating surgeon will open the envelope prior to pin insertion and
      follow the randomization schedule as prescribed in the envelope.

      A standard technique will be followed. IV antibiotics will be administered within 60 minutes
      of the starting skin incision. Pin insertion will be done by standard techniques. This
      involves a 1 cm incision, and blunt dissection. 4.0 mm (calcaneal or metatarsal), 5.0 mm
      (tibia) or 6.0 mm (femur) pins will be inserted by one of two techniques: (1) self drilling
      pins are inserted with a power drill directly into the bone; (2) a standard twist drill bit
      is utilized with a power drill to create a pilot hole, followed by insertion of the
      self-drilling pin by power drill.

      Soft tissue relaxation incisions are made according to standard technique after external
      fixation assembly, as needed. The pin care protocol will consist of daily pin site cleaning
      using dilute hydrogen peroxide and dry dressings. Patients with suspected pin site infection
      will be treated with Keflex 500mg po q 6hr. Patients with an allergy to Keflex will receive
      Clindamycin 300mg po q 6hr.

    <description>The fractures will be treated according to standard of care. If the external fixation is to be used as a staging procedure, then this will be removed and an internal fixation procedure will be performed. The pin sites will be checked daily according to standard of care. All individuals involved in the examination of the pin sites will receive a standardized training in the grading of pin tract infection and loosening. Each pin site will be graded individually by three persons to evaluate internal accuracy of our grading. Pin tract infections will be first graded as yes or no, and then graded according to the Modified Joglekar Classification (Grade 0-4, Grade 0: no erythema, no drainage; Grade 1: erythema, no drainage OR no erythema with serous drainage; Grade 2: erythema, serous drainage; Grade 3: erythema, purulent drainage; Grade 4: gross pin loosening). Pin loosening will be evaluated at the time of pin removal and graded as either yes or no.</description>
