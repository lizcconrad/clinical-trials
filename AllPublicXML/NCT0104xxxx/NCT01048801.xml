  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most malaria deaths occur within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, and in rural areas with poor
      access to health facilities, home management of malaria (HMM) can improve the timeliness of
      treatment and reduce malaria mortality by up to 50%. In order to maximize both coverage and
      impact, ACTs should be deployed in HMM programmes, as well as in formal health facilities. Up
      to 80% of malaria cases are treated outside the formal health sector and shops are frequently
      visited as the first (and in some cases only) source of treatment. Strategies to deploy ACTs
      in Africa thus also need to examine the role of shops in home management and to ensure that
      drugs sold are appropriate. The current practice of presumptive treatment of any febrile
      illness as malaria (both at health facilities and in the context of HMM) based solely on
      clinical symptoms without routine laboratory confirmation, results in significant over-use of
      antimalarial drugs. With ACT being a more costly regimen, it is important to be more
      restrictive in its administration and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide a simple means of
      confirming malaria diagnosis in remote locations lacking electricity and qualified health
      staff.

      This study therefore proposes to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
      cost-effectiveness of using RDTs to improve malaria diagnosis and treatment by
      community-based drug distributors.The accuracy of RDTs, and the acceptability of this
      approach, will be evaluated in both low and high transmission areas.
