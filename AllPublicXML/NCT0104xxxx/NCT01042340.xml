      Background and aims:

      Old patients seldom reach energy requirements. The effects of an oleic-acid rich formula on
      energy intake and appetite were studied.

      Methods: Recently admitted geriatric patients (n=71), likely to stay more than 1 week were
      randomised to receive a fat emulsion (Calogen, intervention group (IG)) or to standard care
      (control group (CG)). Thirty ml of the emulsion were given 3 times daily, i.e. 420 kcal, and
      was distributed at the regular medication rounds. Food intake and self-rated appetite were
      registered 2-3 days after admission and on day 8 or the day prior to discharge. Nutritional
      risk screening (NRS) 2002 and serum lipids and fatty acid profiles were analysed.
