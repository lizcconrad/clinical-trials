        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Locally invasive high-risk rectal adenocarcinoma as defined by the presence on MRI of
             at least one of the following: i) Tumours within 1mm of mesorectal fascia i.e.
             circumferential resection margin threatened or involved ii)T3 tumours at/below
             levators iii)Tumours extending â‰¥5mm into peri-rectal fat iv)T4 tumours (including the
             involvement of bladder or vagina if surgical resection is possible with clear margins)
             v)Presence of extra-mural venous invasion (primary tumour is therefore at least T3)
             vi)T2 N0/1/2 tumours requiring Abdomino-Perineal Excision, within 1mm of mesorectal
             fascia i.e. circumferential resection margin threatened or involved

          -  The absence of malignant pelvic side-wall disease, local recurrence (either after TME
             or wide local excision) or metastatic disease

          -  Completion of pre-operative long-course CRT

          -  No viable disease seen at MRI performed 4 weeks after long-course CRT, confirmed at 8
             week MRI

          -  Evidence of partial response of rectal tumour to pre-operative long-course CRT at 4
             week MRI which continues to show an incremental response at 8 week MRI.

          -  Histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of rectum.

          -  WHO performance status 0, 1 or 2.

          -  No evidence of metastatic disease as determined by CT scan of chest, abdomen, pelvis
             or other investigations such as PET scan or biopsy if required.

          -  Informed written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years.

          -  Absence of concomitant chemotherapy.

          -  RT dose below 50Gy.

          -  Stable disease at 4 week MRI.

          -  Disease that demonstrates a partial response at 4 week MRI but shows no evidence of an
             incremental response at 8 week MRI.

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Short course pre-operative radiotherapy

          -  Previous pelvic radiotherapy

          -  Medical or psychiatric conditions that compromise the patient's ability to give
             informed consent

          -  Any contra-indication to MRI scanning, eg Cardiac Pacemaker or Hip prosthesis.

          -  Any patients within the EXPERT-C trial.

          -  Tumours which are mucinous (&gt;50% mucin seen on MRI), as these are more likely to be
             PET negative
