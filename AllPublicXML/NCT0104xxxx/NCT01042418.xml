      Food structure influence metabolic response including appetite. Whole grain foods include a
      wide range of products; cracked or cut kernels, rolled flakes or milled to flour and used in
      foods such as breads, breakfast cereals and pasta.

      The aim of the present study was to investigate if rye grain structure influence perceived
      appetite. A comparison of whole rye kernels and milled rye kernels were done in two study
      parts. In the first part the rye was served as porridge breakfasts and in the second one
      milled and whole kernels were included into bread breakfasts. In order to observe potential
      effects that would arise when the remains of the meal reaches the colon, the period of
      measurement was set to 8 h after intake of iso-caloric rye bread and rye porridge breakfasts.

      A randomized, crossover design was used to compare the effects of iso-caloric breakfast meals
      on subjective appetite during 8 h after consumption.
