      The PILI 'Ohana CBPR partnership implemented a pilot study to determine whether a Family plus
      Community focused intervention will improve weight loss maintenance compared to Standard
      follow-up in overweight/obese Native Hawaiian (NH) and other Pacific People (PP) adults (&gt; 18
      yr. old) after receiving a standard individual-focused behavioral intervention. The primary
      hypothesis was that overweight/obese NH and PP adults that undergo a combined family-focused
      plus community-focused intervention vs. a standard follow-up after receiving a standard
      individual-focused behavioral intervention will have significantly higher rates of weight
      loss maintenance.

      The long term mission of the PILI 'Ohana Program is to integrate community wisdom and
      expertise with scientific methods to conduct research on health disparities with a specific
      emphasis on obesity in NHs and PPs. Recognizing that recent advances in medicine such as the
      reduction of cardiovascular disease mortality and the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus,
      have not translated into benefits for all sectors of the U.S. population, especially ethnic
      and racial minority populations, the PILI 'Ohana Program aims to address this gap through
      community-academic partnerships focused on interventions to promote change in obesity-related
      disparities in NH and PP communities. One of the scientific goals of the PILI 'Ohana Program
      focused on designing and implementing research activities aimed at completing a pilot
      intervention study to provide the basis for a more definitive, hypothesis-driven 5-year
      research study in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Native Hawaiian, Filipino or other Pacific Islander ethnic background;

          -  Age 18 years or older;

          -  Overweight or Obese defined as BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2 (NH or Pacific Islanders) or &gt; 23 kg/m2
             (Filipino ethnic background);

          -  Willing and able to follow a behavioral weight loss intervention program that could
             potentially include 150 minutes of brisk walking per week (or equivalent) and a
             dietary regimen designed to induce weight loss of ~1-2 lbs per week;

          -  Able to identify at least 2-3 family, friends or co-workers that would be willing to
             support the participant during the course of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Survival less than 6 months;

          -  Planning to move out of the community during the intervention study period (16
             months);

          -  Pregnancy;

          -  Any dietary or exercise restrictions that would prevent an individual from fully
             participating in the intervention protocol (i.e. end stage renal disease on a renal
             diet, etc.);

          -  Any co-morbid condition (physical and mental disabilities) that would prevent the
             individual from participating in the intervention protocol (i.e. severe arthritis,
             hemi-paresis, major psychiatric illness, eating disorders, etc.).
