  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine wether the use of the Bispectral Index Monitor
      (BIS) as a method to guide anaesthesia for children in different groups of age, undergoing
      ear nose and throat surgery anaesthetized with an infusion of Propofol and Remifentanil with
      an high dose of Remifentanil (0,5-2 mcg/kg/min), can lead to a reduction in the time needed
      for extubation and in the amount of anesthetics used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants to the study are patients undergoing the following operations:
      Tonsillectomy, Adenoidectomy, Microlaryngoscopy, Bronchoscopy, Esophagoscopy, Myringoplasty,
      Myringotomy with positioning of a tube.

      All these procedures are performed with the patient receiving a general anesthesia with and
      infusion of Propofol and Remifentanil. Muscle relaxants and inhaled anesthetics are not used.

      The patients undergoing a Tonsillectomy will receive a supplementary opioid analgesic (Inj.
      Fentanyl iv, 3mcg/kg) at the end of the surgical procedure. Patients undergoing the other
      operations receive intraoperative Paracetamol and NSAID for postoperative pain treatment.

      Stratification by age (1-3y, 4-11y, 12-17y, 18-65y) will be performed to ensure balanced
      allocation of age groups and allow for identification of age and weight specific effects.
      Stratification by operation type will be performed to ensure the identification of the
      effects of the duration of anaesthesia and of the use of longer acting opioids (Fentanyl) on
      outcome parameters.

    <description>Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS monitor integrated in the IntelliVue Patient monitor MP70, Philips) is used to monitor the depth of anesthesia. The values this monitor reports are used as an aid in evaluating the response of the single patient to the administered anesthetics, and as a guide in adjusting the dosing of anesthetics. We follow the algorithm from: http://www.biseducation.com/assets.aspx?ac=1 (ASA Practice Advisory White Paper)</description>
