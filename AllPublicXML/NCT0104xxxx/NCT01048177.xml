      In order to investigate whether the pain in women with vulvodynia may represent bladder
      origin pain, we will be performing a diagnostic test for interstitial cystitis (IC) in women
      with generalized vulvodynia. Those women with a positive test for IC, we will be performing a
      series of bladder treatments (instillations) for IC and checking symptoms throughout the
      trial to see if significant relief of vulvar pain can be obtained through treatment for IC.

      A TRIAL OF INTRAVESICAL THERAPY FOR INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS IN PATIENTS WITH GENERALIZED
      VULVODYNIA

      BACKGROUND:

      Interstitial Cystitis (IC) is a urologic pain syndrome. The classic symptoms of IC are
      frequency, urgency and pain (dysuria) in the absence of an infection or other obvious source.
      IC has also been described as a visceral pain syndrome. In recent years, less common
      presentations of IC have been reported in women with primary symptoms of gynecologic pain
      such as endometriosis, dysparunia and vulvodynia1. This aim of this study is to further
      characterize the relationship between vulvodynia and IC and to see if a brief course of
      initial therapy for IC can relieve symptoms of generalized vulvodynia (GV)

      The diagnostic criteria for IC, agreed to in the mid 1980's at an NIDDK conference, was
      developed for research purposes. These criteria require cystoscopy with hydrodistention in
      the operating room under general anesthesia. There also are multiple exclusionary criteria
      for diagnosis which limit its utility. The end result is that up to 60% of cases of IC can be
      missed using NIDDK criteria for the diagnosis of IC2. Because of these limitations,
      cystoscopy is now used less often for diagnosis.

      In recent years, the potassium sensitivity test (PST) and the &quot;anesthetic challenge&quot; have
      been developed as alternative tests for the diagnosis of IC. These newer diagnostic
      techniques are less invasive and less painful than cystoscopy with hydrodistention, and are
      now fairly well accepted for diagnosis.

      My colleagues &amp; I first reported on a group of patients with vulvodynia who were noted to
      have IC as diagnosed by the PST1,3. This initial data collection was part of study of a
      larger group of patients with pelvic pain who were screened for urinary symptoms and tested
      for IC using the PST. Last month, we reported solely a series of patients presenting with GV
      who were tested for IC using the PST3. In this most recent report, 102 / 122 (84%) of
      patients with GV were found to have a positive PST. These data suggest that many patients
      with vulvodynia may have pain of bladder origin.

      In 2008, Welk and Teichman report on a group of patients with IC treated with an alkinalized
      heparin-lidocaine solution instilled into the bladder (intravesical treatment) for the
      treatment of dysparunia 4. They found that 15/23 (65%) patients reported improvements of
      greater than 50% on the Patient Objective Rating of Improvement of Symptom scale. This report
      demonstrates that a brief course of treatment for IC can result in significant symptom
      relief.

      Intravesical treatment of IC using a heparin-lidocaine-bicarbonate solution has become common
      first line treatment for many patients diagnosed with IC. Its use has been reported as part
      of an algorithm for the care of patients newly diagnosed with IC5. It is commonly used in
      conjunction with multi-modal treatment for IC, but as Welk &amp; Teichman's paper demonstrates,
      it can be used alone with impressive initial results.

      There are no reported head-to-head comparisons of different instillations therapies. Most
      instillation therapies contain heparin. Heparin is a constituent of the normal
      glycaso-aminoglycan (GAG) mucosal barrier in the bladder. In patients with IC, this mucosal
      barrier is thought to be defective, specifically with regard to the presence of heparin. The
      heparin is thought to &quot;rebuild&quot; the mucosal barrier in the bladder. Many bladder instillation
      therapies also contain an anesthetic such as lidocaine. The anesthetic is thought to directly
      treat nerves in and around the bladder through desensitization. Sodium bicarbonate acts to
      alkinalize the solution which has also been theorized to help with absorption or direct
      treatment. Lastly, we have found that some patients have had an initial burning sensation for
      several minutes with the concentrated three ingredient formula and that a small amount of
      sterile water helps to prevent this. Therefore we add the sterile water to all bladder
      instillations.

      We believe that, in many cases, patients with vulvodynia have pain that is referred from the
      bladder. The next logical step in defining the relationship between vulovodynia and IC is to
      offer a short course of intravesical treatment for IC to patients with GV after diagnosis and
      observe for symptom relief. We plan to perform a potassium sensitivity test for diagnosis as
      we believe there is not enough published data yet to support the use of the anesthetic
      challenge for study purposes. We also believe that the PST can help patients with vulvodynia
      understand better the connection between the bladder and the vulva. Further, we are confident
      that the PST does not cause much discomfort as has been described in some reports. We plan to
      proceed with this and report our findings as described in this application. If this pilot
      study demonstrates significant symptom relief in this population, a placebo-control
      randomized trial of treatment would then be indicated. Further, if our hypothesis holds true,
      several treatment modalities currently used for IC could be explored for use in patients with
      GV. We believe that this could literally open a new door to therapy for patients with GV.

      OBJECTIVE:

      We plan to report the incidence of IC in a pilot group of patients with GV as detected by the
      PST. We also plan to report the degree of symptom relief obtained in patients with a positive
      PST during and after a six week course of initial intravesical therapy for IC using several
      validated measurement tools.

      METHODS:

      Patients, Study sites and IRB We plan to enroll 30-60 patients into this study. We hope to
      complete this study as a multi-site study with patients enrolled at two institutions. We plan
      to obtain IRB approval at both institutions. The enrollment period will be approximately one
      year from January thru December 2010.

      Definition of Generalized Vulvodynia For the purposes of this report, we plan to use the
      definition of vulvodynia agreed upon at the 2003 meeting of the ISSVD: GV is a pain syndrome
      characterized by vulvar pain for at least 3-6 months duration with discomfort occurring in
      the absence of relevant infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic findings and in the absence
      of specific clinically identifiable disorder of any kind (i.e., idiopathic). Patients with
      pain generally characterized as burning pain which is unprovoked, provoked or both and
      involving most of the vulva (not localized) will be offered enrollment. The pain can be
      constant or intermittent. Though intermittent symptoms are not part of the 2003 ISSVD
      criteria, we do plan to enroll patients with intermittent symptoms as we believe that
      intermittent symptoms may represent &quot;flares&quot; of IC. Further, patients with intermittent
      symptoms may have vulvodynia that had previously gone unrecognized.

      Inclusion criteria We plan to enroll women 18 years or older with GV and negative tests for
      urine infection, negative cultures for Chlamydia and gonorrhea when indicated, and negative
      screens or cultures for yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis when indicated. Patient
      symptoms will need to include no or minimal vaginal discharge and patients will have a
      minimum Visual Analog Score for vulvar pain of at least 3/10.

      Exclusion criteria We will exclude patients from enrollment if they use chronic narcotic pain
      medication or have localized vulvodynia. (We believe that localize vulvodynia is less likely
      of bladder origin.)

      Symptom Evaluation Patients' surgical and medical histories will be reviewed and documented.
      A questionnaire specifically regarding symptoms or diagnoses of other pain syndromes
      including irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, endometriosis, chronic headaches,
      migraines, hyper-allergic or autoimmune disorders will be completed. Several other
      standardized questionnaires will also administered including: 1) Pain-Urgency-Frequency or
      &quot;PUF&quot; questionnaire, 2) O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index, 3) Short - Urinary Quality of life
      survey, 4) Visual analog pain scale and, 5) two days of bladder diary. A patient will be
      considered positive for urinary symptoms if she voids nine or more times in 24 hours or has
      either urgency or pain associated with the voiding process. Following the 3rd, 6th, 9th
      treatments, as well as 3-4 weeks following the last treatment, questionnaires will be
      re-administered. We plan to collect data points at multiple times during treatment as we
      believe that symptom relief may occur quickly. This will be useful to know in planning for
      subsequent studies.

      Potassium Testing The PST will be performed with the patient blinded to the identity of the
      two solutions as previously reported.10-12. All patients and controls will receive the same
      information in advance of the test procedure: that two separate, unidentified solutions will
      be instilled in the bladder and that they will be asked to grade their reactions. In brief,
      40 ml of water will be instilled into the patient's bladder for 5 minutes and any reactions
      of urgency or pain will be graded on a scale of 0-5 (Figure 1A). Then water will then be
      removed and 40 ml of a potassium solution (40 mEq KCl in 100 mL water) will be instilled and
      reactions similarly graded. After both solutions are instilled and removed, the patient will
      be asked whether one solution caused more urgency or more pain than the other. Any difference
      between solutions will then be graded as mild, moderate, or severe.

      We will consider a PST to be positive if both of the following criteria are met: the
      patient's urgency or pain grade for Solution 2 was at least two points above zero, and the
      patient identified Solution 2 as the solution causing more symptoms. We will report results
      in terms of the percentage of patients with positive tests.

      If neither solution is associated with any symptoms of urgency or pain, the PST will be
      considered negative.

      If the patient reports urgency or pain associated with both solutions, the test is
      potentially indeterminate. Many patients with IC are both volume sensitive and solute
      sensitive, and when they react to both solutions, this suggests pain of bladder origin. We
      will rate such results as indeterminate unless Solution 2 (potassium) was more provocative of
      symptoms; then we will rate the test positive. The number of patients with indeterminate
      tests will be reported.

      Bladder instillations:

      Patients with a positive PST will be eligible to continue in the treatment phase of the
      study.

      Nine bladder instillations will be performed over approximately six weeks for these patients.
      The solution used for bladder instillations will contain: heparin 40,000 units, lidocaine 4%
      - 5 ml (200 mg total dose), sodium bicarbonate 8.4 % - 3 ml and sterile water - 5 ml. This is
      our current standard bladder instillation therapy. For patients with a positive PST, the
      first bladder instillation will be performed immediately following the PST.

      Study costs:

      We have included the diagnosis and treatment of IC in patients with vulvodynia as a standard
      part of our care for patients for the past 5-7 years. Therefore, we plan to continue this as
      routine care and bill patients' insurance for evaluation and management services as well as
      bladder instillations and the PST. Our other potential study site(s) will proceed similarly.
      We seek the support of the National Vulvodynia Association for solely direct costs of
      research coordinator coverage and fellow stipend support for their work on this study. These
      direct costs are: Research Coordinator -10 hrs /week for 50 weeks @ 37.60 per hour including
      benefits = $18,800.00 plus fellow stipend support - 5 hours / week for 50 weeks @ 32.45 per
      hour including benefits = $8,112.50. Our total request for funding is $26,912.50.

      Normally, all funds acquired for research purposes at our institution are subject to an
      overhead &quot;tax&quot; of 25-30%. Our Director of Clinical Research Development has confirmed that
      any NVA funds received will be applied to direct research costs and not institutional costs.
      Confirmation of this is available in writing under separate cover.

      Future applications:

      If this pilot study demonstrates significant symptom relief in patients with GV, a
      placebo-control randomized trial of treatment would then be indicated. Hopefully this project
      will lay the foundation for an application for a research grant from an institution such as
      the NIDDK to explore this topic further.
