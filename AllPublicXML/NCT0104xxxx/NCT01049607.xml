  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is clinical uncertainty and ongoing discussion among liver surgeons regarding the
      optimal method of parenchymal transection in patients undergoing elective hepatic resection.
      While the clamp-crushing technique still represents the reference technique for routine liver
      resections, transection of liver parenchyma using vascular staplers may offer a new and safe
      technique potentially reducing intraoperative blood loss, operation time as well as
      peri-operative morbidity. As morbidity of patients undergoing hepatic resection remains high,
      approaches to lower peri-operative complications are urgently required. Due to the lack of
      evidence it has to be evaluated, if the technique of stapler hepatectomy decreases
      intraoperative blood loss as a highly relevant predictor of peri-operative complications,
      patients' hospital stay and finally health care expenditures. These advantages would favor
      stapler hepatectomy to be applied in routine liver resections. As RCTs are generally
      considered to generate the most valid scientific evidence on a treatment's effects, the
      present trial evaluates potential benefits of stapler hepatectomy in a randomized fashion.
