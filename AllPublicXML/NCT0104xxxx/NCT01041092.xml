      Primary objective: To assess the efficacy of adding raloxifene as an adjunct to antipsychotic
      treatment to improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia in postmenopausal women.

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of raloxifene as adjuvant
      treatment to antipsychotic treatment. Treatment period of 12 weeks.

      The primary result obtained is that women treated with 60 mg of raloxifene compared to those
      treated with a placebo show greater improvement in psychotic symptoms. The investigators also
      found improved response in some aspects of social functioning and neuropsychological
      functioning.
