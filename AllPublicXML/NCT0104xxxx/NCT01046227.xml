    <textblock>
      The patients of pediatric haemato-oncology have a higher risk for novel H1N1 influenza
      infection than general population, and they are strongly recommended to receive novel H1N1
      vaccination. However, there is no previous data to answer how the efficacy and effectiveness
      of novel H1N1 vaccination is in patients of pediatric haemato-oncology. This study is
      designed to investigate the antibodies titers before and after the novel H1N1 influenza
      vaccination in these patients. Titer of H1N1 influenza virus antibodies will be determined by
      hemagglutinin inhibition assay (HAI). A HAI titer with a 4-fold rise or greater is defined as
      seroconversion. Study subjects with seroconversion are regarded as responsiveness to the
      vaccination. Meanwhile, if the patient presents influenza-like symptoms, we will perform
      throat swab or nasal swab for influenza rapid test, viral isolation, and novel H1N1 influenza
      PCR to confirm the diagnosis. After the study, we will be able to know whether or not current
      novel H1N1 influenza vaccination schedule is adequate and efficient for pediatric
      haemato-oncology patients.

      The emergence of novel H1N1 influenza in 2009 has a great impact to the societies in Taiwan
      and worldwide. The patients of pediatric haemato-oncology have a higher risk for novel H1N1
      influenza infection than general population, and they are strongly recommended to receive
      novel H1N1 vaccination. However, there is no previous data to answer how the efficacy and
      effectiveness of novel H1N1 vaccination is in patients of pediatric haemato-oncology. This
      study is designed to investigate the antibodies titers before and after the novel H1N1
      influenza vaccination in these patients. Thus two blood samples will be drawn. The first
      sample will be collected before the vaccination and the second one will be collected three
      weeks after the vaccination (If the patient is younger than 9 years old, the third sample
      will be collected three weeks after the booster vaccination). Titer of H1N1 influenza virus
      antibodies will be determined by hemagglutinin inhibition assay (HAI). A HAI titer with a
      4-fold rise or greater is defined as seroconversion. Study subjects with seroconversion are
      regarded as responsiveness to the vaccination. We will analyze seroconversion rate as well.
      Meanwhile, if the patient presents influenza-like symptoms, we will perform throat swab or
      nasal swab for influenza rapid test, viral isolation, and novel H1N1 influenza PCR to confirm
      the diagnosis. After the study, we will be able to know whether or not current novel H1N1
      influenza vaccination schedule is adequate and efficient for pediatric haemato-oncology
      patients.
