  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a national multicenter prospective observational study, including 200 patients.
      The main purpose of this study is to explore in more detail the influence of genetic
      variability (CYP enzymes and vitamin K dependent proteins) and dietary vitamin K status on
      warfarin dosing, clinical effect and adverse events with emphasis on the initial phase of
      treatment. The hypothesis is that genetic variability concerning CYP enzymes and vitamin K
      dependent proteins predict dosing and adverse events during warfarin treatment. The main aim
      is to individualize warfarin therapy and establish a treatment algorithm based on genotype
      and dietary vitamin K status to make the anticoagulation therapy with warfarin more secure.
