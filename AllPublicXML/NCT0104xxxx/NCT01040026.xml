  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-dose chemotherapy with melphalan and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) is considered standard treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. While autologous
      HSCT may induce remission in patients resistant to standard chemotherapy, and has been shown
      to lead to long-lasting disease control in a subgroup of patients, the procedure is not
      curative. Given enough time and in the absence of a competing cause of death, all patients
      eventually relapse after auto-HSCT.

      The only potentially curative approach currently available in the treatment of multiple
      myeloma (MM) is stem cell trans-plantation from an allogeneic donor. Allogeneic HSCT
      eradicates residual myeloma cells through T-cell mediated graft-versus-tumor effects.
      Allogeneic HSCT is, however, associated with significant risk of graft-versus-host disease
      and its use is therefore limited to younger patients with high risk dis-ease. Malignant
      plasma cells in multiple myeloma are also sensitive to natural killer cell lysis. Natural
      killer cells do not cause graft-versus-host disease, which has led to interest in their
      therapeutic use in patients with multiple myeloma.

      We have previously shown that immunomagnetic separation of a highly pure NK cell product from
      a leukapheresis is possible and that these cells can be expanded up to 100-fold in a
      GMP-compatible setting. The current study aims to test the tolerability and feasibility of
      infusions of in vitro expanded haploidentical NK cells for patients after melphalan 200mg/m2
      high dose chemotherapy and autologous HSCT in 10 patients. If feasible, the data will provide
      a basis for further prospective studies.

    <description>10 expanded NK-DLI will be applied at fixed intervals and to each patient within 30 days (3 applications per week, Mo/We/Fr) starting with increasing CD56+CD3- NK cell doses at 3 dose levels (1.5x10e6/kg, 1.5x10e7/kg and 1x10e8/kg) and, if safe, continuing with maximally 7 doses of 1x10e8/kg. Maximal cumulative T-cell dose is fixed at &lt;1x10e5/kg</description>
