  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies suggest that the use of in-person, professionally trained medical
      interpreters can reduce health care costs associated with diagnosing and treating patients
      with limited English proficiency. However, few studies have specifically addressed the
      question of the cost-effectiveness of language services in health care settings. This study
      used a randomized controlled study design to compare the cost-effectiveness of using
      professional interpreters with Spanish-speaking patients seen in hospital emergency
      departments (EDs) versus using the usual language services available to these patients. The
      main goal of the study was to estimate the effect that professional interpreters have on
      resource utilization and patient/provider satisfaction in the ED compared to the language
      services usually offered in these settings. Our hypothesis was that use of trained
      interpreters would lead to more cost-effective provision of ED services.
