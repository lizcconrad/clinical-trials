  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators prospectively evaluated 89 consecutive outpatients (29 female) with stable
      congestive heart failure. The presence of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and Cheyne-Stokes
      respiration (CSR) while awake were investigated by overnight polysomnography. Males and
      females were similar in age, body mass index, and LVEF. Prevalence of SDB was higher in males
      than females. During follow up of 25±10 months, 27% of the population died. Nonsurvivors had
      lower LVEF (p=0.01), worse NYHA class (p=0.03) a higher proportion of CSR-awake (p&lt;0.001)
      than survivors.

      Bakground: There is little information in sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in women with
      congestive heart failure (CHF). We studied consecutive CHF patients in order to compare SDB
      characteristics according to gender, and to determine overall mortality impact of SDB and
      Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) while awake.

      Methods: Eighty nine consecutive outpatients (29 female) with stable CHF (LVEF&lt;45%) were
      prospectively evaluated. The presence of SDB, as characterized by obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) and CSR during sleep, as well as CSR while awake before sleep onset, were investigated
      by overnight polysomnography.
