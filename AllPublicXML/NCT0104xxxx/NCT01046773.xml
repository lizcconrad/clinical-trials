  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBD is caused by an abnormal immune response to the gut bacteria in people who are
      genetically predisposed. There has been a huge increase in the number of people diagnosed
      with IBD since World War II, likely due to changes in our environment. It is possible that
      the abundance of vitamin D in the body may be one of those environmental factors that the
      investigators can control to make patients with IBD better.

      Vitamin D acts on cells of the immune system and causes many effects, including the
      production of a &quot;natural antibiotic&quot; called cathelicidin. The investigators know that when
      people are supplemented with vitamin D, levels of cathelicidin produced by these immune cells
      increase. By supplementing children with Crohn's disease with vitamin D, the investigators
      may be able to alter their immune system &quot;naturally,&quot; making their disease better. A
      consensus of vitamin D experts believes that vitamin D levels need to reach a level of 40-70
      ng/mL in the blood in order to have effects on the immune system. Raising vitamin D levels to
      this range is one of the goals in the current study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is an important nutrient controlling the health and development of our bones. Many
      patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are deficient in levels of vitamin D in their
      bodies. This is probably because vitamin D is lost from inflamed intestinal tissue into the
      stools. But while much attention has been given to studying the impact of vitamin D
      deficiency on the bone status of patients with IBD, our understanding of how vitamin D
      deficiency might affect the immune system in these patients is relatively poor.

      The investigators intend to study vitamin D supplementation in children with Crohn's disease,
      ages 8 to 18 years. At the time of enrollment, the investigators will gather data on disease
      activity using both a simple history and physical exam, as well as blood and stool tests. In
      addition, the investigators will measure the levels of cathelicidin produced by the immune
      cells in their blood. The investigators will then supplement 20 children with vitamin D for a
      total of 6 months. During the study, patients will be seen every two months, where the
      investigators will monitor their vitamin D levels as well as perform rigorous safety
      monitoring for toxicity using blood and urine tests.

      And at study conclusion, the investigators will again judge their disease severity and check
      their vitamin D levels in addition to tests of cathelicidin levels. The investigators believe
      that at study conclusion, the investigators will have achieved several important objectives.
      First, as a public health benefit, the investigators will show that large doses of
      supplemental vitamin D are safe in children and provide more benefit with less risk. Our
      patients will achieve those levels of vitamin D agreed by expert opinion that are required to
      cause effects on the immune system, and the investigators will see an increase in the amount
      of cathelicidin produced by their immune cells. As an added piece of information, the
      investigators would like to determine if there are any improvements in disease activity in
      patients supplemented with vitamin D.
