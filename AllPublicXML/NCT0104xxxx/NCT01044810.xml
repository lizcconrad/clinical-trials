    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of EFV-based regimens in
      HIV-1-infected patients who; (1) were previously allergic to NVP and stopped all ARV
      simultaneously; (2) were previously allergic to NVP and continued the other NRTIs for a
      period of time, i.e. &quot;staggered interruption&quot;; and (3) started EFV-based regimens as an
      initial regimen (as controlled group).
