    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and feasibility
      of the Amygdala Retraining Program (ARP), a mind-body practice versus a control (C) on
      fatigue, quality of life and sleep in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Chronic
      Fatigue (CF) and Fibromyalgia (FM).

      CFS, CF and FM are incapacitating disorders characterized by profound fatigue, muscle pain,
      impaired memory, insomnia, and post-exertional malaise (Fukuda 1994). Current literature
      points to a centrally sensitized state in CFS, CF and FM (Meeus 2007). The ARP attempts to
      retrain this neuronal network through mind-body practices such as cognitive restructuring via
      neurolinguistic programming, yoga based breathing and simple mindfulness based meditation. A
      case series of 33 patients with CFS and ARP reported improvement in 92% of patients with
      two-thirds of patients reaching 80-100% of pre-illness levels of health (Gupta 2009). However
      ARP has never been formally studied in CFS.

      We propose to gather preliminary data on the efficacy and feasibility of ARP versus C on
      fatigue, quality of life and sleep in 30 patients with CFS, CF and FM. All participants will
      undergo standard clinical treatment which consist of a 2 day self-management program in the
      Chronic Fatigue Clinic. Following this, participants will be randomized into the ARP or C
      group. The ARP group will receive an additional 2.5 hour training surrounding core concepts
      of the ARP program. They will then be given the ARP DVD program and booklet, to reinforce and
      continue the practice. They will then receive scheduled bi-monthly phone calls for 3 months
      from a study investigator for support. The C group will receive only standard care. However
      they will receive a complementary copy of the ARP program at the end of the study (6 month
      time point) as a gift for participation in the study.

      Preliminary data on efficacy will be assessed at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months using the
      following validated questionnaires: Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MDFI), Short form-36
      (SF36) Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Epworth Sleep Scale (ESS) and Measure Your
      Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP-2). Feasibility will be assessed by evaluation of a daily
      practice log where patients record the total time spent daily in the practice of ARP and any
      specific difficulties they encountered in the practice of the program.
