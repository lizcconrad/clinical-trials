      Advice to increase water consumption as part of a weight-reducing diet - typically to 8 cups
      (64 fl oz, ~2 L) per day (&quot;8x8&quot; water recommendation) - is almost ubiquitously recommended by
      healthcare professionals. Many believe that water promotes weight loss through numerous
      physiological mechanisms. However, only limited observational data and virtually no
      experimental data exist regarding the effects of water consumption on body weight. In this
      study, we propose a randomized controlled pilot study in which two groups of overweight
      adolescents will receive a standard weight loss regimen, either with (experimental
      intervention) or without (control intervention) additional advice and support to increase
      water consumption. We will utilize individual sessions, an innovative text messaging
      protocol, and motivational telephone calls to promote adherence to the interventions. The
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate feasibility and obtain preliminary efficacy data,
      to inform design of a future, definitive study.

      It is hypothesized that increasing water consumption will improve the efficacy of a standard
      weight-reducing diet and will lead to decreased consumption of energy-containing beverages,
      decreased total energy intake, improved diet quality, improved immune status, and improved
      cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors. This simple behavioral intervention will be
      feasible and will significantly increase water consumption among participants in the
      experimental vs. control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month randomized controlled trial. After the initial baseline screening and
      assessments, 60 overweight adolescents will be randomly assigned (30 subjects per group) to a
      standard weight-reducing diet with the advice to consume 8 cups of water per day
      (experimental group) or the same standard weight-reducing diet without additional advice
      (control group). The interventions will consist of nutrition education and behavioral
      counseling by a registered dietitian, during individual sessions and telephone calls. Mobile
      text messaging will be used to reinforce information presented at the individual sessions and
      thereby foster adherence to dietary advice. Diet prescriptions will differ only in regard to
      the specificity of recommendations regarding water consumption and physical activity
      recommendations will not differ between groups. The frequency and content of text messages
      will be consistent between the experimental and control groups, with the exception that the
      experimental group will receive an additional phrase with each message to encourage the &quot;8
      x8&quot; water recommendation.

      A registered dietitian will communicate with each participant one time per month, either
      during an individual session or by telephone. Individual sessions will include nutrition
      classes, taste testing, hands-on activities, and opportunities for questions and answers.
      Text messages will be sent on a daily basis.

      Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at regular intervals throughout the 6 months
      of the study.

      ANALYSIS PLAN:

      The blinding of the randomization will be broken on or after July 28, 2014 and the data will
      be analyzed according to the following plan. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat
      principle, attributing each subject to his or her assigned diet regardless of compliance.
      Baseline characteristics will be compared between the diet groups using the Fisher exact test
      for categorical variables and t-test for continuous variables. The 6-month change from
      baseline in the primary and secondary outcomes will be compared between groups using a
      general linear model, adjusting for baseline covariates that are potentially correlated with
      the outcome. These include demographics, socioeconomic status, anthropometrics, physical
      activity, and beverage consumption. We will further test covariates for potential
      interaction, i.e., differential effect on outcome in the two trial arms. The null hypothesis
      is that the 6-month change from baseline will not differ between diet groups.

    <description>Participants will be counseled to follow a standard weight-reducing diet including consumption of 1) ample vegetables, fruits, and legumes; 2) whole rather than refined grains; and 3) high-quality proteins at most meals and snacks. Moreover, we will recommend limiting intake of added fats and sugars and avoiding juices and sugar-sweetened beverages (per standard practice). Participants will also be counseled to increase their water intake to 8 cups per day, consistent with the popular &quot;8 × 8&quot; recommendation (eight 8-oz glasses of water).</description>

    <description>Participants will be counseled on the same standard weight-reducing diet, as described above, with no specific advice regarding water consumption. Furthermore, no specific dietary recommendations will be provided on altering fluid/beverage intake, other than to decrease calorie-containing beverages as noted above. When participants ask for a recommendation regarding water intake, they will be advised that drinking plain water is the best way to satisfy thirst and instructed to drink when thirsty.</description>
