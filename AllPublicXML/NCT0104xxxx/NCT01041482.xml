      A one-arm,open,multi-center study, to evaluate sorafenib (400mg twice daily ) as a adjuvant
      to prevent recurrence of RCC(renal cell carcinoma) patients after radical nephrectomy with a
      high-risk of recurring. To observe disease-free survival and the survival rate in 3 years,5
      years.

      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To study the efficacy of Sorafenib as an adjuvant therapy for reducing recurrence rate
           in locally advanced renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) after radical nephrectomy.

        -  To observe the incidence of hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) after the Urea (10% or 5%)
           based cream intervention treatment.

      The primary end point is the disease-free survival(DFS).The secondary end point is overall
      survival(OS),the drug safety and tolerance, the occurrence of hand foot skin reaction(HFSR)
      at the week of 3,6,12,the skin toxicity(not include HFSR) higher than CTCAE(Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Grade 2 at the 12th week, the incidence of HFSR
      after the Urea (10% or 5%) based cream intervention treatment.

      A one-arm, open, multi-center study, to evaluate sorafenib (400mg twice daily) as a adjuvant
      to prevent recurrence of RCC(renal cell carcinoma) patients after radical nephrectomy with a
      high-risk of recurring. To observe disease-free survival and the survival rate in 3 years,
      and 5 years. To observe the incidence of hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) after the Urea (10%
      or 5%) based cream intervention treatment. 140 subjects are prospected to enter the trial.

      The sorafenib adjuvant therapy is unremitting with a time of 12 months. For a convenient
      record, every 6 weeks is regarded as a single observational cycle. The end-point are
      recurrence, not being tolerant to the toxicity, need to stop the intervening study or
      withdrawing the informed consent. It is necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety every 6
      weeks. At the screening stage and every 12 weeks imaging review are performed such as
      abdominal and chest CT or MRI, the imaging methods of a single subject should be in
      uniformity during the trial.

      The post-treatment evaluation are performed 30 days after the last usage of the adjuvant in
      order to collect all the adverse events (AE) and the survival rates of all the subjects. The
      agent-relevant AE (known or unknown) should be reported to the drug safety institution, the
      patients should be visited until the events solved, except the events can not be solved for
      the subjects' underlying diseases.
