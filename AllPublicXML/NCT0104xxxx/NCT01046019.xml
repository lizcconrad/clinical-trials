  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research with DXA has shown the pattern of bone remodelling around an implant. The baseline
      and reference value for such calculations is the first measurement after the operation. The
      baseline measurement is performed at different time from study to study. If there is a rapid
      bone loss the first weeks after an operation, this will influence the reference value and
      then the results. To evaluate DXA as a method we decided to set up a study with 3 DXA
      measurements within the first 2 weeks. Our hypothesis is that there is a rapid bone loss the
      first 2 weeks after operation and that timing of the first post operative measurement will
      influence the later results.

      Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) has become the most used and proven to be a precise method to
      investigate changes in bone mass density (BMD). Research with DXA has shown the pattern of
      bone remodelling around an implant. Results from implant studies are often presented as
      changes in BMD as a function of time. The baseline and reference value for such calculations
      is the first measurement after the operation. The most pronounced bone loss after
      implantation of hip prosthesis usually comes within 3 months. The baseline measurement is
      performed at different time from study to study. If there is a rapid bone loss the first
      weeks after an operation, this will influence the reference value and then the results. To
      evaluate DXA as a method we decided to set up a study with 3 DXA measurements within the
      first 2 weeks.

      We included 23 patients operated with total hip prosthesis (THP). They were measured with DXA
      at 1, 5 and 14 days, 3 and 12 months after the operation. Results were given in percent
      (+/-SD) for each Gruen zone. There were no changes in bone density between the first 3
      measurements. In all zones, except zone 1, the lowest BMD was measured after 3 months. We
      concluded that DXA measurements done within 14 days after the operation can be used as
      reference measurements for later follow ups.
