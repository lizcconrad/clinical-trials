    <textblock>
      Statins are a class of drugs given to lower cholesterol. Although statins are considered to
      be generally safe, some studies show that about 10% of people on statins develop
      muscle-related symptoms, from fatigue (tiredness), weakness, cramping, pain and sometimes a
      lifethreatening muscle breakdown condition known as rhabdomyolysis. In some, these symptoms
      may greatly affect their daily activities. One consideration why symptoms develop in only
      some patients is that they may have an underlying problem in the way their muscles use fats
      to produce energy. In these patients, the muscles are not able to fully utilize fats and so
      they become tired more easily. Fat within the muscle can also affect how your body uses a
      hormone called insulin, which affects your blood sugar levels. The investigators are
      specifically interested in previous statin users and determine if the muscle symptoms are
      related to changes in energy and sugar use. We propose to enroll patients who have developed
      muscle side effects on previous statin treatment and have since discontinued statin
      treatment.

      Our aim is to compare the metabolic parameters in these patients to age and gender-matched
      normal individuals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        SAM Group

          1. Males and females 40-65 yrs old; females must be post-menopause (&gt;12 months since last
             menstrual period)

          2. Developed statin-associated myopathy, defined as:

               -  Documented elevated levels of CPK &gt; 3x upper limit of normal with muscle pain,
                  weakness, cramping during statin treatment, or

               -  Diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis, or

               -  Developed muscle pain, weakness, cramping during statin treatment that resulted
                  in statin discontinuation by the subject's MD

               -  Developed recurrence of muscle symptoms after resumption of statin treatment, or
                  A score of at least 5/17 on the INQoL on screening on any of the aspects of
                  muscle symptoms (weakness, pain, locking or tiredness) based on subject's recall
                  at the height of the muscle symptoms

          3. Able to ambulate independently (in order to perform exercise tests)

          4. Muscle symptoms started/ occurred within one year of starting statin treatment or
             within one year of changing statin brand or dose adjustment

          5. Discontinued statins at least 2 months from study inclusion date

          6. 20% probability of having a cardiovascular (CV) event in the next 10 years calculated
             using an online CV risk calculator AND with a low or a moderate American College of
             Sports Medicine (ACSM) risk stratification for a cardiovascular event during a
             treadmill test

        Normal Control Group

          1. Age and gender-matched individuals who are not on statins but would otherwise be

             severe muscle pain, weakness or cramping at rest or during exercise
