  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Although a small group, special attention has to be given to lower urinary tract
      (LUT) dysfunctions in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, as they also suffer under a loss of
      motor-sensory function and autonomic regulation next to the severe deficiencies in bladder
      and bowel control. Autonomic dysregulation linked with LUT dysfunction can cause autonomic
      dysreflexia with life threatening increases in blood pressure and there is still no concept
      for an early rehabilitation of bladder function after SCI.

      Hypothesis: We assume that inadequate reorganization of nerve fibres in SCI is a reason for
      spastic bladder dysfunction and vegetative dysregulation and that this can be positively
      influenced by early neuromodulation. We hypothesized that bladder dysfunction as well as
      autonomic dysreflexia will be positively affected.

      Specific aims: Evaluation, if external pudendal nerve stimulation (EPS) can positively
      influence LUT rehabilitation in SCI patients and if early initiation of stimulation is more
      effective compared to late initiation (after spinal shock).

      Experimental design: Prospective multicentre study in 36 SCI patients (24 treatment subjects,
      12 control subjects). EPS will be started either within 10 days after SCI (early stim group)
      or after cessation of spinal shock (late stim group). Effects on spastic bladder function and
      autonomic disinhibition will be assessed by urodynamics, vegetative tests, and by
      electrophysiological techniques.

      Expected value: If early EPS is effective and complete SCI patients benefit from this
      intervention; and if early onset of EPS has better and longer lasting effects than late onset
      stimulation, the findings will be of utmost relevance not only for bladder function but also
      to alleviate adverse phenomena such as autonomic dysreflexia. Neurostimulation may bear the
      opportunity to early reshape maladaptive neuroplasticity. This would be proof of an effective
      modulation and promotion of neuroplasticity, thus opening up new treatment options in the
      field of paraplegiology.
