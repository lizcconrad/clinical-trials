    <textblock>
      Follow-up programmes consume a large amount of resources with less time for the surgeon to
      take on new patients. The aim of this randomised study was to compare patient satisfaction,
      resource utilisation, and medical safety in patients curatively operated for rectal cancer
      that were followed-up by a surgeon or a nurse.
