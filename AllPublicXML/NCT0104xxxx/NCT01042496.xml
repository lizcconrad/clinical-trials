      This study compared glutamate and other neurometabolites measured by proton magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in bipolar I and II patients currently depressed with
      age-matched healthy controls. The study will also compare 1H-MRS of bipolar I and II patients
      before and after taking a 12-week course of lamotrigine.

      The goal of this study was to better understand the neurobiology of bipolar depression and
      how lamotrigine may therapeutically impact brain function and mood response.

      The hypothesis was that in comparison to non-remission participants, bipolar participants who
      achieve remission (defined as a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score &lt;12
      at week 12) associated with lamotrigine monotherapy will exhibit a greater decrease in
      glutamate (Glu) and an increase in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), reported as a cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF)-corrected absolute concentration percent change from baseline to endpoint in
      anterior cingulate (AC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is the predominant prevailing mood state in bipolar disorder and bipolar
      depression is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. However, in comparison to
      acute mania, bipolar depression is understudied both from the standpoint of its
      pathophysiology as well as clinical trials which include FDA-approved treatments. Given this
      lack of evidence to base guidelines, clinicians and patients are limited as to how best to
      treat the depressive phase of the illness.

      Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a valuable, non-invasive method to study
      in-vivo brain biochemistry. Of the novel imaging paradigms, MRS is uniquely positioned to
      investigate biochemical mechanism of drug action that is objectively measurable and
      clinically relevant. As there is increasing interest in glutamatergic dysregulation in mood
      disorders, this project will utilize 1H-MRS to study glutamate and glutamine levels in brain
      regions implicated in bipolar disorder (anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex).

      This was a 5-year single-site study of bipolar depression utilizing 1H-MR spectroscopy before
      and after treatment with lamotrigine. At baseline bipolar depressed subjects and age-matched
      controls underwent a 1H-MRS at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. The bipolar depressed
      subjects were then be placed on 12-week, open evaluation of lamotrigine monotherapy. After 12
      weeks, the bipolar subjects underwent a second 1H-MRS scan.

      Two different MRS sequences were used to measure the brain chemicals in a single 2 x 2 x 2 cm
      cube located in the center of anterior cingulate cortex: an intermediate echo-time PRESS
      sequence and a 2D J-resolved averaged PRESS sequence. Spectroscopic data were inspected for
      quality; subjects whose data were contaminated by artifact were excluded from the study.
      Spectra were then processed using LCModel to quantify brain chemical levels. Regular brain
      MRI images were segmented, yielding a map of the amount of CSF in the head. The MRS cube was
      overlaid onto the CSF map and the fraction of CSF within the cube measured. This measurement
      was used to &quot;remove&quot; the CSF from the MRS cube giving brain chemical concentrations. The
      concentrations were then used for statistical analysis.

      Note: All of the spectroscopy data are expressed in Institutional Units (IU).

        <title>Glutamate+Glutamine (GLX) Measured in Mid Anterior Cingulate Cortex (MACC) &amp; Left Dorsal Lateral Prefrontal Cortex (LDLPC) Using Long TE PRESS MRS Technique at Baseline for Both Groups; After 12 Weeks of Lamotrigine Monotherapy for the Bipolar Group</title>
        <description>Two different MRS sequences were used to measure the brain chemicals in in anterior cingulate and left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex : an intermediate echo-time PRESS sequence and a 2D J-resolved averaged PRESS sequence. (Note: The intermediate echo-time PRESS sequence was used for this outcome measure.) Spectroscopic data were inspected for quality; subjects whose data were contaminated by artifact were excluded from the study. Spectra were then processed using LCModel to quantify brain chemical levels. Regular brain MRI images were segmented, yielding a map of the amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); the MRS voxel was overlaid onto the CSF map and the fraction of CSF was measured. This CSF corrected measurement was used for statistical analysis.</description>

        <population>Sample sizes varied due to imaging results/scan viability. Excessive noise resulted in poor metabolite readings which in-turn were not used in the final analysis.

        <title>Mean Glutamate (GLU) Measured in the MACC and LDLPC Using the ProFit MRS Technique at Baseline for Both Groups, After 12 Weeks of Lamotrigine Monotherapy for the Bipolar Group</title>
        <description>Two different MRS sequences were used to measure the brain chemicals in a single 2 x 2 x 2 cm cube located in the center of anterior cingulate cortex: an intermediate echo-time PRESS sequence and a 2D J-resolved averaged PRESS sequence. (Note: The 2D J-resolved averaged PRESS sequence was used for this outcome measure.) Spectroscopic data were inspected for quality; subjects whose data were contaminated by artifact were excluded from the study. Spectra were then processed using LCModel to quantify brain chemical levels. Regular brain MRI images were segmented, yielding a map of the amount of CSF in the head. The MRS voxel was overlaid onto the CSF map and the fraction of CSF within the voxel measured. This CSF-corrected measurement was then used for statistical analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Sample sizes varied due to imaging results/scan viability. Excessive noise resulted in poor metabolite readings which in-turn were not used in the final analysis. Baseline: control group MACC n=8, LDLPC n=8, Bipolar group MACC n=13, LDLPC n=13. Bipolar group 12 weeks MACC n=8, LDLPC n=17. The control group did not do the procedure at 12 weeks.</population>
