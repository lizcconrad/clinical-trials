      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and efficacy of repeat doses of
      compound 1278863A in subjects with anemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is
      being developed for the treatment of anemia. This study, PHI112844, will be the first
      administration of compound 1278863A to investigate the pharmacodynamics/efficacy, safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of repeat oral doses in anemic pre-dialysis patients with
      moderate or severe renal impairment and in hemodialysis-dependent patients.

             informed consent.

          2. A male or female is eligible to enroll and participate in this study if he/she:

               1. (Part 1) has Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment (equivalent to NKF KDOQI Stage 3
                  or 4, not receiving dialysis) as determined by estimated Glomerular Filtration

               2. (Part 2) has Severe Renal Impairment and has been on stable hemodialysis
                  treatment for 1 month prior to Screening (subjects with planned transition to
                  hemodialysis) or 3 months prior to Screening (subjects emergently placed on
                  hemodialysis). These subjects are equivalent to NKF KDOQI Stage 5.

               3. otherwise healthy or considered clinically stable with respect to underlying
                  renal impairment and with respect to underlying/chronic disease as determined by
                  a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation including
                  medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.

               4. has clinical laboratory test results that are considered clinically stable in the
                  opinion of the principal investigator, especially if the clinical abnormality or
                  laboratory parameter is deemed associated with the patient's underlying renal
                  impairment.

          3. Meets the following erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) criteria:

               1. The patient is ESA naïve OR

               2. If the patient has a scheduled ESA interval which is ≤ 7 days, ESA treatment must
                  be discontinued for at least 7 days OR

               3. If the patient has a scheduled ESA interval which is &gt; 7 days, ESA treatment must
                  be discontinued for at least that scheduled interval length (eg discontinued ≥ 14
                  days for a scheduled 14 day ESA interval) AND The patient will not resume ESA
                  treatment until completion of the Follow-up Visit (Day 57).

          4. Has a hemoglobin value:

               1. For ESA naïve patients: ≤11.0 g/dL

               2. For patients receiving ongoing ESA treatment: ≤11.5 g/dL at Screening with a re
                  check value of ≤11.0 g/dL after appropriate ESA discontinuation according to
                  Inclusion 3 and prior to commencing study drug dosing.

          5. 5. Has serum ferritin at Screening:

               1. ≥40 μg/L with the absence of microcytic or hypochromic RBCs (regardless of
                  transferrin saturation %) OR

               2. 25-39 μg/L with transferrin saturation % ≥20% (fraction saturation ≥0.20) and the
                  absence of microcytic or hypochromic RBCs

          6. Has Vitamin B12 and folate above the lower limit of normal at Screening

          7. A female patient is eligible to participate if she is:

               1. of childbearing potential, and must agree to use one of the contraception methods
                  in Section 8.1.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of Screening
                  until completion of the Follow-up Visit (Day 57) OR

               2. of non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
                  contraceptive method.

          8. Male patients must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1.2. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study drug
             until completion of the Follow-up Visit (Day 57).
