      The investigators hypothesize that significant exposure to artificial morning bright light
      (approximately 200 lux of primarily blue light at eye level for thirty minutes daily) as
      compared to sham bright red light (placebo) will:

        1. improve sleep quality

        2. improve cognitive scores

        3. improve depression scores

        4. improve quality of life scores.

    <textblock>
      Bright light therapy has been shown to improve depression and insomnia in multiple studies.
      These are common conditions among elders, particularly those residing in long term care
      environments. Bright light therapy has been inadequately studied in the geriatric population.
      We will show that a groups of twenty elders can simultaneous be exposed to bright light and
      that it will result in improvements in multiple realms of behavior and quality of life.
      Elders will be tested with a number of neuropsychological test batteries prior to exposure to
      bright light and again at the end of a four week exposure. Some subjects will have daytime
      and night time activity levels monitored with actigraphy. Cortisol and melatonin levels will
      be obtained prior to and at the end of the exposure period.
