  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulse pressure variation (PPV) known as a dynamic preload index is increasingly being used
      for guide of fluid management under various clinical situations. We hypothesized that PPV
      could play a role as a predictor of fluid responsiveness during displacement of the heart in
      patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB).

      The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of PPV to predict fluid responsiveness
      during displacement of the heart in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass
      surgery. After anesthesia, we will measure mean arterial pressure, heart rate, central venous
      pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure, mixed venous
      oxygen saturation, PPV and cardiac index in patients receiving elective OPCAB. All parameters
      will be recorded at 5 minutes after the left anterior descending artery anastomosis,
      immediately after the displacement of the heart for the left circumflex artery anastomosis,
      and 10 minutes after fluid loading with hydroxyethyl starch 6%(10 mL/kg). Patients whose
      cardiac index increased by &gt;15% to fluid loading will be defined as responders. To test the
      abilities of central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and PPV to predict
      fluid responsiveness during heart displacement, areas under the receiver operating
      characteristics curves of the responders will be calculated and compared.
