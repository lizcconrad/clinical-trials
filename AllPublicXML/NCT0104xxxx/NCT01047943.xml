  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical assessment of patients with plaque-type psoriasis is performed by open,
      intrapatient comparison of 0.2% STA-21 with vehicle(Vaseline) alone within a 2 week period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two discrete psoriatic lesions with a similar size (approximately coin-sized) and clinical
      severity are selected in each patient. Clinical assessment of psoriatic lesion severity is
      performed at the baseline and at 1 and 2 (end of treatment) using the scores of erythema,
      induration, scaling on a scale of 0-4 by two observers. Since STA-21 inhibits Stat3
      activation, which is essential for disease activity of psoriasis, topical application of 0.2%
      STA-21 in Vaseline should improve psoriasis in two weeks.
