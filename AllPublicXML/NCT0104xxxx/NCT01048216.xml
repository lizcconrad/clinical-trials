  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to treat tumors in the liver that cannot be removed surgically and
      chemotherapy cannot control these tumors, using radiation therapy and a more precise delivery
      than has been used before.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of conformal radiation
      therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal liver cancer. This study would also evaluate
      local control rate within irradiated area and to assess failure patterns and survival of
      patients treated with conformal liver radiation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  liver metastases unequivocally seen on contrast enhanced CT and/or MRI from colon or
             rectal cancer, previously confirmed pathologically as adenocarcinoma

          -  either 1) the tumor must be unresectable, 2) the patient must be medically inoperable,
             or 3) extra-hepatic metastases are present (making hepatic surgery an inappropriate
             treatment option)

          -  good performance status (0-1)

          -  Age &gt; 18 years. Adult patients of all ages, both sexes and all races will be included
             in this study. Female patients within reproductive years may not be, nor become,
             pregnant during participation in this study

          -  life expectancy &gt; 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with active hepatitis or clinically significant liver failure

          -  patients receiving anticoagulation treatment with warfarin or heparin

          -  prior radiation therapy to the right upper abdomen, precluding re-irradiation of the
             liver

          -  clinically apparent ascites

          -  central nervous system metastases
