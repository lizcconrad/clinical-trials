    <textblock>
      In this research study, we are using heart imaging exams and blood testing, in order to gain
      an improved understanding of the pulmonary (lung) hypertension and cardiovascular (heart)
      complications that often occur in sickle cell patients. Information gathered from the healthy
      volunteers that participate in this study will be compared to information from the sickle
      cell patients in this study in order to help further our understanding.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has gained increasing clinical application in
      cardiopulmonary diseases. Due to its 3-dimensional nature, CMR is considered the
      gold-standard for quantifying left and right ventricular systolic function and size.
      Additionally, its high tissue contrast allows for a detailed characterization of myocardial
      tissue. Specifically, the use of techniques such as late gadolinium enhancement can be used
      to detect the presence of tiny amounts of myocardial scar. Other techniques have been shown
      to correlate strongly with myocardial iron content. Just as importantly, CMR perfusion
      imaging can accurately quantify myocardial blood flow and can provide tremendous insight into
      the function of the microcirculation. CMR's high spatial and temporal resolution, its
      3-dimensional approach, its ability to characterize the tissue, and its ability to evaluate
      the micro- and macro-circulation make it a comprehensive technique for the evaluation of
      heart disease. Recently, one CMR study has already shown the presence of cardiac
      microvascular disease in a subset of adult sickle cell disease (SCD) patients in the absence
      of infarcted myocardium, myocardial iron overload, or coronary artery disease, increasing the
      evidence for the contribution of left heart disease to pulmonary hypertension (PH)
      development in these patients; unfortunately, strong conclusions could not be made because
      the study was underpowered. Thus, this proposal will leverage the advantages offered by CMR
      to better characterize and detect the PH and cardiopulmonary subphenotypes in the SCD patient
      population.
