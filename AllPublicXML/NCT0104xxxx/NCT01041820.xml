    <textblock>
      Early childhood (~3-7 years of age) is an important window for determining body composition
      trajectory and may be a critical period for the development of tissue partitioning patterns
      that influence obesity risk. As adiposity accelerates during this critical period,
      deposition/ preservation of fat stores may be sustained at the 'expense' of other tissues;
      i.e. energy homeostasis may be inherently biased toward fat gain. The type and amount of
      tissue mass accrued in early childhood has implications for metabolic profile,
      glucose/insulin homeostasis, hormone profile and resting energy expenditure.

      The interplay between fat and bone deposition represents a physiologic trait enabling the
      body to choose between shuttling 'energy' towards accrual of a particular tissue. Plausibly
      the phenotype underlying obesity and diabetes risk may be determined by the differentiation
      of cell type (adipocyte, osteocyte, etc.) during this early stage of growth and development.
      In vitro studies demonstrate transdifferentiation under the influence of specific external
      stimuli, which can switch phenotypes toward other cell lineages. Further, rodent models have
      demonstrated that exposure to stimuli (exercise) early in life may prevent excess fat mass
      accrual in adulthood, even when the stimulus is later removed (animals are no longer
      exercising). Children's early experiences (engagement in physical activity vs. sedentary
      behavior) may 'environmentally induce' alterations in body composition and predispose
      individuals to obesity throughout life.

      Aim 1. To examine the associations between body composition via DXA and objectively-measured
      physical activity/inactivity.

        1. Hypothesis 1.1: There is a positive association between physical activity and bone mass.

        2. Hypothesis 1.2: There is a positive association between sedentary behavior and total fat
           mass.

           Aim2. To examine the associations between adipose tissue distribution via MRI and
           objectively-measured physical activity/inactivity.

        3. Hypothesis 2.1: There is an inverse association between physical activity and bone
           marrow adipose tissue.

        4. Hypothesis 2.2: There is a positive association between sedentary behavior and bone
           marrow adipose tissue.
