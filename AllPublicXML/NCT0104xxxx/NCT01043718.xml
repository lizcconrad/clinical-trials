  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hershey Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh are doing a research study to help
      meet the needs of the adult population at risk for diabetes and heart disease. This study
      will provide a web-based program that aims to help participants to develop healthier eating
      habits, lose weight and become more physically active. The Internet-based materials will
      teach participants about healthy eating and physical activity and will ask them to
      incorporate the information they learn into their daily lives.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of online lifestyle change
      programs to promote weight loss, healthy eating and physical activity patterns, in the
      interest of reducing risk for and adverse outcomes of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD).

    <description>The online lifestyle intervention will include elements of a behavioral lifestyle program developed by the Diabetes Prevention Program. The program will assist individual participants with establishing appropriate weight loss goals, implementing dietary recommendations (including analysis of current diet), and defining exercise programs. The program curriculum provides standard information about healthy lifestyle, and behavioral techniques for integrating them into daily living. In each lesson, patients provide feedback about how they interpret the information, and ideas for integrating it into their lives.</description>

    <description>The participants will be provided with the information to access the online Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) intervention materials. Following the original DPP trial, all DPP materials were placed online for the public to access. This group will receive a lifestyle counseling session and tools to facilitate their intervention.</description>
