  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia is still characterized by a certain proportion of
      patients who are resistant to common antipsychotics. Variability in individual response
      ranges from patients who experience complete or near complete symptom remission to a subset
      of patients who remain treatment-refractory despite extensive drug trials over years. The
      investigators propose to take advantage of the simultaneous acquisition of clinical and of
      intermediate phenotypes to ascertain the possible contribution of SNPs within putative
      causative genes to response to treatment with quetiapine XR.
