    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease is a common condition in older adults involving poor arterial
      circulation in the legs leading to leg pain and debility. The body's own circulating blood
      vessel stem cells may help to improve circulation. This study will test whether treatment
      with the drug granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) will improve symptoms
      and signs of peripheral arterial disease over placebo after four weeks of therapy. As well
      this study will examine whether improvements in blood vessel function can be observed.
      Finally, we will measure blood vessel function and stem cell levels in order to determine
      whether they can help to predict whether patients wither peripheral arterial disease will
      suffer further cardiovascular complications.

      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects more than 8 million Americans. Although exercise,
      smoking cessation, anti-platelet therapy, cilostazol, statins and revascularization are used
      to treat PAD, men and women with PAD have significantly greater functional impairment and
      fasterfunctional decline than those without PAD. Stem and progenitor cell (PC) therapy that
      promotes neoangiogenesis is an emerging treatment modality in PAD. Progenitor cells,
      particularly those of endothelial origin, are involved in vascular repair and regeneration.
      They originate primarily but not exclusively from the bone marrow, differentiate into
      endothelial and other vascular cells, and contribute to neovascularization during tissue
      repair by direct and paracrine mechanisms. Endogenous, pharmacologically-stimulated, and
      exogenous PCs contribute to re-endothelialization and neovascularization. Granulocyte colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
      stimulate mobilization of hematopoietic and other PCs from the bone marrow.In the murine hind
      limb ischemia model, GM-CSF administered by injection or by plasmid transfer augments
      circulating levels of PCs, increases capillary density, and promotes arteriogenesis.GM-CSF
      also augments neo-endothelialization of denuded arteries, promotes proliferation,
      differentiation and survival of hematopoietic cells, monocytes and macrophages.

    <measure>Change in Peak Walking Time During Treadmill Exercise Tolerance Test From Baseline to 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) was conducted using the Gardner protocol. Participants exercised on a treadmill, starting at 2.0 mph. The intensity of exercise (speed) was increased in grade of 2% every 2 minutes. Participants were asked to exercise until symptom limitation and the time measured in seconds from the ETT was used for data analysis.</description>

        <title>Change in Peak Walking Time During Treadmill Exercise Tolerance Test From Baseline to 3 Months</title>
        <description>Exercise Tolerance Test (ETT) was conducted using the Gardner protocol. Participants exercised on a treadmill, starting at 2.0 mph. The intensity of exercise (speed) was increased in grade of 2% every 2 minutes. Participants were asked to exercise until symptom limitation and the time measured in seconds from the ETT was used for data analysis.</description>
