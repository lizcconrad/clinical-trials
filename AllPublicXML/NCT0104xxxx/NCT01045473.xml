  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population of the US is aging. They remain more active and place greater demands on their
      musculoskeletal system. A key problem is that pain and disability of age related spinal
      disorders will increase. Problems such as Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis, Degenerative
      Disk Disease, Spinal Stenosis and Degenerative Scoliosis are age related problems that are
      treated with spinal fusion when non-operative treatment fails. Traditional open surgery poses
      significant risk for patients in this age group. The use of minimally invasive spinal surgery
      techniques provides an opportunity to treat these patients with less morbidity than
      traditional open surgery.
