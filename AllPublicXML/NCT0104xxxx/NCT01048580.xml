      This is a Phase I study of Perifosine + Capecitabine for patients with advanced colon cancer.

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I trial. A total of 3 ‐ 9 patients will be enrolled. Three patients
      will initially be enrolled. There will be no dose escalation in this study as only one dose
      for perifosine (50 mg) in combination with one dose of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 BID) will be
      evaluated. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined in which fewer than 33% of patients
      experienced DLT attributable to the study drug(s), when at least six patients have been
      treated at that dose and are evaluable for toxicity. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data will also be
      evaluated from all enrolled patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with 3rd line or &gt; metastatic colon cancer

          -  Patients must have received or not be candidates for regimens containing 5‐ FU,
             oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab, and cetuximab or panitumumab

          -  No prior exposure to perifosine

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function

          -  Patients must have at least one measurable lesion

          -  Patients must agree to have extra blood drawn for PK analyses

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior exposure to perifosine.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents or devices.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to perifosine (miltefosine or edelfosine).
