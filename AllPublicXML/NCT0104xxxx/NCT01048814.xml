  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve upon and validate the prognostic and/or predictive
      accuracy of a drug response marker by the development of improved alternative algorithms
      based on the actual clinical outcome of retrospective cases.

      This is a multicenter, retrospective chart review study of de-identified drug response marker
      results and a limited data set of clinical outcome data. Data from approximately 512 cases
      will be collected from approximately 30 sites and correlated to the secondary endpoints
      identified in order to produce a training set that will incorporate additional improvements
      to the existing ChemoFx scoring system. The outcome of progression free survival will be
      defined as the period of time between the first dose of chemotherapy following the report of
      the marker result until clinical progression or death. Objective response will be measured
      from the first dose of chemotherapy following the report of the marker result until
      progression or change in therapy.

        Approximately 512 cases of ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube, recurrent, persistent, or
        refractory cancer that have had ChemoFx drug response marker results for NCCN recommended
        second line therapy from August 2006 to January 31, 2009 will be included in the
        compilation of the training set. Cases will be selected sequentially from each
        participating clinical site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Case has an original pathology report showing, epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or
             fallopian tube carcinoma.

          -  Cases must meet one of the following classifications: Recurrent: Complete Response
             following primary therapy and a period of absence of no measurable disease;
             Persistent: Partial Response following 6 cycles of a platinum based therapy with
             measurable disease remaining or Refractory: Stable Disease or Progressive Disease
             during primary platinum therapy.

          -  Case must have a commercial ChemoFx drug response marker final report

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases with evidence of synchronous primary endometrial cancer or a past history of
             primary endometrial cancer are excluded unless all of the following conditions are
             met: Stage not greater than I-B; Less than 3 mm invasion without vascular or lymphatic
             invasion; No poorly differentiated subtype, including papillary serous, clear cell, or
             other FIGO Grade 3 lesion.
