      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the new diabetes care
      delivery system applied to preexisting public health care resources through advanced
      information technologies such as PDA-type glucometer and the Internet on the glycemic control
      of type 2 diabetes patients lived in isolated rural area.

      The investigators conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in patients with type
      2 diabetes for 12 weeks. The intervention group was treated with the new health care delivery
      system, where diabetes center provided specialized management, mediated by nurse of primary
      health care posts using the Internet and the PDA-type glucometer, while the control group
      with conventional health care. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and lipids levels were measured
      at baseline and follow-up.
