    <textblock>
      Hypothesis 1. Consumers with disabilities and co-occurring SUD receiving IPS will be more
      likely to be competitively employed (defined as 1 or more days of work over the past 30 days)
      at 3, 6 and 12 months following the initiation of vocational treatment goals when compared to
      a group receiving standard services.

      Hypothesis 2. Consumers with disabilities and co-occurring SUD receiving IPS when compared to
      the comparison group will 1.) be more successful in achieving their employment goals as
      indicated by the ratio of hours worked to desired hours worked; 2.) become competitively
      employed sooner; 3.) earn higher wages, 4.) have greater job satisfaction, 5.) have greater
      economic satisfaction; 6.) have greater life satisfaction, 7.) have greater self-esteem, and
      8.) have fewer days of using substances during follow-up points.
