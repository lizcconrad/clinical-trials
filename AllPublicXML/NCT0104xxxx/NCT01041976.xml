  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare 6 monthly counseling sessions to 6 monthly
      information sessions on Veterans' decisions to (a) participate in vocational rehabilitation
      services and (b) become employed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 85-90% of those with serious mental illness are unemployed (9, 10). This level
      of unemployment exists despite the finding that, among people who have a psychiatric
      disability and are unemployed, 55-61% desire employment, with the total reaching 75% when
      concern about losing benefits was taken into account (1, 2). The rewards of employment for
      adults with SMI are greater than simply an increase in financial resources. Studies have
      found that people with serious mental illness who worked competitively scored higher on
      measures of self-esteem, satisfaction with finances, leisure, and overall life satisfaction
      compared to those worked little or not at all (11). Supported employment (SE) has been more
      effective than any other vocational rehabilitation approach for this population (3, 4) and
      the VA has mandated that SE be integrated into all current VHA Compensated Work Therapy (CWT)
      programs (VHA Directive 2007-005). Two areas of concern include (a) national utilization of
      SE services is low (13), and (b) the percentage of SE participants who obtain at least one
      job during the studies averages 56% even though everyone who enters the program expressed an
      interest in working (13).

      Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based practice that has been effective in
      enhancing a range of clinical services (6), but has just recently been applied to employment
      and vocational services by Drebing et al. (7) and Glynn et al (8).

      The proposed project is a randomized trial of Adapted Motivational Interviewing for Supported
      Employment (AMI-SE) provided to Veterans and their significant others (family members or key
      friends) in order to address the internal and external barriers to the Veteran enrolling in
      supported employment and returning to work.
