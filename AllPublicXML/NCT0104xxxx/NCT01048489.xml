  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effectiveness of health education regarding the smoking habit is under discussion .
      Nevertheless, according to the literature, some personal, familiar, cultural, and social
      factors are considered risk factors for students to become smokers. Probably, a health
      education intervention integrated in the school program will show a higher rate of
      effectiveness regarding incidence and prevalence of smoking habit in this age-group .

      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a health education program to reduce the smoking
      habit in students.

      METHODOLOGY: Quasi-experimental design including all the junior high school students in an
      educational district in Tarragona (Spain). The sampled schools will be randomised into two
      groups (experimental and control). All the included students will be monitored for three
      years.

      The health education program will be divided in three interventions: role games and debates
      (1st year), workshops regarding the family and the social role of smoking (2nd year) , and
      the analysis of smoking advertising (3rd year). The incidence and prevalence rates will be
      compared on the experimental and control group, before de beginning of the intervention and
      at the beginning of each year.
