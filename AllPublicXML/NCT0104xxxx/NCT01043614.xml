    <textblock>
      Project PEER utilizes a randomized controlled study design to investigate the combined
      effects of an exercise and nutrition intervention that is based on self-efficacy principles
      and delivered primarily by peer educators to reduce the risk for obesity in female college
      freshman over one academic year (N = 300). The control group will receive minimal interaction
      from the research team, paralleling the typical freshman experience on the UIUC campus.
      Recruitment will take place in two waves (consecutive fall terms with n = 150).

      During the final year (Fall 2010) of the project, a General Education course will be offered
      that targets weight management. Importantly, the discussion groups for this course will be
      taught by peer educators trained using the peer resources further refined during the PEER
      project. In addition to conventional measures of content knowledge assessed in the college
      classroom when obtaining class credit, personal physical activity and nutrition behaviors
      along with behavioral determinants (self-efficacy, self-regulatory skills and outcome
      expectations) will also be assessed.

      Primary Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of a peer-delivered self efficacy-based
      behavioral intervention to enhance nutrition and physical activity behaviors and subsequently
      weight management success in female university freshman over one academic year. We
      hypothesize that freshmen randomized to the intervention group will be more successful in
      losing or maintaining weight than the control group through a combination of diet and
      physical activity strategies.

      Primary Aim 2: To examine the role played by social cognitive factors in changing nutrition
      and physical activity behaviors across one academic year. We hypothesize that self-efficacy
      will have both a direct influence on behavior and an indirect effect through its influence on
      self-regulatory skills and outcome expectations.
