  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lutein is one of oxygenated carotenoids. Over the past few years, there has been increased
      interest in evaluating the effect of lutein for optimizing eye health. A large number of
      epidemiological studies support the notion that the high intake dietary of lutein is strongly
      associated with a decreased relative risk of AMD.Moreover, findings from initial
      observational studies have now been followed by placebo-controlled intervention trials
      showing that dietary modification and supplementation with lutein result in increasing the
      macular pigment optical density, and may help to improve visual function in patients
      suffering from AMD.Currently, nutritional status and background information of lutein and
      zeaxanthin in Chinese population is lack. Little is known about the preventive and therapy
      benefits of lutein on visual function in the AMD populations. In particular, the effect on
      visual function of relatively certain doses of lutein and zeaxanthin is unknown. Therefore,
      the objective of the present study was to examine the effect of consuming different doses of
      lutein on MPOD and visual function in AMD.

      We aim to study the effect and the mechanism of lutein in the prevention and treatment for
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Using the cluster sampling method, baseline
      characteristics screening will be performed in Han nationality men and women in the suburban
      areas of Beijing, ranging in age from 50 to79 years. According to clinical diagnosis standard
      of AMD, AMD (n=120) and normal subjects (n=40) will be randomly selected to measure serum
      lutein and nutritional status, and evaluate the relationship between lutein and AMD. Each
      subject of AMD will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: Group low lutein (Group LL); Group
      high lutein (Group HL); Group lutein/zeaxanthin (Group LZ); and Group Placebo to participate
      in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 1 year intervention study, respectively.
      Macular pigment optical density,related symptoms and multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG)
      will be measured at at weeks 0, 24 and 48, to compare their dynamic changes in response to
      supplements at baseline and each follow-up visit, observe time- and dose-response correlation
      of supplementation with lutein, assess the efficacy, dosage of lutein and/or zeaxanthin
      supplement.
