  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a physical therapy intervention for reducing pain in the
      low back and into the legs. With individuals over the age of 40 years, this pain may be
      associated to changes in back height from aging of the cushions between the back bones. When
      pain is caused from this, completion of different positions and rest periods have been shown
      to help reduce the pain, at least temporarily. This study will compare two such positions;
      1)floating in deep warm water with weights attached to the ankles, to take the load off of
      the spine, 2)lying on their back with hip and knees flexed to a 90 degree angle. The height
      of each person will be measured before and after completion of each intervention using a
      specially designed measuring tool.

      Experimental hypothesis:

        1. Subjects with low back and leg pain suggestive of nerve root compression syndrome will
           experience increase in spinal height when completing aquatic vertical suspension and/or
           land-based supine flexion.

        2. Subjects with low back and leg pain suggestive of nerve root compression syndrome will
           experience greater increase in height, greater reduction of pain intensity and location
           when completing underwater vertical suspension as compared to supine land based flexion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal height is affected throughout life from many different physiological changes and
      mechanical stresses, but a large portion is thought to occur primarily from intervertebral
      disc degeneration with resultant reduction in overall spinal height. The use of specific
      postures and rest periods to increase the overall spinal height has been suggested through
      various stadiometric research studies. This overall spinal height change can be used as a
      treatment tool for management of symptoms of chronic low back pain and signs of nerve root
      compression.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of aquatic vertical suspension on
      spinal height, symptom location and pain intensity compared to a more commonly used land
      based supine flexion position.

      The study will be conducted at one outpatient physical therapy clinic with subjects recruited
      from the local community.

      A single blinded True Experimental Repeated Measure cross over design will be utilized.

      Spine height will be measured using a commercially available stadiometer. Spinal height
      measurements will be completed after loaded walking, supine land based flexion positioning
      and after aquatic vertical hang.
