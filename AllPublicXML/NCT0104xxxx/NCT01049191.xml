    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a common disorder of compromised bone strength causing 40-50% of women and
      ~25% of men to sustain fragility fractures during their lifetime. The reduction of bone
      strength in osteoporotic people results from loss of bone density and deterioration of bone
      quality. Bone quality is a complex amalgamation including macro- and micro-architecture,
      mineralization, turnover and damage accumulation. Currently, medications to reduce fracture
      risk are prescribed primarily on the basis of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement.
      Unfortunately, currently available BMD measurement technologies do not detect the
      aforementioned properties of bone quality; as such, less than half of individuals who sustain
      osteoporotic fractures are classified as &quot;osteoporotic&quot; by currently available diagnostic
      tools. Clearly, measures to enhance identification of those at high fracture risk are needed.
      High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) technology, such as that provided by
      MicroMRI, Inc., has outstanding potential to be such a tool. Therefore, our long-term goal is
      to evaluate and optimize the use of HR-MRI in fracture risk prediction; this pilot work is an
      essential step in attaining this goal.

      This research will investigate 72 postmenopausal women with normal or osteopenic BMD by
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 36 with prior low-trauma fractures will be compared
      with 36 age-, race- and BMD matched women without fracture. We hypothesize that 1.) Women
      with fractures will have evidence of microarchitectural deterioration on HR-MRI and 2.) Newly
      developed, more rapid MRI sequences designed at the UW will provide similar trabecular
      microstructure information more rapidly than the currently used, albeit investigational,
      technology produced by MicroMRI, Inc.

      Our specific aims are to a) Evaluate differences in MicroMRI parameters of trabecular
      microstructure (bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, surface/curve ratio and erosion
      index) between age-, race- and BMD-matched postmenopausal women with and without fracture;
      b.) Correlate T2* relaxation time (a rapid indirect MRI measure of trabecular density and
      microstructure) with BMD measured by DXA, and microstructural parameters measured by
      MicroMRI. As an exploratory aim we will investigate HR-MRI parameters of trabecular
      microstructure obtained using a newly developed, rapid MRI sequence referred to as IDEAL-FSE
      with parameters obtained using the currently available MicroMRI, Inc. sequence.

        Seventy-two postmenopausal volunteers age ≥ 50 years will be recruited from existing
        databases of ~3500 women with expressed interested in research. All will have normal BMD or
        osteopenia (T-score &gt; -2.5 at the L1-4 spine, proximal femur and 1/3rd radius) by DXA.
        Thirty-six will have sustained a &quot;fragility&quot; fracture of the spine, hip or wrist, defined
        as a fracture occurring with everyday activities including a fall from standing height or
        less. Historical radiographic documentation of fracture will be obtained. Thirty-six women
        without fracture will serve as age- race- and BMD-matched controls. Age will be matched to
        within 6 months; BMD in grams/cm2 at the non-dominant ultra-distal radius will be matched
        to within 5%.
