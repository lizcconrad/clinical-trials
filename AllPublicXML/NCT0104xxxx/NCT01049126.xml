      The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship of assay sensitive patients versus
      assay resistant patients with progression free survival.

      This is a multicenter, retrospective chart review study of de-identified drug response marker
      results and a limited data set of clinical outcome data. Data from approximately 70 cases
      will be collected from approximately 10 study sites and correlated to the ChemoFx drug
      response marker results. The outcome of progression free survival will be defined as the
      period of time between the first dose of chemotherapy following the report of the marker
      result until clinical progression or death. Objective response will be measured from the
      first dose of chemotherapy following the report of the marker result until progression or
      change in therapy. Overall Survival will be measured from the start of chemotherapy to the
      actual date of death.
