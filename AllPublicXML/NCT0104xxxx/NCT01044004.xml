      Aims will be analyzed separately as stratified by treatment arm (chemotherapy treatment arm
      vs. post-treatment remission arm).

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine whether armodafinil is more effective than placebo in reducing fatigue as
           measured by the change in scores from the FACT-Fatigue reported at study entry, week 7
           of study treatment, and study completion (week 13).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine whether armodafinil is more effective than placebo in reducing fatigue as
           measured by standard actigraphy summary statistics including total sleep time (TST),
           wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep latency, number of awakenings, daytime sleep time,
           mean daytime activity, peak activity, acrophase, and circadian mesor at week 1 of
           screening, week 7 of study treatment, and study completion (week 13).

        -  To determine whether armodafinil is more effective than placebo in improving work
           quality as measured by the change in scores from the WLQ© reported at study entry (week
           1) and study completion (week 13).

        -  To determine whether armodafinil is more effective than placebo in reducing fatigue as
           measured by the change in activity patterns with actigraphy using applied functional
           data analysis during week 1 of screening, week 7 of study treatment, and study
           completion (week 13).

        -  To evaluate whether measured cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and TGF-α) are
           elevated at baseline.

        -  To evaluate whether measured cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and TGF-α) change from
           the time of study entry to study completion.

        -  To assess whether cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and TGF-α) correlate with
           circadian patterns in wrist actigraphy and self-described reports of fatigue as measured
           by the FACT-Fatigue at baseline and study completion.
