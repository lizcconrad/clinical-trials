      The purpose of the study is to determine if listening to your choice of music with a portable
      mp3 player before and after a cesarean section for delivery of a baby will decrease the
      patient's anxiety level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Music has been suggested and evaluated as a therapeutic intervention to reduce preoperative
      anxiety for surgical patients. Music intervention in the immediate preoperative period may be
      effective in lowering anxiety levels during Cesarean delivery. If this investigation shows
      that music intervention before and after Cesarean delivery reduces anxiety levels, this
      intervention can be integrated into future operative care for women having scheduled or
      emergency Cesarean deliveries. Music therapy could be expanded to included patients
      undergoing other surgical procedures under regional anesthesia. The effect of reducing
      anxiety levels could aid in lactation initiation and improve infant bonding in new mothers,
      but it could also shorten postoperative recovery time for all surgical patients.
