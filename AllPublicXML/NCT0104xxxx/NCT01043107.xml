    <textblock>
      Thyroid Cancer is one of the most common malignant carcinomas. The incidence of thyroid
      cancer has risen in the past years. The recrudesce rate is highly raised. Computer is widely
      used by people nowadays, is it a predisposing factor to the highly raised recrudesce rate?
      This research observed two random assigned groups, in which the patients were diagnosed by
      pathologic results. One group were strictly prohibit with using computer, the other were not
      told. Finally collect the recrudesce rate of each group, analyze the data by statistic
      software.
