      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Acclarent
      Tympanostomy Tube Delivery System (TTDS) in the placement of tympanostomy tubes (TTs) in
      patients indicated for such treatment for chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) or
      recurrent acute otitis media (AOM).
