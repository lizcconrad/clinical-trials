    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate the effect on BMI of a school-based program that
      discourages the consumption of all sweetened beverages, encourages the reduction in sugar
      intake, and encourages the increase in physical activity among adolescents and their families
      from a low socioeconomic area.

      Specific objectives are:

        1. To compare total, lean, and fatty body mass variation in adolescents aged 11 to 14, from
           7th and 8th grades from schools under intervention and from the ones not subjected to
           the intervention program.

        2. To compare sweetened beverages consumption and sugar intake before and after the
           intervention in both groups of schools.

        3. To evaluate the impact of the intervention on the selling of sweetened beverages in the
           cafeterias.

        4. To compare change in family expenditures with sweetened beverages and sugar.

    <description>Based on beliefs and behaviors of children sections of education will be delivered via classroom activities.
Activities will be facilitated by trained research assistants. Printed instructions and orientations on the facilitation process will support the assistants' efforts. The activities will require 20 to 30 minutes, and teachers will be encouraged to reiterate the message during their lesson. The goal is to promote ten one-hour sessions of activity for each class.
Children will also be stimulated to increase everyday activities such as walking and playing games at home and school. Also, activities with parents and family members such as walking around the neighborhood on weekends will be promoted.</description>
