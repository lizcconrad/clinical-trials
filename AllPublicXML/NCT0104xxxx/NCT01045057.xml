  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a total laryngectomy a puncture is created in the tracheoesophageal wall and a voice
      prosthesis is inserted. With this voice prosthesis the patient learns to speak again. During
      this study a new surgical tool will be investigated that creates the puncture and places the
      voice prosthesis.
