  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the elderly a chronic basal systemic inflammation prevails - which is evident by enhanced
      CRP or IL-6 plasma concentrations - and by compromised defense mechanisms against invading
      microbes. These alterations belong to the physiological ageing process of the immune system
      (immunosenescence) and are regarded as an inflammatory response towards lifelong antigen
      stress (&quot;inflammatory/pathogen burden&quot;). This lifelong antigen stress evokes an age-dependent
      basal inflammatory activation of innate immunity as well as a wasting of specific immunity:
      it is supposed that in the course of life-time due to a multitude of infectious/inflammatory
      events (&quot;multiple hits&quot;) an inflammatory stress prevails or &quot;inflammatory/pathogen burden&quot;
      accumulates, which substantially contributes to an enhancement of the inflammatory parameters
      of natural immune response. Such enhanced inflammatory parameters characterize persons at
      increased risk of degenerative diseases like atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease. The
      risk is the higher, the higher the &quot;pathogen burden&quot;. An impact of the inflammatory load on
      cardiac ageing has not yet been described.

      &quot;CARDIAC AGEING&quot;, REFLECTED BY A NARROWING OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY: The physiological
      ageing process of the heart goes along with a narrowing of heart rate variability as shown by
      various groups, including our own. Arguments in favour of a causal relationship between
      inflammation and cardiac ageing come from an experimental study with healthy human volunteers
      who had received a low dose of endotoxin: such a proinflammatory stimulus leads to a
      reversible narrowing of heart rate variability (7). Also in senescence heart rate variability
      steadily declines, paralleled by a steady increase of basal inflammatory activity.

      The reduction of heart rate variability also is regarded as a sensitive parameter of
      autonomic dysfunction, which contributes to the compromise of cardiac reserve in old age.
      Apart from typical morphological features and functional deterioration, e.g. diastolic
      dysfunction, the senescent heart is typically characterized by a narrowed heart rate
      variability. Efforts have been made to estimate the cardiac age of an individual by this
      compromised heart rate variability, which may be divergent to the biological age. In recent
      years diverse approaches were proposed to measure cardiac age on the basis of heart rate
      variability. The published mathematical formulae were mostly validated with small patient
      groups and have presently not entered clinical practice. Still heart rate variability is an
      accepted surrogate parameter of cardiac ageing and is amenable by therapeutic measures, e.g.
      beta-blockade.

      The interaction between autonomic nervous system and inflammation is bilateral: thus vagal
      stimulation can improve heart rate variability and at the same time evoke anti-inflammatory
      action: this &quot;cholinergic anti-inflammatory&quot; reflex could make the basis for pharmacological
      interventions to confine overwhelming inflammatory response syndromes. The afferent vagal
      nerve, on the other hand, can be stimulated by inflammatory mediators and toxins (endotoxin,
      Interleukin-1), thus activating the efferent vagus to release acetylcholine, which can bind
      to a nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor on macrophages and thus interrupt cytokine release
      and limit the rise in the blood levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6). The
      biological meaning of this reflex is to localise inflammatory reactions in the organism and
      prevent a spill of cytokines to the circulation. A functioning autonomic nervous system is
      thus mandatory to prevent overshooting of inflammatory response to infection and
      non-infectious stimuli. The link between cardiac ageing and autonomic dysfunction gives
      another argument in favour of the notion that autonomic dysfunction and pathogen/inflammatory
      load could be factors promoting cardiac ageing. This, on the other hand, implies the chance
      of slowing down the cardiac ageing process by successfully modulating the extent of autonomic
      dysfunction and the scope of &quot;pathogen/inflammatory burden&quot;.

      THE NEED FOR A TRIAL:

      A possible causal relationship between basal inflammatory activation and cardiac ageing has
      not been established. This is the issue of the project proposal. In this trial the
      investigators strive to lower the &quot;pathogen/ inflammatory load&quot; by simple and safe measures.
      The investigators therefore chose treatment with statins, standardised physical training
      (both parameters of heart function and heart rate variability could thus be improved) and
      vaccinations against influenza and pneumococci to prevent a further enhanced &quot;pathogen/
      inflammatory burden&quot;.
