  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Integrated eHealth is an innovative, proactive approach to the management of patients with
      chronic cardiopulmonary disease. Our overall goal is to improve the health of patients by
      integrating guideline-based education, remote disease monitoring, coordinator-based disease
      management and healthcare provider-initiated therapy. Patients enrolled in the program
      receive a set of equipment, including a Health Buddy® telemonitor that connects to a normal
      telephone, as well as instruments to measure oxygen levels (pulse oximeter), lung function
      (spirometer) and activity (pedometer). Through the Health Buddy® patients receive
      guideline-based disease education in their own homes. The Health Buddy® also allows patients
      to transmit daily information about their symptoms, oxygen levels, lung function and ability
      to walk to program coordinators located at the University of Colorado Hospital. Our program
      coordinators are highly experienced nurses or respiratory therapists with expertise in the
      management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure
      (CHF). Through this remote disease education/monitoring program, patients learn to take a
      more active role in the management of their own disease. However, once the coordinators
      identify early warning signs of a potential problem, patients are contacted and connected to
      their primary healthcare provider for early intervention. By this integrated approach to
      care, patients learn self-management techniques, physician communication is enhanced, and
      early interventions for problems are possible. We propose to target the Integrated eHealth
      Program to areas of Colorado that are highly impacted by COPD.

      Key Objectives: The key objectives are to improve COPD care in the 16 Colorado counties with
      high COPD mortality rates.

      Target Population: We will target patients with severe or very severe COPD.

      Expected Outcomes: We expect that this study will increase the use of evidence-based
      guidelines in the screening, diagnosis and treatment of COPD, resulting in improved
      quality-of-life and a reduction in healthcare utilization.
