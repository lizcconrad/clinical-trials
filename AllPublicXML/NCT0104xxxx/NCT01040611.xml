  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis belongs to chronic diseases as a result of the treatment of disease over a long
      period, admission to negative pressure isolation wards, and restrictions on visitors. During
      the in-patient admission, patients are vulnerable to social isolation and separation anxiety.
      If anxiety sustained, patients' quality of life would be affected. Thus, it is important to
      improve patients' experience of anxiety. Music has the effectiveness of relaxation, and is
      helpful to patients' anxious status and physiological responses. This study examined the
      effectiveness of music therapy on anxiety, depression and physiological responses for
      patients with tuberculosis.
