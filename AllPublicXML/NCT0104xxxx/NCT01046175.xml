  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory complications continue to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality
      in people with spinal cord injury, especially among cervical and higher thoracic injuries.
      Both inspiratory and expiratory function are often severely decreased, leading to respiratory
      complications, such as atelectasis, pneumonia and ventilatory failure. The prevention of
      these respiratory complications needs to begin immediately after injury. To achieve effective
      expelling of secretions before they form mucus plugs, it is essential to improve patients
      ability to cough. Manually assisting the cough is one way of increasing cough flow, but an
      effective cough also requires adequate lung volumes. The emphasis should therefore be on
      expansion of the lungs before coughing. One way of expanding the lungs is by air-stacking. In
      air-stacking insufflations are stacked in the lungs to maximally expand them. Cough can be
      valued by measuring Peak Cough Flow (PCF). By combining air-stacking with manually assisted
      cough the PCF can be increased sufficiently. The aim of this study is to compare the effect
      of two different air-stacking techniques on PCF, air-stacking on a respirator versus
      air-stacking with a manual resuscitator.
