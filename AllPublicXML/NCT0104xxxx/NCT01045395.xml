  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall goal is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of consumption of two algae
      formulations compared to a placebo on: degree of severity of skin lesions, plasma lipid
      levels, as well as other health-related markers, in individuals with clinically diagnosed
      psoriasis.
