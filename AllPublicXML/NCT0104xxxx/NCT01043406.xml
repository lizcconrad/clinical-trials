      The purpose of this prospective, single-arm, unblinded, multicenter clinical study is to
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the NeuroVista Seizure Advisory System (SAS) in
      patients with medically refractory epilepsy. A total of 15 subjects will be implanted at up
      to three study sites.

    <textblock>
      This research project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the SAS based on how well it
      provides subjects with signals (or &quot;advisories&quot;) that they can see and hear to predict their
      &quot;likelihood&quot; of having a seizure. It does this by monitoring signals in the brain. A
      secondary purpose of the study is to learn whether the advisories improve subject quality of
      life or that of their caregiver.

      The SAS is made up of three main components that work together to monitor the subject's brain
      signals and then relay their information to the subject: the leads, the implantable telemetry
      unit (ITU), and the personal advisory device (PAD). The leads will be placed on different
      areas of the subject's brain to record electrical signals. The leads are tunneled down the
      neck to an ITU that is implanted in the chest, similar to a pacemaker. The ITU wirelessly
      transmits information to the PAD, which is carried like a pager. It records and processes
      brain signals and may be able to advise subjects when a seizure is likely or unlikely to
      occur.

      Following implantation with the SAS, subjects will return for five study visits for
      neurological examinations and quality of life assessments. Throughout the study, subjects
      must maintain their SAS; which includes daily recharging and data card replacement.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has disabling partial seizures and/or secondarily generalized partial
             seizures. Disabling refers to seizures that are severe enough to cause injuries or to
             significantly impair areas of function such as employment, psychological or social
             wellbeing, or mobility.

          2. Subject has failed treatment with a minimum of two AED's used in typical therapeutic
             dosages.

          3. For three months prior to enrollment, subject's anti-epileptic medication dosages have
             been stable and subject has had at least two disabling seizures per month, on average,
             with a seizure-free interval not to exceed 45 days. Seizures must be separated by a
             minimum of eight hours not to be considered part of a cluster. A cluster, for the
             purpose of this criterion, shall be considered a single seizure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For three months prior to enrollment, subject's anti-epileptic medication dosages have
             not been stable, or subject has had more than 12 disabling seizures per month, on
             average, or there was a seizure-free interval longer than 45 days. Clinical seizures
             must be separated by a minimum of eight hours to not be considered part of a cluster.
             A cluster, for the purpose of this criterion, shall be considered a single seizure.

          2. Subject is implanted with pacemaker, implantable cardiac defibrillator, cardiac
             management product, or a medical device that interferes with the SAS or with which the
             SAS interferes. This includes, but is not limited to, direct brain neurostimulators,
             spinal cord stimulators, vagus nerve stimulators (VNS), and cochlear implants.
             Patients with a vagus nerve stimulator implanted but turned off through the duration
             of the study may be enrolled, provided their clinical status has been stable for at
             least one month with VNS turned off.

          3. Subject has been diagnosed with primary generalized seizures.
