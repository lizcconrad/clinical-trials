      The purpose of this study is to see if using a combination of other drug classes, like the
      ones that Kaletra® and Intelence™ belong to, can still help reduce the amount of HIV in your
      blood. Using Kaletra® and Intelence™ without other drugs is not approved by the FDA and so
      their use in this study is experimental.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 RNA ≥ 5000 copies/mL by Roche Amplicor 1.5v Primer

          -  More than 18 years of age

          -  Provide written informed consent and willingness to participate in and comply

          -  Less than 7 days of prior ART with any licensed or investigational compound

          -  Does not currently have or has not been treated for an active opportunistic infection
             (OI) within 30 days of screening

          -  Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit evidence of
             acute illness

          -  A female who is a non-childbearing potentiator or if in child-bearing potential, has a
             negative serum pregnancy test at screen and agrees to one of the following: complete
             abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the study drug,
             throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after completion or premature
             discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of the investigational drug.
             Should a patient decide to become sexually active during the course of the study, she
             must be counseled and be willing to use one of the birth control methods like double
             barrier method, intrauterine device, sterilization and any other methods.

        NOTE: Data are insufficient to exclude a clinically important interaction of LPV/r with
        drugs, such as hormonal contraceptives, that are highly metabolized by the cytochrome P450
        enzyme system. As a result, hormonal contraception is not considered adequate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection in the 30 days prior to
             baseline and that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from
             participating in the study (See Appendix C).

          -  Patient has a weighted genotypic score for etravirine ≥3 . (See Appendix D)

          -  Patient has &gt;3 mutations at 10, 20, 24, 32, 33, 36, 46, 47, 48, 50, 54, 73, 82, 84, or
             90 in protease or ≥1 of the following mutations in protease (I47A/V, V32I, or L76V).

          -  History of active substance abuse.

          -  Pregnant at time of screening evaluation or breast-feeding.

          -  Patient, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to be able to complete the
             48-week dosing period and protocol evaluations and assessments or adhere to the study
             drug regimen.

          -  Serious medical condition, such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy
             or other cardiac dysfunction, which in the opinion of the investigator would
             compromise the safety of the patient

          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction, which may interfere with
             drug absorption or render the patient unable to take oral medication.

          -  Undergoing interferon therapy for HCV or anticipates undergoing therapy during the
             course of this trial

          -  HBV co-infection

          -  Laboratory results within 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication:

               -  Hemoglobin concentration &lt; 8.0 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 750 cells/mm3

               -  Platelet count &lt;50,000 cells/ mm3

               -  Aminotransferase (AST, ALT) &gt;3 times ULN

               -  Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 times the Upper Limits of Normal (ULN)

          -  Radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents within 4 weeks prior to entry,
             or has an anticipated need for these agents within the study period.

          -  Immunomodulating agents, such as systemic corticosteroids, interleukins, or
             interferon's within 4 weeks prior to study entry, or patients who have received an HIV
             immunotherapeutic vaccine within 3 months prior to entry. Asthmatic patients using
             inhaled corticosteroids are eligible for enrollment.

          -  Methadone therapy

          -  Foscarnet therapy or therapy with other agents with documented activity against HIV-1
             in vitro.

          -  Taking astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, oral midazolam, triazolam, flecainide,
             pimozide, propafenone, St. John's Wort, lovastatin, simvastatin, and rifampin or ergot
             derivatives.
