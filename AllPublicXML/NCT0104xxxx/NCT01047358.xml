  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of Aromasin through the end of the study for an average of 5.6 months</time_frame>
    <description>All AEs reported after start of administration of Aromasin were considered as TEAEs and summarized.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Without Recurrence/Metastasis (Early Breast Cancer)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the study, average of 5.6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The antitumor efficacy for early breast cancer was measured by recurrence/metastasis status (Yes or No) of the participant at the end of the study. The investigator recorded the final evaluation date and the information of tumor recurrence or metastasis (Yes or No) in each participant's case report form (CRF).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time-to-Progression (Early Breast Cancer)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the study, average of 5.6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to-Progression was defined as the duration from the date of first administration of Aromasin to the date of recurrence or contralateral breast cancer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants by Overall Tumor Response Assessed Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Advanced Breast Cancer)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the study, average of 5.6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The antitumor efficacy for advanced breast cancer was measured by objective tumor assessments according to the RECIST of uni-dimensional evaluation. Complete response (CR) was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, and no new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as disappearance of all target lesions, a persistence of ≥1 non-target lesions, no new lesions; or a ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, no new lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no new lesions. PD was defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions; or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of ≥1 new lesions.</description>

        <description>The antitumor efficacy for advanced breast cancer was measured by objective tumor assessments according to the RECIST of uni-dimensional evaluation. Complete response (CR) was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, and no new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as disappearance of all target lesions, a persistence of ≥1 non-target lesions, no new lesions; or a ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions, no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, no new lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no new lesions. PD was defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions; or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of ≥1 new lesions.</description>
