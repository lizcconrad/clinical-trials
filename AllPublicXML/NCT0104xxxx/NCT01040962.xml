  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fall risk is increased in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and yet, minimal
      research has been conducted to identify appropriate fall risk assessment tools and improve
      our understanding of falls in these individuals. Purpose: The primary purpose of this study
      is to establish a foundation of knowledge needed to address falls in people with DPN. This
      will be accomplished through 1) comparing the validity of 4 fall risk assessment tools, 2)
      identifying risk factors for falls and 3) determining how quality of life is influenced by
      factors related to falls in people with DPN.

      All subjects participate in testing that involves questionnaires, cognitive testing, fall
      risk assessment, and other testing related to physical parameters including body mass index,
      glycosylated hemoglobin, lower extremity nerve conduction study, and ankle range of motion,
      proprioception and strength. After testing, subjects are interviewed to determine fall status
      (faller or non-faller). A &quot;faller&quot; is defined as someone that has fallen at least 2 times in
      the past year. Data Analysis: The validity of the fall risk assessment tools will be compared
      using sensitivity and specificity analyses. Variables related to ankle function, neuropathy,
      glycemic control and general activity will be analyzed for association with recent fall
      history through multivariable logistic regression. Variables related to falls, neuropathy and
      activity level will be analyzed for association with health-related quality of life through
      multivariable linear regression.
