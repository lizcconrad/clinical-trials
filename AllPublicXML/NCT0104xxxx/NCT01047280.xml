  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine how a naturally occurring fat found in meats, such as
      beef and lamb and milk, called conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), will affect your body weight
      and body fat content, blood fat levels, as well as selected safety parameters. The CLA will
      be supplemented in an oil form and will be added to solid foods as provided by the metabolic
      kitchen at the Richardson Centre for Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to investigate the effectiveness of CLA on body weight and composition, as well as
      blood lipids, a double-blinded, 3-phase crossover trial will be conducted in moderately
      overweight (BMI=25-40 kg/m2), borderline hypercholesterolemic (LDL-C ≥ 2.5 mmol/L) men
      between the ages of 18-60 years. During three 8-week phases separated by 4-week washout
      periods, and under supervision to ensure compliance, 28 subjects will consume in random order
      (i) Control: 3.5 g/d of safflower oil, (ii) Clarinol G-80®: 3.5 g/d of 50:50 mixture of t10,
      c12 and c9, t11 CLA and (iii) c9, t11: 3.5 g/day of c9, t11 CLA. Body weight, fat mass and
      lean body mass will be measured at beginning and end of each phase by dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DEXA). Baseline and endpoint blood samples will collected to determine blood
      lipid profile, and different safety parameters, including insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR
      index), and concentrations of inflammatory (hs-CRP, TNF-α, IL-6) and oxidative (Oxidized-LDL)
      biomarkers. Effect of CLA consumption on fatty acid oxidation will also be measured.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Study subjects will be defined as overweight or obese, hyperlipidemic males, with a
             LDL-C level of greater than 2.5 mmol/L.Subjects will be between 18-60 years old and
             must have a body mass index (BMI) of 25-36 kg/m2. Subjects with thyroid diseases will
             be included in the study as long as they have been shown to be stable in response to
             their medications and thyroid therapy will have to be maintained at a stable dose
             throughout the study.
