  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety of a new pacing method (Fusion
      Pacing) for heart failure patients with an ejection fraction (EF) greater than 50% over a
      period of 4 months, and determine the effects on different measures of heart failure. This
      new pacing method may allow the heart to pump more efficiently. Participation in this study
      will last approximately 8 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an EF greater than 50% and a regional mechanical delay of &gt;= 65ms (an
      indication of mechanical dyssynchrony) will receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
      (ICD) with a special pacing feature. When the feature is active, the device wil pace the left
      ventricle to target improved pump efficiency. Patients will have the feature active for 4
      months and inactive for 4 months. The order will be randomized and the patient will not know
      whether the pacing is active or not. Echocardiography, biomarkers, exercise testing, quality
      of life (QOL) testing and device information will be used to compare the patient's status
      while the feature is active vs. inactive.
