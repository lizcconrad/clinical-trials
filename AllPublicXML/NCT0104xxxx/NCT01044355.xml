  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of fixed CPAP in comparison
      to APAP in reducing arterial blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension and
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

      The secondary objectives are: a) to evaluate the relative effectiveness of fixed CPAP versus
      APAP in improving arterial stiffness, sleep-disordered breathing, sleep quality, inflammatory
      markers and glucose regulation; b) to identify specific characteristic of persons who respond
      to the two CPAP modalities in order to identify which device is better for each subject.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The confirmatory hypothesis is that subjects with resistant hypertension and OSA will show a
      greater degree of blood pressure reduction after 6 weeks of treatment with fixed CPAP in
      comparison to those treated with APAP. Explanatory and exploratory hypotheses are that a
      greater reduction in arterial stiffness will be noted when compared with the benefit in blood
      pressure, that reductions in arterial stiffness will be associated with benefits to serum
      measurements of inflammatory markers and glucose regulation, and that control of sleep apnea
      and the attendant improvement in sleep quality will be better with fixed CPAP than APAP.
