  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of vitamin C when given with a
      standard chemotherapy for people who have metastatic pancreatic cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, dose-escalating study of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) designed to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose of vitamin C or, if well tolerated, the dose required to obtain a
      desired ascorbic acid plasma concentration.

      Because this is a phase I study, prospective subjects should have advanced disease (i.e.,
      metastasis) and have failed other curative therapies (or, are unable to receive curative
      therapies due to comorbidities or stage of disease).

    <description>Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) weekly for three weeks and then one week off. Ascorbic acid, given twice weekly, escalating doses weekly. Week 1: 15 grams ascorbic acid per infusion Week 2: 25 grams ascorbic acid per infusion Week 3: 50 grams ascorbic acid per infusion Week 4: 75 grams ascorbic acid per infusion Week 5: 100 grams ascorbic acid per infusion
Ascorbic acid infusion dose is maintained at the level that provides a serum level of 350-400 mg/dL.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Normal G6PD status

          -  Histologically or cytologically diagnosed pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

             toxicities related to that treatment.

          -  If post-therapy, must have disease progression since that treatment

          -  If treated with prior radiation therapy, disease must be outside of the radiation
             fields

          -  No currently active second malignancies unless it is a non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Women must be non-pregnant and non-lactating
