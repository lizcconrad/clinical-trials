      Background:

      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is characterized by regional myocardial damage which may
      lead to systolic and diastolic dysfunction with a subsequent risk of left ventricular (LV)
      remodeling, local and systemic neurohormonal activation, vascular dysfunction and development
      of heart failure. The pathophysiology and prognosis of LV systolic dysfunction after AMI has
      been the focus of research for several decades. Insights from these studies have led to
      several therapeutic interventions that improve outcome. In addition to depressed systolic
      function, clinical or radiographic evidence of heart failure is a consistent and powerful
      predictor of outcome in patients following AMI. Pulmonary congestion after AMI reflects
      raised LV filling pressures but is frequently seen after what appears to be only minor
      myocardial damage. The pathophysiological mechanism for this is incompletely understood but
      may involve impaired active relaxation of the myocardium and increased LV chamber stiffness,
      hence, abnormalities in diastolic function. Abnormal LV diastolic function especially when
      chamber stiffness is increased is characterized by a disproportionate increase in filling
      pressure during exercise and an inadequate increase of cardiac output. During ventricular
      diastole the left atrium acts as a conduit between the left ventricle and the pulmonary
      veins. Thus in case of increased filling pressures left atrial pressure is elevated exposing
      the pulmonary vascular bed to increased pressures. In accordance pulmonary artery pressure is
      frequently increased after AMI, even when systolic function is preserved.

      Several recent studies have demonstrated that Doppler echocardiographic indices suggestive of
      increased filling pressure and increased pulmonary arterial pressure are associated with
      excess mortality and morbidity after AMI . The optimal management of this large group of
      patients is unknown, but in theory lowered preload improved cardiac output especially during
      exercise and lowering of pulmonary arterial pressure could relive symptoms and improve
      exercise capacity.

      Sildenafil is a potent selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that suppresses degradation of
      cyclic GMP. In the pulmonary bed this leads to pulmonary vasodilation, in addition sildenafil
      has been shown to improve endothelium dependent vasodilation thus augmenting abnormal
      vascular tone . In patients with systolic heart failure sildenafil has been demonstrated to
      lower pulmonary wedge pressure, improve cardiac index and lower pulmonary arterial pressure
      without causing systemic hypotension . Thus in theory sildenafil may have beneficial effects
      in patients at high risk of heart failure.

      Hypothesis:

      In patients with Doppler echocardiographic signs of elevated LV filling pressures despite
      preserved LV systolic function after AMI treatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor
      sildenafil 40 mg three times daily for 9 weeks will compared with placebo

        1. Improve resting LV filling and cardiac hemodynamics.

        2. Improve exercise capacity.

        3. Improve filling pattern and cardiac hemodynamics during exercise.

           Study procedures

           In possibly eligible patients a screening echocardiography is performed during
           hospitalization at the coronary care unit 2144 or 3141 HS Rigshospitalet, Denmark. If
           eligible and consent is obtained during hospitalisation an ambulatory exercise Doppler
           echocardiography with simultaneous invasive recording of pulmonary wedge pressure,
           pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac index and a 6 min walk test and maximal exercise
           test is performed 1 week after revascularization. Patients are then randomized in a 1 to
           1 fashion to placebo or sildenafil 20 mg three times daily. If tolerated dosage is
           titrated every 2'nd week in the outpatient clinic to a target dose of 40 mg three times
           daily. After 9 weeks of treatment exercise echocardiography and 6 min walk test are
           repeated, in addition conventional maximal ergometer testing is performed.

           Screening echocardiography 2 dimensional echocardiographic will be obtained from the
           parasternal and apical windows. Pulsed Doppler measurements of mitral inflow will be
           obtained with the transducer in the apical four-chamber view, with a 1-2 mm Doppler
           sample volume placed between the tips of mitral leaflets during diastole. Tissue Doppler
           imagining of the mitral annulus will be obtained from the apical 4-chamber view with a
           1.5-mm sample volume placed at the medial mitral annulus. All Doppler echocardiographic
           examinations are done with horizontal sweep set to 100 mm/s. At least 3-5 cardiac cycles
           will be measured. LA volume will be obtained from the apical 4 and 2 chamber views with
           a zoomed image of the left atrium. Clinically indicted echocardiograms performed in the
           echolab may be used as screening echocardiograms.

             -  Wall motion index will semiquantitatively using a descending scoring as previously
                validated.

             -  Maximal left atrial volume will be measured at end-systole with the use of two
                orthogonal apical views.

             -  From the pulsed wave mitral inflow signal, peak E wave velocity will be measured.

             -  From the tissue Doppler assessment of the medial mitral annulus early (E')
                diastolic velocity will be recorded. Diastolic E/e' ratio will be calculated.

           Resting echocardiography Doppler echocardiography will be performed on a GE medical
           Vivid 7 ultrasound machine by a single investigator. Images will be obtained from the
           parasternal and apical windows. M-mode recordings will be done in the parasternal
           long-axis view. Pulsed Doppler measurements of mitral inflow will be obtained with the
           transducer in the apical four-chamber view, with a 1-2 mm Doppler sample volume placed
           between the tips of mitral leaflets during diastole. Tissue Doppler imagining of the
           mitral annulus will be obtained from the apical 4-chamber view with a 1.5-mm sample
           volume placed at the medial and lateral mitral annulus. All Doppler echocardiographic
           examinations are done with horizontal sweep set to 100 mm/s. At least 3-5 cardiac cycles
           will be measured. Finally color coded real time tissue Doppler images will be acquired
           in the apical windows, with the lowest possible depth and smallest angle.

             -  End-systolic, end-diastolic volume and ejection fraction will be calculated
                according to the Simpson modified biplane method.

             -  Wall motion index will semiquantitatively be assessed according to the
                recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography.

             -  Maximal left atrial volume will be measured at end-systole with the use of two
                orthogonal apical views with zoom of the left atrium.

             -  From the pulsed wave mitral inflow signal, peak E wave velocity, peak A wave
                velocity, and mitral E-wave deceleration time will be measured.

             -  From peak tricuspid regurgitant velocity and size of inferior v. cava pulmonary
                arterial systolic pressure will be estimated.

             -  From the tissue Doppler assessment of the medial mitral annulus early (E')
                diastolic velocity will be recorded. Diastolic E/e' ratio will be calculated.

             -  From color coded tissue Doppler images systolic longitudinal fibre shortening will
                be assessed using tissue tracking.

             -  From 2dimensional images speckle tracing will be performed to assess radial and
                longitudinal LV function.

           Exercise echocardiography Exercise echocardiography is performed at cardiac intensive
           care unit 2143. Before exercise a Swan Ganz catheter is introduced with a seldinger
           technique through the right jugular vein. Simultaneous with resting echocardiography
           pulmonary artery pressure, left atrial pressure, cardiac index and pulmonary wedge
           pressure is recorded. Patients are then exercised on a supine bicycle with increasing
           workload to 100W with increments of 25W every 2'nd min. At 100W echocardiography is
           repeated with simultaneous assessment of pulmonary artery pressure, left atrial
           pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure and cardiac index.

           Neurohormonal analyses Prior to surgery and at each follow-up visit venous blood samples
           will be drawn for analysis of plasma N-terminal proBNP, and of plasma N-terminal ANP
           concentrations. In addition plasma will be frozen at each visit for possible later
           analysis.

           Six minutes walk test A 6 min. walk test will be performed at baseline 9 weeks.

           Exercise test A conventional bicycle ergometer test is performed at hospital discharge
           and after 4 months. Maximal exercise is achieved by increments on 25W every 2'nd min.
           with continuous ECG recording and assessment of blood pressure every 2'nd min.

           Feasibility and sample size estimation From a recent study at a tertiary invasive centre
           including 380 patients with AMI, (Aberdeen AMI study, Hillis et al ESC 2006), it was
           found that among 219 patients EF was &gt;45%. Among those patients E/e' &gt;15 was found in 41
           patients, and in further 48 E/e' 8-15 and left atrial volume index &gt;32 ml/m2 was found.
           Thus 40% of patients with LVEF&gt;45% would be potentially eligible. Annually 2500 patients
           are admitted or transferred to RH with AMI.

           Based on a standard deviation of E/e' of 5 (estimated from potentially eligible patients
           from the Aberdeen AMI study), an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.80 a sample of 70 patients
           will allow detection of a difference in E/e' of 3.6. Sample size estimation is performed
           according to Altmann using nomogram.
