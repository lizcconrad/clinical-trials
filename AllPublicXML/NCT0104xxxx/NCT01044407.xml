      To evaluate whether cardiac output manipulation via a cardiac pacemaker can stabilise

      Many patients with heart failure exhibit a distinctive abnormal cyclical breathing pattern,
      'periodic breathing'. This means that patients have a worse prognosis and they have
      debilitating symptoms including breathlessness, fatigue and disrupted sleep. Many of these
      patients also have cardiac pacemakers fitted, to improve their heart function. We have
      discovered a new physiological mechanism linking the heart and lungs, and have shown that by
      changing the programmed settings of a cardiac pacemakers, we can change a patient's
      breathing. If we increase the programmed pacing heart rate, we increase the rate of delivery
      of carbon dioxide to the lungs temporarily, which increases ventilation. When we reduce the
      programmed pacing heart rate, the converse happens. We aim to demonstrate this phenomenon
      scientifically, and to use this information to stabilise periodic breathing in heart failure
      patients using pacemakers. We then plan to continue to investigate whether we can show that
      sleep quality is improved in heart failure patients with periodic breathing, by our pacing
      protocol.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with cardiac pacemakers implanted on standard clinical grounds, and either
             normal left ventricular systolic function (as assessed by echocardiogram) or impaired
             left ventricular systolic function and stable breathing patterns (as assessed by
             screening in outpatients' clinic).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of &gt;70 bpm will be excluded.

          -  Patients with implantable cardiac defibrillators with anti−tachycardia therapy set at
             an unusually low rate (&lt;120 bpm), because it would limit the ability to vary the heart
             rate during the experiment.

          -  Patients with significant respiratory disease (FEV1 &lt;50% predicted) will be excluded,
             as will patients with any condition that who have any condition precluding them from
             lying comfortably on a bed for 90 minutes.

          -  Patients who have had a recent deterioration in condition i.e. admission in previous
             six weeks, those in a brittle condition and those who have end−stage renal failure
             requiring haemodialysis.
