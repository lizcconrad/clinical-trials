  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to determine the effects of exercise training on quality
      of life and physical capacity, 3 months and 1 year after radical operation for pulmonary
      cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are radically operated for pulmonary cancer report suffering from respiratory
      problems, mostly dyspnoea, 5 years after operation. Dyspnoea restricts their physical
      capability and leads to poorer physical, social and mental wellbeing. The effects of training
      programs on physical and mental wellbeing for cancer patients are well documented. Most of
      the studies are though performed on patients suffering from breast, colon and prostate
      cancer. There are only few studies addressing patients with pulmonary cancer. They are mostly
      focused on short term effects of exercise training on quality of life, with no control group
      included in the trials. These studies target patients after different forms for treatment,
      including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. There is no data referring to quality of life
      of patients who are radically operated for pulmonary cancer.

      Comparison: multidisciplinary group intervention consisting of exercise training and dyspnoea
      counseling, 10 times, once a week, compared with one instruction in exercise training and
      dyspnoea counseling. Exercise training is given by a physiotherapist. Both groups receive in
      addition standard treatment, which is up to 3 counseling sessions with a nurse.
