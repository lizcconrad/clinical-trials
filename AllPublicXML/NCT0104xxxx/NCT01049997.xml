  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe patients, 75 years old or older, with Non ST
      Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) especially regarding the following variables:
      cardiovascular risk, co-morbidity and frailty. The investigators hypothesize that the degree
      of frailty influences the benefit from coronary angiography and the possible invasive
      treatment which can follow.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term frailty denotes a multi-dimensional syndrome characterized by increased
      vulnerability and decreased physiologic reserves. Frailty stratification predicts a patient's
      risk of death and need for institutional care. The construct is well validated, but there is
      not one single accepted operational definition. The CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a
      7-point scale relying on clinical judgement. It is a global clinical measure of biological
      age, and it mixes co-morbidity, disability and cognitive impairment.Though frailty
      instruments so far mainly have been used in a geriatric context, it has been pointed out as
      relevant for cardiologic patients as well, e.g. regarding risk stratification for elderly
      patients with NSTEMI. The purpose of this study is to describe patients, 75 years old or
      older, with Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) especially regarding the
      following variables: cardiovascular risk, co-morbidity and frailty. The investigators
      hypothesize that the degree of frailty influences the benefit from coronary angiography and
      the possible invasive treatment which can follow.
