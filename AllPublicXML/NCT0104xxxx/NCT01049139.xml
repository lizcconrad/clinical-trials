  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will carry out a preliminary &quot;proof of concept&quot; to evaluate two types of
      supplemental information that would serve as an adjunct to the traditional informed consent
      in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) vaccine clinical trial. These will be compared to the
      condition where the traditional informed consent form is used alone.

      Using four intervention sites, participants will be administered a standard HIV vaccine trial
      consent form. They will then be randomized into three conditions: 1) No supplemental
      information; 2) Supplemental information with 1-sided messages (emphasizes information
      content related to vaccine trial randomization and unproven efficacy of vaccine); and 3)
      Supplemental information with 2-sided messages (acknowledges the beliefs that are at odds
      with the information content and seeks to neutralize those beliefs through counter-argument).
      An interviewer-administered questionnaire (IAQ) Part 1 will be administered before the
      traditional HIV vaccine trial informed consent is reviewed with the participant. An IAQ Part
      2 will be administered directly after the HIV vaccine trial informed consent in the control
      condition or after reading through the supplemental material. Debriefing interviews will be
      conducted with selected participants to review their understanding of the study procedures
      and their reactions to the supplemental materials and/or questionnaires.

      The proposed research is a &quot;proof of concept&quot; study and is therefore not designed to test
      hypotheses. Consequently, formal hypothesis and related power calculations to detect certain
      effect sizes are not required. Instead, the goal will be to enroll an appropriate number of
      subjects for purpose of determining the feasibility of developing a larger study of
      supplemental information to be used as an adjunct to the informed consent statement in HIV
      vaccine clinical trials and providing related descriptive statistics.
