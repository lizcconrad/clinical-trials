      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of
      capecitabine + bevacizumab concomitantly with radiotherapy versus capecitabine concomitantly
      with radiotherapy, as neoadjuvant treatment for patients with localized and resectable rectal
      cancer.
