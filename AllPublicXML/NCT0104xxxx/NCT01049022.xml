  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in children to
      see what the best dose should be for children in the future. Pharmacokinetics is to see how
      the body absorbs, distributes, breaks down and gets rid of the study drug. The
      pharmacokinetics of certain drugs may be altered in children due to developmental differences
      in various organ functions responsible for drug elimination, as well as in general
      distribution characteristics. The safety of moxifloxacin in children with infections will
      also be looked at. Results from this study will be used to guide dosing strategies of the
      larger clinical trial planned for children

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Findings on Joint Assessment: Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Joint assessment included formal physical examination of all joints with special care and attention to the weight-bearing joints (such as, knees, hips, and ankles) and to the shoulder girdle. All joints were examined for pain/tenderness, evidence of inflammation (i.e., redness, warmth, deformity, swelling or ballotable fluid), loss of function (to the extent this could be assessed in younger children and infants), and any restrictions to expected active/passive range of motion. An incidence count was reported as the number of subjects with at least one finding at baseline, regardless of side.</description>
