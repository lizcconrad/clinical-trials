    <textblock>
      Patient Population: Patients with active myeloma (Stage II/III) that have completed induction
      therapy and are eligible for an autologous stem cell transplant.

      Number of Patients: Will treat a total of 32 evaluable patients in a 1:1 randomization of
      aMILs vs aMILs plus vaccine. An evaluable patient is defined as one which has received the
      activated MILs and is at least 6 months post-transplant.

      Study Objectives:

      Disease response as determined by the Blade' criteria will be the primary endpoint of the
      trial at one year.

      Additional study endpoints include progression free survival, parameters of T cell
      reconstitution, anti-tumor immune responses as well as the effect on osteoclastogenesis and
      clonogenic myeloma precursor cells.
