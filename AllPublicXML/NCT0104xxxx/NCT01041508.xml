  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stem cell transplant is an important therapeutic option for pediatric patients with relapsed
      or refractory leukemia. Although, full myeloablative transplants are widely used for patients
      with acute leukemia, myeloablative chemo-radiotherapy may not be feasible in some specific
      settings. These settings include 1) patients with pre-existing health issues and organ
      toxicities; 2) patients who have relapsed post-ablative transplant and need a second stem
      cell transplant; and 3) leukemia patients with advanced disease who have been heavily
      pre-treated. Clofarabine, a new purine nucleoside anti-metabolite, has the advantage of
      significant antileukemic activity in addition to its possible immuno-suppressive properties.
      In this study we plan to determine the maximum feasible dose (MFD) of Clofarabine in
      combination with total body irradiation that can achieve durable donor engraftment without
      causing excessive toxicity.

             dysfunction or disease involving the heart, kidney (including dialysis patients),
             liver, or other organ system that may place the patient at undue risk to undergo
             treatment.

          -  Patients with a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection not controlled
             (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without
             improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment).

          -  Any significant concurrent disease, illness, psychiatric disorder or social issue that
             would compromise patient safety or compliance, study participation, follow up, or
             interpretation of study results.
