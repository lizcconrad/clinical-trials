      Purpose:

      This randomized phase II trial evaluated whether the combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel
      plus All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) increases Response rate (RR) and Progression-free
      survival (PFS) in patients with advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an
      acceptable toxicity profile and its association with the expression of Retinoic acid receptor
      beta 2 (RAR-beta2) as a response biomarker.

      Patients and Methods:

      Patients with stage IIIB and IV NSCLC were included to receive Paclitaxel and Cisplatin (PC).
      Patients were randomized to receive ATRA 20 mg/m2/day (RA/PC) or placebo (P/PC) 1 week prior
      to treatment until completing two cycles. RAR-beta2 expression was analyzed by
      Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RT-PCR in tumor and adjacent lung tissue.
