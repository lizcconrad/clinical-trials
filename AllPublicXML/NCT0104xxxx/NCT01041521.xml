  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study seeks to determine if the use of omega three fatty acids in individuals infected
      with HIV and with high triglycerides leads to improved triglyceride levels, better blood
      vessel function and decrease in the amount of obstruction in blood vessels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While omega-three fatty acids have been shown to be beneficial for TG and HDL-C levels in HIV
      uninfected individuals and in some small, short duration studies in HIV-infected individuals,
      there are no data that extend these observations to determine whether intake of omega-three
      fats over a more prolonged time period will also have a beneficial impact on functional
      outcomes such as vascular endothelial function and anatomic surrogate markers of CVD in
      HIV-infected patients.

      We propose a randomized, double blind trial of purified omega-three fatty acids in
      HIV-infected individuals with elevated levels of triglycerides. While the impact of
      omega-three fatty acids on lipid profiles should be evident early (within 12 weeks); we
      propose to conduct this trial for a full 24 months to test our overall hypothesis that this
      intervention will not only improve triglyceride and HDL-C levels, improve HDL-subpopulations,
      plasma and membrane phospholipids and decrease inflammation, but will also improve brachial
      artery reactivity testing (BART) as a measure of vascular endothelial function at 24 weeks
      and 24 months and arterial stiffness measured by a pulse wave velocity test as a surrogate
      marker of CVD risk at 24 months when compared to controls.

      The specific aims of this proposal include:

        1. To conduct a randomized, placebo controlled trial of omega-three fatty acids over 24
           months in HIV-infected individuals with elevated levels of triglycerides (&gt; 150 mg/dl).

        2. To demonstrate the impact of omega-three fatty acid intake on TG levels and on HDL-C
           levels, HDL subpopulations, composition of plasma and membrane phospholipids, and
           chronic inflammation as measured by CRP, sPLA2 and by levels of arachidonic acid.

        3. To demonstrate the impact of omega-three fatty acid intake on BART at 24 weeks and 24
           months and on arterial stiffness at 24 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-infected men and women at least 18 years of age,

          -  On stable HAART for the previous two months and without anticipated changes in their
             HAART regimen throughout the duration of the study,

          -  Fasting triglycerides &gt; 150 mg/dl and &lt; 2,500 mg/dl

          -  Participants may be on lipid lowering therapy; if on lipid lowering therapy, therapy
             must be stable for 8 weeks and cannot be changed during the course of the study.

          -  Participants may be on beta blockers (e.g., Atenolol, Metoprolol, Propranolol), and
             Estrogens (e.g., Estinyl; Estrace; Estraderm), however therapy with these agents must
             be stable for 8 weeks before starting the study and cannot be altered while on study
             unless deemed medically necessary by the participant's medical provider and approved
             by Dr. Wanke.
