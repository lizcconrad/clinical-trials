  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we are going to investigate quantitative and qualitative natures of appetite
      and eating-behavior changes induced by atypical antipsychotics, i.e., risperidone, olanzapine
      and aripiprazole, in schizophrenia patients.

      This is an observational study. 2 Self-report questionnaires assessing changes of appetite
      and eating behaviors after medication are applied to patients who have been receiving one of
      the three atypical antipsychotics. We are going to compare changes of appetite and eating
      behaviors after medication between three atypical antipsychotics and investigate the
      association between changes of appetite and eating behaviors and changes of weight after
      medication.
