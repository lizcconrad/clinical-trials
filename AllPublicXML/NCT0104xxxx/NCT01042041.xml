      RATIONALE: Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth or by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the
      blood flow to the tumor and keeping chemotherapy drugs near the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying side effects and best dose of sorafenib tosylate when
      given together with chemoembolization in treating patients with unresectable liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity and safety of integrating sorafenib with chemoembolization for
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To observe the imaging response (AASLD/EASL modification of RECIST) and time to
      progression following chemoembolization in conjunction with sorafenib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily. Beginning 2 weeks later, patients
      undergo chemoembolization with cisplatin, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and mitomycin C.

      Chemoembolizaton repeats once a month for up to 4 procedures in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months.
