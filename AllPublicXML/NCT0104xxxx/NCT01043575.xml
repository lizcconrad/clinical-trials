  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize rifapentine drug levels in patients
      with TB in relationship to its effectiveness in treating TB and any adverse effects
      experienced by participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-period, non-blinded, multi-center pharmacokinetic substudy of rifapentine and
      rifampin in patients with tuberculosis enrolled in Tuberculosis Trials Consortium (TBTC)
      Study 29. This PK substudy will use a convenience sample, i.e. be restricted to TBTC sites
      having logistical capacity for intensive pharmacokinetic sampling. These sites will have
      non-random selection of patients. In addition to the intensive sampling of 60 patients in
      this PK study, all patients receiving rifapentine in Study 29 will be eligible for sparse PK
      sampling as part of the parent treatment protocol.
