      Prospective, multicenter, uncontrolled cohort study to analyze the efficacy of a risk adapted
      treatment strategy, including gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) during consolidation, for patients
      with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      Patients will be stratified according to age in a first step, with a cut-point of 65 years
      old. For patients younger than 65 years old who achieve complete response, a second
      stratification will be made before first consolidation treatment. This second stratification
      will be performed according to the follow parameters: MDR at the end of induction, karyotype
      and molecular findings, including FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and NPM1 mutations.
      The following groups can be identified according to these parameters:

      Group A:

      Patients aged 65 or younger who are candidates for intensive chemotherapy.

      Group A1:

      Patients who are in first CR with negative MRD (less than 0.1%), good prognosis karyotype
      and, in the case of t(8;21) or inv(16), absence of mutations in the exon 17 of c-kit.

      Group A2:

      Patients who are in first CR with negative MRD (less than 0.1%), intermediate-risk karyotype,
      NPM1 positive and FLT3 negative.

      Group A3:

      Patients who are in first CR with negative MRD (less than 0.1%), intermediate-risk karyotype,
      absence of NPM1 mutations and who are negative for FLT3-ITD or FLT3-ITD positive with a ratio
      less than 0.8, regardless NPM1 status.

      Group A4:

      Patients who are in first CR with positive MRD (greater than 0.1%), t(8;21) or inv(16) with
      mutations in the exon 17 of c-kit, intermediate risk karyotype with positive FLT3-ITD and
      ratio greater or equal to 0.8 or high-risk karyotype.

      Group B:

      Patients over 65 years who are able to receive intensive chemotherapy.

      TREATMENT SCHEDULE:

      Treatment is tailored for each of the previously defined groups:

      Group A:

      Induction with Idarubicin and ARA-C in &quot;3 +7&quot; schedule (IDA 12 mg/m2 x 3 days and ARA-C 200
      mg/m2 x 7 days).

      Group A1:

      Two consolidation cycles with ARA-C at a dose of 3 g/m2 on days 1, 3 and 5. Collection of
      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) after the first consolidation. Autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT) with Busulphan 1 mg/kg/6 VO or 0,8 mg/kg/6 h IV (Busilvex®) from day
      -8 to -5; Etoposide 20 mg/kg/d from day -4 to -3 and ARA-C 3 g/m2/12 h from on days -3 and -2
      (see criteria for HiDAC modification); and G-CSF 10 µg/kg/d from day -9 to -2 (BEA schedule).
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is not recommended in first CR
      in this group of patients.

      Group A2:

      First consolidation with Idarubicin and ARA-C at the same dose than induction plus GO 3 mg/m2
      at day 1. Collection of PBSC after first consolidation. Second consolidation with ARA-C 3
      g/m2 on days 1, 3 and 5 followed by ASCT with BEA conditioning. It is not recommended to
      perform Allo-HSCT, especially from alternative donors, in first CR.

      Group A3:

      First consolidation with Ida and ARA-C at the same dose than induction plus GO 3 mg/m2 at day
      1. Collection of PBSC after first consolidation. Second consolidation with ARA-C 3 g/m2 on
      days 1, 3 and 5 followed by ASCT with BEA schedule if no HLA-identical sibling is available.
      Patients in this group are candidates for allo-HSCT in first CR if HLA-identical sibling is
      available. Allo-HSCT will be performed after first consolidation.

      Group A4:

      First consolidation with Ida and ARA-C at the same dose than induction plus GO 3 mg/m2 at day
      1. Collection of PBSC after first consolidation. Second consolidation with ARA-C 3 g/m2 on
      days 1, 3 and 5 followed by ASCT with BEA schedule if no donor is available. Patients in this
      group are candidates for allo-HSCT in first CR, including alternative donors. Allo-HSCT will
      be performed after first consolidation or later if no donor is available at this time.

      Group C:

      Induction with Idarubicin and ARA-C &quot;2 + 5&quot; (IDA 12 mg/m2 x 2 days and ARA-C 200 mg/m2 x 5
      days). Two consolidations with GO 3 mg/m2 day 1 and ARA-C 100 mg/m2 continuous infusion days
      1 to 5.

      AML CHARACTERIZATION AND SAMPLES COLLECTION:

      To achieve a complete characterization of AML, inmunophenotype analysis (defining the pattern
      for MRD studies), cytogenetics, FISH for inv(16), t(8;21) and t(15;17), and molecular study
      for AML1/ETO, CBFβ/MYH11, NPM1 and FLT3-ITD will be performed in all cases. For FLT3-ITD, the
      ratio between the mutated and not mutated allele will be calculated.

      During the phase of samples collection, DNA, RNA and viable cells will be stored.

          4. LVEF &gt; 40 % measured by means of echocardiography.

          5. If background of respiratory disease (not related to the AML), risk factors or
             clinical criteria for COPD, the values of functional tests, including DLCO, should be
             greater than 50% of the expected.

          6. Bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and ALT &lt; of 3 fold the upper normal value, providing
             that it is not due to the disease that motivates the treatment (AML).

          7. Serum creatinine &lt; 2,5 mg/dL providing that it is not due to the disease that
             motivates the treatment (AML).

          8. In fertile aged women, negative pregnancy test and use of contraception methods are
             required.

        Any patient who does not meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria for treatment with
        intensive chemotherapy can be evaluated individually when considering that could still
        obtain benefit from this treatment considering that could still obtain benefit from this
        treatment.

        Criteria for GO administration in patient candidates for intensive chemotherapy
