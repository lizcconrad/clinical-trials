  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify cardiac patients' degree of unappreciated mild
      impairment in cognitive function patterns of cognitive function, and influencing factors
      related to cognitive functioning during hospitalization. The results from the study will
      contribute to tailoring the delivery of patient education to optimize patient understanding
      of information in future clinical practice.

      It is hypothesized that the study will demonstrate the following:

        1. The degree of cognitive function for patients hospitalized in a CICU will be below the
           scores for normal functioning adults.

        2. Patients with acute cardiovascular conditions will score differently in cognitive
           functioning at various times throughout their hospitalization.

        3. Relationships between cognitive function and following variables:

             -  Patients with greater sleep deprivation or fatigue will exhibit lower cognitive
                functioning.

             -  Patients with greater hunger will exhibit lower cognitive functioning.

             -  Patients who are experiencing greater anxiety will exhibit lower cognitive
                functioning.

             -  Patients who are experiencing depression will exhibit lower cognitive functioning.

             -  Patients who have undergone or will undergo shortly treatment or procedures will
                exhibit lower cognitive functioning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Admission to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unite for acute cardiological issues during
             time of enrollment.

          -  Patients with NYHA class I, II, III, and IV.

          -  18 years or older and must be awake and conversant at time of enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of neurological disorder or injury (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, dementia,
             stroke, seizures).

          -  Moderate or severe head injury (defined as &gt; 24 hours loss of consciousness)

          -  Past or current history of severe psychiatric illness. Specifically, psychotic
             disorders (e.g., schizophrenia) and bipolar disorder. Potential participants will not
             be excluded on the basis of managed depression or anxiety disorder. These conditions
             are common in cardiac patients and their exclusion may limit the generalizability of
             findings.

          -  5 years past or current history of alcohol or drug abuse (defined by DSM-IV criteria).

          -  History of learning disorder or developmental disability (defined by DSM-IV criteria).

          -  Renal failure requiring dialysis.

          -  History of sleep apnea (defined through previous sleep studies).

          -  Severely ill individuals, including those who are sedated, on a ventilator, exhibiting
             acute hemodynamic changes, and/or those deemed inappropriate by patient's physician to
             participate in study.
