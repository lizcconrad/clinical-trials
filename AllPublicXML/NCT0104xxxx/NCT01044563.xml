    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To develop a breathing training protocol specifically designed to improve HRV and
           psychosocial functioning for postmenopausal women with depressive symptoms,

        2. To examine the immediate effects of an 8-week breathing training program on HRV and
           psychosocial end points in postmenopausal women with depressive symptoms,

        3. To examine the intermediate-term effects of an 8-week breathing training program on HRV
           and psychosocial end points in postmenopausal women with depressive symptoms, and

        4. To determine whether the change in depressive symptoms with breathing training in
           postmenopausal women is associated with the change in HRV.

    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women without hormone replacement therapy are associated with higher risk of
      cardiac morbidity and mortality. They are likely to experience depressive symptoms after
      menopause, and the comorbidity of depression are related to altered autonomic function. We
      expect that postmenopausal women with depressive symptoms who receive breathing training will
      demonstrate decreased depressive symptoms and increased heart rate variability immediately
      upon and later after completion of training, and optimally contributing to improve autonomic
      nervous regulation in their later life to prevent undesired cardiac outcomes.
