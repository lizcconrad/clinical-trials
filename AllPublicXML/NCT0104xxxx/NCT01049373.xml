  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate superiority of HDC in comparison to placebo in the treatment of chronic low-back
      pain in relation to pain, functional impairment, quality of life, and state of health during
      a 15-week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low-back pain is often provoked by inflammatory edema in the region of the facet joints. In
      naturopathy, a fixed homeopathic drug combination (HDC) is established in the treatment of
      edema and swellings. For the first time, the efficacy of HDC was investigated in the
      treatment of low-back pain.

      Objective: To examine the efficacy and safety of HDC medication vs. placebo in the treatment
      of chronic low back pain considering constitution and diathesism in a double-blind,
      randomized controlled clinical trial.
