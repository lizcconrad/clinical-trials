  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4-year study will investigate the effectiveness of methylphenidate for initiating and
      sustaining abstinence in methamphetamine dependent individuals. Approximately 90 participants
      seeking treatment for methamphetamine dependence will be enrolled in the study for an initial
      2 weeks to establish clinic compliance. During this compliance phase, participants will
      receive incentives for clinic attendance. After meeting clinic attendance requirements,
      participants will be randomized to placebo (n = 45) or active study medication (n = 45)
      conditions, and given 18mg/daily of study drug or placebo for one week, followed by
      36mg/daily study drug/placebo for a second week. Finally, participants will be stabilized on
      54mg/daily study drug/placebo for the remainder of the study. Placebo participants will be
      given placebo medications prepared to appear identical to the active medication. In addition,
      after randomization, all participants will receive motivational incentives for
      methamphetamine-negative urine tests and begin weekly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      provided for the duration of the study.

          2. Be between 18-55 years of age;

          3. Meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for MA dependence as assessed by the Mini International
             Neuropsychological Interview (MINI);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have any history or evidence suggestive of seizures or brain injury;

          2. Have any known hypersensitivity or previous medically adverse reaction to
             methylphenidate;

             medical history or physical examination, including pre-existing heart failure, recent
             myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm
