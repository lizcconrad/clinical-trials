      The goal of this research is to find out possible susceptible gene(s) in schizophrenic
      patients with family history and 5-year period functional changes of brain among the members
      of family, in order to further analysis factors and their interactions.

      Schizophrenia is a serious mental disease, highly family inheritable inclination. By means of
      traditional psychiatry diagnosis, genetics and long term brain change researches will help to
      unveil the secret of schizophrenia and other factors. The advantage of comparative gene
      hybridization is that chromosome copy number alterations can be detected; this technique has
      been widely applied in many researches, such as cancer, mental retardation screening and
      autism. As we known, we are the first one use this technique in chromosome abnormality
      research for family history schizophrenic patient, this study also is the first one to track
      the relationship of long term brain function alteration and chromosome abnormality in Taiwan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1.Psychiatry doctor diagnosed who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
        Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for schizophrenia or
        schizoaffective disorder, family history, age older than 15 will be recruited for
        participation in this study. Participants agree and sign informed consent forms will
        eligible to participate this experiment.

        2.10-20c.c blood will be drawn from the participants. 3.Participants need to understand
        procedures and assays of this experiment. 4.At least one psychiatry doctor interview
        needed, participants and their family voluntarily join this interview, approximately
        30-45min.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant can not understand procedures and assays of this experiment.

          2. Participant has another major mental disease other than the inclusion criteria.

          3. Participant has material abuse history, it could seriously influence diagnosis.

          4. Participant has combination diseases, it could seriously influence diagnosis.

          5. Psychopathy or psychosis can not be categorized in defined group.

        Other considerations:

          1. Participants, age fewer than 20 needs to their deputy guardians (parents) and their
             own consent altogether.
