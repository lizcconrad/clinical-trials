      The aim of our study is to see if people with metabolic syndrome who attend a group education
      programme based on lifestyle changes (dietary and increased physical activity) can lessen
      their risk of having diabetes, heart disease and strokes in the future.

      People who have a combination of risk factors termed metabolic syndrome are at increased risk
      of developing diabetes, heart disease and strokes. Metabolic syndrome is a major public
      health concern requiring urgent action because 25% of the adult UK population fulfil the
      criteria, and this will increase as people continue to be less active and levels of
      overweight and obesity rise.

      The aim of our study is to see if people with metabolic syndrome who attend a structured
      group education programme based on lifestyle changes (dietary and increased physical
      activity) can lessen their risk of having diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the future.
      Overall, we hope to show that this type of education reduces the number of people who have
      metabolic syndrome.

      Subjects recruited with metabolic syndrome will be randomised to intervention or control
      arms. The intervention arm will receive group education and the control group will receive
      routine care.

      The results will inform primary prevention strategies in people from varied ethnic
      backgrounds who are at high risk of developing type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

          -  Previous diagnosis of T2DM, CVD (stroke/cerebrovascular accident, transient ischaemic
             attack), peripheral arterial disease, or coronary heart disease (angina, myocardial
             infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, angioplasty)

          -  Life-limiting terminal illness

             made appropriate for ethnically diverse populations, but individuals who are unable to
             understand, speak and read English will be excluded at this stage. However, if the
             self-management programme is found to be successful we would adapt it for non-English
             speakers.)
