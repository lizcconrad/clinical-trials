  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy, paclitaxel, and carboplatin work in
      treating patients with high-risk endometrial cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x
      rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by
      stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Giving radiation therapy with
      chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival. II. To assess and document location of disease
      recurrence (distant vs local vs both) using this treatment regimen.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity of radiation therapy &quot;sandwiched&quot; between cycles of
      paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy in patients with high-risk endometrial cancer.

      III. To evaluate the associations of cancer recurrence with tumor tissue expression levels of
      insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-II, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1
      (IGFBP-1) and -3, insulin receptor, IGF-I receptor, estrogen receptor, and progesterone
      receptor.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMOTHERAPY (weeks 1-9, 13-21): Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours
      and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses
      during weeks 1-9 and 3 courses during weeks 13-21.

      RADIATION THERAPY (weeks 8-13 or 8-15): Patients with stage I disease undergo high dose rate
      (HDR) brachytherapy once weekly for a total of 5 fractions during weeks 8-13. All other
      patients undergo external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a week for a
      total of 25 fractions during weeks 8-12 and HDR brachytherapy once weekly for a total of 3
      fractions during weeks 13-15.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
