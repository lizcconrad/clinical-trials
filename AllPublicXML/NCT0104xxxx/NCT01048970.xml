  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: A frequent manifestation of advanced lung cancer is malnutrition, timely
      identification and treatment of which can lead to improved patient quality of life, response
      rate to chemotherapy and survival. N-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
      and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may possess anticachectic properties. This trial compared a
      protein and energy dense supplement enriched with n-3 fatty acids with nutritional assessment
      for their effects on weight, lean body mass (LBM), body fat, phase angle, dietary intake,
      inflammatory response and quality of life in first-line chemotherapy patients with advanced
      lung cancer.

      Methods: Chemonaive patients with stages IIIB and IV of lung cancer are going to receive
      Paclitaxel and Cisplatin. Patients will be randomized to receive two cans/day of EPA and DHA
      containing oral supplement or nutritional assessment one week prior to treatment until
      completing two cycles. Serum levels of Reactive C Protein (RCP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
      tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are going to be measured baseline and after two
      courses of chemotherapy. Phase angle and body composition will be measured using Bioimpedance
      analysis (BIA). Quality of life, dietary intake will be assessed with validate
      questionnaires. All data is going to be collected in a database for further blind analysis.
      Written informed consent will be collected from all patients.

      inflammatory response and quality of life in first-line chemotherapy patients with advanced
      lung cancer.

      Hypothesis: Lung cancer patients who received EPA and DHA containing oral supplement will
      have a lower frequency of weight loss, rate of adverse effects to chemotherapy and
      inflammatory response, improving quality of life, response rate to chemotherapy compared with
      patients who received nutritional assessment.

      Methods: Chemonaive patients with stages IIIB and IV of lung cancer are going to receive
      Paclitaxel and Cisplatin. Patients will be randomized to receive two cans/day of EPA and DHA
      containing oral supplement or nutritional assessment one week prior to treatment until
