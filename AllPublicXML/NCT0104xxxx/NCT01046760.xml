  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rolandic Epilepsy is the most common form of childhood epilepsy. It is classified as
      idiopathic, age-related epilepsy syndrome with benign evolution. The absence of
      neuropsychological impairment is part of the criteria of benignity of this epilepsy syndrome.
      However recently have been suggested several deficits related to attention and language. The
      purpose of this study was assess school performance and to investigate problems of praxis in
      patients with rolandic epilepsy as compared to a control group composed of normal children
      with age, gender and educational level equivalents.

      Method: Nineteen patients aged between 7 and 12 years underwent clinical neurological
      evaluation, psychological assessment, through Weschsler Scales of Intelligence and language
      evaluation, to assess the academic performance and research of the presence or absence of
      praxis difficulties.
