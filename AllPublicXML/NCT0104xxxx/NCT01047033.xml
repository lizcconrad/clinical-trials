      clients of a microcredit organization in Peru will improve health outcomes among clients and
      their children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasingly popular scheme for poverty alleviation is microcredit, the awarding of small
      loans to individuals too poor or too remote to take advantage of traditional lending
      services. Studies have repeatedly shown that income is one of the factors strongly associated
      with physical and mental wellbeing. Yet economic growth alone doesn't necessarily lead to
      healthier families, especially if basic health knowledge or health services are absent in the
      community. Microcredit institutions have recently tried to address this issue by
      supplementing banking-only microcredit programs with programs that include &quot;tie-ins&quot; or
      &quot;add-ons&quot; such as health education or health services. A rigorous evaluation of such
      &quot;banking-plus&quot; endeavors has not yet been conducted, leaving a gap in the knowledge base
      regarding whether these organizations are meeting their stated goals in catering to both
      economic and social needs. This study attempts to address this research question using a
      randomized controlled trial of a health education intervention to clients of a microcredit
      organization in Peru.
