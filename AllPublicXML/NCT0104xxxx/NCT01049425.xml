  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned trial compares an anthracycline-free taxane based regimen versus a modern third
      generation (anthracycline/taxane-based) regimen in HER2/neu non-over expressing tumors. The
      aim is to define a further anthracycline-free standard and to spare anthracycline toxicity to
      a patient, who will only have a modest benefit from this compound. Prior to randomization for
      chemotherapy for all patients with HR positive disease OncotypeDXÂ® will be performed to
      identify patients who should not receive chemotherapy.

      Secondary objectives of this trial will be to compare overall survival and toxicity between
      the two chemotherapy arms, to evaluate survival in the observation arm and to perform
      translational research regarding prognostic and predictive factors.
