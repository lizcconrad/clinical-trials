      This study will examine the effects of atorvastatin, a statin (drug that lowers cholesterol)
      on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). If not treated, HIV infection causes an incurable,
      progressive deficiency in the immune system that leads to death, usually from disease that
      takes advantage of weakened immunity. However, previous studies have suggested that if the
      amount of cholesterol in infected cells is reduced, multiplication of HIV is also reduced. In
      this study, researchers will examine the HIV viral loads, that is, amount of the virus in the
      blood. They will evaluate the composition of the strain of the virus that patients carry (HIV
      genotype), response of the immune system to the virus, and how genes may determine the way in
      which the drug may or may not work against the strain of virus. Researchers plan to enroll 22
      participants, anticipating a study to last 30 weeks for each participant.

      Patients ages 18 or older with HIV infection, who are not pregnant or breastfeeding, who do
      not have a known allergy to atorvastatin use, and who have not had a serious illness or
      infection that required hospitalization within the 30 days before entering the study may be
      eligible for this study. They will be assigned to random groups: one that to receive
      atorvastatin and the other to receive a placebo, which has no effect on cholesterol or
      ability of the HIV infection to multiply. Patients will remain in their groups and treatments
      for 8 weeks. At the completion of 8 weeks, no matter the study group, all patients will be
      required to discontinue all study-related medications for 4 weeks. After that period, the
      study assignments will be switched, so that those previously taking the placebo will take
      atorvastatin, and vice versa. The study will proceed for another 8 weeks, followed by a
      period of stopping study-related medications and patients being observed for 4 weeks.
      Throughout the study, patients will have regularly scheduled visits at the clinic. At those
      visits there will be collection of blood samples, assessments of symptoms, physical
      examinations, and questionnaires to complete. Blood tests may require fasting beforehand, and
      blood samples will be used in standard tests, including those regarding the liver, kidneys,
      muscles, blood cells, and pregnancy status. Specialized blood tests will determine viral
      load, effects of the drug on the immune cells, and genetic influence on the drug's
      effectiveness. The time spent for procedures during clinic visits...

      This protocol is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial designed to study the
      effects of the lipid lowering statin, atorvastatin on HIV-1 viremia.

      Untreated HIV-1 infection results in an incurable, progressive immunodeficiency and death,
      usually from opportunistic infections. Combination antiretroviral therapy (ARV) has been
      successful in suppressing HIV replication and reducing morbidity and mortality. Long term ARV
      therapy is associated with the development of HIV-1 drug resistance, and significant adverse
      side effects including metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Prolonged therapy with
      certain antiretrovirals is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and a
      number of dyslipidemic syndromes, including increased levels of cholesterol, LDL, and
      triglycerides in peripheral blood. New therapeutic strategies to suppress HIV-1 infection are
      essential.

      Previously, in vitro studies suggested that exposure to cholesterol-lowering statins results
      in decreases in HIV-1 replication. The mechanisms of inhibition remain uncertain, but
      possibilities include disrupting membrane trafficking or cytoskeletal processes necessary for
      intracellular transport of viral proteins, or altering cellular activation state necessary
      for viral gene expression. Initial in vivo studies of the effects of statins on HIV-1 have
      been largely anecdotal in nature and have yielded conflicting results. Although statin
      therapy is commonly used in HIV-1 infection, adverse effects from the combination of
      antiretrovirals and statins are possible. A more thorough understanding of the effects of
      statins on HIV-1 replication is essential to determine the potential therapeutic effect and
      to investigate the risks and benefits of this approach in vivo.

      We plan to conduct a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial, with a cross over
      design, to study the effects of atorvastatin in 22 HIV-infected patients not currently taking
      antiretroviral therapy. Patients will be randomized to receive either placebo or atorvastatin
      80mg for 8 weeks. After a 4-week wash out period patients on the atorvastatin arm will
      crossover to placebo and, vice versa patients in the placebo arm will cross over to
      atorvastatin for an additional 8 weeks. Upon completion of study medications all patients
      will be followed for 4 weeks. Each arm will have a minimum of 11 patients each. The primary
      outcome measure in this study is the effect of lipid lowering agents on HIV-1 RNA levels;
      additional secondary outcome measures include effects of lipid lowering agents on lipid
      profile, markers of inflammation and immune activation and investigations of host and viral
      genetic factors.
