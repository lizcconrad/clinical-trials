  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of bosentan therapy (in a study known as
      ASSET) for patients who have high blood pressure in the lungs associated with sickle cell
      disease. That form of hypertension places people at risk for complications, including
      shortness of breath, pain, pneumonia, and death. Previous studies have shown that bosentan
      can be helpful in reducing pulmonary hypertension.

      Patients ages 16 and older who have completed the 16-week treatment in the ASSET 1 or ASSET 2
      study and who are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be eligible for this study. The research
      will be conducted in about 25 hospitals in the United States and Europe. Up to 30
      participants will be enrolled. The screening visit will involve a physical examination, blood
      sample of about 3 teaspoons for laboratory tests, and a pregnancy test. Patients' doctors
      will give them bosentan tablets (62.5 mg each), to take one in the morning and one in the
      evening. After 1 month, patients will be told whether the dose should be increased to 125 mg
      tablets to take twice a day. Two weeks after the increase in dose, a blood test will be done
      to analyze the drug's effects on the liver. After the start of treatment, patients will
      return for visits every 6 months, when there will be a 6-minute walking test to measure
      exercise capacity and evaluate shortness of breath. There will be follow-up for patients up
      to the end of the study and for 28 days after the last dose of bosentan is taken, to collect
      information about side effects.

      Some patients on bosentan have had changes in liver function and red blood cell count. Side
      effects commonly reported are headache, flushed appearance, inflammation of the throat and
      nasal passages, and gastrointestinal symptoms. If patients have sudden worsening in breathing
      in the first few weeks after taking bosentan, they should immediately tell their doctors,
      because it may be necessary to change the treatment.

      The object of this study is to assess long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of bosentan
      in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with sickle cell disease (SCD). The
      study population will include male and female patients with sickle cell disease
      (SS,S-beta-Thalassemia) who have previously completed the 16-week treatment period of the
      double-blind study of bosentan (ASSET 1 or ASSET 2). Patients who meet all the inclusion
      criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be started on 62.5 mg bid for 4 weeks and
      then start the maintenance dose of 125 mg bid (or stay on 62.5 mg if their weight is less
      than 40kg/90lbs). Patients will be divided into two groups. Group A will consist of patients
      who begin this study within 4 weeks of completing ASSET 1 or ASSET2. Group B will consist of
      patients who begin this study longer than 4 weeks after completing ASSET I or ASSET 2.
      Patients will remain on drug until the FDA approves the drug for use in patients with
      pulmonary hypertension or until the sponsor decides to stop the study.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Completion of the 16-week treatment period in the double-blind ASSET study

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative result on their serum pregnancy
             test and use reliable methods of contraception during study treatment and for 3 months
             after study treatment termination.

        Reliable methods of contraception are:

          1. Barrier type devices (e.g., female condom, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge) only in
             combination with a spermicide.

          2. Intra-uterine devices.

          3. Oral, injectable, transdermal or implantable contraceptives only in combination with a
             barrier method.

        Hormone-based contraceptives alone, regardless of the route of administration, are not
        considered to be reliable methods of contraception.

        Abstention, rhythm method, and contraception by the partner alone are not acceptable
        methods of contraception.

        Women not of childbearing potential are defined as prepubescent, postmenopausal (i.e.,
        amenorrhea for at least 1 year), or surgically or naturally sterile.

        Signed written informed consent is obtained from the patient or patient's parent/ legal
        representative prior to initiation of any study-related procedure.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        All patients (Groups A and B):

          1. Any major protocol violation in the preceding double-blind ASSET study*.

          2. Hemoglobin concentration less than 6.0 g/dL.

          3. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

             * Protocol violations will be reviewed by the monitor during site visits and discussed
             with the study staff on an ongoing basis and at the patient's completion of the
             double-blind study.

             Group B only:

          4. Acute liver disease.

          5. Newly diagnosed cirrhosis or portal hypertension.

          6. ALT greater than or equal to 3 times ULN and/or albumin greater than 20% below LLN.

          7. Newly diagnosed psychotic, addictive or other disorder limiting the ability to provide
             informed consent or to comply with study requirements.
