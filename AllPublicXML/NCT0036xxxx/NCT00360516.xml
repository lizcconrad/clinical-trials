      If eating a &quot;Paleolithic&quot; diet helps improve these diseases, this would be the first step in
      both improving people's health as they get older as well as contributing to future national
      dietary guidelines for Americans.

      Because genetic evolutionary changes occur slowly in Homo sapiens, and because the
      traditional diet of Homo sapiens underwent dramatic changes within recent times, modern
      humans are better physiologically adapted to a diet similar to the one their hominid
      ancestors evolved on than to the diet typical of modern industrialized societies. The
      investigators developed a computational model to estimate the net acid load of diets from the
      nutrient composition of the diet's component ingredients, and suggest that the majority of
      these hominid diets yield a negative net acid load (that is, yield a net base load), in
      addition to being low in sodium chloride, high in potassium-containing fruits and vegetables,
      and low in saturated fats, with the majority of the non-animal-source calories coming from
      fruits and vegetables, not from acid-producing grains, separated fats and oils, starches and
      refined sugars. According to paleonutritionists, Homo sapiens' recent switch from their
      ancestral Paleolithic-type diet to the modern Western diet has contributed in a major way to
      so-called age-related diseases of civilization. The investigators hypothesize and will test
      whether:

        1. consuming a high-potassium, low-sodium, net base-producing &quot;Paleolithic-type&quot; diet, even
           in the short term, has detectable beneficial effects on cardiovascular physiology, serum
           lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, and exercise performance; and

        2. their computational model predicts the measured negative net acid loads of a net
           base-producing &quot;Paleolithic-type&quot; diet, using steady-state values of renal net acid
           excretion as the measure of the diet net acid load (a.k.a., net endogenous acid
           production), which will be of value in constructing net-base producing diets for modern
           consumption.

      The long term complications of the combination of high blood pressure, high blood sugar and
      high fat and cholesterol levels, sometimes called the &quot;metabolic syndrome&quot;, has been termed
      the number one medical problem in modern society today. If eating a &quot;Paleolithic&quot; diet helps
      improve these diseases, this would be the first step in both improving people's health as
      they get older as well as contributing to future national dietary guidelines for Americans.
