      The goals of this study are:

        -  to determine if the combination of two drugs, motexafin gadolinium and pemetrexed, may
           be an effective treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have
           had one previous chemotherapy regimen that included a platinum containing drug such as
           cisplatin or carboplatin.

        -  to assess response to treatment in patients with NSCLC six months after beginning study
           treatment.
