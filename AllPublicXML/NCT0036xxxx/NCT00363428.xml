      RATIONALE: Exercise may help improve lung function and lessen complications of surgery in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are undergoing surgery for lung
      cancer. It is not yet known whether lung rehabilitation is more effective than standard
      therapy in improving lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who
      are undergoing surgery for lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying lung rehabilitation to see how well it
      works compared to standard therapy in treating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease who are undergoing surgery for lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the impact of preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation (including upper and lower
           extremity resistance training) vs usual care in patients with lung cancer and moderate
           to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who require lung resection for lung
           cancer.

        -  Compare the impact of this study intervention vs usual care on functional status after
           surgery.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo pulmonary rehabilitation (including daily upper and lower
           extremity resistance training, education, and smoking cessation counseling) twice a day
           for 5 days prior to surgical resection. Beginning 2-3days after surgery, patients
           undergo pulmonary rehabilitation once a day until discharge from the hospital.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive usual care (education and smoking cessation counseling alone)
           twice a day for 5 days prior to surgical resection. Following surgery, patients will
           receive usual care once a day until discharge from the hospital.

      Days of hospitalization, ICU admissions, postoperative complications (i.e., pneumonia,
      mechanical ventilation &gt; 48 hours, or atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy) and spirometry and
      imaging studies will be evaluated after surgery.

      After completion of study intervention, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks, at 12 weeks, and
      at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.
