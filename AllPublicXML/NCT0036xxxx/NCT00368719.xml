      To assess the long-term safety of tacrolimus ointment 0.03% or 0.1% in the treatment of
      subjects with atopic dermatitis under actual use conditions, including the risk of developing
      cutaneous or systemic malignancies. The FDA and EMEA approved Tacrolimus ointment, 0.03% in
      children and 0.1% and 0.03% in adults, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. As part of the
      approval process, the FDA and EMEA requested a post-marketing commitment regarding the safety
      of long-term use of Tacrolimus ointment in pediatric atopic dermatitis subjects.
