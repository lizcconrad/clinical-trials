      The purpose of this study is to obtain human heart tissue after treatment with Anginera to
      determine its effect on a variety of things that might indicate improvement in heart
      function. Patients who will have a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implanted while they
      wait for a donated heart will be treated with Anginera. At the time of heart transplant,
      their diseased heart which is removed will be analyzed by microscopic examination to see what
      effect Anginera had.

      This will be a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label, within-patient paired
      design study. The primary purpose is to analyze cardiac tissue obtained after application of
      Anginera to adults with an LVAD as a bridge to transplant, to determine effects on various
      markers.
