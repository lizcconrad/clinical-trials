  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial of nimotuzumab that will be conducted in patients with advanced
      incurable solid tumors. This is a dose-seeking study to determine the maximum tolerated and
      recommended phase II doses of nimotuzumab that can be safely given to patients with advanced
      and/or metastatic solid tumors.

      This is an open-label, dose-escalating, phase I trial of nimotuzumab in patients with
      advanced incurable solid tumors. The objective of this study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of nimotuzumab that can be
      given in a weekly schedule in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumor cancer.
      This study will also examine the safety, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of
      nimotuzumab in this patient population.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors, refractory to standard curative therapy, or
             for which no curative therapy exists.

          -  Clinically or radiologically documented disease. Patients must have measurable
             disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional
             techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Archival tumor specimens evaluable for expression of the EGFR (but EGFR positivity is
             not a requirement for study entry).

          -  Patients must have tumor lesions accessible for biopsy for correlative studies. In
             cases where there are medical contraindications to tumor biopsies, exceptions may be
             made upon discussion with the Principal Investigators.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0,1,2.

          -  Previous therapy: Previous chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation and/or surgery is
             permitted with certain restrictions as outlined in the protocol.

          -  Hematology and chemistry lab results within specifications outlined in the protocol.

          -  Willingness to give written informed consent.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up.

          -  Protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working days of patient registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Both men and women enrolled on study should be using
             adequate birth control measures throughout the course of the study.

          -  History of second malignancy who have a disease-free interval of less than two years
             (except cervical cancer in situ or nonmelanomatous skin cancer).

          -  Untreated brain or meningeal metastases. Patients with treated and stable brain
             metastases are eligible providing that they have radiologic evidence of disease
             stabilisation of at least 3 months duration and are asymptomatic.

          -  Untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions and/or have symptomatic
             cardiac dysfunction.

          -  Active or uncontrolled infections, or with serious illnesses or medical conditions
             which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol.

          -  Prior therapy with EGFR targeting therapies, including monoclonal antibodies or small
             molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

          -  Allergy to the antibody.

          -  Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs or anti-cancer therapy.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to give written, informed consent prior to study
             participation.
