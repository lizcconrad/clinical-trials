      Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPCs) are highly radiosensitive tumors, and the primary treatment
      of NPCs is radiotherapy.1 Because most patients who have NPC are at advanced stages when
      initially seen, local failures in terms of persistence or recurrence are not infrequent after
      primary radiotherapy.2,3 Local regional relapse without the presence of distant failure can
      still be salvaged and should be aggressively treated. Tumors relapsing in the nasopharynx can
      be salvaged using either re-irradiation or surgical techniques.1 Although re-irradiation to
      the recurrent tumor can extent the 5-year actuarial survival rate, it is associated with high
      morbidity. 4-6 Traditional nasopharyngectomy has been associated with local control rates on
      the order of 40%~50%, but it has also been associated with complications such as palatal
      defects, trismus, facial scarring, osteomyelitis, etc.7-10 That is the reason why surgeons
      continue searching for new methods for performing nasopharyngectomies with lower morbidities.

      Nasopharyngectomies are difficult to perform because of the inaccessibility of the
      nasopharynx. More difficulties are encountered in performing a nasopharyngectomy through the
      nose due to the restricted surgical field. With advances in techniques of endoscopy and
      application of the potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) laser in surgery, pathologic lesions
      located either at the choanal margin or in the nasopharynx can easily be managed with
      instruments inserted via the nasal cavities. The surgical technique had been accepted by the
      authority journal. This time, we will review the therapeutic result of KTP-laser
      nasopharyngectomy in patients with recurrent NPC.
