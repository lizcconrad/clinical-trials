      The purpose of this study is to determine whether IHL-305 (irinotecan liposome injection) is
      safe and effective in the treatment of advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose-escalation study of intravenous administration of IHL-305 in patients
      with advanced solid tumors. Patients will receive IHL-305 as an intravenous infusion over 60
      minutes on Day 1 followed by a 27-day observation period for a total of 28 days (4 weeks) per
      cycle. Two patient populations will be evaluated separately; patients with UGT1A1*28 genotype
      homozygous wild-type (wt/wt) and heterozygous (wt/*28) variants as one group, and patients
      with UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant (*28/*28) as another group.

               -  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with
                  creatinine levels above institutional normal

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previously treated with irinotecan, or had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study, or not
             recovered from adverse effects due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier
