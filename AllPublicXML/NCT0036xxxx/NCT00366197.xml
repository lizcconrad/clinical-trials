      This trial examines weaning outcomes using the rapid shallow breathing index rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the trend of the Rapid Shallow Breathing Index or RSBI rate, is a better
      predictor of weaning outcome than the RSBI as a single value during the weaning trial.
      patients are recruited during a weaning trial on t-piece and the RSBI during what the RSBI is
      measured periodically. The outcome is ventilatory status at 24 hours after the weaning trial.
