  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This no treatment research study is being done to find a safe and an appropriate dose of
      antibody (protein) against tumor cells to best target the cancer in people with pancreatic
      cancer. To do this, this no-treatment research study will compare two doses of an antibody
      called hPAM4 IgG when combined with a radioactive element, Indium-111.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, non-randomized, single-arm, pilot imaging study to
      determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and tumor targeting of an indium-111
      (111In)-labeled, humanized anti-MUC1 antibody, designated hPAM4 IgG1 in patients with known
      pancreatic cancer. The primary objective of this trial is to examine how changing the protein
      dose will affect these parameters with the intent to determine if a single protein dose can
      be selected to optimize tumor targeting. It is expected that these data will aid in the
      selection of an appropriate protein dose to be used in a Phase I therapy trial with
      yttrium-90 (90Y)-labeled hPAM4 IgG. The secondary objective is to monitor safety.

      Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, tumor targeting, and dosimetry (modeling for 90Y) will be
      assessed against clinical parameters, such as pre-study PAM4-reactive MUC-1 antigen in the
      serum, tumor size, location, histopathology, immunohistology, and if possible, antigen
      content by extraction of tumor sample.

        Inclusion Criteria:-

          -  All patients must either have a histologic or cytological diagnosis of pancreatic
             cancer or a high clinical suspicion of pancreatic cancer.

          -  Patients must be 21 years of age.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by CT scan.

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks beyond any major surgery.

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks beyond any chemotherapy or radiation therapy and
             must have recovered from treatment-induced toxicity.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of 70% or greater on the Karnofsky Scale and a
             minimal life expectancy of 3 months.

          -  Patients must not have severe anorexia, nausea or vomiting, and no signs of intestinal
             obstruction.

          -  Patients must have a serum creatinine that is &lt; 1.5 x the Institutional Upper Limit of
             Normal (IULN).

          -  AST/ALT &lt; 2 times the IULN; serum bilirubin &lt; 3 x IULN.

          1. Known history of active coronary artery disease, unstable angina, myocardial
             infarction, or congestive heart failure present within 6 months or cardiac arrhythmia
             requiring anti-arrhythmia therapy.
