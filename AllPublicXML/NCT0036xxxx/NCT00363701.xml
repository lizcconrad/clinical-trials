      The primary purpose of the study is to determine the effect of esomeprazole compared to
      placebo in patients from general practice who have previously been treated with
      proton-pump-inhibitors (PPI) and who have no upper endoscopic findings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with dyspepsia are treated in primary care with acid-suppressive
      therapy for shorter or longer periods of time on the assumption that the patientsÂ´ symptoms
      are related to the production of acid in the stomach.

      In about half of the dyspeptic patients there is no structural or biochemical explanation for
      their symptoms. These patients suffer from functional dyspepsia.

      Treatment with proton-pump-inhibitors is effective in treating patients with gastroesophageal
      refluxdisease or ulcers. It is however controversial if acid-suppressive treatment is
      effective in the large group of patients with functional dyspepsia. Previous studies have
      shown no or very modest effect with a very high placeboresponse rate of 40-50%.

      In primary care patients with upper abdominal symptoms are often treated with PPI as a
      diagnostic tool. If the treatment is effective continued or repeated treatment with PPI is
      often favored. However some of the patients must experience the abovementioned
      placebo-effect. These patients may end up being treated with PPI long-term on uncertain
      indication.

      We wish to investigate the consequences of withdrawing treatment with PPI in patients from
      general practice who have previously been treated long-term.

      An upper endoscopy is performed in patients who experience upper abdominal symptoms after
      withdrawal of treatment.If the endoscopy is normal patients are randomised to 1 week
      treatment with either esomeprazole or placebo.
