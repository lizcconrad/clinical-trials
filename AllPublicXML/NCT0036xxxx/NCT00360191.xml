        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy men and women, 18 years of age to 65 years of age.

          2. Meet DSM-IV criteria for marijuana dependence.

          3. All subjects will agree to and sign a written, IRB-approved informed consent.

          4. Subjects must live within a 60-mile radius of Charleston, SC, in order to improve
             study visit compliance.

          5. Subjects must be willing to identify collateral individuals for contact purposes to
             facilitate follow-up appointments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals meeting DSM-IV dependence for a substance other than marijuana with the
             exception of nicotine and caffeine. Dependence on nicotine and caffeine will be
             allowed since dependence on these substances commonly co-occurs with marijuana
             dependence and excluding these individuals would compromise study recruitment.

          2. Individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for a lifetime history of schizophrenia or another
             non-affective psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder, since these patients will most
             likely be taking other psychotropic medications and often require intensive
             psychiatric care.

          3. Individuals meeting DSM-IV criteria for current major depressive disorder or eating
             disorder, since these individuals will likely require treatment with psychotropic
             medications.

          4. Individuals who present significant suicidal risk.

          5. Individuals with significant cognitive impairment, as they may be unable to understand
             the informed consent, comply with study protocol, or accurately complete assessments.

          6. Individuals currently receiving benzodiazepines, antidepressant or antipsychotic
             medications, as these medications could confound the effects of buspirone treatment.

          7. Pregnant or nursing women, or women who refuse to use adequate birth control, as
             buspirone has not been approved for use in pregnancy.

          8. Individuals without stable housing, as contacting these individuals would be
             difficult.

          9. Individuals with major medical illnesses (e.g., HIV, renal failure, unstable angina,
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infectious hepatitis).

         10. Individuals who, in the investigators' opinion, would not be able to comply with study
             procedures, such as individuals unable to reliably present for intake appointments.
