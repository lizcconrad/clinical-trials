  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether restrictive guidelines for red blood cell
      (RBC) transfusions for preterm infants can reduce the number of transfusions without adverse
      consequences.

      Design, Setting, and Patients. We enrolled 100 hospitalized preterm infants with birth
      weights 500 to 1300 g into a randomized clinical trial comparing two levels of hematocrit
      threshold for RBC transfusion.

      Intervention. The infants were randomly assigned to either the liberal or the restrictive
      transfusion group. For each group, transfusions were given only when the hematocrit fell
      below the assigned value. In each group, the transfusion thresholds decreased with improving
      clinical status.

      Main Outcome Measures. We recorded the number of transfusions, the number of donor exposures,
      and various clinical and physiological outcomes.

      Results. Infants in the liberally transfused group received more RBC transfusions, mean 5.2
      (SD 4.5) vs 3.3 (SD 2.9) in the restrictive transfusion group (P=0.025). However, the number
      of donors to whom the infants were exposed was not significantly different, mean 2.8 (SD 2.5)
      vs 2.2 (SD 2.0). There was no difference between the groups in the percentage of infants who
      avoided transfusions altogether, 12% in the liberal transfusion group vs 10% in the
      restrictive group. Infants in the restrictive group were more likely to have intraparenchymal
      brain hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia (P=0.012), and they had more frequent
      episodes of apnea (P=0.004), including both mild and severe episodes.
