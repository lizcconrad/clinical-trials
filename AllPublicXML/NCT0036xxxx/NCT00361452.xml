  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is a common disease of infancy and a main reason for infants' hospital
      admissions in the first 2 years of life. The main cause of bronchiolitis is RSV (respiratory
      syncytial virus). Though, Treatment is mainly supportive, the treatment benefit of nebulized
      epinephrine or albuterol has been largely debated for the past years. Most of the clinical
      studies used clinical parameters to detect and compare the effectiveness of such medical
      interventions. In this study we will use non invasive computerized method of wheeze and
      crackles quantification to compare the effectiveness of nebulized epinephrine vs albuterol in
      RSV Bronchiolitis.

      Inpatient Infants younger than 2 years of age with first episode of RSV bronchiolitis will be
      randomly assigned to treatment with nebulized epinephrine (1 mg diluted with 3 ml of 0.9%
      saline) or nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg diluted with 3.5 ml of 0.9% saline). Both solutions
      will be provided in identical containers.

      Clinical assessment and clinical score will be done before treatment, 10 and 30 minutes after
      treatment. The following parameters were recorded at each time point, wheezing, respiratory
      distress, O2 saturation, respiratory rate and heart rate. Computerized lung sounds as well,
      will be recorded before treatment, 10 and 30 minutes after treatment via 4 contact sensors
      attached to the chest.
