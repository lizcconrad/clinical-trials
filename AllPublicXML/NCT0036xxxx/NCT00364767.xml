  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decreased risk of diabetes type 2. This
      association could be mediated by an improvement of insulin sensitivity with moderate alcohol
      consumption. Patients with diabetes type 2 or impaired glucose tolerance often may have
      decreased fat oxidative capacity or oxidative phosphorylation in tissue such as muscle. This
      could lead to accumulation triglyceride storage in muscle, which could interfere with insulin
      signaling. Whether such mechanism can also play a role with moderate alcohol consumption is
      unknown and will be investigated in this study.

      In addition, moderate alcohol consumption with a meal can lead to delayed hypoglycemia in
      type 1 diabetes patients. How moderate alcohol consumption affects postprandial glycemic
      response in healthy subjects is unknown. This is a secondary objective of this trial.

      To investigate the effect of moderate alcohol consumption on

        -  enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in
           skeletal muscle

        -  transporters of fatty acids and glucose in fat tissue

        -  post-prandial glycemic response in healthy, lean or overweight, young men

      Design : Open, randomized, partially diet-controlled, placebo controlled cross-over design

      Participants

        -  Description : Healthy, lean and overweight young (18-40 years) men

        -  Number : 20

      Study substances

        -  Test substance : 100 ml whiskey (Famous Grouse, 40% v/v alcohol: â‰ˆ 32 g alcohol)

        -  Reference substance : 100 ml mineral water (Spa blauw)

      Duration: 2 treatment periods of 4 weeks (28 days)

      Test parameters:

        -  Muscle biopsy for activity of 3-hydroxy fatty-acyl CoA dehydrogenase, citrate synthase,
           cytochrome c oxidase

        -  Postprandial glycemic response (glucose, insulin, GLP-1, GLP-2, GIP, glucagon, FFA etc.)

        -  Insulin sensitivity and related factors (oral glucose tolerance test, adiponectin,
           HbA1c)

        -  Liver enzymes (safety)

        -  Body weight

        -  Urinary ethyl glucuronide (compliance)
