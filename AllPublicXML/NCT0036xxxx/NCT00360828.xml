      Phase 2 trial to explore the efficacy and safety of irinotecan (CPT-11). Also administered at
      each cycle was zofran/Kytril/Anzemet, decadron, and IV atropine.

      At each cycle, patient exams and interviews as well as lab results were to help the research

      Phase 2 trial to explore the efficacy and safety of irinotecan (CPT-11) in patients with
      recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), mixed malignant glioma, and oligodendrogliomas (OA).
      Patients were to be stratified by tumor histology and treated with CPT-11 every 21 days
      (treatment cycle).

      Baseline data (collected &lt;14 days) was to consist of a neurological/oncological history,
      neurological examination, height, weight, performance status, Quality Of Life FACT-L
      questionnaire, laboratory studies to include complete blood count (CBC), differential,
      platelets, prothrombin time (PT), complete metabolic panel (CMP), Lactose dehydrogenase
      (LDH), and a pregnancy test, as well as a cranial Computerized Tomography/Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (CT/MRI) with and without contrast (to measure or evaluate the size and location of
      the tumor before treatment).

      Administered every 21 days was a dose of irinotecan (CPT-11), zofran/Kytril/Anzemet,
      decadron, and intravenous (IV) atropine. At each cycle, patient exams and interviews as well
      as lab results were to help the research team to determine the symptomatic side effects of
      the treatment. Recorded past toxicities were to be compared with current side effects.

      Between days 15-21 (within 7 days of next scheduled CPT-11 treatment) the following tests
      were to be repeated - a neurological/oncological history and neurological examination,
      weight, blood drawn (CMP, LDH), performance status, and Quality Of Life FACT-L questionnaire.
      Also, a MRI (Cranial CT/MRI with and without contrast) was to be performed for tumor
      assessments at week 9, 18, 27, 36, and after every nine weeks thereafter until progression.
      Response was to be measured by a reduction in tumor size.

      These supportive therapies were provided as necessary:

        -  Antiemetic Therapy

        -  Anticholinergics

        -  Loperamide (ImodiumÂ®)

        -  Growth Factors

        -  Other Concomitant Medications

    <description>The intent was to have 63 evaluable participants to determine the Objective Response Rate utilizing Criteria for Response, Progression and Relapse according to the McDonald Criteria. A measurement is made of the maximal enhancing tumor diameter on a single axial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted section, and then the largest perpendicular diameter is measured on the same image. The product of the 2 diameters is calculated, and the measurements are repeated with each scan. Measurements from multiple lesions are summed.</description>

    <description>Participants were given irinotecan at a fixed dose: [350 mg/m2 in patients either not on anti-seizure drugs or on anti-seizure drugs which do not interfere with the metabolism of Irinotecan; 600 mg/m2 in patients on anti-seizure drugs which interfere with the metabolism of Irinotecan] once every 21 days. Depending on how many side effects were experienced with the first cycle [first 21 days], the dose of both drugs may remain the same or may be decreased to make the treatment better tolerated with less side effects. The irinotecan was given to through a vein over 90 minutes.</description>

    <description>Irinotecan injections. Irinotecan hydrochloride [CPT-11; CAMPTOSAR] is an antineoplastic agent of the topoisomerase I inhibitor class. The drug is supplied in amber vials and appears as a pale yellow transparent aqueous solution. Two vial sizes are available: 2 mL vials containing 40 mg of drug and 5 mL vials containing 100 mg of drug. A treatment cycle was 21 days. Patients were treated for a minimum of 3 cycles (doses) of CPT-11 or until their disease progressed.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Objective Response After 3 Cycles of Treatment</title>
        <description>The intent was to have 63 evaluable participants to determine the Objective Response Rate utilizing Criteria for Response, Progression and Relapse according to the McDonald Criteria. A measurement is made of the maximal enhancing tumor diameter on a single axial gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted section, and then the largest perpendicular diameter is measured on the same image. The product of the 2 diameters is calculated, and the measurements are repeated with each scan. Measurements from multiple lesions are summed.</description>

            <description>Participants were given irinotecan at a fixed dose: [350 mg/m2 in patients either not on anti-seizure drugs or on anti-seizure drugs which do not interfere with the metabolism of Irinotecan; 600 mg/m2 in patients on anti-seizure drugs which interfere with the metabolism of Irinotecan] once every 21 days. Depending on how many side effects were experienced with the first cycle [first 21 days], the dose of both drugs may remain the same or may be decreased to make the treatment better tolerated with less side effects. The irinotecan was given to through a vein over 90 minutes.</description>
