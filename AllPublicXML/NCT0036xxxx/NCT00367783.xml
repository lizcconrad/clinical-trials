  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CP-741,952 is effective in the treatment of
      obesity and to determine 12 week safety and toleration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following review of the preliminary data from completed study A7081004, the development
      program for CP-741,952 was terminated on 15 March 2007. Primary reasons for program
      termination included a lack of significant efficacy at all doses investigated and an
      increased incidence of mild to moderate elevations in serum transaminases, primarily alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), and liver fat content, in treated compared to placebo subjects. A
      synopsis will be created and will include greater detail on these findings.
