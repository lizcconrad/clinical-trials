  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic glomerular diseases are one of the main causes leading to end stage renal disease
      (ESRD). Hypertension and proteinuria are two modifiable factors promoting the progression of
      ESRD. Podocyte are terminally differentiated epithelial cells and play a central role in the
      progression of chronic kidney disease and in the development of glomerulosclerosis. The
      presence of podocyte in urines (podocyturia) has been documented by several teams with
      continuous and regular podocyturia during glomerular disease. This facts suggests that
      podocyturia could become a marker of podocyte loss and glomerular damage. In our university
      hospital, we developed a technique to evaluate the number of microparticles (cellular
      fragments) in different biologic samples. The podocytary origin of microparticles will be
      determinated thanks to specific antibodies. The aim of the present study is: i) to quantify
      podocyturia during glomerular nephropathies by dosing podocyte microparticles ii) to study
      the relationship between podocyturia and other biologic markers such as proteinuria iii) to
      evaluate the effect of angiotensine 2 blockage on podocyturia. This is an open-labelled
      randomized monocenter cross-over study. Twenty subjects with hypertension and glomerular
      nephropathy characterized by proteinuria and a normal or slightly altered renal function will
      be included. Patients will be treated successively by an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB),
      losartan and by a thiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, (after a wash out period). We will study the
      impact of these two therapies on podocyturia. Results will be compared with others markers
      like proteinuria (and its selectivity). We may finally dispose of a non invasive urinary
      marker of podocyte lesions responsible for glomerulosclerosis and for ESRD progression.
      Moreover mechanism of nephroprotection of the ARB may be more comprehensive.
