      -  To compare the Kinetics of inhibition of platelet aggregation (aggregometry) and
           platelet activation (flow cytometry) with different loading doses of clopidogrel

        -  To evaluate the effect on various parameters of inflammation and necrosis and the safety
           of these loading doses
