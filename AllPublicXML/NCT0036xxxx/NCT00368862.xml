      The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of memantine, a noncompetitive NMDA
      receptor blocker, in depression co-morbid with long term alcohol heavy use comparing to
      SSRI-inhibitor, escitalopram. Second goal is to compare their influence to cognitive tasks
      and the third goal is to follow up alcohol-use with these two medicines.

      Context Depression is common clinical problem among alcoholics and its treatment has no
      standard and is controversy. Glutamate NMDA-receptors may mediate the effects of long term
      alcohol related depression and thus the NMDA-receptor modulator memantine could have effects
      on it.

      Objectives The preliminary aim of this study was to identify possible new treatment for
      depression of alcoholics and compare the efficacy of escitalopram and memantine in co-morbid
      depression of alcoholism.

      Design and setting Double-blind, randomized, naturalistic study, 26-week trial on alcohol
      dependent outpatients.

      Participants Eighty alcohol dependent depressive adults

      Intervention Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive memantine or escitalopram 20 mg per day.
      During the study the patient received routine psychosocial treatment at A-Clinic. No
      concomitant intervention on alcohol consumption and no imposed treatment goals. The patients
      were met weekly in first month, then after 3 and 6 months.
