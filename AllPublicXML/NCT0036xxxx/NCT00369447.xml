  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I-II study designed to investigate nimotuzumab (TheraCIM h-R3) in combination
      with external radiation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of the Phase
      I portion of the study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the administration of
      nimotuzumab with palliative radiation in patients who are unsuitable for radical therapy and
      to select the optimal dose for the Phase II component of the study. The primary objective for
      the Phase II portion of the study is to examine the efficacy of this combination treatment.

      The Phase I component of this study has been completed. The Phase II is now closed to
      recruitment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter Phase II study with Phase I lead-in. Patients
      enrolled in this study will receive external radiotherapy with or without nimotuzumab
      (TheraCIM h-R3). The objective of the Phase I component of the study is to evaluate the
      safety and feasibility of the administration of nimotuzumab with palliative radiation in
      patients who are unsuitable for radical therapy (curative intent chemoradiation) and to
      select the optimal biologically effective dose (BED) for Phase II component of the study. In
      the Phase II component, overall survival, local and systemic response rates and quality of
      life will be evaluated inpatients treated with nimotuzumab in combination with palliative
      radiation vs. radiation alone.

      The Phase I component of this study has been completed. The Phase II is now closed to
      recruitment.
