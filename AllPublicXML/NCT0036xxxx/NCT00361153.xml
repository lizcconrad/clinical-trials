  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test whether WelChol (colesevelam HC1) improves blood sugar control
      in patients with type 2 diabetes by making their own insulin work more efficiently.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-center, randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8-week trial in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Two parallel treatment groups include double-blind
      colesevelam or placebo. A screening period may be up to 18 weeks to withdraw non sulfonylurea
      antidiabetic treatment or withdraw or adjust sulfonylurea antidiabetic treatment. To evaluate
      hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, subjects will undergo a two-step
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with a tritiated glucose infusion at pre randomization and
      after 8 weeks of treatment. To evaluate oral glucose absorption, subjects will undergo two
      oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) at pre randomization, one without colesevelam and one
      with colesevelam, and one OGTT at the end of the treatment period..

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting the following criteria at the Screening Visit will be eligible to
        participate in the trial:

          -  Have given written informed consent

          -  Ages 18 to 75 years, inclusive

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus of at least 3 months duration

          -  HbA1C 7.0- 10.0%, inclusive

          -  Antidiabetic treatment may include oral agents; all antidiabetic agents must be
             withdrawn before randomization

          -  Women may be enrolled if they are not pregnant (negative serum βHCG at the Screening
             Visit), are not breast-feeding, and do not plan to become pregnant during the trial.
             In addition, they must either have had a hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6
             months before signing informed consent, be post-menopausal for 1 year, or practicing
             an acceptable method of birth control. An acceptable method of birth control may be
             oral, injectable or implantable hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device,
             diaphragm plus spermicide, or female condom plus spermicide. Abstinence, partner's use
             of condoms, and partner's vasectomy are NOT acceptable methods of contraception

          -  BMI 25 - 45 kg/M sq, inclusive

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects are excluded from participation in the study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus or history of diabetic ketoacidosis

          -  Treatment with lipid or blood pressure lowering therapy that has not been stable for
             three months before randomization

          -  Treatment with WelChol, cholestyramine or colestipol for hyperlipidemia within the
             last 3 months

          -  Treatment with thiazolidinediones

          -  History of dysphagia, swallowing disorders, or intestinal motility disorder

          -  Serum triglyceride &gt;500 mg/dL at Visit 1

          -  Serum LDL-C &lt;60 mg/dL at Visit 1

          -  Any condition or therapy which, in the opinion of the investigator, poses a risk to
             the subject or makes participation not in the subject's best interest

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 30 days before randomization

          -  Chronic treatment with oral corticosteroids

          -  History of hyperthyroidism and/or treatment with thyroid hormone/ levothyroxine
