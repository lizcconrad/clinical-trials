    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of atomoxetine (also known as
      Strattera) compared to placebo (inactive substance) on daily activities such as attention and
      focus, thinking ability and muscle movements in subjects with early Huntington Disease (HD)
      and attention deficit disorder (ADD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No medications have been investigated to improve attention and executive functions in
      patients with Huntington's disease, despite the evidence that these cognitive domains can be
      abnormal even before motor symptom onset. Because cognitive symptoms are highly associated
      with functional disability, treatments aimed at improving cognitive functions would be of
      significant benefit to patients in the early stages of the disease. Atomoxetine is the ideal
      choice for such a trial. It has proven efficacy in adults with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and it selectively targets norepinephrine and dopamine in the
      prefrontal cortex rather than in subcortical areas. This selectivity is an advantage for
      patients with HD, because motor side effects are less likely to be facilitated than with a
      psychostimulant. The present study is a feasibility study in which we propose to administer
      either 80 milligram (mg) atomoxetine for 4 weeks or placebo to 20 patients with early HD who
      also complain of mild cognitive symptoms. The groups will then crossover to the other
      condition (atomoxetine or placebo). Participants will be assessed on measures of ADHD
      symptoms and a sensitive battery of neuropsychological tests. Based on the shared neural
      circuitry in ADHD and HD, and the demonstrated effectiveness of atomoxetine on attention in
      adults with ADHD, improved performance on cognitive tests of attention and executive
      functions and on subjects' report of ADHD symptoms are expected in the atomoxetine treatment
      phase. No changes in motor status are predicted during the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Conners' Adult Attention Rating Scale (CAARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>There are two time points for this measure: baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Conners' Adult Attention Rating Scale (CAARS) is one of the most frequently used self-rating measures for adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and was given as a self-report measure of attention. It has 66 items with each item ranging from 0 to 3 points. Higher total scores represent greater impairment. The outcome reported was change in score from baseline for each treatment arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Attention Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>There are two time points for this measure: baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The attention composite comprises performance on Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III Symbol-Digit and Letter Number Sequencing Subtests, Trail Making Test Part A, computerized simple-choice reaction time, and computerized working memory (i.e., 2-Back). The composite score is the average combined z score for each test. Higher, positive values indicate better than average performance and negative and lower values indicate worse than average. The outcome reported was change in score from baseline for each treatment arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Executive Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>There are two time points for this measure: baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The executive composite comprises performance on Trail Making Test Part B, Stroop Color and Word Test, and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (i.e., Verbal Fluency). The composite score is the average combined z score for each test. Positive values indicate better than average performance and negative values worse than average. The outcome reported was change in score from baseline for each treatment arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>There are two time points for this measure: baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, a self report measure of psychiatric symptoms. The measure produces raw scores and normed scores (T scores Mean = 50), with higher values representing greater impairment. The outcome reported was change in score from baseline for each treatment arm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Motor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>There are two time points for this measure: baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Although changes in motor symptoms were not hypothesized, the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale motor examination was administered at every visit. An experienced motor rater completes a motor examination and rates the participant on several motor tasks. Total score ranges from 0 - 124, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome. The outcome reported was change in score from baseline for each treatment arm.</description>
