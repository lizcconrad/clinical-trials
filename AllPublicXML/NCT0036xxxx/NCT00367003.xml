      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of
      chronic, high frequency stimulation of the subgenual cingulate white matter (Cg25WM) using
      the ANS Totally Implantable Deep Brain Stimulation System as an adjunctive treatment for
      severe treatment-refractory Major Depression in twenty TRD patients, and to investigate
      potential mechanisms of action of this intervention.

      Major Depression is one of the most common and costly of all psychiatric disorders. While
      depression can be effectively treated in the majority of patients by either medication or
      some form of evidence-based psychotherapy, up to 20% of patients fail to respond to standard
      interventions. For these patients, trial-and-error combinations of multiple medications and
      electroconvulsive therapy are often required (Kennedy and Lam 2003; UK ECT Review Group
      2003). For patients who remain severely depressed despite these aggressive approaches, new
      strategies are needed.

      Specific Aim 1. To asses the safety and tolerability of acute and chronic Cg25-DBS.

      Specific Aim 2. To assess the antidepressant efficacy of active Cg25-DBS in
      treatment-resistant depressed patients.
