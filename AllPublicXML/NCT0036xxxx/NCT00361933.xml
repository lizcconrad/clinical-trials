    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn whether people who are experiencing an MCD (multicentric
      Castleman's Disease) flare will improve after taking valganciclovir. MCD is a type of
      inflammatory disease associated with Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). Valganciclovir is FDA
      approved for treating a different type of Human Herpesvirus, but not approved for the
      treatment of HHV-8. It is therefore considered experimental in this study.

      All participants will undergo an initial screening appointment. At this visit, participants
      will be tested for Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), the virus that is associated with MCD, and we
      will review participants' medical history and medical records to determine whether he/she has
      MCD. If participants do not live within the Seattle area, this visit may occur over the
      phone.

      Those who qualify for the study will be followed for up to 2 years. During that 2 year
      period, participants will be asked to collect oral swabs once a week and have blood drawn
      monthly. If subjects do not live within the Seattle-area, they will be asked to ship these
      samples to UW for testing. We will provide subjects with instructions for these shipments.
      This will be done at no cost to the participant.

      If during the 2 year period the participant experiences a MCD flare, he/she will be admitted
      to the University of Washington Medical Center's Clinic Research Center for 14-days. If the
      participant does not live within the Seattle-area, all travel expenses will be covered.

      The study will enroll a total of 8 patients who will receive open-label valganciclovir for
      14-days. Everyday during the hospitalization, participants will have blood drawn (to check
      your HHV-8 levels), 1 oral swab will be collected and a general physical exam will be
      performed.
