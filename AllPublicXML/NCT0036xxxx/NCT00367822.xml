  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to compare an individually optimized dose of the lisuride TTS
      patch against placebo and against an individually optimized dose of oral ropinirole (active-
      and placebo-controlled design) in idiopathic and uremic RLS patients with regard to efficacy,
      safety, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 300 patients will be randomized to receive either lisuride, ropinirole or
      placebo in a 2:1:1 fashion. After completion of 12 weeks of double-blind treatment, eligible
      patients will have the option to continue treatment with the lisuride patch for further 36
      weeks in an open-label extension of the study.

      Primary outcome: Changes in the total score of the International Restless Legs Severity Scale
      (IRLS) from baseline to end of double-blind treatment (12 weeks) will be used as primary
      efficacy outcome measure.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate quality of life, safety and tolerability. After the
      double-blind period, long-term efficacy of lisuride will be assessed for further 36 weeks in
      an open-label extension of the study.
