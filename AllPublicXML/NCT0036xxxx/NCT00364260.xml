  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using Eprex, to maintain hemoglobin within the
      normal range, will prevent or delay the progression of left ventricular mass growth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease continues to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in subjects
      with renal (kidney) disease. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been correlated with a
      high risk of cardiac and all cause mortality. In the renal population , many factors have
      been shown to be important in the development of LVH, including anemia. This is a
      multicentre, open, controlled, randomized trial to determine if maintaining hemoglobin within
      the normal range delays the progress of left ventricular mass growth. Additionally, this
      study will evaluated the safety of maintaining hemoglobin within the normal range in
      pre-dialysis subjects. The trial duration is 24 months. Subjects randomized to the treatment
      arm will receive Eprex therapy to maintain hemoglobin between 120-140 g/L. Subjects
      randomized to the control arm will not receive any treatment unless their hemoglobin falls to
      less than or equal to 90 g/L. Those subjects will then be treated to maintain their
      hemoglobin between 90-105 g/L. The subjects were to receive injections of Eprex once weekly
      to maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range for the arm to which they were
      randomized. The subjects were to receive treatment for up to 24 months.
