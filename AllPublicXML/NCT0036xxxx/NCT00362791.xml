  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of counseling to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has not been definitively shown. This
      multi-center randomized controlled trial (Project RESPECT) sought to compare the effects of 2
      interactive HIV/STD counseling interventions with didactic prevention messages typical of
      current practice.

      A total of 5758 STD clinic patients were enrolled from 5 public STD clinics (Baltimore, Md;
      Denver, Colo; Long Beach, Calif; Newark, NJ; and San Francisco, Calif) between July 1993 and
      September 1996. Eligible participants were heterosexual, HIV-negative patients aged 14 years
      or older who came for full STD examinations. Using a block design, participating men and
      women were randomzied separately to 1 of 3 individual face-to-face interventions. Arm 1
      received &quot;enhanced counseling&quot; consisting of 4 interactive counseling sessions based on the
      Theory of Reasoned Action and Health Belief Model. Arm 2 received &quot;brief counseling&quot;,
      consisting of 2 interactive risk-reduction sessions based on CDC's client-centered counseling
      model. Arms 3 and 4 each received 2 brief didactic messages about HIV/STD prevention messages
      typical of current care at that time. Participants assigned to Arms 1, 2, and 3 were actively
      followed up after enrollment with questionnaires at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and STD laboratory
      examinations and tests at 6 and 12 months. An intent-to-treat analysis was used to compare
      interventions. Arm 4 participants were followed passively to determine potential effects of
      active study follow-up.

      The main outcome measures were self-reported condom use and new diagnoses of STDs (gonorrhea,
      chlamydia, syphilis, HIV) defined by laboratory tests.

      Results: At the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits, self-reported 100% condom use was higher
      (P&lt;.05) in both the enhanced counseling and brief counseling arms compared with participants
      in the didactic messages arm. Through the 6-month interval, 30% fewer participants had new
      STDs in both the enhanced counseling (7.2%; P = .002) and brief counseling (7.3%;P=.005) arms
      compared with those in the didactic messages arm (10.4%). Through the 12-month study, 20%
      fewer participants in each counseling intervention had new STDs compared with those in the
      didactic messages arm (P = .008). Consistently at each of the 5 study sites, STD incidence
      was lower in the counseling intervention arms than in the didactic messages intervention arm.
      Reduction of STD was similar for men and women and greater for adolescents and persons with
      an STD diagnosed at enrollment.

      Subset analyses found that

      Based on these results, we conclude that short counseling interventions using personalized
      risk reduction plans can increase condom use and prevent new STDs. Effective counseling can
      be conducted even in busy public clinics.
