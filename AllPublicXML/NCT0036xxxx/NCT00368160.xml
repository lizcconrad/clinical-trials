      The study is a single centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled 2-way crossover
      design in a group of 32 healthy male and female volunteers. The medications under
      investigation are eszopiclone and placebo. Volunteers will receive the study medications and
      placebo on the evening of Day 2 of each treatment period. Performance will be assessed on Day
      3 of each treatment period. Each treatment period will be separated by at least a 7-day
      washout period. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor
      Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was
      changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
