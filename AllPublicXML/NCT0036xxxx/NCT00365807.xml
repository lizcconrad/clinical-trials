  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study examined the effectiveness of a behaviorally-based group intervention for
      overweight children and their families. The target intervention was compared to an enhanced
      standard of care treatment. The impact of both treatment programs on numerous outcomes was
      explored.

      The primary objective of the present investigation was to determine the effectiveness of an
      empirically supported intervention for pediatric overweight in two outpatient clinical
      settings. A number of previous randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of
      behaviorally-based group interventions for overweight children and their families. As called
      for by Kazdin and Weisz (1998) and Chambless and Hollon (1998) the proposed investigation was
      designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of such a treatment in a clinical setting, and to
      examine the effects of the intervention on children's quality of life (QOL). Because the
      clinical impact of empirically supported interventions is mitigated by economic and consumer
      variables, a secondary aim of the proposed investigation was to examine (1) the
      cost-effectiveness of an outpatient group intervention for pediatric obesity, and (2) the
      consumer satisfaction with the proposed intervention. Finally, an additional exploratory aim
      was to examine predictors of adherence to treatment for the intervention.
