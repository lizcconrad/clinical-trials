  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Defects in the apoptotic process can lead to the onset of cancer by allowing cells to grow
      unchecked when an oncogenic signal is present. Obatoclax is designed to restore apoptosis
      through inhibition of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, thereby reinstating the natural process
      of cell death that is often inhibited in cancer cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase II study of single-agent obatoclax administered in
      2-week cycles as a 24-hour infusion every 2 weeks at a fixed dose of 60 mg to patients with
      myelofibrosis. Infusions may be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigational or
      commercial agents or therapies other than those described in the protocol may be administered
      with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy. Supportive care measures including those
      directed at controlling symptoms resulting from myelofibrosis (blood products, growth factor,
      hydroxyurea, etc.) are allowed.
