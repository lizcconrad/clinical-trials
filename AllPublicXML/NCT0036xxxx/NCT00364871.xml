      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of 3 combinations of
      naltrexone and bupropion SR compared to naltrexone alone, bupropion SR alone or placebo.

      A completed proof of concept study, OT-101 (Data on File, Orexigen Therapeutics, 2005),
      demonstrated that a combination of 300 mg bupropion SR and 50 mg naltrexone was associated
      with greater weight loss than bupropion SR alone, naltrexone alone, or placebo in subjects
      with uncomplicated obesity.

      The hypothesis for the current trial is that by adjusting the doses and titration schedules
      of bupropion SR and naltrexone greater efficacy and improved tolerability can be achieved. In
      this trial, a higher dose of bupropion and 2 lower doses of naltrexone than utilized in the
      previous trial (OT-101) will be evaluated. The doses of both drugs will be titrated over 4
      weeks and administered twice a day. There are 2 cohorts. At each site, cohort 2 recruitment
      began as soon as cohort 1 enrollment was completed. Cohort 1 treatment groups are (60 per
      group):

        -  Group 1: Bupropion SR (400 mg/day) plus Naltrexone (48 mg/day)

        -  Group 2: Bupropion SR (400 mg/day) plus Naltrexone (16 mg/day)

        -  Group 3: Bupropion SR (400 mg/day) plus N-Placebo

        -  Group 4: B-placebo plus Naltrexone (48 mg/day)

        -  Group 5: B-Placebo plus N-Placebo

      Cohort treatment 2 Groups are:

        -  Group 6: B-Placebo plus N-Placebo (n=20)

        -  Group 7: Bupropion SR (400 mg/day) plus Naltrexone (32 mg/day)(n=60)
