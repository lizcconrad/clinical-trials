      This is a phase 4 study to determine if a semipermeable hydrophilic membrane marketed as
      Ferris PainWrap can relieve low back pain more effectively than a placebo wrap. In the United
      States, the prevalence of low back pain of at least 1 month's duration is about 15% and its
      incidence is 5%. It is one of the two most common pain complaints. Low back pain is thus a
      major health problem in this country and worldwide. Treatment that relieves low back pain and
      restores function would be of great benefit to the individual and the community at large,
      particularly if the treatment is convenient and has no significant adverse effects. Ferris
      PainWrap was originally developed as a burn dressing and is commercially available for this
      purpose. The Food and Drug Administration approved the material as Ferris Hydrophilic
      Dressing for marketing in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of
      the Medical Device Amendments. The material is classified as a medical device. It was found
      to relieve pain, inflammation, swelling, and bruising over traumatized areas. Subsequently,
      it appeared to relieve low back pain in informal, open (non-blinded) trials. The proposed
      mechanism for low back pain relief is by alteration of cutaneous A-beta receptor and possibly
      cutaneous A-delta fiber function through shifts in sodium and water concentrations in the
      skin. This study will compare a &quot;no dose&quot; placebo to a &quot;high-dose&quot; back wrap. It is a one
      year pilot study which will be randomized, double-blinded, and controlled, comparing Ferris
      PainWrap to an identical appearing placebo back wrap in individuals with chronic low back
      pain of three months duration or longer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English speakers, necessary to understand the protocol and communicate observations to
             the investigators

          -  Low back pain of 3 months or longer. Acceptable conditions include non-specific low
             back pain or pain associated with lumbar spondylosis without neurological impairment
             associated with the stenosis.

          -  Numerical Pain Rating Scale value of 4.5 or higher, estimated for the past week where
             0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain.

          -  Pain must interfere in some way with daily activities, assessed by Roland and Morris
             Disability Survey.

          -  Beck Depression Inventory score of 20 or less.

          -  Physical examination findings of tenderness, muscle spasm or taut bands, or myofascial
             trigger points in the low back region. The low back region is defined as the
             lumbosacral region, below the 12th thoracic vertebra down to the sacro-coccygeal
             junction, and extending laterally to the plane of the lumbar vertebral transverse
             processes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  NPR rating score of less than 4.5.

          -  Neurologic impairment in the legs (absent knee or ankle deep tendon reflexes,
             dermatome sensory loss or weakness) that indicates lumbar radiculopathy.

          -  Presence of cancer (previous diagnosis of cancer, or treated cancer with no sign of
             recurrence for 5 years is acceptable).

          -  Presence of systemic disease that can cause low back pain (endometriosis, prostatitis,
             chronic renal disease, recurrent urinary tract infections, or other acute infections,
             not including simple upper respiratory infections without significant coughing).

          -  Pending litigation involving back injury.

          -  Back related disability.

          -  Lumbar laminectomy.

          -  Subjects cannot have participated in other research studies within 3 months of
             starting this study.
