      The purpose of the research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of high-dose acyclovir
      compared to valacyclovir for reduction of asymptomatic genital shedding in persons with
      genital herpes.

      The study will enroll men and women who are 18 years or older, test positive to HSV-2 (by
      blood test) and have had a first outbreak of HSV-2 within the past 6 months or have had at
      least 4 genital herpes outbreaks in the past year. Participants must be HIV negative and
      willing to stop taking suppressive therapy for HSV for the one week wash out period. (Females
      only: You must not be pregnant or breast-feeding). Both men and women will be asked to use an
      effective form of birth control.

      Involvement in the study will last 15-weeks and you will be asked to visit the clinic every
      2-weeks. At each visit, you will be given medication to take daily (either valacyclovir or
      acyclovir; you will receive both medications at some point during this study). There will be
      a total of 9 study visits and each visit will last approximately 30 minutes. We will ask that
      you complete a daily symptom diary and collected daily home swabs 4-times a day, everyday
      during the study. Each daily home swab will take less than 3 minutes to perform.

      Screening Assessment

      Patients will be assessed for their eligibility to enter the study at a screening visit.
      After signing informed consent they will undergo a medical history and the following
      information will be recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF):

        -  Demographic Data: Date of birth, sex, marital status, education and race

        -  Previous antiviral medication taken

        -  History of sexually transmitted infections and sexual history.

      Start of Study Visit (Day 0) and Day 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98 and 105 Follow-Up Visits.

      Eligible patients will return to clinic to be given study drug and a patient diary card on
      which to record concomitant medications, signs and symptoms, and adverse experiences. The
      investigator will instruct the patient on daily home viral sample collection, taking the
      study drug, and completing the diary card. The patient will be instructed to return to clinic
      in 2 weeks, +/- 2 days. Medication compliance will be assessed at each visit using pill
      counts.

      Crossover Study Visit Prior To Washout Period (Day 49-55)

      Participants will not be given study drug or placebo during the 7-day washout period.

      Daily Home Viral Sample Collection

      Participants will collect swabs from the genital mucosa four times per day and store the
      samples in PCR media with preprinted labels. Women will swab the cervicovaginal, vulvar and
      perianal areas, and men will swab the penile and perianal. Every two weeks, they will return
      the samples to the Virology Research Clinic when they present for additional study drug and
      assessment.

      Final Study Visit (Day 105)

      At the final study visit at Day 105 or for premature discontinuation, the investigator will
      perform the activities at the regular study visits, with the exception of the dispensation of
      study drug.
