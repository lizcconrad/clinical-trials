      -  The primary objective of this study is to describe the incidence of RSV-associated LRI
           or apnea (% RSV positive) among infants &lt;1 year of age presenting to the ED during
           selected shoulder months. The total number of events will also be described.

        -  To characterize the clinical outcomes and demographic data of infants presenting to the
           ED with RSV-associated LRI or apnea

        -  To characterize the social burden (in the form of number of days lost from work by
           parent/ guardian) for these infants through 14 days after the index ED visit and through
           hospital discharge will also be described.

        -  Based on a sample of cases collected in a cohort of patients enrolled at or near the
           peak of RSV disease during the traditional season, a comparison of the rate of RSV
           between shoulder and peak periods will be described.

        -  To describe the overall rates of RSV-associated LRI or apnea based on the general ED
           statistics collected during the entire study period.
