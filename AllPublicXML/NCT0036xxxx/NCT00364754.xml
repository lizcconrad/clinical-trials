  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over pharmacokinetic study designed to
      investigate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene alters the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of a standard regimen of epirubicin and/or its principle metabolite,
      epirubicinol and cyclophosphamide.

      This is a Phase I, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over pharmacokinetic study designed to
      investigate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene alters the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of a standard regimen of epirubicin and/or it's principle metabolite,
      epirubicinol and cyclophosphamide. The plasma pharmacokinetics of epirubicin/epirubicinol and
      cyclophosphamide when given alone or concurrently with tesmilifene will be examined. Safety
      information for the tesmilifene/ epirubicin and cyclophosphamide combination and for
      epirubicin and cyclophosphamide alone in this patient population will also be collected.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with documented histological/cytological proof of metastatic and/or recurrent
             breast cancer suitable for treatment with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide. Patients
             with locally advanced and inoperable lesions are also eligible.

          2. Previous therapy:

               -  If patients have had hormone-responsive disease, randomization is permitted after
                  6 weeks off anti-hormonal therapy or 5 half lives (whichever is shorter) unless
                  there is evidence of progressive disease in which case patients could be
                  randomized earlier.

               -  No previous exposure to anthracycline/anthracenedione-based chemotherapy.

               -  Patients may have received non-anthracycline/anthracenedione based adjuvant
                  chemotherapy, completed a minimum of 4 weeks prior to randomization. Patients
                  must not have had previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

               -  Immunotherapy and experimental therapy must stop a minimum of 4 weeks prior to
                  randomization.

               -  A minimum of four weeks must have elapsed between the end of prior radiotherapy
                  and randomization. Exceptions will be made, however, for palliative radiotherapy
                  which involves no more than 30% of bone marrow.

          3. ECOG status of 0, 1 or 2.

          4. Female, aged 18 to 55 years.

          5. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          6. Patients must be willing and able to follow instructions and make all required study
             visits.

          7. Patients must be willing and able to give written consent to participate in this
             study.

          8. Disease free interval less than or equal to 36 months.

          9. Normal organ and marrow function

         10. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to randomization and must
             be on a medically recognized form of birth control that is approved by the
             investigator.

         11. Negative blood tests for HIV and Hepatitis B and C within 4 weeks prior to
             randomisation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous malignancies, excluding curatively treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma
             of the skin or in-situ cervical cancer or any other cancer treated more than five
             years prior to study entry and presumed cured.

          2. Known brain or meningeal metastases

          3. Use of chemotherapeutic agents for any malignancy within 4 weeks prior to study entry
             or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more
             than 4 weeks earlier.

          4. Treatment with any other investigational drug within the preceding four weeks.

          5. Pregnant and breast-feeding females.

          6. History of seizure disorder.

          7. Clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction within 6
             months, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, unstable angina, cardiomyopathy or
             arterial or ventricular clinically significant arrhythmias even if medically
             controlled.

          8. Clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, endocrine, hepatic,
             respiratory, neurologic, psychiatric, immunologic, gastrointestinal, haematologic,
             metabolic or any other condition or laboratory abnormality that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator or Medical Director of YM BioSciences Inc., makes the patient unsuitable
             for participation in the study.

          9. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to test article ingredients.

         10. Patients on COX 1 or 2 prostaglandin inhibitors (e.g. ASA, other NSAID's, Celcbrex®,
             Vioxx® ) who can not comply with guidelines or concomitant therapy.

         11. Patients on H1 antagonists as detailed in the protocol who can not comply with
             guidelines or concomitant therapy
