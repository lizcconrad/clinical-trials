  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept behind our study was to combine an effect of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory
      agents for a more efficient acne therapy directed at the factors involved in the
      pathophysiology of the disease. For this purpose we evaluated a combination of clindamycin
      phosphate and salicylic acid in a non-irritating carrier.
