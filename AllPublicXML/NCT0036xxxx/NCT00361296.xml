      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from cancer cells may help the body build an effective immune
      response to kill abnormal cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients
      with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of GM-K562 cell vaccine in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine the hematologic and cytogenetic response in patients treated with this
           vaccine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine if vaccination with GM-K562 cell vaccine can induce an immune response to
           common myeloid antigens (e.g., Wilms' tumor-1 [WT-1], survivin, or proteinase-3), as
           defined by a 30% increase from baseline in specific cytotoxic T-cells measured by
           Elispot assay, in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Determine if immune response correlates with any clinical responses (e.g., hematologic
           response, resolution of cytogenetic abnormalities, or decrease in other parameters, such
           as WT-1 mRNA levels).

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive GM-K562 cell vaccine subcutaneously once in weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, and 17 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected periodically for correlative and biomarker studies.
      Samples are analyzed by cytogenetic studies, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and
      flow cytometry. Elispot is used to quantify cellular cytotoxic T-cell response to Wilms'
      tumor-1 (WT-1), survivin, and proteinase 3.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study.
