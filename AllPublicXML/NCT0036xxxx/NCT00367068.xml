      The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with
      intrathecal baclofen for severe spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.

    <textblock>
      Spasticity in cerebral palsy (CP) is a serious problem leading to pain, sleep disturbance,
      increased expenditure of energy and/or interference with positioning, transfers, dressing and
      body hygiene. In later stages, secondary phenomena, such as contractures, decubitus and
      heterotopic calcifications of joints or tendons may create large treatment problems. A
      substantial group of children with severe CP does not respond to regular treatments, such as
      physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery or oral medication. An effective treatment option for
      intractable spasticity is the continuous delivery of intrathecal baclofen (CITB). In 2000,
      the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine (AACPDM) published a
      systematic review on the body of evidence about intrathecal baclofen (ITB) for spasticity in
      individuals with CP. It appeared that only a small and uncertain number of children had been
      studied. Except for two case-reports, none of the studies solely concerned children. The
      research methodology employed in three quarters of the available studies was not capable of
      confirming treatment effect. The AACPDM underlined the need for further high-level research
      in the form of prospective, randomized trials that use valid and reliable outcome measures in
      well described and homogeneous groups.

      In 1998 the Dutch Study Group on Child Spasticity designed the Dutch national study on the
      effectiveness and safety of ITB for refractory spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.
      The Dutch national ITB study included four phases: 1] the selection phase, 2] the
      double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-escalation test treatment phase, 3] the prospective,
      randomized, open-label implantation phase and 4] the follow-up phase.
