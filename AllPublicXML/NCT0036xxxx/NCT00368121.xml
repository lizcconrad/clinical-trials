    <textblock>
      EMMA-1 is an open-label, non-randomized, two-stage phase II study. Patients with refractory
      multiple myeloma stage II or III or relapsed disease after at least one line of treatment
      will receive Cetuximab+/-Dexamethasone.

      The planed treatment duration per patient is 16 weeks. Patients achieving a response or
      stable disease after 16 weeks of treatment may continue study medication for 6 more months
      (patients receiving Cetuximab alone) or for 3 more months (patients receiving Cetuximab plus
      Dexamethasone). Responding patients who relapse during follow-up period of two years may
      receive a second treatment with Cetuximab following initial study guidelines
