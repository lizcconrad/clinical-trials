  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In children, behavior management is critical to the success of pediatric dental procedures.
      Most of the studies on local anesthesia performed in children deal with the question how to
      avoid or minimize pain during injection. Due to the sensation of numbness children scratch
      the soft tissues and bite lips and tongue. In many cases, this may be kept in children's
      memory as a &quot;painful experience&quot; and may affect their behavior in the following visit. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate children's reactions to the administration of local
      anesthetic injection in the mandible (mandibular block) and in the maxilla (supraperiosteal
      infiltration), and to assess their behavior in the following visit related to each type of
      injection.

      Children between the ages of 4 to 7, undergoing dental treatment at the Department of
      Pediatric dentistry of the Hadassah School of Dental Medicine will participate in the study.
      All patients should be ASA Class I with no prior dental treatment who need at least two
      clinical sessions of similar operative procedures preceded by local anesthetic injection, one
      in each jaw, none of which due to emergency. Subjective and objective evaluation will be
      performed according to previously validated scales.
