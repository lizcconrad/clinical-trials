    <textblock>
      The precursor study (SCA101469) was an open-label, prospective multicentre study in adult
      subjects diagnosed with bipolar disorder consisting of 36 weeks treatment with lamotrigine.
      The current study is to provide 12 months post study access to open-label lamotrigine for
      participants of the SCA101469 study.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurred during the course of the trial after study treatment had started. An adverse event is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect. Only SAEs were recorded and reported in this extension study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          -  completed 32 weeks of open label treatment in study SCA101469 and, in the
             investigators opinion, has responded to lamotrigine therapy

          -  male or female subject

        A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

          1. non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is post-menopausal or sterilised) or,

          2. child-bearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test at screening, and agrees
             to one of the following contraceptive methods:

               -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the
                  study drug, throughout the study, and for a time interval after completion of
                  premature discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of the
                  investigational drug (a minimum of 5 half-lives or longer if the pharmacodynamic
                  profile of the investigational drug warrants a longer time period); or,

               -  Sterilisation of male partner; or,

               -  Implants of levonorgestrel; or,

               -  Injectable progestogen; or,

               -  Oral contraceptive (combined or progestogen only); or,

               -  Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the lowest
                  expected failure rate is less than 1% per year (not all IUDs meet this
                  criterion); or,

               -  Any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected failure
                  rate for that method is less than 1% per year; or,

               -  Barrier method only if used in combination with any of the above acceptable
                  methods.

                    -  willing and able to give written informed consent to participate in the

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          -  subject experienced a 'mood episode' during participation in study SCA101469, or since
             completing participation in study SCA101469.

          -  participation in a clinical drug trial other than SCA101469 within the past 30 days or
             previous participation in this clinical study

          -  known hypersensitivity to lamotrigine

          -  in the investigator's judgement, the subject poses a current serious suicidal or
             homicidal risk, or has made a suicide attempt within the past 6 months.

          -  combination of carbamazepine and valproate

          -  concurrent lamotrigine therapy, other than that commenced in study SCA101469

          -  current or history of substance abuse

          -  diagnosis of epilepsy

          -  diagnosis or history of an obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, or eating

          -  significant cardiac, renal, cerebrovascular, or hepatic condition; no significant
             abnormalities in the laboratory tests or ECG recording performed during study
             SCA101469.

          -  unable to understand or implement instructions
