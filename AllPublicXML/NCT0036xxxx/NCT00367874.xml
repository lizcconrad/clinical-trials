    <textblock>
      Managed detoxification is a first and necessary step prior to treatment and rehabilitation.
      Detoxification can be a major obstacle for some patients, and the availability of managed and
      safe withdrawal is a prerequisite for long-term treatment.

      In our clinical practice we have felt the need for a standardised and safe detoxification
      treatment regimen for our opioid addicts, as dependence on multiple drugs is so common.

      Objectives

        1. To assess whether a novel standardised treatment regimen - Buprenorphine (BPN) combined
           with Valproate (VPA) - will result in fewer withdrawal symptoms during detoxification of
           opiateâ€“polydrug users than the existing treatment regimen, i.e. Clonidine (CLN) combined
           with Carbamazepine (CBZ).

        2. To determine whether there are differences in treatment retention between the BPN/VPA
           and the CLN/CBZ groups.

        3. To assess differences in clinical side-effects and biochemical interactions between the
           two treatment regimens.
