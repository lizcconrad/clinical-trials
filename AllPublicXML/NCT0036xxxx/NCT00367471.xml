      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of lapatinib when administered
      with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and trastuzumab in subjects with ErbB2-positive breast cancer
      and with carboplatin and paclitaxel in subjects with ErbB2-negative breast cancer.

    <description>Subjects in Treatment Group A (in cohorts of three) will receive oral lapatinib QD (Days 1 to 28). Following lapatinib administration on Day 1, paclitaxel will be administered intravenously over one hour followed immediately by an IV infusion of carboplatin over not less than 15 minutes. Carboplatin will be followed by an initial loading dose of trastuzumab by 90 minute IV infusion (first dose only) with subsequent IV doses of trastuzumab to be given weekly over 30 minute infusion.</description>

             specimens must be demonstrated before study enrollment. It is requested that archived
             breast tumor tissue be sent to a central laboratory for independent confirmation of
             ErbB2 status by FISH analysis.

             specimen must be demonstrated before study enrollment. It is requested that archived
             breast tumor tissue be sent to a central laboratory for independent confirmation of
             ErbB2 status (FISH analysis).

                  have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and agree to one of the
                  following:

          -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from two weeks prior to administration of the
             first dose of study medication until 28 days after the final dose of study medication;
             or

          -  Consistent and correct use of one of the following acceptable methods of birth
             control:

          -  male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is
