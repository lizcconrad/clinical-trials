      Patients diagnosed with chronic sarcoidosis with fatigue for more than 6 months. Sarcoidosis
      and its treatment can greatly affect your quality of life. Many patients suffer from fatigue

    <textblock>
      This is to be a double blind, randomized trial with cross over of 12 patients with chronic
      sarcoidosis on stable systemic therapy. Patients will be screened for fatigue using a
      modified SNAP and Facit-F scores. Patients will be in the study for 20 weeks. Objective of
      study: To determine the effect of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride, (d-MPH)(Focalin) on
      fatigue in Sarcoidosis. The is a common complaint in sarcoidosis, related to the chronic
      inflammatory nature of the disease. It may also related to therapy for the disease.
