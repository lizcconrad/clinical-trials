      -  To evaluate Blood Pressure (BP) reduction to the targeted values (Systolic BP ≤ 130 mmHg
           and Diastolic BP ≤ 80 mmHg) in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients.

        -  To evaluate the benefit of Irbesartan in the reduction of microalbuminuria from baseline
           (if any at the inclusion visit) in this population.

        -  To demonstrate the safety of Irbesartan in this population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Proven Hypertensive Type 2 Diabetic Patients with HbA1c &gt; 6% and ≤ 10% (with or
             without microalbuminuria).

          -  Newly diagnosed &quot;naïve&quot; hypertensive patients (no prior treatment for hypertension).
             OR,

          -  Patients who were receiving antihypertensive agents (maximum two agents, including one
             diuretic) with blood pressure targets achieved, yet, in the investigator's opinion,
             those patients would benefit more from switching to the study medication. These
             patients will undergo a wash out period for not less than 7 days prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg).

          -  Patients with secondary hypertension.

          -  Patients with UAE &gt; 200µg / min.

          -  Patients with HbA1c &lt; 6% or &gt; 10%.

          -  Significant chronic renal impairment (Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL).

          -  Significant liver disease as shown by SGPT/SGOT (ALAT/ASAT) &gt; 2.5 times the upper
             limit of the normal range.

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not protected by effective contraceptive method of
             birth control and/or who are unwilling or unable to be tested for pregnancy.

          -  Any patient who is in need for a combination antihypertensive therapy from the start
             (from the medical point of view of his/her physician).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to irbesartan, other ARBs(Angiotensin Receptor Blockers),
             hydrochlorothiazide, or other thiazide diuretics.

          -  Patients with malignancy during the past 5 years, known collagen disease or severe
             cardiac, cerebrovascular or gastric disease.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
