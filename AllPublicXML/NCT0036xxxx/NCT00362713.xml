      The purpose of this study is to learn if ipilimumab can be given safely at two different
      doses given to patients with urothelial cancer who are going to have surgery as part of their
      treatment. The immunological effectiveness of ipilimumab will also be studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously untreated urothelial cancer requiring surgery for treatment

          -  Ineligible for chemotherapy

          -  Adequate hematologic, kidney and liver function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Sexually active and fertile individuals or partners of these individuals who are
             unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of birth control for the entire trial
             and up to 4 weeks after the study

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment prior to study drug administration

          -  Prior treatment with ipilimumab or other anti-CTLA4 antibody, or a CD137 agonist

          -  Concurrent malignancy, with the exception of adequately treated and cured basal or
             squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix (previous malignancy
             without evidence of disease for 5 years will also be allowed to enter trial)

          -  Autoimmune disease: subjects with a documented history of inflammatory bowel disease
             (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are excluded from this study as are
             patients with a history of symptomatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, autoimmune
             vasculitis [e.g., Wegener's Granulomatosis]). Subjects with motor neuropathy
             considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre Syndrome) are excluded from this
             study

          -  Patients deemed ineligible for surgery

          -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseased in the
             past month

          -  Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL-2, interferon or other non-study
             immunotherapy regimens, chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other investigation
             therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (used in the management of
             cancer or non-cancer related illnesses)

          -  Prior radiation therapy for urothelial cancer

          -  Positive screening tests for or any prior history of HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C
