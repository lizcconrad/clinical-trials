  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In multiple myeloma, combination chemotherapy with melphalan plus prednisone has been used
      since the 1960s and is regarded as the standard of care in elderly patients. We assess
      whether the addition of thalidomide to this combination or adapted high-dose chemotherapy,
      using a melphalan 100 mg/m2 -based regimen, would improve survival.

      Trial design This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial is conducted by the French
      Myeloma Intergroup(IFM) in elderly patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. The
      primary objectives of the study are to compare the efficacy and safety of MP with
      MP-Thalidomide or with MEL100 (intermediate-dose melphalan 100 mg/m2 - based treatment). The
      secondary objective is to compare the efficacy of MP-Thalidomide vs MEL100.
