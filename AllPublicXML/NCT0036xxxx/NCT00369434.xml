      To assess the efficacy and safety of 100 mg and 150 mg of DVS SR in comparison to placebo for
      the treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause, as well as additional
      outcome indicators such as sleep disruptions, overall climacteric symptoms, mood changes,
      somatic symptoms, and overall satisfaction with DVS SR in postmenopausal women.
