    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of Tai Chi with an
      Attention Control intervention consisting of a stretching and wellness education program
      involving 40 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. We hypothesized that the
      participants receiving Tai Chi would show greater improvement in knee pain, physical and
      psychological functioning, and health-related quality of life than participants in the
      Attention Control group, and that the benefit would be mediated by effects on muscle
      function, musculoskeletal flexibility and mental health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis in the United States, affecting 21
      million older people. Symptomatic knee OA in the elderly is one of the most frequent causes
      of loss of independence and physical disability. There are currently no satisfactory
      pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapies for knee OA. New strategies to improve
      functional capacity, quality of life and reduce long-term disability in people with knee OA
      are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the physical and psychological
      benefits of Tai Chi exercise as a complementary treatment for people with knee OA. Tai Chi is
      a traditional Chinese discipline with both physical and mental components that appear to
      benefit a variety of conditions. The physical component provides exercise that is consistent
      with recommendations for OA (range of motion, flexibility, muscle conditioning and aerobic
      cardiovascular exercise), while the mental component has the potential to increase
      psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and perceptions of health. These effects are
      especially pertinent for the treatment of older adults with knee OA.

      Over a three-year period, 40 patients with symptomatic knee OA were randomly assigned to
      receive a 12-week Tai Chi program or stretching and wellness education program. Outcome
      measurements were obtained at baseline and on completion of the 12-week program, as well as
      24 and 48 week follow-up periods. We compared changes in knee pain, stiffness, and physical
      function using the well-validated Western Ontario and McMaster Index (WOMAC), as well as
      clinical knee examination, lower extremity function, knee joint proprioception, and health
      related quality of life.

    <measure>Change in 6 Minute Walk Test From Baseline to 12, 24, and 48 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12, 24, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 minute walk test is a reliable measure of functional exercise capacity. Patients were asked to walk as fast and as far as possible within the 6-minute period and were accompanied by the research staff using a wheel measure that measured distance covered in inches and convereted to yards; higher scores indicated improved state. Higher numbers reported here indicate more improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Standing Balance From Baseline to 12, 24, and 48 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 12, 24, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The standing balance test included tandem, semi-tandem, side-by-side, and one-legged stands. Patients were asked to maintain each position for 30 seconds. For each task, the research staff first demonstrated the task, asked the patient if they felt comfortable and ready and then supported the patient while positioning themselves. One point was given if they exceeded 30 seconds and none if they could not or did not attempt the test. Higher numbers reported here indicate more improvement from baseline.</description>

    <description>The Tai Chi program was based on the classical Yang Style. Patients participated in 60-minute Tai Chi sessions twice a week for 12 weeks. Each session included warm up and review of Tai Chi principles and techniques; Tai Chi exercises; breathing techniques; and various relaxation methods. The classes were taught by a Tai Chi master with over 20 years' experience conducting Tai Chi Mind-Body exercise programs. Several modifications were developed to achieve the physical and mental goals of the study for knee OA, accommodate knee OA symptoms and limit dropouts. Subjects were instructed to practice Tai Chi at least 20 minutes a day at home and encouraged to maintain their usual physical activities, but not to participate in additional new strength training other than their Tai Chi exercises.</description>

    <description>The wellness education and stretching program provided an active control for the attention being paid to the Tai Chi group. The control group attended two 60-minute class sessions per week for 12 weeks. Each session started with 40 minutes of didactic lessons on OA knowledge, nutrition, and physical and mental health education. The final 20 minutes consisted of stretching exercises involving the upper body, trunk and lower body, each stretch being held for 10 to 15 seconds. Participants were also instructed to practice at least 20 minutes of stretching exercises per day at home. They were encouraged to maintain their usual physical activities, but not to participate in additional strength and mind-body exercise programs other than their stretching exercise.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC is a validated, self-administered instrument specifically designed to evaluate knee and hip OA. The WOMAC was administered to the participants at baseline, 12, 24 and 48 weeks. The pain subscale score range was 0-500mm, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. Negative numbers reported here (change in subscale score) indicate improvement in condition from baseline. (So -200 indicates a 200-point improvement from baseline.)</description>

        <title>Change in Timed Chair Stand From Baseline to 12, 24, and 48 Weeks.</title>
        <description>Timed stand tests measure the time taken to complete ten full stands from a sitting position. Patients began the chair stand seated with their arms folded across their chests, then rose to a standing position and sat back down with their back against the back rest of the chair. The test was completed when the patient stood for the tenth repetition. Chair stand time was measured in seconds, with lower scores indicating improved state. Negative numbers reported here indicate improvement in condition from baseline. (So -10 indicates a 10-second improvement from baseline.)</description>

        <description>The 6 minute walk test is a reliable measure of functional exercise capacity. Patients were asked to walk as fast and as far as possible within the 6-minute period and were accompanied by the research staff using a wheel measure that measured distance covered in inches and convereted to yards; higher scores indicated improved state. Higher numbers reported here indicate more improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Standing Balance From Baseline to 12, 24, and 48 Weeks.</title>
        <description>The standing balance test included tandem, semi-tandem, side-by-side, and one-legged stands. Patients were asked to maintain each position for 30 seconds. For each task, the research staff first demonstrated the task, asked the patient if they felt comfortable and ready and then supported the patient while positioning themselves. One point was given if they exceeded 30 seconds and none if they could not or did not attempt the test. Higher numbers reported here indicate more improvement from baseline.</description>

The patient rates his/her confidence of being physically active in different types of situations on a 5-item scale with responses ranging from &quot;not at all confident&quot; to &quot;extremely confident&quot;. The total score is coputed by calculating the average of all 5 questions. A higher score indicates greater self-efficacy.
