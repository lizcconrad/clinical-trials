  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the optimal treatment frequency of 308-nm excimer laser for vitiligo and
      identify the key clinical variable(s) associated with the treatment efficiency under the
      optimal treatment frequency.

      Prospective, randomized, comparative study among groups of vitiligo patients treated with
      308-nm excimer laser, with the limitation of no follow-up.

    <textblock>
      Vitiligo patients were treated with 308-nm excimer laser for 20 sessions at different
      frequencies (0.5×, 1.0×, 2.0× and 3.0× weekly). Treatment protocols adapted the dose to the
      lesions and not to the minimal erythemal dose. Treatment efficacy was blindly evaluated by 2
      independent physicians. Re-pigmentation rate was graded on a 6-point scale. The onset of
      re-pigmentation of vitiligo lesions was evaluated after 5 treatment sessions. The differences
      between Group 0.5×, 1.0×, 2.0× and 3.0× linking different clinical variables were assessed.
