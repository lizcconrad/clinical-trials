    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in the Frequency of Satisfying Sexual Events as Measured by the eDiary.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A small personal handheld electronic device (eDiary) was used by the patients to record information about sexual events. Patients were instructed to complete the eDiary every morning. When completing an eDiary entry, patients answered questions regarding their sexual events since their last eDiary entry. If patients missed or were late with their eDiary entry, they entered information about their sexual events covering a maximum time period of the past 7 days; however, they did not enter any information beyond the last entry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 24 Weeks in Responses to the eDiary Daily Desire Question.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the electronic diary (eDiary) Sexual Desire Monthly Total Score standardized to a 28-day period (total score range 0-84). Change from baseline is calculated as the difference between the four week baseline period and Week 21 to Week 24. Patients were asked to record information daily in the eDiary throughout the trial. Every time the eDiary was completed, a desire question was asked. If a patient did not complete the diary on a given day, the patient was not asked to enter desire information for more than a 24-hour retrospective period. The desire item read &quot;Indicate your most intense level of sexual desire in the last 24 hours / since your last visit.&quot; Potential responses included &quot;no,&quot; &quot;low,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; and was scored 0-3, with 0 indicating no desire and 3 indicating the highest level of desire:
0 = No desire
= Low desire
= Moderate desire
= Strong desire</description>

        <description>A small personal handheld electronic device (eDiary) was used by the patients to record information about sexual events. Patients were instructed to complete the eDiary every morning. When completing an eDiary entry, patients answered questions regarding their sexual events since their last eDiary entry. If patients missed or were late with their eDiary entry, they entered information about their sexual events covering a maximum time period of the past 7 days; however, they did not enter any information beyond the last entry.</description>

        <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of those patients who were randomized to a treatment group, received at least one dose of study medication, and had at least one on-treatment efficacy assessment. The FAS was analyzed for efficacy.</population>

        <description>Change from baseline in the electronic diary (eDiary) Sexual Desire Monthly Total Score standardized to a 28-day period (total score range 0-84). Change from baseline is calculated as the difference between the four week baseline period and Week 21 to Week 24. Patients were asked to record information daily in the eDiary throughout the trial. Every time the eDiary was completed, a desire question was asked. If a patient did not complete the diary on a given day, the patient was not asked to enter desire information for more than a 24-hour retrospective period. The desire item read &quot;Indicate your most intense level of sexual desire in the last 24 hours / since your last visit.” Potential responses included &quot;no,&quot; “low,” “moderate,” or “strong” and was scored 0-3, with 0 indicating no desire and 3 indicating the highest level of desire:
0 = No desire
= Low desire
= Moderate desire
= Strong desire</description>

Every time the eDiary was completed, a desire question was asked. If a patient did not complete the diary on a given day, the patient was not asked to enter desire information for more than a 24-hour retrospective period. The desire item read &quot;Indicate your most intense level of sexual desire in the last 24 hours / since your last visit.” Potential responses included &quot;no,&quot; “low,” “moderate,” or “strong” and was scored 0-3, with 0 indicating no desire and 3 indicating the highest level of desire:
0 = No desire
= Low desire
= Moderate desire
= Strong desire</description>
