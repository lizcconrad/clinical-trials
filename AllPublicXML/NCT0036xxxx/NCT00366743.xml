  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate visual outcomes, contrast sensitivity, glare testing and
      high order aberrations induced by different laser technologies and to evaluate differences in
      aberrometer technology. We hypothesized that there will not be differences among conventional
      or wavefront guided treatments.
