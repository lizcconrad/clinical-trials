  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe hypoglycaemia leading to collapse without warning is one of the most-feared
      complications for those with Type 1 diabetes. The aim of this study is to determine whether
      detection and targeted prevention of hypoglycaemia by using either an optimised subcutaneous
      insulin regime or continuous insulin regime can restore hypoglycaemia awareness in Type 1
      diabetes. Following a 6-day continuous subcutaneous monitor glucose profile, participants
      will be randomised to 1 of 3 interventions: rigorous avoidance of hypoglycaemia on current
      insulin regime; targeted optimisation of subcutaneous insulin regime to avoid hypoglycaemia;
      or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Symptomatic experience and severity of
      hypoglycaemia, pattern of hypoglycaemia on glucose profiling and, in selected individuals,
      response to hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemic clamp, will be compared over a 6 month period. It
      is envisaged that successful prevention of hypoglycaemia by one or more interventions may
      reverse altered hypoglycaemia awareness and prevent further episodes of severe hypoglycaemia.

      The unifying objective of the proposed unblinded randomized prospective study is to determine
      whether hypoglycaemia awareness in Type 1 diabetes can be restored by rigorous avoidance of
      hypoglycaemia addressed by one of the following interventions:

        1. A non-targeted approach whereby pre-prandial glycaemic targets are raised from
           4.5-7mmol/L to 7.2-8.3mmol/L and hypoglycaemia is rigorously avoided without specific
           alterations in subcutaneous insulin regime5

        2. Optimisation of subcutaneous insulin regime employing pre-prandial short-acting insulin
           analogue in combination with once daily insulin Glargine targeted to prevent periods of
           hypoglycaemia identified by 24 hour glucose profiles

        3. Insulin delivery by external pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) targeted to
           prevent periods of hypoglycaemia identified by 24 hour glucose profiles
