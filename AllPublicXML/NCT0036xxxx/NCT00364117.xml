    <textblock>
      Reduction in beds coupled with the increased need for health care services has led to a
      supply and demand struggle or capacity management challenge for health care facilities. This
      is now recognized as a major public health issue. The impact is readily seen as overcrowding
      in emergency departments. At present 76% of hospitals' emergency departments (ETDs) are at or
      over capacity with 33% reporting ambulance diversions, the most common sign of overcapacity
      within a health care facility. Compounding the physical capacity problem is the &quot;human
      capacity strain&quot; as admitted patients remain in the ETD for prolonged periods waiting for
      beds. Delayed admission to patient care units significantly strains the financial resources,
      impedes &quot;patient flow&quot; ultimately impacting the quality of care, patient satisfaction and the
      &quot;bottom line.&quot; Discharge before 11 am optimizes the availability of hospital beds to meet
      admission demands thereby avoiding a surge over capacity or &quot;patient back log&quot;, ambulance
      diversions in ETD; the post anesthesia recovery unit, admissions office and critical care
      units. Conversely competing needs for the attending physician's physical presence off of the
      hospital premises; off of the unit (private practice and meetings) often delays patient
      discharge from before 11 am to the afternoon and evening.
