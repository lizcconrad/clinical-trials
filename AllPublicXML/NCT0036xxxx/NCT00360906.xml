  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on previous clinical studies indicating beneficial treatment effects of omega-3 fatty
      acids in multiple sclerosis, and the increasing evidence of anti-inflammatory effects of
      omega-3 fatty acids, this study aims to evaluate treatment effects of concentrated omega-3
      fatty acids (Triomar™) in MS, both as monotherapy and in combination with standard
      immunomodulatory therapy defined as interferon-beta 1a (Rebif™).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with evidence of disease activity
      defined as at least one relapse or at least one new MRI lesion during the year prior to
      inclusion will be included in the study.

      Eligible patients will be randomised for daily treatment with either oral omega-3 fatty acid
      (Triomar™) or placebo. After six months all patients will in addition receive interferon-beta
      1a (Rebif™) 44 mcg subcutaneous three times per week for another 18 months.

      The patients will undergo monthly contrast enhanced MRI for the first nine months and
      thereafter at months 12 and 24. They will also be examined by clinical and laboratory tests
      at six months intervals in addition to month 9 (3 months after start of IFNB treatment).
      Fatigue and QoL registration will be performed at baseline and at months 6, 12 and 24. Tests
      for circulating neutralising antibodies against interferon-beta will be performed during the
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A patient may be included if he/she;

          -  Is aged between 18 and 55 years (both included).

          -  Has multiple sclerosis according to the McDonald criteria (McDonald 2001)

          -  Has a stable disease during the last month period prior to inclusion, and a disability
             equivalent to EDSS of 5.5 or less (Kurtzke 1983).

          -  Has shown disease activity defined as at least one relapse or at least one new MRI
             lesion (T1 enhancing or T2 lesion – ref. McDonald criteria) during the year prior to
             inclusion.

          -  Is prepared to and considered able to follow the protocol and to attend the planned
             visits during the whole study period.

          -  Has renal insufficiency.

          -  Has ASAT or ALAT &gt; 2,5 x normal upper limit.

          -  Has leukopenia &lt; 2500 leukocytes per µl or thrombocytopenia &lt;100 000 thrombocytes per
             µl.

          -  Has any systemic disease, which can influence his/her safety and compliance, or the
             evaluation of the disability.

          -  Has thromboembolic disease that needs anticoagulative treatment.
