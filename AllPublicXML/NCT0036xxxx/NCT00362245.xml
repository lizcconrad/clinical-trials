      The limited available data precludes establishing an antibiotic regimen in patients suffering
      from bacterial meningitis after head trauma, or spontaneous bleeding Understanding the
      disposition of Amikacin administered intrathecally will enable to propose rational treatment
      of these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Culture proved bacterial meningitis where the prescribed therapy includes the use of
             systemic and intraventricular amikacin therapy.

          2. The included patient should have an intraventricular catheter placed for
             intraventricular pressure measurement and admitted to an intensive care unit.

          3. Blood creatinine concentration up to 1.49 mg/dL measured at the inclusion day.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients or legal guardians who refuse to participate in the study.

          2. Known allergy to amikacin.

          3. Blood creatinine concentration of 1.5 mg/dL or higher.

          4. Subjects without intraventricular catheter who will need repeated lumbar punctures for
             CSF amikacin determinations.

          5. Patients suffering from known chronic liver disease.
