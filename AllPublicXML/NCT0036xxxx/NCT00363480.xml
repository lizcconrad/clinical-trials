  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of asthma patients are not well controlled, despite the availability of asthma
      medication that could effectively treat the disease. In this study uncontrolled patients who
      are steroid-naive or on low dose inhaled corticosteroids will be treated with Seretide
      (salmeterol/fluticasone combination, SFC) 50/250 µg twice daily. The asthma control test
      (ACT) will be used to detect differences in the level of asthma control during treatment. The
      study aims to show a correlation between improvements of ACT und the level of asthma control
      which will be reached by the patients.

      The aim of the study is to show that most of symptomatic asthma patients can reach 'well
      controlled asthma' with SFC. We get information about ACT in daily practice and physicians
      are trained to use the asthma control test as a screening tool and for follow up of asthma
      management. Correlations are expected between the improvements in ACT, Quality of Life and
      asthma control according to the Gaining Optimal Asthma controL (GOAL) criteria.

    <measure>Percentage of Well Controlled Participants as Per Gaining Optimal Asthma Control (GOAL) Criteria After 12 Week Compared to Percentage of Participants With Asthma Control Test (ACT) Score of 20-25 for Week 9 to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 9 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A week with well controlled asthma, when two or more of the criteria were fulfilled (diary entries): At most 2 days per week with 24-hour symptom score &gt;1 (Range: 0= None to 5= severe), rescue salbutamol use on &lt;= 2 days and at most 4 occasions per week, and a morning peak flow &gt;= 80% of the predicted value on each day per week. All of the criteria which includes no night-time awakenings due to asthma (diary entry), no emergency visits (diary entry), no exacerbations and no treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment change are fulfilled. The total ACT score is based on a range of 5 to 25. Higher score indicates better asthma control. A score of 19 or less may be a sign that asthma symptoms are not under control.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 3) up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>For the level of asthma control, baseline values were derived taking the last 8 weeks during the pre-treatment period prior to Visit 3 into consideration. Regarding derived variables based on the asthma diary, data from the last week prior to Visit 3 was taken. Visit 3, regarded as baseline. AQLQ has 32 questions regarding activities, emotions, symptoms, and environmental triggers. Each item values range from 1 (maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment). A positive change from baseline score indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Participants received the combination product, fluticasone 250 microgram (mcg) plus salmeterol 50 mcg (SFC 50/250 mcg) for 12 weeks. Study treatment was received using DISKUS™ powder inhalers, one dose in morning and evening. Study medication was dispensed at visits 3, 4, and 5 for 30 days each. The participants were provided with salbutamol rescue medication if they developed acute asthmatic symptoms. This medication was provided in metered dose inhalers containing at least 200 puffs of 100 mcg salbutamol. Use of rescue medications was recorded in the participant's asthma diaries. Stable dosages of other concomitant medications were allowed if they had no impact on the outcome criteria.</description>

          <title>SFC 50/250 mcg</title>
          <description>Participants received the combination product, fluticasone 250 microgram (mcg) plus salmeterol 50 mcg (SFC 50/250 mcg) for 12 weeks. Study treatment was received using DISKUS™ powder inhalers, one dose in morning and evening. Study medication was dispensed at visits 3, 4, and 5 for 30 days each. The participants were provided with salbutamol rescue medication if they developed acute asthmatic symptoms. This medication was provided in metered dose inhalers containing at least 200 puffs of 100 mcg salbutamol. Use of rescue medications was recorded in the participant’s asthma diaries. Stable dosages of other concomitant medications were allowed if they had no impact on the outcome criteria.</description>

        <description>A week with well controlled asthma, when two or more of the criteria were fulfilled (diary entries): At most 2 days per week with 24-hour symptom score &gt;1 (Range: 0= None to 5= severe), rescue salbutamol use on &lt;= 2 days and at most 4 occasions per week, and a morning peak flow &gt;= 80% of the predicted value on each day per week. All of the criteria which includes no night-time awakenings due to asthma (diary entry), no emergency visits (diary entry), no exacerbations and no treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment change are fulfilled. The total ACT score is based on a range of 5 to 25. Higher score indicates better asthma control. A score of 19 or less may be a sign that asthma symptoms are not under control.</description>

        <description>The total ACT score is based on a range of 5 to 25. Higher score indicates better asthma control. A score of 19 or less may be a sign that asthma symptoms not under control. In order to derive the total ACT score, all 5 questions had to be answered. Change from baseline value was calculated by subtracting baseline value from week 12 value. The assessments recorded at Visit 3 were considered as Baseline assessments.</description>

        <description>Well controlled or totally controlled asthma assessments were done according to the GOAL criteria. A week with well controlled asthma, when two or more of the criteria were fulfilled (diary entries): At most 2 days per week with 24-hour symptom score &gt;1(Range: 0= None to 5= severe), rescue salbutamol use on &lt;= 2 days and at most 4 occasions per week, and morning peak flow &gt;= 80% of the predicted value on each day per week. All of the criteria which included no night-time awakenings due to asthma (diary entry),no emergency visits (diary entry), no exacerbations and no treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment change were fulfilled. The total ACT score was based on a range of 5 to 25. Higher score indicates better asthma control. A score of 19 or less may be a sign that asthma symptoms are not under control.

Regarding derived variables based on the asthma diary, data from the last week prior to Visit 3 was taken. Visit 3, regarded as baseline. AQLQ has 32 questions regarding activities, emotions, symptoms, and environmental triggers. Each item values range from 1 (maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment). A positive change from baseline score indicates improvement.</description>

            <description>Participants received SFC 50/250 mcg for 12 weeks. Study treatment was received using DISKUS powder inhalers, one dose in morning and evening. Study medication was dispensed at visits 3, 4, and 5 for 30 days each. The participants were provided with salbutamol rescue medication if they developed acute asthmatic symptoms. This medication was provided in metered dose inhalers containing at least 200 puffs of 100 mcg salbutamol. Use of rescue medications was recorded in the participant’s asthma diaries. Stable dosages of other concomitant medications were allowed if they had no impact on the outcome criteria.</description>
