  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study where researchers are collecting blood to evaluate the genetic
      characteristics of individuals with chronic lung diseases, including asthma, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and lung
      cancer.

      The investigators hope to be able to identify an association between a genetic make-up in the
      blood samples and the risks of developing a particular lung disease, or severity of a lung
      disease. The findings of this study might be important to develop future preventative methods
      and potential treatments for the management of lung disease. The investigators aim to collect
      blood samples from 300 people with lung disease and 300 controls over 5 years.

      In this study, a small amount of blood for extraction of DNA for the study of the genetic
      basis of lung disease will be obtained from each subject. The collected blood (cells and
      serum) will be used for genetic testing in studies relating to the genetic material and/or
      gene expression, and/or studies of proteins or other substances in serum (the liquid portion
      of the blood after it has been allowed to clot). Because these latter protein studies will
      occur at a future date, the serum will be stored for use in these studies.

        Individuals visiting the Starr-5 Pulmonary, Critical Care Unit, and 5 West floor for
        standard clinical care will be recruited. Controls will be obtained from volunteers without
        a history of lung disease.
