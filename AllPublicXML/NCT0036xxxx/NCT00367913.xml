    <textblock>
      To date key drugs in the treatment of MAIS, M.malmoense and M.xenopi (Opportunist
      Mycobacteria have been rifampicin and ethambutol. Clarithromycin and Ciprofloxacin are active
      in vitro against these species of mycobacteria. The primary aim of this study was to compare
      these to agents as supplements to rifampicin and ethambutol. A secondary aim was to assess
      the vale of immunotherapy with M.vaccae.
