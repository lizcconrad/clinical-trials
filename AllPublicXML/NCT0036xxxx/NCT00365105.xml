      RATIONALE: Zoledronate, vitamin D and calcium may prevent or delay bone pain and other
      symptoms caused by bone metastases. It is not yet known whether giving zoledronate together
      with vitamin D and calcium is more effective with or without strontium 89 or samarium 153 in
      treating patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer, lung cancer, or breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying zoledronate, vitamin D, and calcium to
      see how well they work compared to zoledronate, vitamin D, calcium, and either strontium 89
      or samarium 153 in preventing or delaying bone problems in patients with bone metastases from
      prostate cancer, lung cancer, or breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of zoledronate, vitamin D, and calcium with or without strontium
           chloride Sr 89 or samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium, in terms of preventing or
           delaying the time to development of malignant skeletal-related events (SREs) (defined as
           a pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, or radiation to
           bone) in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate, lung, or breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the rate of SREs at 1 year in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on pain control in these patients.

        -  Evaluate resource utilization and cost effectiveness of these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to primary disease site (prostate vs breast vs lung) and number of bone metastases
      (≤ 2 vs &gt; 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes once a month. Patients also
           receive oral vitamin D and oral calcium once daily. Treatment continues in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive zoledronate, vitamin D, and calcium as in arm I. Within 6 weeks
           of beginning study treatment, patients also receive a single dose of either strontium
           chloride Sr 89 IV or samarium Sm 153 lexidronam pentasodium IV.

      Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline and then at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months from
      start of protocol treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 352 patients will be accrued for this study.

            <groups_desc>Assuming an exponential distribution, the weighted yearly SRE hazard rate for patients treated with bisphosphonates only is 0.7991 which translates to a median time to SRE of 10.4 months. The study was designed to show a 33% relative reduction in the yearly SRE hazard rate, i.e. 15.6 months median time to SRE. Using a two-sided log-rank test assuming a type I error of 0.05, one planned interim analysis with 90% statistical power, 257 SREs are required with a total of 316 patients.</groups_desc>
