  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether DCE-MRI can detect changes of active disease
      in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of etanercept.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current literature shows the promise of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing
      response to therapy in RA but the heterogeneity of the methodology and the semi-quantitative
      nature of the image analysis limits its applicability. To evaluate the ability of DCE-MRI to
      serve as a biomarker for treatment-induced changes in RA associated synovial inflammation,
      the reproducibility of the measurement and an effect size are required. Additional endpoints
      such as synovial volume, bone erosion progression and bone marrow edema-like changes may also
      prove useful for short-term assessment of a therapeutic intervention, but have not been
      explored in the context of a pharmacodynamic biomarker. It is therefore critical to conduct a
      carefully designed longitudinal study, focused on identifying the key parameters related to
      the instrumentation and data analysis, to fully evaluate the potential utility of MRI in an
      early clinical development setting. Importantly, this study will also demonstrate the
      feasibility of using DCE-MRI at multiple centers to acquire useful information that will
      drive program decisions.

    <measure>Percent Change in Synovial Transfer Constant (Ktrans) From Days 1-29</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in transfer constant (Ktrans) for dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of the wrist from study day 1 to study day 29. Ktrans reflects contrast delivery (capillary blood flow) and transport across the vascular endothelium (capillary permeability-surface area product), with the dominant factor depending on whether delivery is flow or permeability limited. A Ktrans value of zero indicates the absence of disease (ie, no leakage of the contrast agent into the synovial volume); therefore, an increase in this parameter indicates worsening disease (ie, greater permeability of the synovial membrane).</description>

        <description>Percent change in transfer constant (Ktrans) for dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of the wrist from study day 1 to study day 29. Ktrans reflects contrast delivery (capillary blood flow) and transport across the vascular endothelium (capillary permeability-surface area product), with the dominant factor depending on whether delivery is flow or permeability limited. A Ktrans value of zero indicates the absence of disease (ie, no leakage of the contrast agent into the synovial volume); therefore, an increase in this parameter indicates worsening disease (ie, greater permeability of the synovial membrane).</description>
