      Overall 80% of diabetic patients with low vision are in the nonproliferative stage and the
      main cause of decreased visual acuity is macular edema.

      According to the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS), the treatment of choice
      for diabetic macular edema (DME) is laser therapy, which may be neither effective nor
      curative in some patients.There are many cases which are refractory to laser treatment or not
      suitable candidates for it.

      Corticosteroids might have a beneficial effect on DME. They have been used with different
      doses and routes (periocular,intravitreal,and slow released implants) for a variety of
      retinal diseases.

      Recently, a few prospective randomized studies, concerning the effect of intravitreal
      triamcinolone acetonide (IVT) on DME have been published. In their two-year results, Gillies
      et al. concluded that IVT improved vision and reduced macular thickness in eyes with
      refractory diabetic macular edema. They showed that this beneficial effect persisted for up
      to 2 years with repeated treatment.

      We also conducted a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the safety and
      efficacy of IVT for intractable DME. Besides, we tried to evaluate the effect of this
      intervention on angiographic findings of these patients.
