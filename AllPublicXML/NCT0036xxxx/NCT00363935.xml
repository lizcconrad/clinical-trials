    <textblock>
      After obtaining informed consent,80 morbidly obese ASA II-III patients undergoing
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery procedures would be randomly assigned to one of four study
      groups at UTSWMC at Dallas.Hemodynamic paarameters, recovery times, postoperative pain
      scores, the need for rescue analgesics and side effects will be recorded.The purpose of this
      study is to determine the optimal linfusion rate of dexmedetomidine for maintaining
      cardiovscular stability during general anesthesia.
