  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to collect data on the medical management of patients presenting
      to the Emergency Department who are treated for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) in a
      hospital setting that has incorporated a disease management program for heart failure.

  <detailed_description>

      This is an Observational (individuals are observed or certain outcomes are measured. no
      attempt is made to affect the outcome), multi-center registry study of patients presenting to
      the Emergency Department (ED) for treatment of known or suspected Acute Decompensated Heart
      Failure (ADHF). Data will be collected on the medical management of patients presenting to
      the ED who are treated for ADHF in a hospital setting incorporating a disease management
      program for heart failure. The study will evaluate change in clinical management and outcomes
      of ADHF patients treated in the ED after ED implementation of three or more components of a
      disease management program for heart failure. The results are intended to assist hospitals in
      evaluating and improving quality of care for patients with ADHF by tracking quality
      indicators and providing site-specific benchmark reports and national benchmark reports. This
      registry considers patients treated with any therapy for ADHF

        The study population consists of all consecutive adults patients seen in the Emergency
        department of an acute care hospital and treated actively for Acute Decompensated Heart
        Failure (ADHF) where the condition is defined clinically as new onset of Heart Failure with
        decompensation or chronic heart failure with decompensation. Patient eligibility is based
        upon the presence of a hospital discharge and/or Emergency department diagnosis of ADHF and
        is not tied to the use of any specific therapeutic agent or regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years at the time of ED treatment

          -  Received or is eligible to receive a principal ED and/or hospital discharge diagnosis
             of ADHF

          -  ADHF is present as determined clinically by the patient care team and as documented in
             the DRG (Diagnosis-related Group) or APC (Ambulatory Payment Classifications) codes,
             and ADHF is the focus of treatment

          -  If required by site IRB/IEC patient (or legally acceptable representative) must be
             able to give informed consent for participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ADHF is present as a co-morbid condition, but is not a principal focus of diagnosis or
             treatment during this ED or hospital episode

          -  Patient was not treated in ED during this episode of care

          -  Participation in any clinical trial that precludes use of a Disease Management Program
             (specific component of the disease are managed in an integrated manner by a team of
             physicians, pharmacists, nurses and communication experts)
