  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells
      to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing
      substances to them. Giving bortezomib together with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with rituximab works as
      first-line therapy in treating patients with low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      This is a multicenter, prospective study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, 15, and
           22. Patients also receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1 and on day 1
           of all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 35 days for 3 courses. Patients
           achieving a complete response, partial response, or stable disease proceed to
           maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Beginning 6-8 weeks after induction therapy, patients receive
           bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds and rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 60
           days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study treatment.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

    <description>On days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of the 1st cycle, bortezomib will be administered intravenously (through a vein) over 3-5 seconds followed by an intravenous infusion of rituximab. How long it will take to infuse the dose of rituximab is dependent upon your weight and how well you tolerate the infusion; it is estimated this first infusion may take between 3-4 hours. During subsequent cycles, bortezomib will again be given on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. However, rituximab will only be given on day 1 of each cycle.</description>
