      This is a randomized primary prevention trial to compare the LDL lowering effects of an
      alternative regimen to statins(simvastatin) This alternative regimen is over the counter and
      available at health food stores. The alternative regimen consists of lifestyle changes
      including a Mediterranean Diet,exercise program, and stress reduction, with red yeast rice
      1200 mg twice per day and fish oil 6 grams/day. The second group, run at the same time will
