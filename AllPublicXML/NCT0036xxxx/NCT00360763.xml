  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The autoantibodies against AT1 receptor (ATR-AA), behaving like an agonist were detected in
      patients with hypertension. ATR-AA which can blocked by ARB may play a role in the
      pathogenesis of hypertension. The present study is to explore whether AT1 receptor blocker
      has superior anti-hypertensive effect in patients with positive ATR-AA hypertension. Patients
      with 2 grade hypertension were recruited and ATR-AA was assayed by ELISA. A study was carried
      out and the efficacy of anti-hypertension was compared between candesartan cilexetil and ACE
      inhibitor imidapril.
