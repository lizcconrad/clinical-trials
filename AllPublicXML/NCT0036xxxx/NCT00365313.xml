      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Esomeparzole with Placebo in the
      Prevention of Recurrent Ulcer Bleeding in Patients Receiving a COX-2 Inhibitor
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among patients with previous ulcer bleeding, neither nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) nor a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor adequately
      prevents recurrent ulcer bleeding.

      The aim is to investigate whether adding a PPI to a COX-2 inhibitor is superior to a COX-2
      inhibitor alone for the prevention of recurrent ulcer bleeding in high-risk patients.

      Patients with arthritis who presented with NSAID-induced ulcer bleeding were eligible if they
      had healed ulcers on follow-up endoscopy; were H. pylori negative or eradicated; and required
      regular NSAIDs. After the ulcers had healed, all patients received celecoxib 200 mg b.i.d.
      They were randomly assigned to esomeprazole 20 mg b.i.d. or its placebo for 12 months. The
      primary endpoint was recurrent ulcer bleeding.

      Results Intention-to-treat analysis included 273 patients (137 received esomeprazole and 136
      received placebo). Recurrent ulcer bleeding occurred in none receiving esomeprazole and 8
      patients receiving placebo. The 12-month cumulative incidence of recurrent bleeding was 0% in
      the esomeprazole group and 8.9% in the placebo group (difference, 8.9 percentage points; 95%
      confidence interval for the difference, 4.1 to 13.7; P=0.0004). During follow-up, 16.1% of
      patients in the esomeprazole group and 15.4% in the placebo group used low-dose aspirin.
      Among patients who did not use aspirin, the cumulative incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding
      was 0% in the esomeprazole group and 7.1% in the placebo group (difference, 7.1 percentage
      points; 95% confidence interval, 2.4 to 11.8; P=0.004).

      Conclusion Among patients with arthritis who have previous NSAID-induced ulcer bleeding,
      adding a PPI to a COX-2 inhibitor is superior to a COX-2 inhibitor alone for the prevention
      of recurrent ulcer bleeding.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criteria were ulcer healing confirmed by follow-up endoscopy, a negative
             test for Helicobacter pylori or successful eradication of Helicobacter pylori based on
             histology, and anticipated regular use of NSAIDs for the duration of the trial. The
             exclusion criteria were concomitant use of low-dose aspirin, anticoagulants or
             corticosteroids; a history of gastric or duodenal surgery other than a patch repair;
             the presence of erosive esophagitis, gastric outlet obstruction, renal failure
             (defined by a serum creatinine level of more than 2.26 mg per deciliter), terminal
             illness, or cancer.
