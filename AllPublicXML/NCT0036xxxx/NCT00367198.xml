    <textblock>
      The mortality rate in chronic hemodialysis (CHD) patients remains excessively high and
      approaches 21% per year. Among the many factors that adversely affects patient outcome is
      uremic malnutrition, a unique form of deranged nutritional status. It is associated with
      increased hospitalization and death risk in CHD patients. Several measures have been
      identified to prevent uremic malnutrition in CHD patients, including efforts to optimize
      dialysis regimen and dietary protein and energy intake. A large number of CHD patients suffer
      from uremic malnutrition in spite of these aggressive measures. The inevitable protein
      catabolic effects of the hemodialysis procedure are important factors leading to increased
      prevalence of uremic malnutrition. Preliminary data suggest that oral nutritional
      supplementation administered during the hemodialysis procedure counteracts these protein
      catabolic effects and leads to net protein anabolism in the acute setting. In this proposal,
      we hypothesize that Pro-Stat, a high nitrogen, enzyme-hydrolyzed, tryptophan-fortified,
      collagen protein supplement will reverse the net protein catabolism observed during
      hemodialysis procedure.
