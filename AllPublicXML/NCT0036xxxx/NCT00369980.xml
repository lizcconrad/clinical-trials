  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      L-[3-18F]-α–methyltyrosine (FMT) is amino-acid tracer for positron emission tomography (PET),
      and is used for tumor detection because malignant tumor cells accumulate 18F-FMT based on the
      increased expression of amino-acid transporter. This study was conducted to investigate a
      usefulness of 18F-FMT PET in combination with 18F-FDG PET for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in
      patients with suspected malignancy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients were required to have histologically proven noncaseating epithelioid
             cell granuloma and at least one disease that the possibility of coexistent malignancy
             could not be excluded as follows; 1) extrapulmonary lesions mimicking malignant
             diseases including systemic lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenic involvement, or other
             lesions, 2) multiple nodular lesions mimicking pulmonary metastasis, 3) the occurrence
             of BHL in cancer patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients that PET imaging using 18F-FDG and 18F-FMT was performed before
             establishment of the final diagnosis of sarcoidosis, patients undergoing treatment for
             sarcoidosis before the PET study, and patient having diabetes mellitus.
