    <textblock>
      This study is designed to see if some tests of hand movement, strength, and function are
      valid for children with burns.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children will be given a battery of tests to determine the validity of these measures for
      children with severe hand burns. The tests include:

        -  Pinch and grip strength;

        -  Stereognosis;

        -  Speed of manipulation using the Nine Hole Peg Test, Box &amp; Blocks Test, and the Moberg
           Pickup Test;

        -  Measurement of Range of Motion of the wrist and fingers.

    <measure>Blocks &amp; Box (Standardized Test).</measure>

    <description>Children are asked to move as many blocks as possible from one box to another in one minute. The number of blocks moved is the score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of Motion, Total Active Motion (TAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' degrees of hand motion are measured by a trained therapist and recorded. Total Active Motion is a measure of finger range of motion that can be used to predict functional movement of the hand. The TAM is the sum of the degrees of active motion of each of the three joints of the fingers, and two joints of the thumb. For this study we also included wrist motion. Full TAM is 1,455 degrees of motion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of grip strength in pounds using a dynamometer. The subject squeezes the dynamometer as hard as possible for three trials separated by a short rest. The mean of the three trials is the score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Moberg Pickup Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Seconds to pick up all 12 objects</time_frame>
    <description>The child picks up 12 small objects such as a coin, safety pin and paper clip one at a time and puts them in a container. The time in seconds to complete the task is the score.</description>
