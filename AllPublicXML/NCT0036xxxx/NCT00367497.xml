  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is difficult to handle once it relapses or becomes
      refractory to chemotherapy. Various second or third line chemotherapies, which are called
      salvage chemotherapy, were developed without promising results. Improvement in efficacy by
      adding relatively new agent, rituximab, to chemotherapy is now widely accepted in
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study will test the safety and efficacy of adding rituximab to
      existing salvage chemotherapy, ESHAP (R-ESHAP). Our aim is also to proceed to high-dose
      chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after successful R-ESHAP
      therapy.
