  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to investigate the effects of rhGH treatment on glucose,
      protein and fat metabolism in GHD children. Specifically, the investigators will measure the
      rates of glucose production, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, insulin sensitivity and
      glucagon response before and after treatment with rhGH. In addition, the investigators will
      study changes in protein and fat metabolism pre and post rhGH therapy in children with GHD.
      The findings in the GHD children will be compared to those of a control group of age and sex
      matched healthy children.

      Hypotheses: H1- The fraction of glucose derived from gluconeogenesis is decreased and that
      from glycogenolysis is increased in the post-absorptive state in untreated GHD children when
      compared to healthy children. H2- Treatment with rhGH will not change the overall glucose
      turnover but will normalize the abnormal partitioning of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
      in GHD children. H3- GH replacement will reduce urea production and increase estimates of
      protein synthesis, thus optimizing the availability of amino acids for growth. H4- Untreated
      children with GHD after an overnight fast will have an increased glucagon challenge response
      that will decrease after 8 weeks of treatment with rhGH.

      Specific Aims: In healthy and newly diagnosed GHD children the investigators will: 1. Measure
      the Glucose Production Rate (GPR) 2. Determine the fraction of glucose derived from
      gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis 3. Estimate insulin sensitivity 4. Measure proteolysis and
      protein oxidation 5. Determine glucagon challenge response after an overnight fast. The
      above-mentioned parameters will be re-evaluated in the children with GHD after 8 weeks of
      rhGH therapy.

    <textblock>
      Children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) have increased insulin sensitivity and may
      present with hypoglycemia during infancy. Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone
      (rhGH) reduces the risk for hypoglycemia and decreases insulin sensitivity. The investigators
      hypothesize, that GHD causes a decrease in the fraction of glucose derived form
      gluconeogenesis and conversely glycogenolysis and insulin sensitivity will be increased, when
      GHD children are compared to healthy controls. The investigators anticipate that total
      glucose production will be unaffected by rhGH therapy. Therefore, the GDH subjects treated
      with rhGH for 8 weeks will have an increase in the fraction of glucose derived form
      gluconeogenesis and a decrease in that form glycogenolysis and decreased insulin sensitivity.
      To test this hypothesis, 10 healthy and 10 GHD children will be studied using the stable
      isotope [U-13C] glucose and Mass Isotopes Distribution Analysis (MIDA). The investigators
      will be specifically measuring the rate of glucose production, gluconeogenesis,
      glycogenolysis, insulin sensitivity and glucagon response after an overnight fast. In
      addition, the investigators will measure changes in protein oxidation, proteolysis and fat
      metabolism using the stable isotopes [15N2] urea, [1-13C] leucine and concentrations of free
      fatty acids and b-hydroxybutyrate. The GHD group will be studied at the time of diagnosis and
      after 8 weeks of rhGH.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study population will consist of children with newly diagnosed growth hormone
        deficiency (GHD), between the ages of 1-17 years. The clinical evidence will be provided by
        one or more of the following criteria: delayed bone age, growth deceleration, short stature
        (more than 2 SD bellow the mean for the subject's age) and/ or height more than1.5 SD below
        the predicted mid-parental height. The biochemical diagnosis of GHD will be established by
        an abnormal growth hormone stimulation test and low IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 (growth factors). The
        growth hormone stimulation test will be performed following the standard Endocrinology
        Clinic protocol. The growth hormone stimulation test is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; to
        diagnose Growth Hormone Deficiency. This test is part of the standard clinical practice to
        diagnosed GHD. An abnormal test is defined as a post stimulation Growth Hormone level less
        than10 ng/mL.

        The control group will include healthy children between the ages of 1-17 years, not taking
        any medication with a normal weight for height and growth factors (IGF-1 and IGFBP-3).&quot;

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria will include for both groups age less than 1 or more than 17 y/o,
        evidence of anemia (hemoglobin less tan 12 mg/dl), the use of medications that can directly
        impact blood sugar (steroids, oral contraceptives etc), history or proof of chemical abuse,
        lack of supportive family environment, allergies to local anesthetics and elevated liver
        enzymes. The GHD children will have a head MRI, and children with evidence of tumors or
        space occupying lesions will be excluded. GHD subjects with adrenal insufficiency and or
        hypothyroidism. will not be considered for the study.
