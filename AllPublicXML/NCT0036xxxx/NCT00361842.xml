  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CPX-1 is effective in patients with
      advanced colorectal cancer who have already received chemotherapy that included the drug
      oxaliplatin or irinotecan. All patients will receive CPX-1 at a dose of 210 units/m2 over 90
      minutes every two weeks.

      CPX-1 Liposome Injection is a liposomal formulation of a fixed combination of the
      antineoplastic drugs irinotecan HCl and floxuridine. The two drugs are present inside the
      liposome in a fixed 1:1 molar ratio. CPX-1 was developed as a means of delivering and
      preserving a fixed 1:1 molar ratio of the two drugs. This ratio was found in vitro and in
      vivo models of cancer to have synergistic anti-cancer activity and preservation and delivery
      of this ratio is important because other ratios of these two drugs have been found to be
      antagonistic or only additive. Both floxuridine and irinotecan HCl are active
      chemotherapeutic agents, each approved for clinical use in the United States and Canada for
      colorectal cancer. Current practice routinely administers 5- fluorouracil with irinotecan in
      combination regimens in first or second line treatment without the means of preserving the
      synergistic ratio.
