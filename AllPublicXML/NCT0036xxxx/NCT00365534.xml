    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is widely used for the investigation of lower gastrointestinal tract
      disease.However,colonoscopy remains a technically difficult procedure. As the colon is a
      mobile organ, looping may occur when the colonoscope passes through.Hence,reducing looping
      during procedure is very improtant to achieve succes as well as patient
      acceptance.Recently,some studies shown that cap-assisted colonoscopy(CAC)allow better
      visualisation of the colonic folds, thus increase success rate.However, previous studies
      shown that magnetic endoscope imaging (MEI)is useful as an adjunct to assist endoscopist in
      performing the procedure and as a modality to look for the mechanism of looping. Because of
      such concern,our study is to compare the mechanism of looping formation and acceptance of CAC
      and regular colonoscopy by MEI.
