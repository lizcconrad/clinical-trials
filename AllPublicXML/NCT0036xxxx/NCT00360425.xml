      This trial will be conducted in order to provide an evaluation of the potential of
      ferumoxytol to cause cardiac arrhythmia in accordance with the International Conference on
      Harmonization (ICH) E14 guidance. The purpose of this trial is to define the effects of
      ferumoxytol on electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Pharmacokinetics will also be evaluated at
      multiple time points as specified. Subject safety will be monitored throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects currently participating in a clinical trial with another investigational new
             drug or device or who have received an investigational new drug or device within 30
             days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to randomization into this study.

          -  Subjects who have evidence or history of clinically significant allergic (except for
             untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing), hematological,
             endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, or
             neurological disease. Exceptions to these criteria (e.g., stable, mild joint disease)
             may be made following discussions with the Medical Monitor.

          -  Subjects who have donated blood or blood components within four weeks prior to the
