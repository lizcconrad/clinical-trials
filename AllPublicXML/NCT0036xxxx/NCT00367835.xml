  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Oppositional Subscale of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised Long Form (CPRS-R:L) Score at Up to 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The oppositional subscale of the CPRS-R:L contains 10 items designed to reflect criteria for oppositional defiance disorder (ODD). Each item is scored on a range from 0 (not true at all) to 3 (very much true) with total scores ranging from 0 to 30. Higher scores are reflective of more severe symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) Total Score at Up to 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV consists of 18 items scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms) with total score ranging from 0 to 54.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S assesses the severity of the subject's condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement on Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I consists of a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Improvement is defined as a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the 40-Item Conduct Problem Scale of the New York Parent's Rating Scale-School-aged (NYPRS-S) Score at Up to 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each item on the NYPRS-S is scored from a range of 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much) with total scores ranging from 0 to 120. Higher scores are reflective of increased disease severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Parent Stress Index-Short Form (PSI/SF) Score at Up to 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The response to each of the 36 items on the PSI/SF is converted to a five-point scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree) with total scores ranging from 36 to 180. A higher score is reflective of less stress for the parents.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Overall Satisfaction on the Medication Satisfaction Survey (MSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Medication Satisfaction Survey (MSS) consists of 11 questions each being answered with one of six responses (strongly agree, agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, disagree, strongly disagree). Overall satisfaction with their child taking the study medication, Question #11, with a response of &quot;strongly agree&quot; or &quot;agree&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Electrocardiogram Results (QTcF Interval) at Up to 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>QTcF is the QT interval using Fridericia's correction formula. QT interval is a measure of time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave and is dependent on the heart rate (e.g., the faster the heart rate, the shorter the QT interval). The QT interval has to be corrected in order to aid interpretation.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>217 subjects were randomized (138 to SPD503 and 79 to placebo). However, only 214 subjects received at least one dose of study medication (136 for SPD503 and 78 for placebo). Therefore, 214 subjects constitute the safety population.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Electrocardiogram Results (QTcF Interval) at Up to 8 Weeks</title>
        <description>QTcF is the QT interval using Fridericia's correction formula. QT interval is a measure of time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave and is dependent on the heart rate (e.g., the faster the heart rate, the shorter the QT interval). The QT interval has to be corrected in order to aid interpretation.</description>
