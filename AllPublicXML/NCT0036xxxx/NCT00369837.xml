    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of clevidipine for treating severely
      elevated blood pressure, defined as systolic (SBP) &gt;180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure
      (DBP) &gt;115 mmHg assessed on 2 successive occasions 15 minutes apart at baseline, in patients
      with or without major organ injury, particularly with respect to controlled dose adjustment
      to desired effect and prolonged continuous infusion. Enrollment of patients into the study
      was to continue until the target goal of 100 patients with at least 18 hours of continuous
      clevidipine treatment, including a minimum of 50 patients with acute or chronic end-organ
      injury, was met.

    <description>A patient-specific blood pressure target range (TR) of ≥20 mm Hg and ≤40 mm Hg SBP was prespecified by the investigator. Once established, clevidipine (0.5 mg/mL in 20% lipid emulsion) intravenous infusion was initiated at 2.0 mg/h and maintained for the first 3 minutes. Clevidipine was up-titrated, as tolerated by the patient, by doubling the dose every 3 minutes until the prespecified systolic blood pressure (SBP) target range was achieved and could continue to be titrated up or down to maintain the desired long-term SBP reduction.</description>

    <description>Clevidipine was required to be administered continuously for a minimum of 18 hours and a maximum of 96 hours and was not to exceed a rate of 32.0 mg/h at any time. Use of an additional or alternative intravenous antihypertensive agent was allowed if the blood pressure target range was not achieved or maintained. If transition to an oral antihypertensive agent is required, then approximately 1 hour prior to the anticipated cessation of clevidipine infusion, but no less than at the 18-hour time point, an oral antihypertensive agent was allowed to be administered as clevidipine was down-titrated or terminated as needed in order to achieve the desired blood pressure level..</description>
