    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to perform a pilot investigation to determine if opioid
      peptides such as casomorphin can be detected in human plasma after cheese ingestion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cheese is one of the most commonly craved foods, suggesting the possibility of opiate
      activity, as has been demonstrated with other craved foods, particularly chocolate. Like
      other dairy products, cheese contains casein, which is the major protein in cow's milk. This
      is unlike human milk, in which the primary protein is whey. Casein includes αs1-, αs2-, β- ,
      and κ-casein, with αs1 and β forms predominating. Human and bovine casein molecules are
      cleaved during digestion to release opioid peptides that are believed to have biological
      properties relevant to infant physiology and behavior. Specifically, β-casein is cleaved to
      form β-casomorphins. Like other opiate agonists, β-casomorphins prolong gastrointestinal
      transit time and have an antidiarrheal effect.

      Casomorphin receptor binding has been demonstrated in opiate receptor assays and bioassays.
      Duodenal aspirates from human volunteers given cow's milk have demonstrated the presence of
      several casomorphins, particularly β-casomorphin-7. Few studies have assessed the presence or
      action of casomorphins in humans. The ability of casein-derived opioid peptides to pass into
      the bloodstream is not well characterized, and is the subject of the present study.

    <description>On study day 1, approximately half of the participants will consume a breakfast of fruits and vegetables, whereas the other half of participants will consume a meal consisting of 9 oz. of cheese.
Blood samples will be collected from participants immediately prior to consumption of the meals, and then again at regular intervals for up to 8 hours following the meals.
At least 3 days later, participants will return for study Day 2. The participants will receive the second meal. Blood samples will then be collected immediately prior to consumption of the test meal and for up to 8 hours after the meal.</description>
