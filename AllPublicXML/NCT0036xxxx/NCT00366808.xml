  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent survey of trends among the members of the American Society of Cataract and
      Refractive Surgery determined that laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is the leading
      surgical procedure for photorefractive corrections ranging from −0 to 3 diopters (D).1 The
      same survey, however, showed a clear trend of participating refractive surgeons toward
      surface ablation. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) was the first refractive surgery
      procedure approved and performed using the excimer laser. Several techniques of epithelial
      debridement have been tried with PRK-type surgery including mechanical debridement, laser
      transepithelial ablation, a rotating brush, and alcohol debridement.

      The Amadeus II microkeratome (Advanced Medical Optics Inc, Irvine, CA, USA) used for the
      creation of a LASIK flap has an upgradeable platform that will allow the user to perform
      mechanical separation of the corneal epithelium before photorefractive treatments. With the
      use of this device, the corneal epithelium can be separated from the underlying stroma
      without previous preparation of the corneal surface with alcohol. The separated epithelial
      sheet can either be removed or replaced on the operated cornea after photoablation. This
      surgical procedure, which has been called Epi-LASIK, represents an advanced alternative
      surface ablation photorefractive procedure for the correction of ametropia. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the clinical visual outcomes, healing rates, and patient
      satisfaction when performing surface ablation procedures using mechanical vs. alcohol
      separation of the epithelium.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be a candidate for surface ablation procedures in both eyes.

          -  ≥ 18 years of age or older.

          -  Myopia ≤ -6.00 D.

          -  Astigmatism ≤ - 3.00 D.

          -  Manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) of -6.00 D.

          -  Capable of wearing a bandage contact lens.

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of ocular pathology.

          -  Very large pupils (greater than 8mm diameter, infrared measurement).

          -  Thin corneas (preoperatively calculated minimal residual bed &lt; 250 um).

          -  If patient fit into the group of the usual exclusionary criteria (e.g. irregular
             astigmatism, asymmetric astigmatism, unstable refraction - most of these patients
             would not typically be considered LASIK candidates under normal circumstances).

          -  History of previous refractive surgery.

          -  Corneal irregularities potentially affecting visual acuity: keratoconus, corneal
             dystrophy, corneal opacities.

          -  Participation in (or current participation) any investigational drug or device trial
             within the previous 30 days prior to the start date of this trial.

          -  Intraocular conventional surgery within the past three months or intraocular laser
             surgery within one month in the operated eye.

          -  Use of any systemic or topical drug known to interfere with visual performance.

          -  Pregnant or nursing mothers and females of childbearing potential not practicing a
             reliable and medically acceptable method of birth control

          -  Inability or unwillingness of subjects to give written informed consent.
