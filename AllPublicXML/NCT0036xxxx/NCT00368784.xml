  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify the cells of the immune system that cause skin disease
      such as psoriasis and mycosis fungoides. Blood samples from many patients will be compared in
      hopes of finding common cells and molecules responsible for skin diseases. Results of this
      study will increase our knowledge about immune mediated skin disease.

      The aim of the study is to characterized the T cell repertoire of individuals with immune
      mediated skin disease (e.g. psoriasis and mycosis fungoides). Peripheral blood with be
      collected from volunteers with psoriasis, mycosis fungoides and age matched controls. Fifteen
      tablespoons of blood will be collected prior to the initiation of treatment and again after
      the patient shows a clinical response to treatment. The time between blood draws will be no
      less than 3 months. There will be no more than two blood draws per patient. Blood samples
      will be used to determine the patient's HLA haplotype via PCR and DNA sequencing. After the
      patient's haplotype has been established the activated T cell repertoire will be analyzed for
      clonal expansions. Clonal expansions in the T cell repertoire will be determined by
      immunoscope analysis, which is a PCR based technique.
