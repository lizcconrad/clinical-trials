  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an HIV vaccine given as three nasal
      immunisations with a protein from HIV virus mixed with a toxoid adjuvant, followed by two
      intramuscular immunisations with the same protein mixed with a liquid adjuvant, causes
      untoward adverse reactions when administered to healthy adult volunteers. An initial
      evaluation of immune responses to the vaccine will also be undertaken.

      immunisations with a protein from HIV virus mixed with a toxoid adjuvant, followed by two
      intramuscular immunisations with the same protein mixed with a liquid adjuvant, causes
      untoward adverse reactions when administered to healthy adult volunteers. An initial
      evaluation of immune responses to the vaccine will also be undertaken by measuring gp140- and
      LTK63-specific IgG and IgA in cervical secretions, vaginal secretions, serum and nasal wash.
      IFNg secretion of T cells in response to gp140 peptide stimulation will be undertaken along
      with neutralising assays.

             form following a detailed written explanation of participation in the protocol.

             examination and clinical judgement.

          -  They are available for the duration of the study

          -  They are women who, if capable of becoming pregnant during the study, have agreed to
             have a pregnancy test immediately before immunisation, and to use appropriate
             contraception methods during the whole study period.

             any nasal disease, malignancy or abnormality discovered at time of screening.

          -  They have a known or suspected history of severe seasonal allergies and allergic
             rhinitis (requiring medication), recurrent nose bleeds, asthma, or cardio-pulmonary
             disease, or any of these conditions discovered at time of screening.

          -  They present in the samples obtained at the screening visit:

          -  They have a known impairment of immune function or are receiving immunosuppressive
             therapy (including systemic or inhaled steroids, but excluding topical).

          -  They are receiving any medications via nasal route.

          -  They have any acute infections (including fever greater than or equal to 38Â°C) or any
