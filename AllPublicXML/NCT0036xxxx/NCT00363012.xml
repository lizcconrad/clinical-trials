      RATIONALE: Studying the immune response to a vaccine made from HER2/neu protein may help
      doctors plan better treatment for patients with breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the immune response in patients who have undergone
      vaccine therapy for stage III or stage IV breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether immunologic memory to the HER-2/neu (HER2) intracellular domain (ICD)
           protein has been generated by active immunization with a HER2 ICD plasmid-based vaccine
           by assessing the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to HER2 ICD peptides 6 months
           after vaccination in patients with HER2-overexpressing stage III or IV breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the memory T-cell population and quantitate memory precursor frequency at
           3, 6, and 12 months after active immunization using intracellular cytokine staining.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive HER2 intracellular domain (ICD) protein mixture intradermally and sterile
      water injected intradermally (as a negative control) at 6 months post-vaccination with
      pNGVL3-hICD vaccine. Vital signs and injection site will be monitored prior to skin test and
      at 60 minutes post-test. Patients return 48-72 hours after skin test for delayed-type
      hypersensitivity (DTH) measurements. The injection site is biopsied and examined by
      immunohistochemistry for infiltrating T-cell and antigen-presenting cell populations.

      Blood is drawn at 3, 6, and 12 months post-vaccination for assessment of immune memory
      response. Blood draws are coordinated with parent study. Blood samples are examined by flow
      cytometry for the presence of memory markers including L-selectin, CD45 isoforms, cytokines,
      and CCR7.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56 patients will be accrued for this study.
