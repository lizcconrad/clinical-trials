  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare different types of rehabilitation after coronary
      bypass surgery. The investigators wish to compare rehabilitation in an institution for four
      weeks with a home based rehabilitation. They also wish to compare rehabilitation in an
      institution for four weeks with a rehabilitation program were the patients live at home but
      visit the hospital twice a week for twelve week. The investigators will measure the patients'
      physical capacity by measuring their maximal oxygen consumption. The investigators will also
      analyze their blood and their endothelian function (how well their arteries dilate).

    <description>This intervention was removed. We never got time to randomize subjects into this category. We had planned to randomize patients from one hospital to either Rehabilitation in institution (rehab center) or rehabilitation at the hospital (out patient). And also patients from another hospital to either rehabilitation in institution (rehab centre) or rehabilitation at home. We have only managed to start the study in this second hospital so far (due to maternity leave and limited time to finish a PhD)</description>
