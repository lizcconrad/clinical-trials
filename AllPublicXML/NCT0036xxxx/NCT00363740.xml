  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of an investigational nasal spray
      compared with placebo nasal spray and commonly used drug in the treatment of seasonal
      allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory disorder of the upper airway that
      occurs following allergen exposure. The focus of this study, seasonal allergic rhinitis
      (SAR), is one type of allergic rhinitis that is triggered by the pollen from trees, grasses,
      and weeds. Typical symptoms are sneezing, nasal congestion and pruritus, rhinorrhea, and
      pruritic, watery, red eyes.
