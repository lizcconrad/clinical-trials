  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, research study determining the effects of an investigational
      drug called volociximab in metastatic melanoma.

      The purpose of the study is to compare the clinical benefit and safety of volociximab.
      Pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action will also be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Must give written informed consent and any authorizations required by local law (e.g.,
             Protected Health Information [PHI]).

          2. Aged &gt;=18 years old at the time of informed consent.

          3. Stage III and Stage IV unresectable melanoma with documented progression during or
             following the most recent prior melanoma therapy.

          4. Must have failed at least 1 prior therapy for metastatic disease.

          5. Must have at least 2 cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal metastases that are safely
             accessible for pre treatment and post treatment biopsies.

          6. Must agree to pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies of tumor lesions (subjects in
             Stage 1 only).

          7. Must have at least 1 measurable target lesion for CT/MRI assessment, according to
             RECIST criteria.

          8. ECOG Performance Status &lt;=1.

          9. Acceptable laboratory results

         10. Life expectancy &gt;=12 weeks.

         11. Male subjects and female subjects of child bearing potential must be willing to
             practice effective contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue
             contraception for 4 months after last infusion of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects with any other active malignancy in addition to metastatic melanoma.

          2. CNS metastases, unless stable for at least 2 months following definitive local therapy
             (surgery, stereotactic radiation). Subjects may not require treatment with steroids or
             anticonvulsants.

          3. History of any other significant medical condition, including cardiovascular,
             pulmonary, neurologic, or autoimmune disease; active infections (e.g., bacterial or
             fungal); or a psychiatric condition within 6 months of Day 1

          4. History of hepatitis B or C.

          5. Known history of HIV infection or AIDS.

          6. History of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events, such as stroke, transient
             ischemic attack, deep vein thrombosis, or bleeding disorders within 12 months prior to
             Day 1.

          7. Prior radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy for melanoma
             within 4 weeks prior to Day 1.

          8. Previous exposure to volociximab.

          9. Aspirin, high dose warfarin, or heparin use. (Note: Aspirin &lt;=81 mg/day, low-dose
             warfarin 1 mg/day or low-dose heparin for IV catheter patency is allowed.)

         10. Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to Day 1.

         11. Requirement for immunosuppression, and/or systemic steroid therapy.

         12. Investigational therapies within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 or 4 half lives of the prior
             investigational drug (whichever is longer).

         13. Known hypersensitivity to murine or chimeric antibodies.

         14. Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the subject unsuitable
             for study participation.
