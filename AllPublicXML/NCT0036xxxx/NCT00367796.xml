      This study will try to find the gene changes responsible for the birth defects in
      craniosynostosis, Philadelphia type. Craniosynostosis syndromes are a group of conditions
      that result from closure of one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of the skull
      before brain growth is complete. Because of the premature closure, the brain is not able to
      grow in its natural shape; instead, it compensates with growth in areas of the skull where
      the joints have not yet closed. The defects in raniosynostosis, Philadelphia type, include
      skull malformations and webbing of the fingers and toes. Gene changes known to be involved in
      other craniosynostosis syndromes have not been found in the Philadelphia type syndrome.
      Therefore, finding the genetic basis of this disorder will provide important new information
      regarding craniofacial and limb development.

      This study includes members of a single large family affected with craniosynostosis,
      Philadelphia type.

      Participants have 1 to 2 teaspoons of blood drawn for genetic studies. A second blood sample
      may be requested for further research. Some blood may be used to establish a cell line for
      later studies. This involves growing the white blood cells from the blood sample. The cells
      can be kept in the laboratory to make more DNA or can be frozen for later use in
      craniosynostosis studies. Patients may also have their medical records reviewed.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the molecular basis of craniosynostosis,
      Philadelphia type. Previous studies by our lab have excluded FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3, the
      causative genes of most hereditary craniosynostosis syndromes. In the five generation kindred
      previously reported we have conducted a genome-wide linkage analysis. We have identified four
      regions linked to this disorder, namely on 2q, 12q, 20q and 22q. Interestingly, syndactyly
      1A, a phenotypically similar disorder, demonstrates an overlapping linkage region in two
      studies. Screening of candidate genes in the redion has excluded ten candidate genes,
      including IHH, IGFBP2 and IGFBP5.

      This protocol is primarily for research purposes. Research subjects may receive benefit from
      knowing that this research may help other families in the future. Results will be discussed
      with the primary physician who is a trained medical geneticist. We will emphasize that these
      are only preliminary findings, that they are not CLIA-approved, and must not be disclosed to
      the patient or included in the medical record. Repeat testing in a CLIA-approved lab would be
      required before the specific genetic information could be shared with the patient and family.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        This research includes only craniosynostosis Philadelphia type patients and members of a
        single family who were previously referred to us and other family members who have since
        displayed interest in participating in this study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf of
        their children as minors) or assent.

        Medical condition(s) are not in themselves reason for exclusion if in the judgment of the
        referring physician this would involve no more than minimal risk.

        We generally reviewed a brief clinical description from the referring physician about a
        potential research subject to determine that the subject was appropriate to enter into the
        study. We reserved the right to exclude cases that were clearly not related to our direct
        research interests. For new participants, we will review the clinical description from the
        referring physician and we reserve the right to exclude cases.
