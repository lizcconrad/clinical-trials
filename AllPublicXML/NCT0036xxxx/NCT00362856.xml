      This study was run to determine the safety, tolerance, and efficacy of multiple doses of
      larazotide acetate in subjects with celiac disease following a gluten challenge.

      CLIN1001-004 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, dose-ranging, 7-arm,
      multicenter study with a gluten challenge. The objects were multiple dose safety and
      tolerance; efficacy (intestinal permeability [change in urinary LAMA ratio] and disease signs
      and symptoms) following gluten challenge.

      Following a 21-day screening period, subjects were randomized to one of seven treatments
      groups: four groups received larazotide acetate (0.25 mg, 1 mg, 4 mg or 8 mg TID) along with
      an 800 mg gluten challenge, one group received placebo with an 800 mg gluten challenge, a
      safety control arm received the highest dose of larazotide acetate (8 mg TID) and gluten
      placebo and the last group received drug placebo and gluten placebo. The gluten challenge was
      administered as capsules (800 mg TID) with each main meal for a total of 2.4 g daily. Drug or
      drug placebo was administered TID 15 minutes prior to each main meal. Subjects received their
      assigned treatments for two weeks (Day 0 through Day 14) and came to clinic for a follow-up
      visit one week later (Day 21). Subjects remained on their gluten-free diet for the duration
      of the study.

    <measure>To demonstrate the safety and tolerability of multiple, oral doses of larazotide acetate in celiac disease subjects that maintain a gluten-free diet.</measure>
    <time_frame>Safety measurements were performed at Screening and at Day 0, 7, 14, and 21 ('End of Study'). Any change from baseline value was calculated at each subsequent visit until &quot;End of Study&quot; (Day 21).</time_frame>
