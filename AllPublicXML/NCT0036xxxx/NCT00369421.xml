  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers intend on diagnosing and treating certain inborn errors of metabolism. By doing
      this researchers hope to expand their knowledge about these disorders and provide access to
      patients of interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience.

      Patients participating in this study will be examined and treated on an out patient basis, if
      practical. However, patients requiring specialized tests or treatments will be admitted to
      the NIH Clinical Center as necessary. Researchers will use only accepted medical procedures
      in diagnosing (medical history, physical examinations, X-ray studies, eye examinations, blood
      tests, and urine tests) and treating the patients involved in this study. Additional tests
      may be required on a case to case basis.

      Many patients seen in this study will go on to be enrolled in a specific disease-related
      research study.&lt;TAB&gt;...

      We propose to characterize the etiology and natural history of rare inborn errors of
      metabolism and other genetic disorders, both known and yet-to-be discovered. In so doing, we
      will expand our knowledge about these disorders and provide access to patients of interest
      for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Individual patients seen under this protocol
      have prompted the establishment of specific disease-related protocols involving intensive
      natural history studies and innovative therapies. In addition to its longstanding role in
      investigating individuals who are of interest to the Section on Human Biochemical Genetics,
      this protocol provides one possible avenue (in addition to other NIH protocols) for admitting
      patients who are part of the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program.

        -  Inclusion/Exclusion criteria

        Patients enrolled in this protocol will have been referred with a known or suspected inborn
        error of metabolism, heritable disorder, or genetic predisposition. Examples include
        inherited developmental defects or diatheses toward infections, cancer, or an
        environmentally induced disease. The principal investigator, along with consulting
        specialists, will review the medical records of prospective subjects and offer admission
        based upon the potential to help the individual, to learn from the patient, or to initiate
        clinical or basic research suggested by the patient s workup. Prior to late 2008, patients
        enrolled in this protocol had disorders of current or potential future research interest to
        the Principal Investigator or an Associate Investigator. Approximately 400 such patients
        were enrolled over the course of 32 years.

        Beginning in 2008, the protocol became one of the vehicles for admitting patients with a
        broader range of inborn errors of metabolism (e.g., those with immune defects,
        developmental disorders, cancer diatheses, etc.) through the NIH UDP. There are several
        aspects of this process:

          1. &lt;TAB&gt;Screening and triaging. Records are reviewed by the UDP Director for completeness
             and missing articles (e.g., images, biopsy slides) are requested. The UDP Director
             assigns records for review to consultants based upon the specialty involved, and
             copies of the records are distributed to 1-5 experts.

          2. &lt;TAB&gt;Criteria for eligibility. Eligibility criteria include novelty of clinical
             findings, multiple family members affected, or an objective laboratory or imaging clue
             to pursue. Of course, patients have to be able to travel, as well.

          3. &lt;TAB&gt;Roles of the UDP personnel. The UDP Director performs the triage, makes the final
             decision, and signs the decision letters. The consultants are NIH clinical specialists
             from the Clinical Center departments and the ICs. A group of nurse practitioners and
             one physician s assistant communicate about medical issues with patients and referring
             physicians. Support personnel obtain missing articles, copy records, file them, send
             out letters of receipt, enter information in the Lab Matrix database, and answer phone
             calls.

          4. &lt;TAB&gt;Consent timing and process. In general, consent is obtained by the care team upon
             admission. Occasionally, a patient or family member gives consent for a blood draw
             locally; this is obtained by an Associate Investigator over the phone and in writing.

        Patients apply with a summary letter from their referring physician and with their medical
        records; the cases are then reviewed by members of a large group of NIH consultants. If any
        of those consultants finds that an applicant qualifies for her/his protocol (in any
        institute), the patient is invited to enroll in that protocol. The UDP connects the patient
        with the principal investigator; there is no involvement of protocol 76-HG-0238.

        For patients not selected by other services, the UDP Director, based largely on specialists
        recommendations, makes the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection with respect to
        protocol 76-HG-0238. The UDP has evolved such that the majority of its patients are now
        being enrolled in 76-HG-0238.

        Once a patient is enrolled in 76-HG-0238, her/his management is the same regardless of
        whether or not entry was through the UDP. Specifically, in each case, all testing except
        the skin biopsy, DNA analysis, and research bloods is medically indicated and directed
        toward diagnosis.

        Some subjects will be relatives of patients with known diagnoses, and their specimens will
        be obtained for the purpose of heterozygote testing or to serve as controls to help
        diagnose the proband. All subjects shall be admitted as inpatients or outpatients at the
        discretion of the principal investigator, based upon particular research interests and
        expertise.

        Individuals will be excluded from this protocol if they already have a diagnosis, if their
        previous evaluations leave no clue to pursue, if they appear to have a known diagnosis that
        has not been made, or if their subjective complaints far exceed any objective findings. We
        will not admit patients under one month of age to this protocol. This exclusion occurs
        because there is no urgency for a very early diagnosis and care is more readily proffered
        to older individuals at the Clinical Center. Patients under one year of age will be
        admitted only if they are medically stable and require admission to the Clinical Center for
        diagnosis.

        Normal adult volunteers will be enrolled to provide control blood and urine specimens. NIH
        employees and members of their immediate families may participate in this protocol as
        normal volunteers. We will follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH
        Research Studies and will give each employee a copy of the NIH information sheet on
        Employee Research Participation.

        For NIH employees:

          1. Neither participation nor refusal to participate will have an effect, either
             beneficial or adverse, on the participant s employment or work situation.

          2. The NIH information sheet regarding NIH employee research participation will be
             distributed to all potential subjects who are NIH employees.

          3. The employee subject s privacy and confidentiality will be preserved in accordance
             with NIH Clinical Center policies, which define the scope and limitations of the
             protections.

          4. For NIH employee subjects, consent will be obtained by an individual independent of
             the employee s team. Those in a supervisory position to any -12- employee and
             co-workers of the employee will not obtain consent.

          5. The importance of maintaining confidentiality when obtaining potentially sensitive and
             private information from co-workers or subordinates will bereviewed with the study
             staff at least annually and more often if warranted.
