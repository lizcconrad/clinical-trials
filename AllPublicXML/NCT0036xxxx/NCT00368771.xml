      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of participation in one of the following
      interventions: (1) IBS Stress Management; (2) IBS Symptom Management; or (3) IBS Educational
      Training on improving IBS associated symptoms. It is anticipated that this research will
      provide information on the usefulness of psychological approaches in treating IBS and will
      help scientists better understand the disorder.

    <description>If randomly assigned to this intervention, the session with the therapist will consist of training about IBS symptoms and their relationship to stress, as well as skills training in relaxation and ways of identifying and challenging mistaken thoughts about life events. The goal of this treatment is to lessen mental and physical stressful reactions to daily events, and therefore lessen IBS symptoms as a reaction to stress. The patient will be encouraged to apply relaxation skills to stressful situations.</description>

    <intervention_name>IBS Symptom Management</intervention_name>
    <description>If assigned to this group, the therapist will discuss feelings, over-attention to IBS symptoms, and your fear of IBS symptoms. Patients will learn how to identify thoughts that may increase your IBS symptoms and will practice how to change these thoughts to ones that make them feel more comfortable. The sessions will focus on reactions to daily life that in turn result in IBS Symptoms.</description>

The reading topics include information on gut disorders, anatomy and physiology of the gut, assessment procedures, and how to manage IBS symptoms. Sessions will also consist of weekly reviews of daily records and IBS symptoms. The goal of this intervention is to provide educational training about IBS.</description>
