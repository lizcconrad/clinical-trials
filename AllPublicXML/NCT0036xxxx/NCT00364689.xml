      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three different treatments for
      hepatic encephalopathy. These treatments are:

        -  Group 1 - lactulose given with a rifaximin placebo (sugar pill)

        -  Group 2 - lactulose given with rifaximin

        -  Group 3 - rifaximin given alone

      The goals of this study are to determine which treatment is most effective at (1) reducing
      admissions to hospital for hepatic encephalopathy and (2) improving mental function, during
      the study period.

      Background:

      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a reversible process resulting from advanced liver disease. It
      can range in severity from disturbed sleep patterns to profound coma and can be triggered by
      a number of common factors, including intestinal bleeding, infection, constipation, and
      dietary changes.

      This study will compare two different medications, used alone or in combination, to prevent
      relapses of HE. Lactulose is a laxative (causes increased bowel movements) which has been
      widely used in the treatment of HE. However, it is not clear how effective it is for this
      purpose and is not always well tolerated. Rifaximin is an oral antibiotic which has been
      studied in the treatment of HE, including longer treatment courses but its role in the
      prevention of HE relapses is not clear. No studies to date have compared the use of lactulose
      to combination treatment with lactulose and rifaximin in the prevention of recurrent episodes
      of HE.

      Study Overview:

      This study is a single-center, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of rifaximin, given alone or in combination with lactulose, as compared to lactulose
      given alone, in subjects in remission from prior acute episodes of HE. This study seeks
      specifically to examine the role of combination treatment with rifaximin and lactulose, as
      compared to either treatment alone, in maintaining remission of HE.

      Our study hypothesis is that rifaximin, given alone or in combination with lactulose, will
      reduce the number of hospital admissions for acute HE, and will improve overall mental
      function during the treatment period, relative to standard lactulose therapy.

      This is a double-blinded study (for rifaximin only), which means that neither you nor your
      study doctor will know whether you are being treated with rifaximin or a placebo pill. You
      will, however, know whether you are receiving lactulose.
