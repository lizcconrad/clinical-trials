  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of CG5503 base Immediate Release(IR) 50
      mg or 100 mg taken every 4 to 6 hours as needed over the long-term exposure of 90 days in
      patients who have chronic pain.

    <textblock>
      CG5503 is a centrally active pain-relieving drug being investigated for the treatment of
      acute and chronic pain. This study is designed to assess the safety of CG5503 Immediate
      Release (IR) in men and women who are 18 years of age or older and who have had chronic (for
      at least 3 months) low-back pain or chronic pain from osteoarthritis of the hip or knee, and
      who require daily analgesic medication. In this double blind study (neither patients nor
      investigators will know what treatment is given), patients will be randomly (patients are
      assigned different treatments based on chance) assigned to receive either CG5503 base IR or
      oxycodone IR to begin a 90 day treatment during which each patient will return to the medical
      facility every 2 weeks. For the CG5503 IR group, patients will take 50 or 100 mg orally every
      4 to 6 hours as needed to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day. Oxycodone IR patients will take
      10 or 15 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours as needed to a maximum dose of 90 mg per day. Patients
      may continue taking their regular, stable, non-opioid medication throughout the study. The
      effectiveness of study treatment (CG5503 base IR or oxycodone) will be assessed with 11-Point
      Numerical Rating Scale and Patient Global Impression of Change. Using these scales, patients
      will indicate their pain intensity level and overall status of their well-being. Opioid
      withdrawal symptoms of CG5503 IR dose of 50 or 100 mg will be assessed with clinical opioid
      withdrawal scale [Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) and Clinical Opiate Withdrawal
      Scale (COWS)] at the end of treatment. Using these scales, patients will indicate the
      physical components of drug withdrawal and the severity of symptoms associated with rapid
      withdrawal. Safety will be assessed using physical examination, monitoring of adverse events,
      clinical and laboratory measures, and 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) results. Constipation,
      vomiting, and sleep assessments will be performed. No formal hypothesis testing will be done
      in this study. For the CG5503 IR group, patients will take a flexible dose of 50 or 100 mg
      orally every 4 to 6 hours as needed to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day for 90 days.
      Oxycodone IR patients will take a flexible dose of 10 or 15 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours as
      needed to a maximum dose of 90 mg per day for 90 days.
