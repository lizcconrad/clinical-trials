    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that dextro-amphetamine (d-amphetamine) will be safe and effective
      when used to augment treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and that tolerance
      (loss of therapeutic effect) to the medication will not develop over a period of several
      weeks.

      The study will investigate whether dextro-amphetamine (d-amphetamine) is safe and effective
      compared to caffeine as an active placebo when used to augment treatment for
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and whether tolerance (loss of therapeutic effect) to
      the medication will develop over a period of several weeks

      D-amphetamine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. Because of the effects that
      d-amphetamine has on the brain, Dr. Koran believes it may be helpful in treating OCD. A
      positive finding in this study may stimulate research aimed at improving OCD treatment and
      understanding of the neurochemistry involved.

      This research study will enroll 24 people who are taking medication for their OCD but are not
      receiving sufficient benefit. The research will be performed only at Stanford University.

    <description>Clinical Global Impressions Scale Improvement Score = 1 (very much improved), or 2 (much improved). Additional possible scale scores are 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse) and 7 (very much worse).</description>

    <measure>Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At end of week 5, except 1 d-amphetamine subject rated at end of week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale score by blinded investigator in direct interview. The scale score is the sum of ten items (5 for obsessions and 5 for compulsions: time occupied, degree of interference with functioning, degree of distress, effort to resist the symptom, success in resisting), each rated from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe OCD. Maximum score is 40. Scores of 14 and below are often described as &quot;subclinical,&quot; though patients with these scores may still exhibit troubling symptoms and mild to moderate distress. A total score of 8 or less is often termed &quot;remission.&quot; A decrease in total score from baseline to endpoint of either 25% or 35% is often used as a &quot;responder&quot; criterion in clinical trials.</description>

        <description>Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale score by blinded investigator in direct interview. The scale score is the sum of ten items (5 for obsessions and 5 for compulsions: time occupied, degree of interference with functioning, degree of distress, effort to resist the symptom, success in resisting), each rated from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe OCD. Maximum score is 40. Scores of 14 and below are often described as &quot;subclinical,&quot; though patients with these scores may still exhibit troubling symptoms and mild to moderate distress. A total score of 8 or less is often termed &quot;remission.&quot; A decrease in total score from baseline to endpoint of either 25% or 35% is often used as a &quot;responder&quot; criterion in clinical trials.</description>
