  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tibial fixation is the weak link when using soft tissue grafts and interference screws for
      fixation in a bony tunnel in ACL reconstruction. The Objective is to study two groups of
      patients undergoing double loop hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction and compare between
      the two tibial fixation devices: the tapered Deltascrew and the Intrafix screw and sheath .
