  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination of ACP-103 (the study
      medication) with either haloperidol or risperidone will show antipsychotic efficacy and that
      it is safe and well tolerated. Further purposes of this study are to determine whether
      ACP-103, in combination with either haloperidol or risperidone, will enhance their
      antipsychotic effectiveness, demonstrate effectiveness against the negative symptoms, improve
      motoric tolerability, and is safe and well tolerated.

      This is a seven-week study (one week screening and six weeks of study medication) where a
      total of 400 patients who meet entrance criteria will randomly be assigned to receive one of
      five groups of study treatments of either low dose haloperidol plus ACP-103, low dose
      haloperidol plus placebo (a substance similar to a sugar pill), low dose risperidone plus
      ACP-103, low dose risperidone plus placebo, or high dose risperidone plus placebo. The study
      will begin with with a three to seven day drug-free period followed by six weeks of a stable
      daily dosage of study medication. Study subjects will be treated as hospital in-patients
      during screening and for the first 14 days of the study. Study subjects will be closely
      monitored throughout the study.
