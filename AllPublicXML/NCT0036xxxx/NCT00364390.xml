      This is a first in man, Phase I safety study of Anginera in adults with Left Ventricular
      Dysfunction (LVD) and Reversible Myocardial Ischemia undergoing a CABG procedure.

      A prospective, multicenter, open-label Phase I safety study of Anginera. Adults with Left
      Ventricular Dysfunction and reversible myocardial ischemia who are undergoing a CABG
      procedure, who have at least one graftable vessel and at least one coronary vessel not
      amenable to bypass or PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention)will be recruited. Three pieces
      of Anginera will be placed on the area of the surface of the ventricle, including the area
      supplied by the vessel or vessels that cannot be bypassed, as well as surrounding myocardium.
      Patients will be followed for 12 months after the surgery at which Anginera is implanted.

      The primary objective is to determine safety. The secondary objectives are to determine
      regional myocardial perfusion and regional left ventricular performance and to investigate
      the utility of measures of patient perception of improvement.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients have been referred for CABG

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 20%

          -  Patients have CAD involving at least two (2) coronary arteries, with at least one or
             more vessel(s) having disease not amenable to bypass grafting or PCI

          -  There is a region of myocardium served by the vessel(s) defined above that has
             objective evidence of multi-distribution reversible ischemia based on a 17-segment
             assessment of reversible defects on SPECT/Thallium.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Patient undergoing valve replacement or valve modification

          2. Patient with significant or malignant ventricular arrhythmias, defined as a patient
             being treated for ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation with an
             implantable cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) or a patient being treated with
             Amiodarone for these same tachyarrhythmias. (Note: having an implantable
             cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) per se, in a patient who does not have significant or
             malignant ventricular arrhythmias, does not exclude the patient from this study.)

          3. Patient requires urgent coronary artery bypass surgery
