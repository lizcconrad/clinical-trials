  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if patients with lung cancer and their main informal
      caregiver (person providing physical, emotional, or financial support) are helped by getting
      information, support, and decision making tools through a computer system called CHESS(the
      Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients and their family/friends use the internet for obtaining information regarding
      the cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this study, the main caregiver of patients with
      advance (stage III or IV) non-small cell lung cancer is provided with a computer and internet
      access. Approximately one-half of the participants will also receive CHESS.
