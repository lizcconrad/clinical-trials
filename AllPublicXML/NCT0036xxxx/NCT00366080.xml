    <measure>Sleep latency (in minutes), as measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), at the end of the DBP</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep latency was measured at the end of DBP (Day 42) by an extended version of the MWT which was used to measure the ability of a participant to remain awake. The MWT consisted of four 40-minutes trails performed at two hour intervals and the main MWT score was mean sleep latency (arithmetic mean of the four 40-minutes trials). Trials were ended after 40 minutes if no sleep occurred, or after unequivocal sleep, defined as three consecutive epochs of stage 1 sleep, or one epoch of any other stage of sleep. Least square mean was used to present the value for adjusted mean.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Frequency of Cataplexy Attacks during the OLP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Narcolepsy was classically described as excessive daytime sleepiness in association with emotionally triggered episodes of muscle weakness, known as cataplexy. Forms of narcolepsy exist without cataplexy which varies in severity from barely perceptible loss of tone of the facial muscles to total collapse. The number of daily cataplexy attacks (frequency) was estimated and recorded in the diary card. Baseline was defined at Visit 1 (Day -1). Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the value on Day -1 minus the value on Day 1-6, 7-13, 14-20, 21-29.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 28 up to Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective sleepiness was measured using ESS, a patient rated measure of excessive daytime sleepiness. ESS was completed by participants at the end of OLP (Day 28) and at the end of DBP (Day 42). Participants estimated their likelihood of falling asleep during 8 normal daily situations (1.Sitting and reading, 2.Watching television, 3.Sitting inactive in public place, such as theatre or meeting, 4.As a passenger in car for an hour without a break, 5.Lying down to rest in the afternoon, 6.Sitting and talking to someone, 7.Sitting quietly after lunch (without alcohol), 8.In a car, while stopped in traffic) on a 4 point scale that consisted of score from 0-3 where, 0=would never dose, 1=slight chance of dozing, 2=moderate chance of dozing, 3=high chance of dozing). The total ESS score is sum of scores on 8 items. Last assessed value of OLP (Day 28) value was used as baseline value for DBP. Change from end of OLP was calculated by subtracting the value on Day 28 minus the value on Day 42.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Frequency of Daytime Naps (Based on Actigraphy) during the OLP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The number of daytime naps was calculated based on Actigraphy. Actigraphy data was collected using the Actiwatch activity monitoring system. Participants were asked to continuously wear a small actigraphy monitor on the wrist of their non-dominant arm during the study in order to objectively monitor sleep quality and daytime napping. The Actiwatch was a wrist-worn device that produced a signal as the wearer made physical movement which was used as a surrogate marker of sleep. Participants marked time in bed manually with the watch, which improved assessment of sleep efficiency. Baseline was defined at Visit 1 (Day -7). Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the value on Day -7 minus the value on Day 1-6,7-13,14-20,21-29.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Time (min) until Sleep Onset REM (rapid eye moment) (SOREM) during the OLP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) up to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>In normal participants, the sleep cycle comprised of 3 to 4 stages of slow-wave or non-REM (NREM) sleep lasting about 90 min. Each NREM sleep period was followed by a period of REM sleep i.e. it was necessary to pass through the non-REM cycle to enter into the REM state. REM sleep was characterized by increased brain activity, dreaming and loss of muscle tone i.e. REM sleep atonia. In narcolepsy, the cycle of NREM alternating with REM was abnormal and entry occured directly into REM sleep with a latency to onset of REM sleep that was abnormally shortened (sleep onset REM). REM sleep was characterised by increased brain activity, dreaming and loss of muscle tone i.e. REM sleep atonia. SOREM was measured on overnight Polysomnography (PSG) used to assess sleep architecture. Baseline was defined at Day -1. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the value on Day -1 minus the value on Day 13 and 27.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 14 and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Disease severity was scored by the clinician (CGIC) and participant (PGIC) using a verbal rating scale from 1-7 which was as follows: 1.Very much improved, 2.Much improved, 3.Minimally improved, 4.No change, 5.Minimally worse, 6.Much worse and 7.Very much worse. During OLP (until Day 28), the investigator/participant indicated their assessment of total improvement or worsening compared with the same participant's condition at start of treatment, whether or not the change was due to drug. However, when disease severity was assessed at end of DBP, the assessor rated any change in disease severity recorded at the beginning of DBP (Day 28), rather than the start of treatment. At this time, participants randomised to active treatment were expected to have &quot;No change&quot; or perhaps a minimal change, while participants randomised to placebo were expected to have answers such as &quot;Much worse&quot; or &quot;Very much worse&quot;, demonstrating a loss of response upon active treatment withdrawal.</description>

    <description>Actigraphy data was collected using the Actiwatch activity monitoring system. Participants were asked to continuously wear a small actigraphy monitor on the wrist of their non-dominant arm during the study in order to objectively monitor sleep quality and daytime napping. The Actiwatch was a wrist-worn device that produced a signal as the wearer makes physical movement which was used as a surrogate marker of sleep. Participants marked time in bed manually with the watch, which improved assessment of sleep efficiency. Nocturnal actigraphy parameters summarized for this outcome measure was average actual sleep time, average actual wake time and average sleep latency duration. Actigraphy was performed on Day -7 to -1, 1 to 6, 7 to 13, 14 to 20 and 21 to 29 during the OLP.</description>
