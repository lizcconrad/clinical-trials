    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and activity of
      XL647 in previously untreated subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). XL647 is a
      small molecule that potently inhibits multiple receptor kinases, including EGFR, VEGFR2
      (KDR), ErbB2, and EphB4. Sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors has been linked to specific EGFR
      mutations and associated with certain clinical characteristics in patients with NSCLC (eg,
      female, minimal and remote smoking history, and adenocarcinoma histology).

    <description>XL647 will be administered orally as a single agent. XL647 will be supplied as 50 mg tablets. Subjects in the Intermittent 5 &amp; 9 cohort will receive XL647 at a dose of 350 mg on a 5 days on and 9 days off cycle every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Subjects in the Daily Dosing cohort will receive XL647 administered daily as a single oral dose of 300 mg. In the absence of progressive disease (PD) and unacceptable XL647-related toxicity, subjects may continue to receive XL647 treatment on their assigned dosing schedule for up to 1 year on this study. Subjects who reach 1 year of treatment with no evidence of disease progression may, with the concurrence of the investigator and the sponsor, continue to receive therapy.</description>
