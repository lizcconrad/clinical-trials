  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topical steroid use may lead to skin deterioration and spider veins. This study will examine
      long-term management of atopic dermatitis (AD) over 12 months with pimecrolimus cream 1% and
      its effect on skin reconstitution of steroid-damaged skin and disease control.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  clinically diagnosed AD

          -  almost clear to mild AD (local IGA [target lesions face and cubital areas] score of
             1-3)

          -  clinically (i.e. to the unaided eye) evident skin atrophy due to long-term topical
             steroid use

          -  Dermatophot Score (DPS - composed of skin atrophy and telangiectasia) of 4-6 on at
             least two target areas

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Phototherapy or systemic therapy known or suspected to have an effect on AD within 4
             weeks prior to study entry

          -  Topical therapy known or suspected to have an effect on AD within 7 days prior to
             study entry or systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Clinical conditions other than AD that according to investigator can interfere with
             the Dermatophot evaluation
