  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of a new experimental drug called darusentan. Darusentan is not
      currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United
      States, which means that a doctor cannot prescribe this drug. The purpose of this study is to
      determine if darusentan is effective in reducing systolic blood pressure in subjects with
      resistant systolic hypertension, despite treatment with full doses of three or more blood
      pressure lowering drugs, including a diuretic.
