      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory study is collecting skin biopsy specimens from patients receiving
      irinotecan or gemcitabine for advanced solid tumors and using them to study change in DNA due
      to this treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the level of p-Chk1 and phospho-histone 2AX (p-H2AX), an indicator of DNA
           damage, and possibly downstream pathway markers in hair follicles from skin biopsies of
           patients treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride or irinotecan hydrochloride for advanced
           solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the method for measurement (immunohistochemistry).

        -  Measure inter- and intra-patient variability for the biomarker.

        -  Partially characterize the dynamic time course of p-Chk1 and p-H2AX after administration
           of a DNA-damaging agent.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo collection of 2 skin biopsies with hair follicles at 4 and 8 hours or at 4
      and 6 hours after the start of irinotecan hydrochloride or gemcitabine hydrochloride
      treatment on day 1 of course 1. Repeat biopsies will be taken at 4, 6, or 8 hours after the
      start of irinotecan hydrochloride or gemcitabine hydrochloride on day 1 of 2 successive
      courses.

      Tissue is examined by immunohistochemistry and possibly other methods for changes in p-Chk1
      and pH2AX.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
