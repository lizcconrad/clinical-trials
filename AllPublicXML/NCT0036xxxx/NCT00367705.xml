    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) in childhood is a chronic relapsing and remitting condition that has a
      significant impact on growth and development. The disease is characterized by an increased
      and unregulated immune response. The main therapy over the last 30 years has been
      corticosteroids leading to remission in 50-80% of patients within 2-4 weeks. However, the use
      of steroids in children is limited by side-effects including acne, moon-face, hirsutism,
      hypertension, metabolic disturbances and above all reduced growth. Hence, pediatricians are
      very interested to find alternative therapies. Therapeutic manipulation of gut flora with
      probiotics promises to be a useful strategy for several disorders including inflammation of
      the gut. The efficacy of the highly concentrated probiotic VSL#3 has been documented in
      maintenance and prophylaxis treatment of pouchitis in double blind, placebo controlled
      studies in adults. The aim of this study is to compare probiotic therapy with VSL#3 versus
      placebo in maintenance therapy of children with mild to moderate CD, treated with either
      5-ASA, corticosteroids (local or budesonide), imuran/6 mercaptopurine (MP), as long as no
      change in medication dosage has been made in the previous 12 weeks (for imuran/6MP) or 4
      weeks (for corticosteroids).

      The aim of this study is to compare probiotic therapy with VSL#3 versus placebo in
      maintenance therapy of children with mild to moderate CD, treated with either 5-ASA,
      corticosteroids (local or budesonide), imuran/6MP, as long as no change in medication dosage
      has been made in the previous 12 weeks (for imuran/6MP) or 4 weeks (for corticosteroids). The
      primary goal will be to compare their ability to maintain remission and to decrease disease
      activity in each of the two study groups. Data will be collected during this 16 week period
      regarding the safety and tolerability of VSL#3, as well as data of changes in stool
      composition of microflora upon treatment.

      The follow up will be continued for up to 6 months with a monthly telephone questionnaire and
      a clinical visit at 6 months.

      Study Design:

      The study will be a multinational, double-blind, randomized controlled study (Munich, Paris,
      Rotterdam, Porto, Brussels, London, Warsaw, Chicago, Toronto, Boston, New York, Baltimore,
      Cleveland, Karachi and Jerusalem).

      The study will include 300 children and will last for at least 16 weeks. These children will
      receive either 1-2 packet according to their weight; each sachet containing 900 billion
      bacteria/day of VSL#3 or an identical placebo, for 16 weeks.

      All patients participating in this study will continue regular medications throughout the
      study period.

      According to the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) patients will be assessed
      clinically at regular intervals and will have stool cultured (including lactobacillus,
      bifidobacteria and Strep salivarius) as well as a stool calprotectin before and after
      treatment.
