  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The stepwise process of leukocyte extravasation to inflamed tissues depends on the expression
      of a variety of cytokines and adhesion molecules. Recently much attention has focused on the
      Junctional Adhesion Molecules (JAM). The three members of this adhesion molecule family,
      namely, JAM-A, -B and -C, have been shown to govern the last step of leukocyte extravasation
      (transmigration) - the process of leukocytes passing between endothelial cells. In addition
      to transmigration, some members of this family seem to support additional steps in the
      leukocyte extravasation cascade. The investigators recently showed, that antibody-mediated
      inhibition of JAM-C significantly reduced hapten induced skin inflammation (J Invest
      Dermatol;125(5):969).

      Recent unpublished work from our laboratory showed, that JAM-C expression of lymphocytes can
      be up-regulated through specific activators. Hence, the investigators hypothesize, that JAM-C
      expression is elevated in patients with psoriasis. As it is currently not know, which factors
      may influence the expression of JAM-C, the investigators intend to analyse JAM-C expression
      on CD3+CD41- cells at several time-points during the treatment of psoriatic patients.
      Expression of JAM-C will then be correlated to disease activity (PASI).
