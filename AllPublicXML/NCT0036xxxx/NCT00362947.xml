  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal treatment of superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) is still uncertain. Though low
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is considered the treatment of choice, studies conducted so
      far do not give clear indications of the optimal dose and duration of treatment. This study
      aims to evaluate whether an intermediate therapeutic dose of LMWH (parnaparin) is more
      effective than a prophylactic dose and also to assess whether 10 rather than 30 days are
      sufficient for treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatients with an episode of SVT of the grand saphenous vein (for at least 4 cm), and/or
      SVT of the small saphenous vein (for at least 4 cm), and/or SVT of a collateral vein of the
      large saphenous vein of the thigh (for at least 4cm) are included in this prospective,
      randomised, double blind, national multicentre study.

      Patients will be randomised into double-blind groups to receive (syringes will be identical
      in appearance) in consecutively numbered boxes:

      A - Parnaparin, dose of 8,500 IU aXa taken subcutaneously once a day for 10 days B -
      Parnaparin, dose of 8,500 IU aXa per day for 10 days followed by Parnaparin 6,400 IU aXa per
      day for the subsequent three weeks. C - Parnaparin, dose of 4,250 IU aXa per day for 30 days
      Elastic compression treatment will be recommended with special stocking and/or elastic
      bandaging with compression to the ankles of 20-40 mmHg, where not contraindicated.
