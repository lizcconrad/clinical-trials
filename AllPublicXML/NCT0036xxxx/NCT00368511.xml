      We propose to obtain computerized dynamic posturography scores on patients in a
      (psycho)geriatric nursing home utilizing the CAPS system from Vestibular Technology. This
      instrument has been validated to measure human stability and is associated with a Fall
      Probability percentage. Subjects will be asked to stand on a platform with eyes open and
      closed for approximately 30 seconds. The data obtained will be utilized as a base for change
      which can be compared to an outcome of music listening and fall prevention. Previous
      investigations have demonstrated a decrease in fall rates associated with music listening. We
      would like to measure the changes in human stability associated with a potential decrease in
      fall rates. We would also like to use the history of falls of the tested individuals if
      available. In case fall statistics are available we respectfully request access to all falls
      data available from the involved geriatric nursing home . The falls data will be kept
      confidential and only used as a control statistic in our evaluation of fall rates after
      implementation of our applications. The music used will include Nolwenn Leroy, Mozart and
      other Dutch and French Singers.

      The outcome measurement will be obtained using computerized dynamic posturography, a standard
      diagnostic test of balance function. The subject's balance will be tested using a
      three-component force platform (BalanceTRAK® CAPST - Vestibular Technologies, Cheyenne WY,
      USA) under one sensory condition of the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on
      Balance (mCTSIB), the eyes closed on perturbing surface condition. This condition was chosen
      as studies have shown it to be the single test that best correlates with balance impairment
      and falls. The stability score, already used in several studies by other authors will be used
      as the primary outcome measure in this research. It is defined as 1 minus the ratio between
      the measured sway during the test (computed as the major axis of a standard 95% confidence
      ellipse) and the amount of sway a normal subject of the same height as the one being tested
      should be able to sway before falling (also known as the theoretical maximum sway or the
      theoretical limit of stability, calculated using a regression formula based on the subject's
      height developed by NASA in 1962 and commonly used in all posturographic tests). For
      convenience, the stability score is expressed as a percentage. Its definition makes it a
      convenient and easy to understand measure to use as a subject able to stand perfectly still
      with no sway will have a score of 100%, whereas one that sways as much as the limit of
      stability will have a score of 0%. During each test, the subject's sway will be determined by
      the force platform and its related software. The CAPST three-component force platform uses 3
      load cells arranged in a triangle to measure the distribution of the vertical ground reaction
      force on the platform. The analog load cell signals are amplified and simultaneously sampled
      by the platform electronics using three synchronized individual 24bit delta-sigma analog to
      digital converters sampling at 312kHz and decimating the samples to a data rate of 64Hz. The
      use of three A/D converters insures that the signals from the 3 load cells are acquired
      simultaneously with no timing error. The high sampling rate with the high decimation and low
      data rate of the sigma-delta converters eliminates aliasing and provides a resolution of
      about 4 parts per million. The digital load cell data will be sent via a USB connection to
      the PC where software uses a calibration matrix determined by the manufacturer to compute the
      total vertical force and the two horizontal moments acting on the platform. From these data,
      the software will compute the point of application of the vertical force acting on the
      platform, commonly referred to as the Center of Pressure (CoP). The location of the CoP
      coincides in static conditions with the projection of the subject's Center of Mass (CoM) onto
      the platform, and its movement relates to the movements of the subject's CoM (sway). The
      determination of the actual sway required the determination of the instantaneous location of
      the CoM will require the determination of the location and inertial properties of each body
      segment of the specific subject being tested. The CAPST, like every other posturographic
      equipment, uses the movement of the CoP as an approximation of the sway. Because it is an
      approximation, and because for kinetic reasons the CoP moves more than the CoM, the 95%
      confidence interval of the CoP motion will be considered. This will allow the CAPST software
      to compute the ellipse that represents the location of all of the sway samples collected
      during the test with 95% confidence. The major axis of this ellipse represents the maximum
      sway of the subject in any direction during the test and it is used to compute the stability
      score. To assess the accuracy and resolution of the measurement chain, calibrated weights of
      75kg and 100kg will be positioned in the center of the force platform (as if it were a
      subject) and 20s acquisitions will be performed: the accuracy of the weight will be
      calibrated to fall within the instrument's factory specifications (+-2N). Therefore the
      accuracy for the position claimed by the manufacturer of +-1mm for a weight of 75kg will be
      accepted as correct as determination would require specialized equipment and software
      available only to the manufacturer. It should be noted that the overall accuracy of the
      position of the CoP given by the instrument will not be relevant in this study as the sway is
      determined by the motion of the CoP. The sway measurement error will be estimated considering
      the fact that during the test at both weights the dead weight will not move, but the
      measurement chain will indicate a &quot;sway&quot; of less then 0.05mm (measurement noise), therefore
      the resolution of the measurement chain and the sway measurement error will be considered to
      be 0.05mm. To verify the repeatability of the measurement chain, the same type of tests will
      be repeated two times, obtaining similar results (within the specified accuracy and
      resolution). Given the sway measurement error, the measurement error in the stability score
      will be determined. From the definition of the stability score it is clear that the least the
      theoretical limit of stability, the more pronounced the effect of the sway measurement error
      is. As the theoretical limit of stability is computed by using the formula
      0.55*height*2*sin(6.25°), the shorter the subject, the more the stability score is sensitive
      to the measurement errors. To estimate the stability score measurement error a subject's
      height of 1.6m will be considered. Such a subject would have a theoretical limit of stability
      of 191.6mm. For such a subject, a sway measurement error of 0.05mm means a stability score
      measurement error of 0.05/191.6 or, if the score is expressed in percentage, of 0.026%. Thus,
      any changes in the stability score greater than that will be as a consequence of the
      subject's sway and not of measurement errors. Inpatients in Dutch Geriatric Hospitals will be
      randomized into several groups and all will have CAPS tests obtained. The groups will be
      asked to listen to a music specific song each morning and CAPS tests will be obtained after
      the listening experiences and at one month intervals throughout the study. Fall data will be
      collected as well and compared to previous falls data. The changes in CAPS outcomes as a
      measure of brain based postural change will be compared to normative data and the types of
      music listened to.
