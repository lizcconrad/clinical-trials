      Skin graft fixation is essential for the success of its survival. There are several common
      methods for skin graft fixation including sutures, skin staples and glue. The study objective
      is to compare between skin graft fixation with staples and glue in burn patients. The study
      is retrospective. It Includes 44 patients that were hospitalized in the burn unit, Rabin
      Medical Center, Israel with 2nd and 3rd degree burns, total body surface area 1-50% during
      1/2002-5/2003.All patients were operated for debridement and skin grafting. In 29 patients
      the skin graft was fixated with staples and in 15 with cyanoacrylate glue (histoacryl). The
      parameters that will be compared are skin graft take, hospitalization length and local
      infection.
