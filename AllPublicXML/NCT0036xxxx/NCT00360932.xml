    <description>Subjects will be treated with SCULPTRA速 according to the investigator's judgment, and in accordance with the SCULPTRA速 package insert. Details of the exact amount and the time of administration of SCULPTRA速 (date, amount, location) will be documented in the CRF at each protocol and non-protocol visit.</description>
