  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential biological predispositions that
      contribute to the difficulty patients with anorexia nervosa have in maintaining normal
      weight.

      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric illness that is characterized by extreme weight loss
      and severe body image distortions. In this study, we are examining changes in body
      composition, metabolic rate, and reproductive function before and after treatment for AN.
      More specifically, we are testing the hypotheses that 1)Weight-restored patients with AN have
      elevated resting energy expenditure (REE) compared to controls, 2) Weight-restored patients
      with AN have a central disposition of body fat compared to controls, 3) Weight-restored
      patients with AN who gain the most fat centrally will have the least improvement on
      psychological measures, 4) Weight-restored patients with AN will have leptin levels out of
      proportion to body fat mass. It will also investigate the relationship between REE and leptin
      with respect to the return of menses.
