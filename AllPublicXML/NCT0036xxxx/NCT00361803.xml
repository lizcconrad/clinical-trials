        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Scale

          -  Predicted life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors who have
             failed conventional therapy for their tumor type or have a tumor type for which no
             standard effective therapy exists; OR Patients for whom single-agent topotecan therapy
             is suitable

          -  At least 4 weeks since last chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic therapy or surgery

          -  Must be free of post-treatment side effects (with the exception of alopecia)

          -  No concurrent chemotherapy, biologic therapy or radiotherapy is allowed

          -  Hemoglobin = 9.0 g/dL

          -  WBC = 3,500/mm3 [= 3.5 x 109/L]

          -  Neutrophils = 1,500/mm3 [= 1.5 x 109/L]

          -  Platelets = 100,000/mm3 [= 100.0 x 109/L]

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance=60 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

          -  Serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL (34 µmol/L) AST, SGPT/ALT and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2
             times the upper limit of normal if liver metastases cannot be visualized by abdominal
             computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan)

          -  If liver metastases are present, subjects with &lt; 5 times the upper limit of normal are
             eligible to participate

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Women subjects of childbearing potential who refuse to abstain from sexual intercourse
             or practice adequate contraception. Childbearing potential is defined as women who are
             not surgically sterilized (i.e. have not had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy
             [ovariectomy], or bilateral tubal ligation) or post-menopausal (i.e., documented
             absence of menses for one year prior to entry into the study).

          -  Men unwilling to abstain from sex or use effective contraception during the study and

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled emesis, regardless of etiology

          -  Active infection

          -  Concurrent severe medical problems unrelated to the malignancy, which would
             significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to extreme
             risk

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug within 30 days or five half-lives prior to
             entry into the study (whichever is longer)

          -  History of allergic reactions to compounds chemically related to topotecan.
