      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how to heal venous leg ulcers faster and to
      test the safety of a drug and see what effects it has on a venous leg ulcer.

      You will:

        -  be interviewed and examined

        -  have a physical exam

        -  have blood and urine tested

        -  have photographs taken of the wound

        -  apply medication to the leg ulcer as directed
