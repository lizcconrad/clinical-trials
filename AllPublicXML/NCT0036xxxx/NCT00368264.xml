  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Standard therapy is ill-defined for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
      suffering from the membraneous form of Lupus nephritis (WHO class V). Therapeutic options
      used at present include azathioprine.

      In a small, open label safety study, patients with lupus nephritis, including patients with
      membraneous lupus nephritis, have experienced a long-lasting therapeutic response, with
      sustained reduction in proteinuria, following a 10 weeks course of 4 infusions of infliximab
      in combination with azathioprine. This short course appeared safe with regard to SLE
      activity, despite increases in autoantibody levels.

      Study hypothesis:

        1. The combination of four infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg of body weight)administered at
           weeks 0, 2,6, and 10, with azathioprine will be faster than azathioprine alone in
           reducing proteinuria to less than 1.5 g/day in patients with active lupus nephritis WHO
           class V (proteinuria &gt; 3g/day).

        2. This combination therapy will show a tolerable safety profile with regard to SLE
           activity and infections.

             least 2 months treatment with steroids with a dose at any time of at least 50 mg
             prednisolone (or equivalent), and ACE inhibitors and/or AT II antagonists at their
             maximum daily dose or, if this cannot be reached, the maximum daily dose tolerated).
