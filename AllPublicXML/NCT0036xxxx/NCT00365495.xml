  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity as treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Treatment of T2D is
      often done by medication, changing the diet and increased physical activity. It is well
      established that physical training has a positive effect on the pathology of T2D such as
      increased insulin sensitivity and reduced fasting plasma glucose (7) and blood lipids (15).
      It is also well known that in healthy subjects endurance training increases mitochondrial
      density, lipid oxidation during submaximal exercise, and results in a number of qualitative
      changes in the control of OXPHOS (24). However, the effect of physical training on the
      mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle of patients with T2D has not been investigated.

      The purpose of this project is to investigate the effect of physical training on the
      mitochondrial respiratory function in muscles of patients with T2D. Skeletal muscle biopsies
      will be taken before and after 10 weeks of physical training in patients with T2D and matched
      control subjects. Mitochondria will be isolated from the muscle biopsies, and respiratory
      function, free radical production and UCP3 will be determined. Furthermore, measures of
      maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), heart rate and capillary lactate concentrations and
      carbohydrate and lipid oxidation will be determined partly to verify an increased aerobic
      capacity and partly to investigate the changes in these factors in T2D patients.
