      Does presentation of clinical evidence for decision making at point-of-care improve
      prescribing patterns in ambulatory pediatrics?

      We showed previously that an electronic prescription writer and decision support system
      improved pediatric prescribing behavior for otitis media in an academic clinic setting. This
      study assessed whether point-of-care evidence delivery could demonstrate similar effects for
      a wide range of other common pediatric conditions. We performed a randomized controlled trial
      in a teaching clinic/clinical practice site and a primary care pediatric clinic serving a
      rural and semi-urban patient mix. There were 36 providers at the teaching clinic/practice
      site, and 8 providers at the private primary pediatric clinic, and an evidence-based message
      system presented real time evidence to providers based on prescribing practices for acute
      otitis media, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, constipation, pharyngitis, croup, urticaria, and
      bronchiolitis. We measured the proportion of prescriptions dispensed in accordance with
      evidence.
