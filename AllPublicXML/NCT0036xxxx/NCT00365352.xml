  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study to assess the efficacy and safety of XP13512 in subjects with Restless Legs Syndrome
      (RLS). Eligible subjects were randomized to receive 1 of 3 once daily oral doses of XP13512
      1200 mg, XP13512 600 mg, or placebo. The primary study objective was to compare the efficacy
      of XP13512 1200 mg taken once daily for 12 weeks versus placebo. The secondary study
      objectives were to assess the efficacy of XP13512 600 mg taken once daily for the reatment of
      RLS and to assess the onset of treatment benefits and improvement in sleep, pain, mood,
      quality of life, and safety and tolerability of both XP13512 1200 mg and 600 mg.

    <description>The International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating scale is a measure of RLS disease severity. The scale reflects the participant-reported assessment of primary sensory and motor features and associated sleep problems in RLS. Ten items (individually scored from 0 to 4) are included that assess the impact of symptoms on participants' mood, daily life, and activities. The total scale score is a sum of all of the individual item scores and ranges from 0-40 points, with 40 being the most severe. The scale assesses symptoms over the week prior to measurement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in IRLS Rating Scale Total Score at Week 12 Using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</title>
        <description>The International Restless Legs Syndrome (IRLS) Rating scale is a measure of RLS disease severity. The scale reflects the participant-reported assessment of primary sensory and motor features and associated sleep problems in RLS. Ten items (individually scored from 0 to 4) are included that assess the impact of symptoms on participants’ mood, daily life, and activities. The total scale score is a sum of all of the individual item scores and ranges from 0-40 points, with 40 being the most severe. The scale assesses symptoms over the week prior to measurement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the IRLS Rating Scale Total Score From Baseline at Week 12 by RLS Treatment History Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The IRLS Rating scale is a measure of RLS disease severity. The scale reflects the participant-reported assessment of primary sensory and motor features and associated sleep problems in RLS. Ten items (individually scored from 0 to 4) are included that assess the impact of symptoms on participants’ mood, daily life, and activities. The total scale score is a sum of all of the individual item scores and ranges from 0-40 points, with 40 being the most severe. The scale assesses symptoms over the week prior to measurement.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Classified as Investigator-rated CGI-I Scale Responders at Week 12 by RLS Treatment History Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The CGI-I scale is a standardized tool that is widely used in psychopharmacologic trials. For the CGI-I, the investigator was asked to rate the participant's overall change in RLS symptoms from Baseline. Scores ranged from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Participants who were much improved (score of 2) or very much improved on the CGI-I scale at the end of treatment (Week 12) are classified as &quot;Responders.&quot;</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Average Daily RLS Pain Score at the End of Treatment (Week 12) for Participants With Pain at Baseline or the End of Week 12 Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The Daily RLS pain score was assessed by participants reporting whether they experienced any pain associated with RLS in the last 24 hours and rating their pain levels on an 11-point numerical rating scale, with 0 being no pain and 10 the most intense pain imaginable. The assessment was performed for 7 days prior to Baseline and pre-defined study visits. The change from baseline was calculated as the End of Treatment (Week 12) value minus the Baseline (Day 1) value.</description>

          <description>The Daily RLS pain score was assessed by participants reporting whether they experienced any pain associated with RLS in the last 24 hours and rating their pain levels on an 11-point numerical rating scale, with 0 being no pain and 10 the most intense pain imaginable. The assessment was performed for 7 days prior to Baseline and pre-defined study visits. The change from baseline was calculated as the End of Treatment (Week 12) value minus the Baseline (Day 1) value.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Indicated on the Mood Assessment That Their Mood Was Much Improved or Very Much Improved at Week 12 (End of Treatment) Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The Mood Assessment is a non-disease-specific question surveying global change in a participant's overall mood. Participants were asked to rate their overall change in mood since the start of the study by choosing a score in a range from 1 (Very Much Improved) to 7 (Very Much Worse). The assessment was completed at Day 1 and the ends of Weeks 4, 8, and 12 or (Early Termination).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Profile of Mood State (POMS) Scale at Week 12 Using LOCF</title>
        <description>The Profile of Mood States (POMS) Brief Form contains 30 adjectives; each participant is asked to rate the degree to which each adjective describes themselves based on how they felt during the past week including the date on which the adjective was rated. The possible ratings range from “0” (Not all all) to “4” (Extremely). The Total Mood Disturbance Score (range of 0 to 120) is obtained by summing the values of six domains. Higher scores indicate a more negative mood disturbance. The POMS was completed at Baseline (Day 1), and at the end of Weeks 4, 8, and 12 (or Early Termination).</description>

          <description>The MOS Sleep Scale measures most constructs of sleep. The scale has a battery of questions to measure specific aspects of sleep in participants with co-morbidities. The four domains scored from the MOS Sleep Scale were &quot;sleep disturbance,&quot;' &quot;sleep quantity,&quot;' &quot;sleep adequacy,&quot; and &quot;daytime somnolence.&quot; The scores of the sleep adequacy domain ranged from 1 to 100, with a high score indicating greater adequacy. The assessment was completed at Baseline (Day 1) and end of Weeks, 4, 8, and 12 (or end of Treatment).</description>
