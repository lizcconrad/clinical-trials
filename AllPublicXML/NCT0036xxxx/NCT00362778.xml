  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia at admission has been associated with bad prognosis in patients with acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI). The clinical benefit of intensive treatment with insulin has
      been evaluated in diabetic patients admitted to intensive care units. The aim of our study
      was to assess the short-term effects and the safety of strict glycemic control in subjects
      with AMI and hyperglycemia without a previous history of diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-eight non-previously diabetic patients admitted with AMI and hyperglycemia were
      randomized to two treatment arms, administered during the first 48 hours: the intensive group
      (n=13) received intravenous insulin with target glycemia levels of 80-110mg/dL, while the
      conventional group (n=15) received subcutaneous insulin only when glycemia was ³ 160mg/dL.
      High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HS-CRP) was determined at 48 hours and before discharge
      and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed at 1 month.
