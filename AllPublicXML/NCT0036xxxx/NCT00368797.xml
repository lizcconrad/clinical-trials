  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NV1FGF, a pCOR
      plasmid constructed by inserting the gene coding for the FGF compared to placebo in patients
      with severe Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease, Fontaine's stage IV. The efficacy was
      assessed by the complete healing of at least one ulcer in the treated limb, 25 week
      post-baseline and secondary by the rate of amputation and death.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatients with severe Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease defined as Rutherford's
             Grade III, category 5 or 6, or Fontaine's stage IV.

          -  Trophic lesions with no signs of healing (no reduction in ulcer size or depth) for at
             least 2 weeks prior to first study treatment administration (Day 1).

          -  Patients with objective evidence of peripheral vascular disease (resting ankle
             pressure &lt; 70 mmHg and/or toe pressure &lt; 50 mmHg, and/or resting ankle-brachial index
             (ABI) &lt; 0.4 and/or resting toe-brachial index (TBI) &lt; 0.3 and/or metatarsal pulse
             volume recording (PVR) flat or barely pulsatile) in the diseased limb on two
             consecutive examinations performed at least 1 week apart.

          -  Demonstration or documentation (historical data not older than 6 months prior to first
             study treatment administration) of total occlusion of the affected limb of one or more
             of the iliac, superficial femoral, popliteal and/or one or more infrapopliteal
             arteries as assessed by angiography.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months from the first study treatment administration.

          -  Poor/not candidates for revascularization (patients suitable for revascularization but
             with a high risk of failure/ amputation/ or patients not suitable for
             revascularization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or current history of malignant disease. Patients who had successful tumor
             resection or radio-chemotherapy more than 5 years prior to inclusion in the study and
             no recurrence will be allowed for inclusion.

          -  Suspicion of malignant disease (abnormal X ray,positive. stool hemoccult, positive
             Prostate Specific Antigen , abnormal mammography, papanicolaou smear of Class IV or
             Class V characterization.

          -  Lower extremity surgery : bypass/angioplasty of the leg to be treated within 2 months
             prior to the first administration of study treatment (Day 1).

          -  Active proliferative retinopathy.

          -  Buerger's disease
