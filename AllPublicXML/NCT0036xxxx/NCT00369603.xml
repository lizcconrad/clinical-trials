  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether standard medications approved for
      Alzheimer's disease treatment differ in their action on brain functioning and whether any
      observed brain activity differences as result of treatment are associated with particular
      patterns of dementia improvement or reduced decline.

      This study seeks to differentiate task-related and resting brain activity patterns captured
      via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and associated with two common Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) medications, equivalent in acetylcholinesterase inhibition effect (AChEI) but
      differing with respect to allosteric nicotinic receptor modulation effect. It is the primary
      aim of this project to gain a better understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in the
      attentional and executive skills improvements associated with nicotinic receptor modulation
      in mild AD patients.

      To address this question, this 12-week continuous treatment, double-blind, head-to-head
      dose-escalation treatment trial seeks to visualize any treatment response unique to
      allosteric nicotinic receptor modulation and to associate these fMRI data with standard
      cognitive assessment outcomes. Using in-scanner tasks shown to reliably elicit brain activity
      in cortical regions important to memory and attention, this treatment trial will examine both
      resting and task-related BOLD signal characteristics in a well-characterized sample of 36
      mild AD patients after periods of low dose and high dose AD dementia treatment with either
      galantamine hydrobromide (AChEI + nicotinic receptor modulation) or donepezil hydrochloride
      (AChEI only). Both the low and high dose imaging comparisons between treatment groups will be
      equivalent for 35% AChEI-effect, which may allow for the isolation of BOLD signal unique to
      allosteric nicotinic receptor modulation in both brain at rest and task-related brain states.
