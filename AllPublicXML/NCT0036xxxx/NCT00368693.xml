  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and side effects, if any, of Dermal - LSR
      combined with standard treatment. We hypothesize the treatment will provide beneficial
      results for diabetic patients suffering foot ulcers.

      This prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center study will test the
      efficacy of Dermal - Living Skin Replacement (Dermal - LSR) plus standard of care treatment
      against solely the standard of care treatment on participants with diabetic foot ulcers.

      The purpose of this study is to test Dermal - LSR combined with standard treatment. We want
      to see how well it works and the number and types of side effects, if any. We hope to learn
      more about how to heal diabetic foot ulcers better.

      You will:

        -  be interviewed and examined

        -  have weekly clinic visits

        -  have blood drawn

        -  have the ulcer photographed

        -  wear a walking boot to reduce pressure on the ulcer

    <description>The only experimental procedure is the application of the study device, Dermal - Living Skin Replacement (Dermal - LSR), to the foot ulcer. All others are regular or standard procedures. Dermal - LSR is a gel containing living human skin cells. This gel is applied directly to ulcers to help repair the skin. The cells used in this study device have come from one foreskin (skin covering the tip of the penis) taken from a baby boy shortly after his birth for reasons unrelated to this study. All cells that will be used have been tested to be healthy and safe. The amount of the study device you will receive depends on the size of your ulcer at each treatment visit. You will receive less than a 1/4 teaspoon of Dermal - LSR for about every dime-size area of your ulcer as measured and calculated by the research investigator.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have Type I or Type II diabetes

          -  Signed informed consent obtained from subject or legal guardian/representative prior
             to the first study intervention.

          -  Age ≥ 18 and &lt; 85 years old at the time the informed consent is signed.

          -  Subjects will have a diabetic ulcer on the lower extremity, with the ulcer having all
             of the following characteristics:

               1. Full-thickness plantar ulcers (fore and mid foot only);

               2. Non-infected as determined by clinical assessment;

               3. Neuropathic as determined by monofilament assessment;

               4. Area ≥ 1.0 cm2 ≤ 25.0 cm2 post-debridement;

               5. Has been present for at least 8 weeks under a physician's observation at the time
                  of enrollment;

               6. Extends through the dermis but without tendon, muscle, capsule or bone exposure.

          -  Subjects will have only one diabetic foot ulcer on the target limb.

          -  Subjects will have either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus

          -  The ulcer bed at the time of enrollment must be free of all necrotic and infected soft
             and bony tissue as determined by clinical examination (no evidence of probing to bone)
             and by X-ray films.

             then a transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) of ≥ 40 mmHg OR a toe
             pressure of ≥ 50 mmHg must be obtained for subject to be eligible.

             treatment.
