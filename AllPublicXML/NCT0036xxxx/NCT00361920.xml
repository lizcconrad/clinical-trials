  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that patients who demonstrate steroid resistant asthma by showing little or
      no improvement in lung function after a course of oral steroids have different cellular
      responses to steroids than patients who are steroid sensitive. These altered responses are
      the reason they demonstrate steroid resistance.

      Current NHLBI guidelines for persistent asthma management recommends the use of steroids for
      treatment of airway inflammation (1,2). However, some asthmatics do not respond to steroids
      (3-6). Unfortunately these patients are subjected to the unwanted side effects (osteoporosis,
      cataracts, etc) of high dose steroid therapy because non-immune tissues remain sensitive to
      steroids. Recent studies suggest that the costs of asthma are largely attributable to
      uncontrolled disease (7). Thus, it is important to understand the mechanism(s) of steroid
      resistance and introduce new forms of therapy for the treatment of these difficult to control
      asthmatics. As a prelude to pharmaceutical studies in steroid resistant asthma, it is
      imperative to develop biomarkers that can robustly identify individuals likely to be poor
      steroid responders so that alternative non-steroid anti-inflammatory therapies, such as
      Xolair®, can be introduced early in the course of asthma therapy.
