    <textblock>
      A double arm (non-inferiority) 44 patient study to assess the performance of BeadBlock™ in
      the treatment of uterine fibroids by embolization with respect to clinical &amp; imaging outcome
      with comparison of primary safety endpoints to Embosphere.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to conduct a comparison between BeadBlock™ and Embosphere in
      uterine fibroid embolization. Baseline and follow-up MR Imaging data will be made with
      respect to changes in fibroid and uterus perfusion and fibroid and uterine volume. This is a
      12 months study (12 month follow up for all enrollees). The primary end-point will be the
      degree of fibroid devascularization as seen at contrast-enhanced MRI performed 3 months (+/-
      15 days) after UAE procedure. In addition we will assess symptom reduction in patients that
      have undergone uterine fibroid embolization with Bead Block™ and Embosphere®.

      Primary Objective 1. To assess the change in fibroid devascularization as seen at
      contrast-enhanced MRI performed after UAE and at three (3) months (+/- 15 days) following the
      UAE, and compare the changes between BeadBlock™ and Embosphere.

      Secondary Objective

      1. To assess the change in fibroid devascularization as seen at contrast-enhanced MRI
      performed several days after UAE and 6 months (+/- 15 days) following the UAE, and compare
      the changes between BeadBlock™ and Embosphere.

      Tertiary Objective

        1. To assess the change in uterine volume as seen at contrast-enhanced MRI performed
           several days after UAE, 3 months (+/- 15 days) and 6 months (+/- 15 days) following the
           UAE, and compare the changes between BeadBlock™ and Embosphere.

        2. To assess the change from baseline in symptom severity (UFS-QOL)at 3, 6 and 12 months
           (+/- 15 days) follow-up, as measured by the subscale of the UFS questionnaire, and
           compare the changes between BeadBlock™ and Embosphere.
