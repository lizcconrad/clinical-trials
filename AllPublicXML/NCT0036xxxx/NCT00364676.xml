  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study will determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      vinorelbine liposomes injection (VLI) in patients with advanced solid tumors, non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma, or Hodgkin's disease.

      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with VLI.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VLI.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VLI.

        -  To explore preliminary tumor response of VLI.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed solid tumor refractory to standard therapy or for which no
             standard therapy is known to exist, or relapsed and/or refractory non-Hodgkin's
             lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease

          2. Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal functions as defined by laboratory tests.

          3. At least 18 years of age.

          4. Have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          5. Patients must give written informed consent.

          6. ECOG or Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary tumors of central nervous system (CNS). Symptomatic brain metastases (unless
             patient is stable without requirement of steroids and/or antiseizure medications for
             at least 3 months) or leptomeningeal tumor involvement.

          2. Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas and mitomycin C).

          3. Planned concurrent systemic therapy and/or radiotherapy drug study treatment.

          4. Use of investigational drugs, biologics or devices within 28 days prior to study
             treatment or planned use during the course of the study.

          5. Active infection or any serious underlying medical condition, which would impair the
             ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment.

          6. Prophylactic hematologic growth factors administered less than or equal to 2 weeks
             prior to start of therapy with VLI (excluding darbepoetin alfa, epoetin alfa).

          7. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          8. Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding
             and giving of informed consent.
