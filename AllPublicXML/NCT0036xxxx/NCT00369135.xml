  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickness absenteeism caused by MSDs is a persistent and expensive health challenge in all
      industrial countries including Switzerland. Despite much progress as to the cause and
      prevention of MSDs, they continue to be some of the most prevalent and challenging health
      problems with respect to the work-place and to socio-economic burden.

      To improve the situation, several recent reviews recommended interventions based on the
      bio-psycho-social model. Work-hardening and industrial rehabilitation programs focused more
      on the in balance between physical and mental demands of work on one side and capacities of
      the individual on the other side. Therefore we propose to merge the two models into one. The
      result is an interdisciplinary intervention strategy witch includes work hardening, medical
      trainings, a cognitive behavioural approach and work place intervention.
