  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is an inherited disorder characterized by elevated
      levels of cholesterol and triglycerides; it often occurs in Mexican individuals with coronary
      heart disease (CHD). The purpose of this study is to identify the specific genes that
      predispose Mexican individuals to FCHL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CHD is the leading cause of death in Mexico. Dyslipidemia that is characterized by high total
      cholesterol, high triglycerides, and low &quot;good&quot; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is
      a risk factor for developing CHD. Research has shown that the Mexican population has an
      increased tendency towards dyslipidemia, but it is not known what genetic factors contribute
      to this predisposition. This study will examine the genetic basis of FCHL, which is an
      inherited form of dyslipidemia characterized by elevated levels of total cholesterol and
      triglycerides. FCHL is a major contributing factor in CHD; 20% of individuals with CHD under
      the age of 60 have FCHL. The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize the
      specific DNA sequence variations that predispose Mexican individuals to FCHL. Results of this
      study may aid in the development of appropriate prevention and screening techniques.

      This study will enroll individuals in Mexico who have FCHL. Participants will attend one
      study visit for blood collection and DNA sampling. Family members of participants will be
      contacted and asked to provide a DNA sample also. A select group of participants will return
      for a second study visit for RNA sampling. Study researchers will analyze participants' DNA
      and RNA samples, as well as two FCHL genes identified in previous research studies.
