  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 12-month double blind, placebo controlled randomized trial is to evaluate
      the effects of daily treatments with low magnitude mechanical stimuli on bone in 160 children
      with Crohn disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal growth is characterized by increases in the size of the hard outer layer of bone
      (cortical bone), and the density of the inner layer of bone (trabecular or &quot;spongy&quot; bone).
      Children with Crohn disease (CD) have numerous risk factors for impaired bone accumulation,
      including poor growth, delayed puberty, malnutrition, glucocorticoid therapy and
      inflammation. We reported that children with CD had significant deficits in trabecular bone
      mineral density (BMD), cortical dimensions, and muscle mass; bone deficits were strongly
      associated with muscle deficits. No trials of therapies that build bone or prevent bone
      breakdown have been conducted in chronic pediatric inflammatory diseases. The capacity to
      increase bone mass and dimensions in response to mechanical loading is greatest during
      growth. Recent studies demonstrate that brief daily exposure to low magnitude mechanical
      stimuli (LMMS) enhances bone mass and quality. This 12-month double blind, placebo controlled
      randomized trial will evaluate daily 10-minute treatments with LMMS in 160 children with CD.
      Trabecular BMD, cortical dimensions, and muscle area will be measured by quantitative
      computed tomography (QCT). The LMMS device monitors adherence; these data will be transmitted
      by modem to the psychologist who will work closely with subjects to optimize adherence. All
      subjects will be provided with calcium and vitamin D supplements. The primary aims are to
      determine if treatment with LMMS results in increased trabecular BMD in the lower leg and
      spine and increased cortical dimensions in the lower leg in children with CD, compared with
      placebo controls.

    <measure>Change in Tibia Trabecular Volumetric Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Z-score at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We calculated the mean change in tibia trabecular volumetric BMD Z-score between baseline and 12 months, as measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT).
The Z-score, or Standard Deviation Score, is a measure of the number of standard deviations that an individual is above or below the median value in a healthy child or adolescent of the same age, sex and race. For example, a Z-score of 0 means that an individual's result is equivalent to the 50th percentile in a healthy population. A Z-score of -1.0 means that an individual's result is equovalent to the 16th percentile in a healthy population.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The recruitment period began May 17, 2007 and ended June 25, 2010. Participants were recruited from the Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease at CHOP and through referrals from physicians outside CHOP. The study was also advertised on the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation Website.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Patients between the ages of 8-21 years with a diagnosis of Crohn disease for at least 6 months were eligible for a screening visit. Patients meeting the entry criteria (pQCT trabecular volumetric BMD z-score below the 25th percentile)were randomly allocated 1:1 to an active LMMS device or a placebo device.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in Tibia Trabecular Volumetric Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Z-score at 12 Months</title>
        <description>We calculated the mean change in tibia trabecular volumetric BMD Z-score between baseline and 12 months, as measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT).
The Z-score, or Standard Deviation Score, is a measure of the number of standard deviations that an individual is above or below the median value in a healthy child or adolescent of the same age, sex and race. For example, a Z-score of 0 means that an individual's result is equivalent to the 50th percentile in a healthy population. A Z-score of -1.0 means that an individual's result is equovalent to the 16th percentile in a healthy population.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>The number was determined by the number of participants with measures at both baseline and 12 month time points. The analysis was intention to treat.</population>
