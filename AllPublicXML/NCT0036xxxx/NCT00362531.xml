  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) is one of the most common forms of nephrotic syndrome
      (NS) in adults and is usually treated by corticosteroids in combination with cytotoxic drugs
      especially cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine. Tacrolimus, a new immunosuppressive agent, was
      proved to be effective in treating refractory NS. Whether it is effective in IMN has not been
      reported. We therefore undertook a multi-center, controlled study to investigate the efficacy
      and safety profile of tacrolimus compared with cyclophosphamide in the treatment of patients
      with idiopathic membranous nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome.

      Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) is one of the most common forms of nephrotic syndrome
      (NS) in adults and is usually treated by corticosteroids in combination with cytotoxic drugs
      especially cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine. However, the effect was not satisfying and the
      side-effects of the above immunosuppressive agents were often a worrying problem. Tacrolimus,
      a new immunosuppressive agent, was proved to be effective in treating refractory NS
      especially FSGS. Whether it is effective in IMN has not been reported. We therefore undertook
      a multi-center, controlled study to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of tacrolimus
      compared with cyclophosphamide in the treatment of patients with idiopathic membranous
      nephropathy and nephrotic syndrome.
