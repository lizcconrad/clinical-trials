  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year in the United States, thousands of babies are born with heart defects. Women who
      take folic acid during pregnancy have a lower risk of giving birth to infants with heart
      defects, but the reason for this remains unknown. This study will examine the relationship
      between genes, nutrition, and the occurrence of heart defects in infants.

      Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect; each year, more than
      30,000 babies in the United States are born with this kind of abnormality. Conotruncal heart
      defects, considered to be a very serious type of defect, involve a structural abnormality in
      the chambers of the heart or blood vessels that lead to and from the heart. Infants born with
      conotruncal defects must undergo complex open heart surgery, and there is a high fatality
      rate. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy has been shown to reduce the risk of
      conotruncal defects. However, some women who take folic acid during pregnancy still give
      birth to infants with conotruncal defects. Specific genes may influence the way individuals
      metabolize folic acid, and variations in these genes may make some infants more prone to
      developing heart defects. This study will examine the relationship between genes, maternal
      nutritional intake, and conotruncal heart defects. The results from this study may help to
      determine genetic and nutritional causes of congenital heart defects.

      This study will use previously collected data on 550 infants born with conotruncal defects
      and 1060 infants born without heart defects. There will be no study visits specifically for
      this study. Infant DNA will be analyzed for genes that may play a role in folate metabolic
      pathways. Blood previously collected from the mothers during pregnancy will be analyzed for
      differences in nutrient intake. Specifically, levels of folic acid, choline, vitamin B12, and
      methionine will be examined.
