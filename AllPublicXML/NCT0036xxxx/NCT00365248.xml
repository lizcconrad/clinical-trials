    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Has the parent(s)/legal guardian given informed consent according to local
             requirements before any trial related activities?

          2. Is the child above 4 weeks and below 6 years of age?

          3. Has at least segmental resection (anatomical/non-anatomical) of the liver and primary
             haemostatic treatment been performed? or Has resection of the liver and placement of a
             segmental liver graft and primary haemostatic treatment been performed?

          4. Is only minor, i.e. oozing, or moderate haemorrhage persisting after primary surgical
             haemostatic procedures of the major vessels (no pulsating arterial haemorrhage and/or
             major venous bleeding)?

        All inclusion criteria must be answered &quot;yes&quot; for a child to participate in the study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Was the child retransplanted or had liver transplantation in combination with other
             organs?

          2. Was there anamnestic or laboratory evidence of congenital coagulation disorders
             including Haemophilia A or B and von Willebrand disease?

          3. Has the child a history of allergic reactions after application of human fibrinogen,
             human thrombin and/or collagen of any origin?

          4. Has the child fulminant hepatic failure, portal vein thrombosis or anamnestic or
             clinical evidence of cirrhotic condition of the liver, including cirrhosis due to
             genetic deficiency of a1 - Antitrypsin?

          5. Did the child undergo an emergency operation?

          6. Does the child participate in another clinical trial during the intra-operative phase?

          7. Has any serious surgical complication occurred?

          8. Has any fibrin glue haemostatic (including TachoSil ® ) been used on the target wound
             before the planned application of TachoSil ® ? To participate in the study all
             exclusion criteria must be answered &quot;No&quot; for a child having segmental resection. For a
             child having total hepatectomy and placement of a segmental liver transplant criteria
             4 and 5 can be answered &quot;Yes&quot;.
