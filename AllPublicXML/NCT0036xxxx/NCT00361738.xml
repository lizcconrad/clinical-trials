  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dose-ranging study of AVE2268 in the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      also receiving metformin.

      Its main objectives will be to assess the effects of several doses of AVE2268 on Mean Plasma
      Glucose. Its secondary objectives will be to assess the effects of AVE2268 on plasma glucose
      (fasting and post-prandial), and also the safety and tolerability of AVE2268.

          -  Subjects with &quot;brittle-diabetes&quot; or any hospitalization or emergency room visit due to
             poor diabetic control within the past 6 months, previous history of diabetes related
             dehydration leading to hospitalization, history or evidence of ketoacidosis.

          -  Presence or history of cancer within the past five years.

          -  Evidence within the past 6 months of myocardial infarction, stroke, retinopathy
