      This is an extension study to provide ongoing treatment with AMG 706 monotherapy for subjects
      with solid tumors who have completed the planned duration of AMG 706 treatment on a separate
      Amgen protocol and have been evaluated as having stable disease or better. Subjects who are
      no longer eligible to continue AMG 706 treatment on a separate Amgen protocol (for reasons
      other than AMG 706 intolerance), but who are receiving clinical benefit or have the potential
      to receive clinical benefit from AMG 706 per the investigator are also eligible to
      participate in this trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women and men 18 yrs or older with solid tumors, previously treated with AMG 706 on an
             Amgen protocol

          -  Subject must meet one of the following criteria: Subject has completed the planned
             duration of AMG 706 treatment on a separate Amgen protocol and has been evaluated as
             having stable disease or better or is no longer eligible to continue AMG 706 treatment
             on separate Amgen protocol for reasons other than AMG 706 intolerance, but is
             receiving clinical benefit from AMG 706 in the judgement of the investigator.

          -  Subject must meet one of the following criteria: Subject has received AMG 706 for at
             least 8 weeks or until the first protocol-specified tumor evaluation (whichever is
             longer) or

          -  Subject has received at least one dose of AMG 706 but did not receive AMG 706 for =/&gt;8
             weeks.

          -  Sign informed consent prior to study specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Discontinued from prior AMG 706 study due to AMG 706-related adverse event including
             intolerance to AMG 706 or for any other reason that a subject's safety could be
             compromised with continued AMG 706 treatment.

          -  Has been off AMG 706 treatment &gt;42 days prior to study day 1.

          -  Participating in any intervening investigational device or drug study between previous
             AMG 706 study and this AMG 706 study or is receiving any other investigational
             agent(s) other than AMG 706.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (resting blood pressure &gt; 150/90 mmHg). Anti-hypertensive
             medications are allowed if the subject is stable on their current dose at time of
             study day1

          -  Requires additional systemic anticancer therapy for primary tumor.

          -  ANC &lt; 1.0 x 10^9/L; PLT &lt; 100 x 10^9/L; Hgb &lt; 9 g/dL; serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or
             calculated clearance &lt; 40 mL/min; AST &gt;2.5 x ULN, or AST =/&gt; to or =/&gt;5.0 x ULN if
             secondary to liver metastases; ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN or ALT =/&gt;5X ULN if liver metastasis are
             present; Alkaline phosphates &gt;2.0 x ULN or =/&gt;5 x ULN if liver and bone metastases are
             present; total bilirubin =/&gt; 2 x ULN (except for subjects with UGT1A1 promoter
             polymorphism, ie, Gilbert's syndrome. Subjects enrolled with Gilbert's syndrome must
             have a total bilirubin &lt;3 x ULN).
