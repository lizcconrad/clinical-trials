      To assess the effect of Aranesp_ on the hemoglobin (Hgb) of CRI subjects who are recombinant
      human erythropoietin (rHuEPO)-naïve or converting from rHuEPO therapy. To assess the
      association between subject self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as it
      relates to Hgb concentration and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in subjects who were
      rHuEPO-naïve prior to study enrollment. To characterize the health-related resource
      utilization of subjects with CRI. To characterize the subject satisfaction with Aranesp_
      compared to previous rHuEPO therapy. To characterize iron treatment in subjects with CRI. To
      assess the safety profile of Aranesp_ therapy in subjects with CRI

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥ 18 years old

          -  diagnosis of CRI and not receiving dialysis therapy (must be predialysis)

          -  measured or estimated (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) creatinine clearance (CrCl)
             of ≤ 70 mL/min, or GFR ≤ 60 mL/min (using the MDRD formula):

          -  Cockcroft-Gault formula: CrCl = (140 minus age in years) x (body weight in kg) serum
             creatinine (mg/dL) x 72.0 For women, the value will be multiplied by 0.85

          -  MDRD formula: GFR = 170 x [SCr]-0.999 x [Age]-0.167 x [0.762 if subject is female] x
             [1.180 if subject is black] x [sun] -0.170SAlb]-0.318

          -  mean Hgb &lt; 11 g/dL during the screening/baseline period (if subject is not already
             receiving rHuEPO therapy)

          -  for subjects currently receiving rHuEPO therapy, the subject must have: a stable
             rHuEPO dose for the past month; and a rHuEPO frequency of once weekly.
