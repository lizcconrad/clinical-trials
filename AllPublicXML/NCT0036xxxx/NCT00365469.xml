  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators had conducted a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial
      studying the effects of 6 months probiotics supplementation from birth on allergic disease
      and sensitization up to 2 years of age. This follow-up study will extend a further 3 years to
      5 years of age for assessing the longer term beneficial effects of this form of probiotics
      intervention on the incidence of allergic disease and sensitization at 5 years of age.

      Probiotics are helpful bacteria of healthy gut and have shown potential in reducing allergy.
      A double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial studying the effects of 6 months
      probiotics supplementation from birth on allergic disease and sensitization up to 2 years of
      age had been conducted. This study aims to assess the longer term beneficial effects of this
      form of intervention on the incidence of allergic disease and sensitization at 5 years of age
      by extending the follow-up period.

      All children (from original cohort of 253) who completed the initial 2-year visit has been
      invited to participate. They will be evaluated with monthly phone calls and yearly clinic
      visits. Allergic sensitization will be assessed with skin prick tests to a panel of
      allergens.

      This project will provide insights into the role of early supplementation of probiotics on
      the development of the immune system and its effect on allergy. The additional follow-up
      period is critical for the evaluation of respiratory allergies in the form of clinical
      asthma, allergic rhinitis and sensitization to inhalant allergens, which tend to develop
      after 2 years of age.
