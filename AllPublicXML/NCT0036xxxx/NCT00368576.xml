          -  Subjects must have been on a stable, low-dose ICS for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to
             the screening visit.

          -  Aged 18-65 years, at screening

          -  FEV1 greater than or equal to 70% predicted (ECCS, 1993)

          -  Subjects must show an increase in FEV1 greater than or equal to 12% (and an absolute
             change &gt;200mL) within 30 minutes following inhalation of 4 puffs of
             albuterol/salbutamol or 1 nebulized treatment of 2.5mg or have historical, documented
             evidence of reversibility, within 12 months prior to screening

          -  Subjects must be willing to replace their inhaled, short-acting β2-agonist with study
             provided albuterol/salbutamol

          -  Patient must be capable of giving informed consent and comply with the study
             requirements and timetable.

        Inclusion Criteria following run in period (Prior to randomisation) Subjects will be
        screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria noted above.

        During the run-in period [Day -14 to Day 1], subjects will be asked to maintain a diary
        card and document the number of puffs of rescue inhaled, short-acting β2-agonists taken,
        asthma-related symptoms and night time awakenings as well as morning and evening PEF
        measurements.

        On the morning of Day 0, subjects will be eligible for randomisation into the study if all
        of the following criteria are met:

          -  Subjects required, on average less than or 2 puffs per day of study provided
             albuterol/ salbutamol during the last 7-day period prior to Day 0 [from Day -7 to Day
             1]

          -  Subjects had asthma symptoms on less than or 5 out of the last 7 consecutive days of
             the run-in period

          -  FEV1 greater than or equal to 70% predicted (ECCS, 1993).

          -  FEV1 must be within ± 15% of the FEV1 value at beginning of screening.

          -  Compliance with completion of the diary card.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  The patient has life threatening asthma. A research patient must not have been
