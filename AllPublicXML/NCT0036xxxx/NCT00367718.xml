  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to test the Efficacy in terms of rates of disease response in metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma of the standard dose of velcade 1.3 mg/m2 given at the day 1,4,8,and
      11 every 21 days schedule. The study uses a Simons 2 stage design and will enroll between
      15-25 patients. Secondary endpoints studied include Pharmacokinetics, toxicities, EBV viral
      load and molecular characterization of EBV in plasma.
