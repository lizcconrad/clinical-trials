    <textblock>
      The hypothesis to be proven is that histamine iontophoresis with measurement of microvascular
      blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry can be used as a reliable marker to characterize the
      normal microvascular cutaneous response to histamine.

      The specific aim of this study is to validate iontophoresis (with measurement of
      microvascular blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry) in a pediatric cohort as a surrogate
      marker capable of reliably characterizing the normal physiologic response of the cutaneous
      microvasculature to histamine. In future studies laser Doppler flowmetry ultimately will be
      used to assess whether microvascular blood flow determined by a previously validated laser
      Doppler technique can be used as a reliable surrogate endpoint capable of functionally
      discriminating the effects of polymorphisms in the genes which are quantitatively important
      for histamine metabolism. The hypothesis to be proven is that histamine iontophoresis with
      measurement of microvascular blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry can be used as a reliable
      marker to characterize the normal microvascular cutaneous response to histamine.
