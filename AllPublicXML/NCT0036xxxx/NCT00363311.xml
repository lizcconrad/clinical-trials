The National Comprehensive Network (NCCN), 2005 clinical practices guidelines in Oncology-prostate cancer were used for clinical tumor staging. T0: no evidence of primary tumor; T1: clinically inapparent tumor, neither palpable nor visible by imaging; T2: tumor confined within the prostate; T3: tumor extends through the prostate capsule; T4: tumor is fixed or invades adjacent structures other than seminal vesicles. A clinical stage of T0 in post-baseline biopsies has been interpreted as &quot;No Worsening.&quot;</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Pathologic Progression</title>
        <description>Pathological progression is defined as one of the following: &gt;=4 cores involved; &gt;=50% of any 1 core involved; or a Gleason pattern of &gt;=4 as a result of any on-study/for-cause biopsy. The 2005 International Society of Urological Pathologists recommendations for Gleason scoring (GS) were used to grade tumors. A primary grade is assigned to the most common tumor pattern, and a second grade to the next most common tumor pattern. The two grades are added together to get a GS. The Gleason grade=1-5, with 5 having the worst prognosis. The Gleason score=2-10, with 10 having the worst prognosis.</description>

          <description>All participants were required by protocol to undergo a TRUS-guided 12-core prostate biopsy at 1.5 and 3 years or at the end of the study, if the participant discontinued the study early. Any for-cause biopsy (outside of protocol-mandated biopsies) 12 cores were obtained. All biopsies were reviewed and analyzed by a central pathologist. . The final biopsy is defined as the latest post-baseline biopsy for which the results are available from the central pathology laboratory.</description>

        <description>The 2005 International Society of Urological Pathologists recommendations for Gleason scoring were used to grade tumors. A primary grade is assigned to the most common tumor pattern (how the cancer cells look under a microscope), and a second grade to the next most common pattern. The two grades are added together to get a GS. Gleason grade range= 1-5; 5=worst prognosis. GS range=2-10; 10=worst prognosis. Improvement is defined as a decrease in GS from a baseline score of 6 (GS&lt;=6; includes no cancer); worsening is defined as an increase in GS from a baseline score of 6 (GS &gt;6).</description>

          <description>All on-study or for-cause biopsies were reviewed and analyzed by a central pathologist. The 2005 International Society of Urological Pathologists recommendations for Gleason scoring were used to grade the tumor. A primary grade is assigned to the most common tumor pattern (how the cancer cells look under a microscope), and a secondary grade to the next most common tumor pattern. The two grades are added together to get a GS. The Gleason grade ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 having the worst prognosis. The Gleason score ranges from 2 to 10, with 10 having the worst prognosis.</description>

        <description>The MAX-PC is a self-reported measure evaluating three aspects of PC-related anxiety: general anxiety related to PC/treatment, fear of recurrence, and anxiety related to PSA testing. The MAX-PC consists of 18 questions, each score ranging from 0 (least anxiety) to 3 (maximum anxiety). Total score is the sum of each question score, thus ranging from 0 to 54. A higher MAX-PC score indicates greater anxiety. At Months 18 and 36, participants were given an additional copy of the questionnaire and were asked to complete at home once they were notified of their PSA result and to send back to clinic.</description>

        <description>The MAX-PC anxiety subscale consists of 3 questions related to PSA testing; &quot;I have been so anxious about my PSA test that I have thought about delaying it.&quot;, &quot;I have been so worried about my PSA test result that I have thought about asking my doctor to repeat the test.&quot;, &quot;I have been so concerned about my PSA test result that I have thought about having the test repeated at another laboratory to make sure the test results were accurate.&quot; A higher MAX-PC score indicates greater anxiety.Scores range from 0 to 3 for each question.

          <description>The MAX-PC fear of recurrence subscale consists of 4 questions related to fear of recurrence; &quot;Because cancer is unpredictable, I feel I cannot plan for the future.&quot;, &quot;My fear of having my cancer getting worse gets in the way of my enjoying life.&quot;, &quot;I am afraid of my cancer getting worse.&quot;, &quot;I am more nervous since I was diagnosed with prostate cancer.&quot; A higher MAX-PC score indicates greater anxiety. Scores range from 0 to 3 for each question. The total score is the sum of the 4 question scores: 0 to 12.</description>

This scale is divided into five subscales: the Physical Well-Being Subscale (7 questions); the Social/Family Well-Being Subscale (7 questions); the Emotional Well-Being Subscale (6 questions); the Functional Well-Being Subscale (7 questions); and the Prostate Cancer Subscale (12 questions). The score for each of the 39 questions ranges from 0 to 4. The total FACT-P score thus ranges from 0 to156; a higher score indicates better quality of life.</description>

          <description>The FACT-P consists of a total of 39 questions. This scale is divided into five subscales: the Physical Well-Being Subscale (7 questions); the Social/Family Well-Being Subscale (7 questions); the Emotional Well-Being Subscale (6 questions); the Functional Well-Being Subscale (7 questions); and the Prostate Cancer Subscale (12 questions). The questionnaire was administered at baseline and at Months 18 and 36. The score for each of the 39 questions ranges from 0 to 4. The total FACT-P score thus ranges from 0 to156; a higher score indicates better QOL.</description>
