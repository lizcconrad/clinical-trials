  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of the study is to establish an in-vitro method to evaluate the effect of
      probiotics on gas production in feces (hydrogen and methane)

      The objective of this study is to establish a model for screening probiotic bacteria in the
      treatment of meteorism symptoms (feeling of air in the stomach) with otherwise healthy adult
      women. As excessive bacterial gas production in the intestine is the most likely mechanism
      behind meteorism, we will examine eventual changes of the production of gases (hydrogen and
      methane) before and after administration of Trevis®. For screening of Trevis® we will apply a
      combination of clinical examination and a laboratory model for the determination of
      gastrointestinal gas production (a new method in connection with studies on probiotics). The
      results will be compared with the test person’s specification of their health, both with
      respect to gastrointestinal function and in general through questionnaires. The background
      for the project will be described in the following.
