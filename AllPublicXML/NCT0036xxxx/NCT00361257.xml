      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of minocycline, an antibiotic, in
      lessening the decreased mental function sometimes caused by anti-HIV drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment, including disabling cognitive, behavioral, and social dysfunction,
      continues to be a major problem faced by HIV-infected people taking antiretroviral therapy
      (ART). Research is needed to develop treatment that can be given alongside ART to prevent or
      lessen cognitive impairment caused by ART. Minocycline, an antibiotic commonly used for the
      treatment of acne and rheumatoid arthritis, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and
      neuroprotective properties in previous studies. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of
      24-week therapy with minocycline in lessening the cognitive impairment of HIV infected adults
      taking ART.

      This study will last at least 24 weeks and has two steps. Patients will be stratified by HIV
      viral load and their neurocognitive state at study screening. In Step I, patients will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 participants will receive twice-daily
      minocycline for 24 weeks; Group 2 participants will receive placebo. At the end of Phase I,
      study participants will be offered to enter Step II; all participants in Step II will receive
      twice-daily minocycline for an additional 24 weeks.

      There will be a total of 8 study visits: 5 visits for Step I (including the entry visit) and
      3 visits for Step II. Medical history will occur at all visits. Blood collection will occur
      at all visits. Participants who have positive nonreactive rapid plasma regain (RPR) values at
      screening will have mandatory lumbar punctures; for those with negative serum RPR results
      lumbar punctures are optional. Participants who test positive for syphilis will also have a
      lumbar puncture at their discretion to determine if syphilis has affected the brain. A
      neurological exam, other neuropsychological, dementia, and depression scale assessments, and
      urine collection will occur at most visits. Patients will be asked to complete a
      questionnaire on daily living at study entry and Weeks 12 and 24. Patients who have a lumbar
      puncture at Week 24 will receive a phone call 2 to 5 days after the procedure to report any
      adverse effects. Some participants may also have an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the study.
      For participants not on atazanavir some procedures and sample collections are optional.

    <time_frame>At baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) questionnaire is designed to learn more about how subjects are able to perform common tasks. There are 16 common tasks. For each task, if the score at the time of evaluation is worse than the best in the past, an indicator of 1 is given. Otherwise, the indicator is 0. The overall IADL score is a sum of 16 indicators divided by 16; therefore, the range is between 0 and 1 and the lower score is better.

          <description>This is an average z-scores of Grooved Pegboard Dominant and Non-Dominant Hand Tests adjusted for age, sex, education, and African-American ethnicity. The grooved pegboard is a manipulative dexterity test requiring rapid visual-motor coordination. The test is completed using the dominant hand (GPD) and then using the non-dominant hand (GPN). The score for each hand is the time in seconds that the participant takes to complete the entire board.</description>

          <description>This is an average of z-scores of Trail Making Part A (TMA) and Trail Making Part B (TMB) tests adjusted for age, sex, education, and African-American ethnicity. The TMA and TMB tests are measures of planning ability, visual-motor speed and concentration. Subjects are required to connect randomly placed numbers in sequence (1-25 for TMA) or to sequentially connect both numbers and letters while alternating back and forth (1-A-2-B-3-C-4-D etc. for TMB). Scores are the time in seconds required to complete the tasks.</description>

          <title>Verbal Memory Domain Z-Score</title>
          <description>This is the average of z-scores of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised, Learning and Delayed Recall Tests adjusted for age and education. The recognition test list comprises 24 words, consisting of 12 words from the original list and 12 &quot;distracters&quot;. The subject must answer &quot;yes&quot; if the word was from the list and &quot;no&quot; otherwise. Twenty minutes after the third list from verbal learning and immediate recall, delayed recall is assessed by asking the subject to recall as many words as possible from the list. The score is the number of words that are correctly recalled from the original list.</description>

          <description>This is the average age and education adjusted z-scores of Stroop Color Interference Test (CTP) and interference task (STP). The Stroop Task is a measure of divided attentional abilities. Performance is measured by the amount of time required to read each of three cards: (1) blocks of colors, (2) names of colors, and (3) colored words. For each task, the time (in seconds) is the score that should be recorded on the form. A task that cannot be completed in 240 seconds is scored as incomplete.</description>

          <description>The baseline CNS penetration score is calculated based on the revised CNS penetration-effectiveness ranks (provided by Dr. Scott Letendre). The score is simply a sum of the ranks of all drugs which participants took at baseline. The better the drug penetrates, the higher the score. The range of ranks are 1 to 4, so the CNS penetration score is integer numbers greater than 1.</description>

This variable has three levels using the TaqMan assay in CSF: (1) HIV CSF RNA VLs ≥30 copies/mL (detectable), &lt;30 copies/mL (Undetectable), or no lumbar punctures (LPs). The assessment was conducted BEFORE the baseline in order to use this information for randomization.</description>

          <description>The 2nd stratification factor is progressive neurocognitive decline defined by objective or subjective criteria at pre-baseline. A decline of at least 1.0 standard deviation below age-matched and education-matched controls on two or more independent tests or 2.0 standard deviations below age-matched and education-matched controls on one test within 1 year before entry is defined as objective decline. Otherwise, subjective neurocognitive decline is defined by the participant or family member or caregiver AND a Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression score &lt;16 within 45 days before entry.</description>

Planning Social Activities; 6.Understanding Reading Materials/TV; 7.Transportation; 8.Using the Telephone; 9.Home Repairs; 10.Bathing; 11.Dressing; 12.Shopping; 13.Laundry; 14.Taking/Keeping Track of Medication; 15.Child Care; 16.Work. For each task, if the score at the time of evaluation is worse than the best in the past, an indicator of 1 is given; otherwise 0. The IADL score is a sum of 16 indicators divided by 16. The lower score indicates better. The range is from 0 to 1.</description>

        <title>Changes in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) questionnaire is designed to learn more about how subjects are able to perform common tasks. There are 16 common tasks. For each task, if the score at the time of evaluation is worse than the best in the past, an indicator of 1 is given. Otherwise, the indicator is 0. The overall IADL score is a sum of 16 indicators divided by 16; therefore, the range is between 0 and 1 and the lower score is better. The 24-week change of IADL score was changed into a categorical variable (no change/worse vs. better) at week 24 compare to baseline.</description>

          <title>Changes in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire</title>
          <description>The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) questionnaire is designed to learn more about how subjects are able to perform common tasks. There are 16 common tasks. For each task, if the score at the time of evaluation is worse than the best in the past, an indicator of 1 is given. Otherwise, the indicator is 0. The overall IADL score is a sum of 16 indicators divided by 16; therefore, the range is between 0 and 1 and the lower score is better. The 24-week change of IADL score was changed into a categorical variable (no change/worse vs. better) at week 24 compare to baseline.</description>
