  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study using a combination of external beam radiation with intratumoral
      injection of dendritic cells (white blood cells) as neo-adjuvant treatment for patients with
      high-risk soft tissue sarcoma. The purpose was to determine if an injection of the patient's
      own immune related white blood cells into their tumor would strengthen the immune system to
      fight against their cancer.

    <textblock>
      Patients were treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) combined with experimental
      intratumoral injection of dendritic cell (DC). Patients received 5,040 centigray (cGy) EBRT
      in 28 equal fractions. Radiation was delivered 5 days per week (Monday-Friday). DCs (10^7
      cells) were injected intratumorally three times on the second, third, and fourth Friday
      during the course of radiation. One additional DC injection was given several days before
      surgery to assess DC migration. Tumors were surgically resected 3-6 weeks after the
      completion of EBRT.

    <description>Immune responses in patients treated with EBRT and DCs: Transient immune response = response detected at only one time point; Robust immune response = response detected at least at two time points. An individual patient was considered a responder to tumor cell lysates (TCL) or survivin if at any time point the response in the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay was higher than 30 spots per 2 X 10^5 cells and in the proliferation assay higher than 3,000 counts per minute (CPM) and the response in IFN-γ ELISPOT or proliferation assays to TCL or Ad-surv was more than 2 standard deviations (SD) higher than the response to the corresponding control lysate or Ad-c at the same time point and 2 SD higher than the response to the same stimuli before start of the treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Increase in Level of Radioactivity at Excision Per Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To identify the nodes to be excised, an injection with Indium 111 (radio active dye) labeled dendritic cells (of vaccine #4) was performed 1 to 3 days prior to surgery. Patients were evenly divided to be assigned to one of three cohorts: Cohort 1, 1 day before surgery; Cohort 2, 2 days before surgery; Cohort 3, 3 days before surgery. Vaccine #4 was labeled in order to evaluate how long dendritic cells need to travel to regional draining lymphatics. Tumor resection was not delayed by this.</description>

        <description>To identify the nodes to be excised, an injection with Indium 111 (radio active dye) labeled dendritic cells (of vaccine #4) was performed 1 to 3 days prior to surgery. Patients were evenly divided to be assigned to one of three cohorts: Cohort 1, 1 day before surgery; Cohort 2, 2 days before surgery; Cohort 3, 3 days before surgery. Vaccine #4 was labeled in order to evaluate how long dendritic cells need to travel to regional draining lymphatics. Tumor resection was not delayed by this.</description>

          <title>EBRT + DC Injection + Resection</title>
          <description>Single Arm: EBRT + DC Injection + Resection. Prior to the fourth DC Injection, participants were assigned to 3 cohorts for that injection only.
Dendritic Cell (DC) Injections: DCs (10^7 cells) were injected intratumorally three times on the second, third, and fourth Friday during the course of radiation. One additional DC injection was given before surgery to assess DC migration. Patients were assigned to one of three cohorts: Group 1 - DC injection # 4 given 24 hours prior to surgery, Group 2 - DC injection # 4 given 48 hours prior to surgery, Group 3 - DC injection # 4 given 72 hours prior to surgery.
Radiation was delivered 5 days per week (Monday-Friday).
Complete Resection - Surgery for tumor removal: Tumors were surgically resected 3-6 weeks after the completion of EBRT.</description>
