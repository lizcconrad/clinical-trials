      Prospective controlled randomized study. Aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and
      sensitivity of CT scanning of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis for the detection of occult
      cancer in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism. Patients presenting with acute
      idiopathic venous thromboembolism, free from already known cancer and in whom a routine
      battery screening has excluded the presence of cancer, are randomized to receive either a CT
      scanning of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis (completed by mammography if not already performed
      in the past year, and by gastroscopy and/or colonoscopy in patients with positive hemoccult)
      or a diagnostic programme freely decided by attending physicians. Patients of either group in
      whom the search for cancer is negative are followed-up for two years to register the
      development of clinically symptomatic malignant disease. The rate of cancer detection and
      that of cancer development are compared between the two study groups.
