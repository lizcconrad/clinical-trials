  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to test the hypothesis that direct injection of bone-marrow cells in
      the heart may increase the number of blood vessels, ameliorating the heart's performance, and
      relieving patients from symptoms like angina and/or shortness of breath.

      Severe ischemic heart disease (IHD) remains a clinical challenge; many patients with IHD have
      undergone myocardial revascularization procedures (either percutaneous or surgical) but still
      remain symptomatic despite maximally tolerated medical therapy. Others are considered
      non-optimal candidates for a complete myocardial revascularization procedure due to the
      extension and diffuseness of the disease.

      Cell therapy with autologous bone marrow-derived cells (BMC) is a novel therapeutic strategy
      being tested for many cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, acute myocardial
      infarction, chronic ischemic heart disease.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of intramyocardial injection of
      autologous BMC on the myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function as an adjunctive
      therapy (compared to placebo) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the effect of intramyocardial injection of
      autologous BMC on functional class (angina/heart failure), functional capacity, global and
      cardiovascular mortality, and quality of life in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
      surgery (CABG).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of chronic, severe, diffuse, multivessel atherosclerotic coronary artery
             disease (CAD) referred for CABG.

          -  Echocardiogram-assessed LVEF between 25 and 55% (Simpson's rule).

          -  Angina (or equivalent) functional class II to IV (Canadian Cardiovascular Society)
             despite maximally tolerated medical therapy.

          -  Abnormal myocardial perfusion tests:

             i. Cardiac scintigraphy ii. Magnetic resonance imaging iii. Dobutamine-atropine
             stress-echocardiogram

          -  Non-candidates for a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to ANY of the
             following:

             i. High risk lesion ii. Extensive lesion iii. Diffuse, small vessel disease

          -  Non-candidates for a complete CABG, or candidates for a complete CABG in whom,
             according to an expert panel, there is a high probability of failure of the grafts due
             to the extension and severity of the disease, with diffuse, small vessel involvement.

          -  To provide a signed, written informed consent, according to the National Guidelines
             for Clinical Trials.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe valve heart disease requiring surgical repair.

          -  Serologic diagnostic of Chagas' disease.

          -  Symptoms of heart failure, even from an ischemic etiology, in the absence of
             objectively documented myocardial ischemia.

          -  Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (like VT), unless an ICD have been placed.

          -  Any acute coronary syndrome in the past 3 months.

          -  End-stage renal disease requiring maintenance dialysis.

          -  History of neoplasia.

          -  Drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Life expectancy below 2 years.

          -  Enrollment in any cell therapy trial in the past 2 years.
