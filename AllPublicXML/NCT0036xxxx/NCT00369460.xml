      RATIONALE: Measuring changes in muscle tissue in patients with cancer may help doctors
      predict how well patients will respond to treatment, and may help the study of cancer in the
      future.

      PURPOSE: This pilot study is evaluating changes in muscle tissue in patients with pancreatic
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Demonstrate a decrease/increase of fat-free mass (FFM) by 10% from baseline, based on
           tumor progression/regression, within each patient with inoperable locally advanced or
           metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.

        -  Determine the correlation between changes in FFM and 6-month survival.

        -  Confirm the frequency of lymphocytopenia in patients with inoperable locally advanced or
           metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.

        -  Demonstrate an interaction between pretreatment total lymphocyte count, treatment
           response, and 6-month survival in patients with inoperable locally advanced or
           metastatic pancreatic carcinoma.

        -  Collect adjuvant information, such as weight, body mass index, age, ECOG performance
           status, gait speed, concomitant medications, CA19-9, and total lymphocyte count, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients will have weight, body mass index, age, ECOG performance status, gait speed,
      concomitant medications, CA19-9, and total lymphocyte count measured before start of cancer
      treatment of the patient's choosing.

      Patients will be re-assessed at approximately 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, and with any
      change in tumor burden.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17 patients will be accrued for this study.
