  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herpes infection is an important co-factor in HIV transmission. A recent meta-analysis
      demonstrated that HSV infection contributed to a 2-fold increased risk of HIV transmission.
      Suppressive therapy with acyclovir has been a method proposed to reduce HIV transmission. We
      are conducting a randomized controlled cross-over trial to evaluate the effect of acyclovir
      suppressive therapy on HIV genital shedding in women co-infected with HIV-1 and Herpes
      Simplex Virus Type-2 (HSV-2) in Thailand.

      65 women ages 18-49 years old with HIV-1 and HSV-2 co-infection are being recruited from
      general medicine clinics, family planning clinics, postnatal clinics, community based
      organizations and community outreach in Chiang Rai, Thailand.

      Our study objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of acyclovir suppressive therapy on HIV genital shedding.

        -  To determine the association between HIV and HSV genital shedding, and the effect of
           acyclovir suppressive therapy on this association.

        -  To determine the acceptability of acyclovir suppressive therapy for women with HIV
           infection.

        -  To evaluate the association of genital symptoms and HIV or HSV genital shedding.

        -  To evaluate the association between cervicovaginal (CVL) specimens and self-collected
           genital swabs for detection of HIV and HSV-2.
