  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study designed to evaluate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose
      of tesmilifene and a standard regimen of docetaxel alters the plasma pharmacokinetics of
      docetaxel. This study will also assess the safety and efficacy of the tesmilifene/docetaxel
      combination in metastatic breast cancer patients.

      Primary Objective:

      1. To evaluate whether the co-administration of a fixed dose of tesmilifene (5.3 mg/kg) with
      a standard dose of docetaxel (100 mg/m2) alters the plasma pharmacokinetics of docetaxel
      compared to the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel when given alone.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To correlate plasma tesmilifene levels during and following the infusion with the acute
           tesmilifene-related adverse events observed during and after the infusion.

        2. To collect safety information for tesmilifene when administered in combination with
           docetaxel.

        3. To evaluate response rate, duration of response and overall survival in metastatic
           breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel plus tesmilifene.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with documented histological/cytological proof of metastatic and/or recurrent
             breast cancer suitable for treatment with docetaxel

          2. Patients must have documented hormone receptor status (ER/PR) and Her-2 neu status
             determined either by Immunohistochemistry or FISH, within 21 days of randomisation, if
             possible, otherwise receptor status from patient history can be used, if determined
             from earlier biopsy/surgery. Patients may be randomised whilst results of hormone
             receptor status (ER/PR) and Her-2 neu status are pending from the laboratory.

          3. Radiological investigations must be conducted within 21 days prior to randomization.
             Exceptions will be made only for patients who have had NEGATIVE examinations with 35
             days prior to randomisation.

          4. Presence of at least one uni-dimensional measurable lesion. 5. Disease free interval
             (DFI) less than or equal to 24 months (from the time of initial surgery to
             randomization date).

        6. Previous hormone therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy allowed as defined in the
        protocol 7. Patients with an ECOG status of 0, 1 or 2. 8. Have a life expectancy of at
        least 6 months 9. Patients must be female and aged ≥ 18 years and ≤ 65 years 10. Patients
        must be willing and able to follow instructions and make all required study visits.

        11. Patients must be willing and able to give written consent to participate in this study.

        12. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined in the protocol.

        13. All women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
        pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L of BHCG) within 72 hours prior to
        randomization.

        14. Patients must have a negative blood tests for HIV and Hepatitis B and C within 4 weeks
        prior to randomisation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with previous malignancies, excluding curatively treated basal or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin or in-situ cervical cancer or any other cancer treated more
             than five years prior to study entry and presumed cured.

          2. Patients with known brain or meningeal metastases (CT scan not required to rule this
             out unless there is a clinical suspicion of CNS disease).

          3. Patients whose only measurable disease is in the bone.

          4. Patients using chemotherapeutic agents for any malignancy within 4 weeks prior to
             study entry or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

             preceding 4 weeks.

          6. Patient who have received hormone treatment for cancer within 6 weeks or 5 half-lives
             of enrolment (whichever is shorter).

          8. Patients with history of seizure disorder.

          9. Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, endocrine,
             hepatic, respiratory, neurologic, psychiatric, immunologic, gastrointestinal,
             haematologic, metabolic or any other condition or laboratory abnormality that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator or Medical Director of YM BioSciences Inc., makes the
             patient unsuitable for participation in the study.

             appendix V, i.e.; avoid from midnight before treatment until midnight post treatment.
             Patients who are required to take low dose aspirin (81 mg) may be allowed to continue
             taking low dose aspirin.

         12. Patients on H1 antagonists (e.g., antihistamines, antidepressants or antiemetics)
             detailed in appendix V who can not comply with guidelines or concomitant therapy as
             outlined in appendix V, i.e.; avoid from 12 hours before the start of protocol
