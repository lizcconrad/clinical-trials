All participants will take one tablet of TRUVADA® (200 mg of emtricitabine and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with food, daily with the morning dose of MK-0518. Dosing interval adjustment of TRUVADA® is recommended in all participants with creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min.</description>

        <description>A laboratory AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product.
Serious AEs are any AEs occurring at any dose that: results in death; or is life threatening; or results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or is a cancer; or is an overdose.
Adverse experiences (AEs) in this study were defined as &quot;drug-related&quot; if the investigator, who is a qualified physician, considered the AE as possibly, probably, or definitely related to MK-0518 or efavirenz alone or in combination with TRUVADA® or to TRUVADA® alone according to his/her best clinical judgment.</description>

        <description>Serious CAEs are any AEs occurring at any dose that: results in death; or is life threatening; or results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or is a cancer; or is an overdose.
Adverse experiences (AEs) in this study were defined as &quot;drug-related&quot; if the investigator, who is a qualified physician, considered the AE as possibly, probably, or definitely related to MK-0518 or efavirenz alone or in combination with TRUVADA® or to TRUVADA® alone according to his/her best clinical judgment.</description>

        <description>Serious CAEs are any AEs occurring at any dose that: results in death; or is life threatening; or results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or is a cancer; or is an overdose.
Adverse experiences (AEs) in this study were defined as &quot;drug-related&quot; if the investigator, who is a qualified physician, considered the AE as possibly, probably, or definitely related to MK-0518 or efavirenz alone or in combination with TRUVADA® or to TRUVADA® alone according to his/her best clinical judgment.</description>

        <description>A laboratory AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product.
Serious AEs are any AEs occurring at any dose that: results in death; or is life threatening; or results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or is a cancer; or is an overdose.
Adverse experiences (AEs) in this study were defined as &quot;drug-related&quot; if the investigator, who is a qualified physician, considered the AE as possibly, probably, or definitely related to MK-0518 or efavirenz alone or in combination with TRUVADA® or to TRUVADA® alone according to his/her best clinical judgment.</description>
