  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of response with the combination of
      erlotinib and bevacizumab in previously treated patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma,
      and to determine potential molecular markers that may predict response to therapy in patients
      with thymoma or thymic carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      We believe that both the EGFR pathway, as well as tumor angiogenesis play an important role
      in the pathogenesis of thymic neoplasms. Our previous experience with the EGFR inhibitor
      gefitinib showed a promising, though limited activity in this disease. We hypothesize that
      combining the novel EGFR inhibitor erlotinib with bevacizumab will have a synergistic effect
      on this tumor. We have selected the 15mg/kg q21 days of bevacizumab based on the data
      published by Johnson DH et al, in which 99 patients were randomly assigned to bevacizumab 7.5
      (n = 32) or 15 mg/kg (n = 35) plus carboplatin (area under the curve = 6) and paclitaxel (200
      mg/m2) every 3 weeks or carboplatin and paclitaxel alone (n = 32). The highest response noted
      in the high-dose group (31.5%) and 28.1% in the lower dose bevacizumab arm. There was also a
      trend to improved TTP and OS in the high dose arm, although the study lacked sufficient power
      to make any definitive conclusions regarding a possible relationship between dose and
      treatment effect. (105) The safety and efficacy of this dose and schedule was confirmed by
      E4599 (43). Herbst et al have confirmed the safety of the combination of erlotinib 150 mg/day
      orally plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg in a published phase I/II trial (74)

      This regimen has the potential to provide a new, effective therapy for this malignancy, as
      well as teaching us important lessons about the biology of the disease. To this end, we would
      also measure surrogate markers of angiogenesis, such as tumor VEGF expression, serum VCAM-1
      and bFGF, as well as urine VEGF. We would also determine tumor expression of phosphorylated
      EGFR, and analyze the effect of known variant polymorphisms in the VEGF gene on outcomes. We
      will test tumor samples for expression of EGFR by IHC and FISH to correlate to response.

             not amenable to potentially curative therapy by surgery in the opinion of the
             investigator. Original biopsy of tumor is sufficient for diagnoses unless otherwise
             clinically indicated.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST. Note: Any scans or x-rays used to
             document measurable disease must be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.
