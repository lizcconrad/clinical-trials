      The purpose of this study is to determine if Rizatriptan, a migraine medication, lowers
      motion sickness in migraine sufferers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine sufferers undergo vestibular tests and were excluded if there were clinically
      significant abnormalities. Following screening, there were 2 experimental visits in which
      migraine sufferers were pre-treated with either Rizatriptan or placebo. After taking the
      drug, subjects were idle for 2 hours. Baseline motion sickness and subjective units of
      distress levels were assessed prior to undergoing sinusoidal-earth-vertical earth axis
      rotation in darkness at 0.05 Hz. Scores were taken immediately after stopping. Subjects were
      given a 2 minutes rest and then underwent a motion sickness provoking rotation. Subjective
      scores were assessed immediately following. Another two minute rest was given and if the
      subject was able, underwent a second motion sickness provoking stimulus followed by an
      assessment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Motion Sickness to Post Vestibular Stimulus</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and Post Stimulus (about 6 minutes apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Scores are based on a scale developed by Graybiel which rates seven subjective and objective signs of motion sickness. The total scores ranged from from 0 to 25. Zero indicating no motion sickness. Greater than 16 indicates severe motion sickness. Trials were stopped if scores were 16 or greater. Scores were taken before and after each rotation.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre and Post Stimulus (6 minutes apart)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective report of distress ranging from 0 to 10 based on the method of Wolpe. Zero indicates no distress and 10 indicates severe distress. Measures used in this analysis match the times used in the analysis for Outcome 1.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Motion Sickness to Post Vestibular Stimulus</title>
        <description>Scores are based on a scale developed by Graybiel which rates seven subjective and objective signs of motion sickness. The total scores ranged from from 0 to 25. Zero indicating no motion sickness. Greater than 16 indicates severe motion sickness. Trials were stopped if scores were 16 or greater. Scores were taken before and after each rotation.</description>
        <time_frame>Pre and Post Stimulus (about 6 minutes apart)</time_frame>
        <population>Ten of the 25 subjects who completed both experimental visits developed negligible motion sickness induced by the stimulus following pre-medication with placebo. These data were not analyzed. It was posited that the presence/absence of vertigo would not impact the analysis of this outcome. The groups were combined for the analysis.</population>
