      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving capecitabine after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.
      Sometimes, after surgery, the tumor may not need more treatment until it progresses. In this
      case, observation may be sufficient. It is not yet known whether capecitabine is more
      effective than observation in treating biliary tract cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying capecitabine to see how well it works
      compared with observation in treating patients with biliary tract cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine has any effect on 2-year
           survival compared to expectant treatment alone (observation) in patients who have
           undergone a macroscopically complete surgical resection of a biliary tract cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To compare capecitabine versus observation in terms of 5-year survival, relapse-free
           survival, toxicity, quality of life, and health economics.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study. Patients are stratified
      according to surgical center, disease site (hilar/extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma vs gallbladder vs intrapancreatic/common bile duct), type of
      resection (R0 vs R1), and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice a day on days 1-14. Treatment repeats
           every 3 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo expectant treatment (observation). Quality of life is assessed
           at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      All patients are followed for up to 5 years post-randomization.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients will be accrued for this study.
