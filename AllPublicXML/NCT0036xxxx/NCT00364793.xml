Terminal elimination plasma half-life=ln2 divided by K where K is the absolute value of the slope of the terminal phase of the plasma profile as determined by log-linear regression of at least three data points. T-HALF was measured in hours (h).</description>

    <description>HIV RNA measured as log10 copies per milliliter (c/mL) plasma. HIV RNA values ≥ 1,000 c/mL were considered evidence of infection. A decrease in number of c/mL is an improvement for the participant. HIV RNA was first measured using the ultrasensitive and standard Roche Amplicor PCR, version 1.5, and then the method of measurement was switched to the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV IVD method. The Baseline visit was within 50 days after the screening visit and was prior to start of study medication (Week 1).</description>

    <description>A CD4 cell is an antigenic marker of helper/inducer T cells. These cells were counted during the hematology cell counts performed during a Complete Blood Cell count (CBC) performed by the Central Laboratory. CD4 are measured as number of cells per millimeters to the third power (cells/mm^3). An increase from baseline in the number of CD4 cells is an improvement. The Baseline visit was within 50 days after the screening visit and was prior to start of study medication (Week 1).</description>

        <description>Cmax and Cmin were derived from plasma concentrations versus time using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for EFV was 10.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) was 8,000 ng/mL. Cmax and Cmin were recorded directly from experimental observations. Blood samples were collected before study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after study drug administration from an indwelling catheter or by direct venipuncture and the pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized using geometric means. Cmax and Cmin were measured in ng/mL.</description>

        <description>Algorithms: Confirmed Virologic Response (CVR) non-completer = failure (NC = F): participants were responders if they achieved confirmed HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL at Week 48; participants were failures if virologic rebound occurred at or before Week 48; therapy discontinued before Week 48; no response by Week 48, or missing HIV RNA at Week 48 and beyond. Virologic Response - Observed Cases (VR-OC): participants were responders according to a single on-treatment HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL closest to the planned Week 48 visit and within the predefined Week 48 visit window; those on treatment and missing their Week 48 measurement were responders only if previous and subsequent measurements to the Week 48 visit window were &lt; 400 c/mL; denominator was all who remained on treatment through Week 48. Snapshot: participants were responders according to the last on-treatment HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL in the predefined Week 48 visit window; denominator was all treated participants.</description>

          <title>The Number of Participants With Plasma HIV RNA &lt; 400 Copies Per Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 48 as Analyzed by Different Algorithms - All Treated Participants</title>
          <description>Algorithms: Confirmed Virologic Response (CVR) non-completer = failure (NC = F): participants were responders if they achieved confirmed HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL at Week 48; participants were failures if virologic rebound occurred at or before Week 48; therapy discontinued before Week 48; no response by Week 48, or missing HIV RNA at Week 48 and beyond. Virologic Response - Observed Cases (VR-OC): participants were responders according to a single on-treatment HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL closest to the planned Week 48 visit and within the predefined Week 48 visit window; those on treatment and missing their Week 48 measurement were responders only if previous and subsequent measurements to the Week 48 visit window were &lt; 400 c/mL; denominator was all who remained on treatment through Week 48. Snapshot: participants were responders according to the last on-treatment HIV RNA &lt; 400 c/mL in the predefined Week 48 visit window; denominator was all treated participants.</description>

        <title>The Number of Participants With Plasma HIV RNA Levels &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 24 as Analyzed by Different Algorithms - All Treated Participants</title>
        <description>Algorithms: Confirmed Virologic Response (CVR) non-completer = failure (NC = F): participants were responders if they achieved confirmed HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/mL at Week 24; participants were failures if virologic rebound occurred at or before Week 24; therapy discontinued before Week 24; no response by Week 24, or missing HIV RNA at Week 24 and beyond. Virologic Response - Observed Cases (VR-OC): participants were responders according to a single on-treatment HIV RNA &lt; 50 c/mL closest to the planned Week 24 visit and within the predefined Week 24 visit window; those on treatment and missing their Week 24 measurement were responders only if previous and subsequent measurements to the Week 24 visit window were &lt; 50 c/mL; denominator was all who remained on treatment through Week 24.</description>

        <description>HIV RNA measured as log10 copies per milliliter (c/mL) plasma. HIV RNA values ≥ 1,000 c/mL were considered evidence of infection. A decrease in number of c/mL is an improvement for the participant. HIV RNA was first measured using the ultrasensitive and standard Roche Amplicor PCR, version 1.5, and then the method of measurement was switched to the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV IVD method. The Baseline visit was within 50 days after the screening visit and was prior to start of study medication (Week 1).</description>

        <title>CD4 Cell Count Change From Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 - Treated Participants</title>
        <description>A CD4 cell is an antigenic marker of helper/inducer T cells. These cells were counted during the hematology cell counts performed during a Complete Blood Cell count (CBC) performed by the Central Laboratory. CD4 are measured as number of cells per millimeters to the third power (cells/mm^3). An increase from baseline in the number of CD4 cells is an improvement. The Baseline visit was within 50 days after the screening visit and was prior to start of study medication (Week 1).</description>

          <title>Percent of CD4 Cells Change From Baseline at Weeks 24 and 48 - Treated Participants</title>
          <description>A CD4 cell is an antigenic marker of helper/inducer T cells. These cells were counted during the hematology cell counts performed during a Complete Blood Cell count (CBC) performed by the Central Laboratory. CD4 are measured as number of cells per millimeter to the third power (cells/mm^3). Percent of CD4 cells is the number of CD4 cells per total number of cells measured*100. An increase in the percent of CD4 cells is an improvement. The Baseline visit was within 50 days after the screening visit and was prior to start of study medication (Week 1).</description>
          <population>Treated participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug (EFV) and had an available baseline measurement were analyzed. n=number of participants with available data at both baseline and each specific week.</population>

          <title>Apparent Oral Clearance Adjusted for Body Weight (CLT/F/kg) of EFV at Week 2 - Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Population</title>
          <description>Plasma concentrations of EFV were determined using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS). The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for EFV was 10.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) was 8,000 ng/mL. CLT/F/kg was calculated by dividing CLT/F by body weight in kilograms (kg). Blood samples were collected before study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after study drug administration from an indwelling catheter or by direct venipuncture and the pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized using geometric means. CLT/F/kg was measured in liters per hour per kilogram (L/h/kg).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Acquisition of Resistance to EFV Categorized by AUC Relationship - Evaluable Pharmacokinetic Population</title>
        <description>PK parameters were evaluated 2 weeks post start of dosing. Based on observed AUC, measured in micromoles (μM)*h, dosing was increased, remained the same, or decreased at next visit to achieve the desired AUC (110-380 μM*h). Number of participants who became resistant was categorized by those who required additional dosing after Week 2 (AUC&lt;110 μM*h) and those who did not. AUC: derived from plasma concentration of EFV versus time. Plasma concentrations for determination of AUC were obtained using a validated LC-MS/MS method. LLOQ for EFV = 10.0 ng/mL and ULOQ = 8,000 ng/mL. AUC calculated by log- and linear trapezoidal summations. Genotypic resistance=presence of substitutions in the RT gene and/or presence of mutations that confer resistance to entire nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class. Phenotypic resistance=EFV: &gt; 3.3* IC50 of control strain. Assays: Monogram Biosciences Phenosense™ GT (EFV biologic cutoff=3) and VircoTYPE™ HIV-1 v 4.3.01( EFV biologic cutoff=3.3).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Acquisition of Resistance to EFV Categorized by AUC Relationship - Evaluable Pharmacokinetic Population</title>
          <description>PK parameters were evaluated 2 weeks post start of dosing. Based on observed AUC, measured in micromoles (μM)*h, dosing was increased, remained the same, or decreased at next visit to achieve the desired AUC (110-380 μM*h). Number of participants who became resistant was categorized by those who required additional dosing after Week 2 (AUC&lt;110 μM*h) and those who did not. AUC: derived from plasma concentration of EFV versus time. Plasma concentrations for determination of AUC were obtained using a validated LC-MS/MS method. LLOQ for EFV = 10.0 ng/mL and ULOQ = 8,000 ng/mL. AUC calculated by log- and linear trapezoidal summations. Genotypic resistance=presence of substitutions in the RT gene and/or presence of mutations that confer resistance to entire nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor class. Phenotypic resistance=EFV: &gt; 3.3* IC50 of control strain. Assays: Monogram Biosciences Phenosense™ GT (EFV biologic cutoff=3) and VircoTYPE™ HIV-1 v 4.3.01( EFV biologic cutoff=3.3).</description>

        <title>CLT/F of Didanosine (ddI) at Week 2 - Pharmacokinetic Evaluable Population</title>
        <description>Plasma concentrations for ddI were determined using a validated LC/MS/MS assay. The LLOQ for ddI was 2.50 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). CLT/F was calculated by dividing the dose of ddI by AUC(TAU) of ddI. Blood samples were collected before study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after study drug administration from an indwelling catheter or by direct venipuncture and the pharmacokinetic parameters were summarized using geometric means. CLT/F was measured in liters per hour (L/h).</description>

        <title>Log10 c/mL HIV RNA Changes From Baseline at Weeks 60, 72, 84 and 96 - Treated Participants</title>
        <description>HIV RNA measured as log10 copies per milliliter (c/mL) plasma. HIV RNA values ≥ 1,000 c/mL were considered evidence of infection. A decrease in number of c/mL is an improvement for the participant. HIV RNA was first measured using the ultrasensitive and standard Roche Amplicor PCR, version 1.5, and then the method of measurement was switched to the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV IVD method. The Baseline visit was within 50 days after the screening visit and was prior to start of study medication (Week 1).</description>

          <title>Log10 c/mL HIV RNA Changes From Baseline at Weeks 60, 72, 84 and 96 - Treated Participants</title>
          <description>HIV RNA measured as log10 copies per milliliter (c/mL) plasma. HIV RNA values ≥ 1,000 c/mL were considered evidence of infection. A decrease in number of c/mL is an improvement for the participant. HIV RNA was first measured using the ultrasensitive and standard Roche Amplicor PCR, version 1.5, and then the method of measurement was switched to the COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HIV IVD method. The Baseline visit was within 50 days after the screening visit and was prior to start of study medication (Week 1).</description>

        <title>CD4 Cell Count Change From Baseline at Weeks 60, 72, 84, and 96 - Treated Participants</title>
        <description>A CD4 cell is an antigenic marker of helper/inducer T cells. These cells were counted during the hematology cell counts performed during a Complete Blood Cell count (CBC) performed by the Central Laboratory. CD4 are measured as number of cells per millimeters to the third power (cells/mm^3). An increase from baseline in the number of CD4 cells is an improvement. The Baseline visit was within 50 days after the screening visit and was prior to start of study medication (Week 1).</description>

        <title>Percent of CD4 Cells Change From Baseline at Weeks 60, 72, 84, and 96 - Treated Participants</title>
        <description>A CD4 cell is an antigenic marker of helper/inducer T cells. These cells were counted during the hematology cell counts performed during a Complete Blood Cell count (CBC) performed by the Central Laboratory. CD4 are measured as number of cells per millimeter to the third power (cells/mm^3). Percent of CD4 cells is the number of CD4 cells per total number of cells measured*100. An increase in the percent of CD4 cells is an improvement. The Baseline visit was within 50 days after the screening visit and was prior to start of study medication (Week 1).</description>
