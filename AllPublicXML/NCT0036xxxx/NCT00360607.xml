  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-abdominal infections are often polymicrobial, and include aerobic as well as anaerobic
      bacteria. Antibiotics used in intra-abdominal infections should aim to cover organisms such
      as Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides fragilis, which are the commonest organisms known to
      cause such infections. Combinations of a third-generation cephalosporin, an aminoglycoside
      and metronidazole are often used to treat such infections in surgical settings. An
      alternative to such combinations is the use of a beta lactam - beta lactamase inhibitor
      combination. Magnex (cefoperazone- sulbactam) is one such combination, which has been shown
      to be as effective as a standard multidrug regimen such as gentamicin and clindamycin in the
      management of intra-abdominal infections. The combination of ceftazidime, amikacin and
      metronidazole has been chosen as a comparator regimen because of its broad coverage of
      Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms found in such conditions.
