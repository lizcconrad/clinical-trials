  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New stroke therapies are needed. This study seeks to provide the preliminary data needed to
      plan a future study that will evaluate the efficacy of using continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) to treat stroke patients who have sleep apnea. Our goal is to use this
      therapy to reduce stroke symptom severity.

      BACKGROUND Sleep apnea occurs in 60-96% of stroke survivors and is associated with poor
      functional recovery and higher post-stroke mortality. Among patients without stroke,
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a safe and effective treatment for sleep apnea.
      This feasibility pilot study is a step in planning a future efficacy trial of CPAP for
      patients with acute ischemic stroke.

      OBJECTIVES The primary objectives are, among acute ischemic stroke patients, to: (1)
      determine the feasibility of performing polysomnography; (2) refine the process for providing
      CPAP within 48-hours of stroke onset; and (3) determine the effect of CPAP on blood pressure.

      METHODS This randomized controlled feasibility study will enroll 100 acute ischemic stroke
      patients. Intervention patients (N=60) receive CPAP within 48 hours of stroke onset and
      continuing for up to 30 days. At 30 days post-enrollment, the intervention patients undergo
      unattended polysomnography. Control (N=40) patients receive unattended polysomnography at
      baseline and after 30 days.

      SIGNIFICANCE CPAP represents an important new potential therapy for acute stroke. CPAP may
      reduce both the neurological symptom severity of the acute stroke and prevent stroke
      recurrence.
