      The purpose of this retrospective study is to identify all neonates (newborns &lt; 30 days of
      age) from January 1, 2002 through June 20, 2006 at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta who have
      suffered neurological complications following cardiac surgery. This retrospective study is
      important to identify the incidence, care and follow-up of neurological complications at this
      institution

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that between one-quarter and one-half of infants undergoing cardiac
      surgery will suffer brain injury during surgery (the perioperative period). Some infants with
      congenital heart disease have neurological injury prior to cardiac surgery as a result of
      cyanosis, acidosis and abnormal circulation. The spectrum of neurological injury ranges from
      agitation and subtle disturbances in learning and new memory acquisition to visual and motor
      development abnormalities, seizures, stroke and encephalopathy.

      The patient will be identified from the cardiothoracic surgery database. Their hospital
      medical records and the neurological database will be reviewed for type of neurological
      complication (i.e. seizure, stroke), neuro-imaging and any mortality for these patients. We
      will review the patient outcome data that is available, after the initial surgery, through
      June 20, 2006. No patients will be contacted.

    <measure>The purpose of this study was to examine short term outcomes following cardiac surgery in premature neonates.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 years</time_frame>
    <description>In congenital cardiac defects where there was a choice of palliation vs complete anatomic repair, premature neonates underwent palliative procedures more frequently than term neonates. Premature neonates spent more days of mechanical ventilation compared to their term counterparts. Importantly, there was no difference in mortality between the two groups.</description>
