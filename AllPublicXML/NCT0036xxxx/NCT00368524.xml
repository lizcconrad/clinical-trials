  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial examined whether an abbreviated treatment using abstinence
      contingency management for housing and work/training (CM, n=103) with cocaine dependent,
      non-psychotic, dually diagnosed homeless persons, would show non-inferior outcomes compared
      to the full treatment (CM+, n=103). It was hypothesized that CM+ would show superior
      abstinence and retention outcomes, but that CM, with components derived from previously
      effective behavioral day treatment, would obtain non-inferior outcomes, defined as 75% or
      more of those observed for the full treatment (CM+) during active treatment months 1-6. The
      CM+ included all CM components but added behavioral day treatment that included voucher
      reinforcement of $7.50-15.00, for objective weekly therapeutic goal attainment in five
      domains of functioning: drug dependence, homelessness, unemployment, non-drug related
      recreational activities, and behavioral, health, or mental health problems. Abstinence was
      assessed by observed urine specimen collection and weekly testing weeks 1-52, and randomly,
      bi-monthly for months 13-18. Abstinence, homelessness, employment and other outcomes were
      also assessed at baseline, 2, 6, 12, and 18 months.
