  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common problem in childhood associated with vesico-renal
      reflux (VRR) in 25-40% of children. A persistent VRR and repeated pyelonephritis may
      predispose to renal scarring and chronic renal failure with an end-stage renal failure in up
      to 3% of children.Defining a standard behaviour facing VRR in children is not easy because of
      the lack of reliable evidence. Numbers of studies compare prospectively or retrospectively,
      medical, endoscopical and surgical treatment.Surgical techniques are effective but invasive
      and not free of complication. Medical treatment is submissive to a good observance. The
      introduction of endoscopic techniques permits to prevent UTI and new renal failure by VRR
      elimination. Since the beginning of the endoscopic treatment, several bulking agents have
      been proposed. The ideal agent should be easy to inject, stable in time and should be safe.
      Of course it should be at least as efficient as actual bulking agent. The use of Teflon was
      the first wave of success of endoscopic treatment. But sudden passion of Teflon has been
      darkened by the notion of migration. Since, others substances have been proposed, autologous
      or exogenous, resorbable or not. But none was ideal and no solutions were found facing
      problem of biocompatibility or long-term stability.Using adipose tissue as a bulking agent is
      ancient in plastic surgery and indications had known a leap forward in the last century with
      Coleman who introduced a new technique called &quot;lipostructure&quot;. This technique has known a
      growing interest in the restoration of all volume defects in plastic surgery because of the
      stability of the graft. We propose to apply this technique to VRR management in children in
      order to combine innocuousness and efficiency.
