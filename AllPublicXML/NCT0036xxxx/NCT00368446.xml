      Healthy volunteers and patients with diseases that involve problems clearing mucus from the
      lungs will be examined and tested to better understand the reasons for recurring lung
      infections in these patients and to try to develop better ways to diagnose and treat them.
      The study will also try to identify the genes responsible for these diseases.

      Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older and patients 2 years of age or older with
      suspected primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), variant cystic fibrosis (CF) or
      pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) may be eligible for this study. Patients enrolled in the
      Natural History Study of Nontuberculous Mycobacteria at NIH or other NIH natural history
      protocols may also be enrolled. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures
      during a 1-day visit at the NIH Clinical Center, as follows:

      All patients and normal volunteers have the following procedures:

        -  Physical examination and review of medical and genetic history and family genetic
           history.

        -  Lung function test and measurement of oxygen saturation level.

        -  Nitric oxide measurement to measure the amount of nitric oxide production in the nose: A
           small tube is placed in the nose while the subject breathes through the mouth into a
           cardboard tube.

      All patients have the following additional procedures:

        -  Blood tests for liver and kidney function, blood count, immunoglobulins and pregnancy
           test (where appropriate).

        -  Blood test or buccal scrape (brushing the inside of the cheek) to obtain DNA to look for
           gene mutations that cause PCD, CF or PHA.

        -  Scrape biopsy of cell lining the inside of the nose: A small toothpick-sized plastic
           stick with a tiny cup on the end is used to get nasal lining cells to look at the cilia
           (hair-like structures that move mucus).

        -  Semen analysis (in some men) to test sperm tail function or structure.

      Patients suspected of having a variant of CF or PHA, including nontuberculous mycobacterial
      lung disease, have the following additional procedures:

        -  Sweat chloride test: A medicine is placed on the arm to produce sweat; then, a very low
           level of electric current is applied for 5 to 12 minutes. Sweat is collected in a
           plastic tube and tested for salt content.

        -  Blood draw for CF genetic testing, if necessary, and to measure levels of the enzyme
           trypsin.

        -  Saliva collection to measure sodium and chloride content.

        -  Nasal potential difference to measure the electrical activity of the cells lining the
           inside of the nose: A soft plastic tube filled with a salt solution is passed into the
           nasal passage and a sterile needle is placed under the skin of the arm. This test
           provides information about how the lining of the nose is able to get used to changes in
           temperature and humidity. (Normal volunteers also have this test.)

      Background: Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental organisms that
      have been increasingly associated with human disease, commonly involving the lung. Post
      menopausal Caucasian women seem particularly predisposed to the development of peripheral
      nodules and dilated airways (bronchiectasis) associated with these organisms. These women
      have distinguishing body characteristics of being taller and thinner than age and gender
      matched controls yet have no identifiable systemic immune defects. There is, however,
      considerable overlap with genetic disorders of mucociliary clearance such as cystic fibrosis
      (CF) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The Genetic Diseases of Mucociliary Clearance
      Consortium (GDMCC) is one of 10 consortia in the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network
      formed under the Office of Rare Diseases in collaboration with NCRR, NICHD, NINDS, NIAMS,
      NIDDK, NHLBI in response to the Rare Diseases Act of 2002. The GDMCC is comprised of 5
      geographically-dispersed clinical research sites that are designed to study rare diseases
      which involve defects in clearance of mucus secretions from the airways (defective
      &quot;mucociliary clearance&quot;). These sites will collaborate in diagnostic, genetic, and other
      studies in patients with impairments of mucociliary clearance, including primary ciliary
      dyskinesia (PCD), variant cystic fibrosis (CF), and pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA). These
      studies are also applicable to diseases where altered airways clearance may play a primary or
      contributory role such as nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, chronic granulomatous
      disease, and the hyper-IgE syndromes. Disorders such as PCD, CF, and PHA reflect genetic
      defects in airway host-defense, and typically result in chronic infection of the airways.
      Patients with these disorders of the conducting airways and sinuses have delayed (or
      incorrect) diagnoses, because diagnostic tests are not readily available. These patients may
      also have sub-optimal management of their clinical disease, because the cause of these
      disorders is not well-defined, and treatment regimens are usually not driven by
      evidence-based medicine.

      Aims: The major aim of this study is to employ a systematic approach to the diagnostic and
      functional evaluation of these patients with chronic airways disease in individual patients,
      better define host susceptibility to infections from environmental organisms such as the
      nontuberculous mycobacteria, and potentially lead to the development of better diagnostic
      techniques, including genetic testing. In addition, we will compare/contrast clinical
      features (phenotype) across these disorders. A rigorous cross-sectional comparison of the
      clinical features will provide better understanding of the clinical disease of these
      disorders; in turn this will lead not only to a better standard of clinical care, but will
      also assist in the identification of novel therapeutic approaches.

      Methods: This is a cross-sectional diagnostic / mechanistic protocol to investigate airway
      host-defenses. The patient populations for these studies include individuals with recurring
      airway infections such as those with nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease who may have
      defective airway host defenses as a predisposing factor, individuals carrying a tentative
      diagnosis of the three known genetic disorders of mucociliary clearance (PCD, variant CF, or
      PHA), and individuals suspected to have one of these disorders but with inadequate or
      inconclusive diagnostic tests. Individuals in this latter category must have a preliminary
      clinical evaluation to evaluate for other more common disorders that may have similar
      manifestations including classical CF, immunodeficiency, asthma, and severe gastroesophageal
      reflux. The evaluation will include a detailed assessment of clinical features; specialized
      laboratory measurements such as nasal potential difference to evaluate the function of
      chloride and sodium channels associated with CF and PHA, nasal biopsy specimens and nasal
      nitric oxide measurements to assess cilia structure and function which are abnormal in PCD;
      and genetic studies to identify disease - causing mutations in genes associated with CF, PCD,
      and PHA.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Overview: Inclusion criteria reflect the two-fold purpose of this protocol. It is primarily
        intended to evaluate the cohort of patients followed at the NIH Clinical Center under
        Protocol 01-I-0202, Natural History, Genetics, Phenotype, and Treatment of Mycobacterial
        Infections, and in this regard, the inclusion criteria mirror those of that protocol.
        Secondly it is part of the multicenter collaborative protocol as a participating site in
        the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium, one of the Rare Disease Clinical
        Consortia sponsored by the Office of Rare Diseases. There is a clear-cut need for
        geographically dispersed centers to have expertise in the diagnostic evaluation and
        treatment of patients with rare diseases of the airways, including patients with suspected
        PCD, non-classical or variant CF, and PHA. The 5 sites will perform rigorous diagnostic
        evaluations utilizing innovative, but standardized methods (SOPs contained in Manual of
        Operations). As a participating site in the Consortium, we will cast a broad net to include
        as many participants as feasible. This will include a multi-center standardized diagnostic
        evaluation and clinical evaluation, giving us a better chance to define the clinical
        spectrum of disease.

        The criteria for participants to enter this study mandates that each patient either be
        enrolled in the 01-I-0202, Natural History, Genetics, Phenotype, and Treatment of
        Mycobacterial Infections or related NIH Natural History Protocol, or if referred as part of
        the Consortium, have received a standard (current clinical practice) diagnostic evaluation
        that includes testing for asthma, severe gastroesophageal reflux and/or classic CF, prior
        to enrolling in the Consortium study. Healthy adult control participants will be enrolled
        for comparison assessment of noninvasive nasal nitric oxide and nasal potential difference
        measurements only. The health status of these control participants will be assessed with
        the standardized clinical history, family history, physical exam including height and
        weight, vital signs, oximetry, and spirometry measurements.

        To enter the study, individuals with a suspected mucociliary clearance defect (n=100) must
        be age 2 years or older and meet one of the 4 following profiles:

          1. Have known or suspected nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease and enrolled in
             Protocol 01-I-0202, Natural History, Genetics, Phenotype, and Treatment of
             Mycobacterial Infections.

          2. Have high suspicion for the diagnosis of PCD, based on ciliary ultrastructural changes
             on EM (if performed elsewhere prior to referral) or clinical features (chronic
             sinopulmonary disease, chronic otitis media, history of neonatal respiratory distress
             or situs inversus), or PCD in a sibling and one of the clinical features of PCD.

          3. Have chronic sino-pulmonary disease with clinical features that overlap with variant
             CF and PCD, but with diagnostic tests to rule out classical CF (sweat Cl- testing and
             CF gene mutation screening). This may include patients with other known immune
             deficiencies such as chronic granulomatous disease followed on NIH natural history
             protocols.

          4. Known or suspected PHA (or variant PHA), which might include elevated (or borderline)
             sweat Cl- values.

        To enter the study as a healthy control (n=25), individuals must be age 18 or older and
        free of any known disease, chronic medical conditions, family history of cystic fibrosis or
        primary ciliary dyskinesia, or any cognitive impairment or significant disability that
        might preclude voluntary consent or the ability to safely comply with the instructions or
        sit through the testing.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Persons who cannot be evaluated at the Clinical Center or who have severe cognitive
        impairment or other severe disability that precludes the ability to understand instructions
        or sit/lie still for the evaluation will be excluded. Certain conditions may preclude
        specific procedures included in the protocol, but may still allow pertinent parts of this
        diagnostic evaluation. These conditions/procedures may include: pregnancy/Chest PA/Lat
        x-ray; allergy to pilocarpine /sweat testing. For reversible conditions such as acute upper
        airway infection, significant epistaxis within the prior week (not related to #2 below), or
        lower airway infection with uncontrollable coughing, the participant may need to be
        rescheduled upon resolution.

        For nasal nitric oxide and nasal potential difference measurements or nasal mucosal scrape
        biopsies:

          1. Anatomic abnormality of the nose or sinuses (e.g. complete sinus blockage or
             turbinatectomy) that precludes either the measurement of nasal nitric oxide or nasal
             potential difference.

          2. A severe bleeding diathesis or condition such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
             syndrome that may predispose to significant nasal bleeding or result in severely
             excoriated nasal mucosa.

          3. Inability to sit still for up to 15 minutes while the nasal catheters are held on the
             mucosal surface for transepithelial potential difference measurements. This would
             include the presence of acute or chronic lower respiratory tract infection that
             results in uncontrollable coughing.

          4. Diffuse skin condition that would preclude placement of the subcutaneous reference
             electrode (butterfly needle) for nasal PD measurement.
