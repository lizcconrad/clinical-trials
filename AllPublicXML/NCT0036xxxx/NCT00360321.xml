  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      International surveys about pathological gambling estimate that there are about 1 to 3 per
      cent of gamblers who develop a pathological behavior about gamble.In France, pathological
      gambling is not a priority of public health, in contrast with other addictive disorders, like
      alcoholism or nicotine addiction. The aim of our study is to describe accurately for the
      first time in France, a sample of “at risk” and pathological French gamblers. We want to
      collect socio-demographical and clinical data from this subjects (story of the addictive
      behaviour, co morbidities, and more specifically, detailed study of pathological gamblers’
      personality), in order to compare our data with those of international
      literature.Secondarily, we want to test the feasibility of this kind of detailed evaluations
      for another study planned for 2007-2008 and which purpose will be to compare pathological
      gamblers’ personality characteristics according to the kind of game that they mainly
      practice.The participation at the study will be proposed to every patient consulting in the
      “service d’addictologie du CHU de Nantes”. The study consists in a single evaluation (about 8
      hours) with standardized tools used all other the world.
