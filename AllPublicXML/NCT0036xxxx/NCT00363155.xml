    <textblock>
      KRN7000 is reported to inhibit HBV replication in HBV transgenic mice. Anti-viral effects of
      KRN7000 can be expected in HBV, as the compound is able to induce not only IFN-alpha/beta but
      also IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. In two clinical trials, KRN7000 was safe in both healthy
      volunteers and solid cancer patients; particularly, the compound has not been reported to
      show drug-related serious adverse events. A phase I/II trial is of significance in assessing
      the safety and efficacy of KRN7000 treatment for CHB patients.

      The 300 microgram/m2 dose level, comparable to 10 microgram/kg, can be considered as the
      highest safe dose level for the phase I/II trial for CHB patients with 3 dose levels. Dose
      incrementation will be performed in a logarithmic manner: 0.1, 1 and 10 microgram/kg.

      In the phase I trial for solid tumor patients, weekly administration of KRN7000 did not allow
      sufficient time for NKT cell recovery. As KRN7000 is reported to be an activating ligand for
      NKT cells, it is logical to assume that a dosing interval that provides time for recovery of
      NKT cells is optimal. In fact, cytokine production after repeating dosing, when NKT cells
      were hardly detected in the peripheral blood, was not observed. As it took approximately 4
      weeks for NKT cells to recover to pre-dose levels after a single administration, monthly
      administration is now proposed for this trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic hepatitis B (confirmed by a liver biopsy performed within 3 years prior to the
             screenings visit and HBV DNA in serum &gt;10E5 copies/ml at the screenings visit).

          -  ALT &gt; 1.2 x ULN on two occasions documented within 8 weeks before initiation of
             treatment.

          -  Able and likely to attend regularly for treatment and follow-up.

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  Adequate contraception for males and females during treatment and follow-up (written
             confirmation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of cirrhosis.

          -  Decompensated liver disease, as marked by: bilirubin greater than 20 micromol/L or
             serum albumin &lt;35 g/L or prothrombin time greater than 3 seconds prolonged or Quick
             test below 70% or history of bleeding esophageal varices, ascites or hepatic
             encephalopathy.

          -  Systemic IFN treatment, systemic antiviral agents, systemic corticosteroids, immune
             suppressive treatment or any investigational drug within 3 months of entry to this
             protocol.

          -  Patients with ALT levels greater than 10 times ULN will not be enrolled but may be
             followed until three consecutive determinations within 2 months are below this level.

          -  Pregnancy, or in women of child-bearing potential or in spouses of such women,
             inability to practice adequate contraception.

          -  Significant systemic or major illnesses other than liver disease, including congestive
             heart failure, ischemic heart disease, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular disease, renal
             failure (creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min), organ transplantation, serious
             psychiatric disease or depression, anaphylactic disorder.

             ng/ml and ultrasound (or other imaging study) within 6 months prior to the entry
             demonstrating a mass suggestive of liver cancer.

          -  Patients with cerebroside metabolite abnormalities (e.g. Gaucher's disease).

          -  Other acquired or inherited causes of liver disease: hepatitis C, hepatitis D,
             alcoholic liver disease, obesity induced liver disease, drug related liver disease,
             auto-immune liver disease, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin
             deficiency.
