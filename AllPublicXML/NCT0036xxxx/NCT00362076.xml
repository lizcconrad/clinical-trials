  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is concerned with psychological and physiological development in infants.
      Specifically, researchers are interested in when and how babies are able to group similar
      objects, like animals or vehicles, into the same category. This study will investigate
      whether motion aids in the categorization process and allows for earlier demonstration of
      this competency.

      Previous studies have demonstrated that the ability to categorize stationary objects or
      images of objects, is present by 6 months of age. This study is made up of three experiments
      to test:

        1. The infant's ability to categorize photographic stimuli.

        2. The infant's ability to categorize moving stimuli.

        3. The infant's ability to transfer knowledge from moving to photographic stimuli.

      Initially, the abilities of 3- and 6-month-old infants will be compared. It is also possible
      that 9-month-old infants will be tested. Data will consist of looking at time measures (level
      of attention to displays) and heart rate. The ability of infants to transfer category
      knowledge will support the view that motion is a source of information for object
      categorization.

      The major objective of this research is to better understand the early development of
      perceptual categorization. The proposed work is designed to examine the emergence of infants'
      ability to access internal categorical representations. Representation refers simply to
      stored information that can influence later behavior. Categorization refers to the treatment
      of discriminable objects as equivalent in some way. Even very young infants appear able to
      visually categorize diverse sets of discriminable patterns or objects. Much less is known,
      however, about how infants internally represent and utilize such information. The present set
      of studies is designed to probe the ontogeny of category of representations in infancy. The
      methodological strategy to be used in the first study consists of exposing infants to
      entirely novel configurations of objects for fixed amounts of time and later analyzing
      infants' examination and manipulation of those objects once they have become familiar.
      Infants will be exposed to these novel categories of objects at home over a 2-month period.
      Later, in a laboratory procedure, 5-month-old infants will be tested both with the familiar
      objects and similar test objects. A second study will utilize eye-tracking technology to
      examine the nature of infants' eye movements as they visually encode the individual members
      of complex categories such as animals and vehicles. Finally, a third study is being conducted
      to examine the relation between individual differences in infants' category learning and
      subsequent variability in language learning later on in childhood.

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Infants will be selected for inclusion in Studies 1 and 2 on the basis of age, gestational
        status (i.e., term vs. preterm birth), visual normality, and general health status.

        The initial group will be recruited to participate within two weeks of becoming 2 months of
        age.

        Infants with a gestational age of less than 36 weeks, and/or those with histories of severe
        perinatal complications, visual abnormalities, or congenital developmental disorders will
        not be recruited for participation.

        Equal numbers of males and females will be recruited to participate.
