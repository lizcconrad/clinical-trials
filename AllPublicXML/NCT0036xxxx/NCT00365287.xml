      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy before a donor umbilical
      cord blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells when they do not exactly match
      the patient's blood. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune system and help
      destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      antithymocyte globulin before transplant and cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after
      transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving combination
      chemotherapy together with total-body irradiation before donor umbilical cord blood
      transplant and to see how well they work in treating patients with advanced hematologic
      cancer, metastatic breast cancer, or kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of nonmyeloablative preparative regimen comprising
           cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and total-body irradiation with or without anti-thymocyte
           globulin, in terms of non-relapse mortality at day 100 post-transplantation, in patients
           with advanced hematologic malignancies, metastatic breast cancer, or renal cell cancer
           who are undergoing umbilical cord blood transplantation from an unrelated donor.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the hematopoietic recovery and degree of chimerism on days 21, 60, 100, 180,
           and 360 post-transplantation.

        -  Determine the incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
           by day 100 post-transplantation and chronic GVHD at 1 year post-transplantation.

        -  Evaluate the risk of relapse at 1 year post-transplantation.

        -  Determine overall survival at 1 year post-transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Nonmyeloablative preparative regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours
           on day -6 and fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -2. Patients also undergo
           total-body irradiation on day -1. Some patients* may also receive anti-thymocyte
           globulin (ATG) IV twice daily on days -6 to -4.

      NOTE: *Patients who have not had prior combination chemotherapy within the past 3 months OR
      who only received 1 prior induction course for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
      acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast
      crisis receive ATG during the preparative regimen.

        -  Umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT): Patients undergo UCBT from an unrelated
           donor on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2 hours or
           orally 2-3 times daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 100 followed by a
           taper until day 180. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV or orally twice
           daily beginning on day -3 and continuing until day 30 or until 7 days after engraftment.

      After transplantation, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.
