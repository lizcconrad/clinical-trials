      The purpose of this project is to analyze the respiratory motion process as relevant in
      cardiac MRI imaging and apply the results for development of improved imaging methods and
      software correction. To accomplish this, we will develop an imaging protocol for monitoring
      respiratory motion.

      The imaging protocol will be limited to less than five minutes of acquisition time so it may
      be performed as &quot;piggyback&quot; acquisition following clinically prescribed imaging studies on
      pediatric and adult cardiac MRI patients, but will also be applied to normal healthy
      volunteers.

      Hypothesis Characterization of respiratory motion will help improve image quality by allowing
      optimized scan acquisition and retrospective correction of acquired data.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used heavily in the research setting but its use
      is limited in clinical practice, the main reason being artifact (noise) from respiratory and
      cardiac motion. To counteract these sources of motion, many different applications have been
      applied. For cardiac motion, ECG (electrocardiogram) gating is widely used, while respiratory
      motion reduction uses methods of breath holding or respiratory gating techniques.

      Patients will be recruited based on whether they are a normal healthy volunteer or a patient
      already receiving a routine cardiac MRI.

      Normal Healthy Volunteers Patients will be recruited via a flyer posted in various locations
      at Emory University. The contents of this flyer will adhere strictly to Emory IRB
      Advertisement guidelines. Subjects will register by contacting Marijn Brunner, PhD, by email
      or telephone.

      Patients already scheduled for a routine cardiac MRI The MRI technical specialist will review
      the laboratory schedule daily. Those who are already scheduled for a routine cardiac MRI will
      be approached by a study staff member in the Children's MRI Department. The patient will be
      asked if he/she would wish to enroll in this study. The patient will be requested to sign a
      consent prior to any study procedures being performed.

      MRI image data will be collected by the prescribed protocol for respiratory monitoring. All
      MRI data will be acquired by standard FDA approved imaging methods. The image data will be
      transferred by network to the Pediatrics Imaging Research Laboratory where they will be
      stored on a password-protected computer and analyzed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will recruit two groups of patients - 35 healthy volunteers (21 years or older) and
             25 cardiac MRI patients of different age groups.

        We wish to recruit cardiac patients from Children's Healthcare of Atlanta into five (5)
        different categories defined by the overall characteristics of breathing motion. The
        categories are:

          1. neonates/infants (shallow belly breathing)

          2. young children (unable to do controlled breathing or breath-holding on command, up to
             approximately 7 years of age)

          3. older children capable of controlled breathing/breath-holding on command
             (approximately 8-12 years of age)

          4. teenagers/adolescents/young adults (ages 13 through 17)

          5. adults (18 and older) These categories may be adjusted or modified during the project
             as deemed appropriate based on the analysis results.

        We will recruit 10 - 35 healthy volunteer subjects for scans to define the MRI imaging
        protocol for respiratory motion monitoring. Healthy subjects are defined as those
        individuals who do not have a prior history of heart or lung disease nor are currently
        diagnosed with heart or lung disease. This information will be obtained verbally during the
        subject screening process.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No exclusion criteria will be placed on any sub-population based on age, gender or
             race other than the patient not freely giving written informed consent or having a
             history or current diagnosis of heart or lung disease. However, the normal exclusion
             criteria for MRI exams will still be adhered to:

               1. subjects with pacemakers, medical implants, aneurysm clips, or imbedded metal
                  fragments will be excluded because of potential effects of the magnetic field

               2. women who are pregnant or who may be pregnant will be excluded because of the
                  potential of a high level of RF power deposition on the fetus

               3. subjects who may experience claustrophobia will be excluded because of their
                  inability to remain in the magnet for the time required to complete the exam
