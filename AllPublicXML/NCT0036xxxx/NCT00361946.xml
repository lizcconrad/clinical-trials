  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study postprandial metabolism in lean, obese and T2DM adolescents using a mixed meal
      challenge. Specifically we will be measuring the following parameters of postprandial
      metabolism: 1. Postprandial glucose and triglycerides excursions 2. Gastric emptying 3.
      Insulin, amylin, glucagon, GLP-1 and ghrelin secretion 4. Glucose Turnover rate

    <textblock>
      Previously type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was considered a disease of the adult; however,
      the incidence of T2DM in children is on the rise. Consequently, complications may occur at an
      earlier age, underscoring the importance of improving glycemic control in the pediatric
      population. Postprandial hyperglycemia contributes significantly to poor glycemic control in
      T2DM. We now understand that in addition to insulin other hormones (glucagon, amylin and
      GLP-1) may play a role in the postprandial glucose metabolism. The role of gastric emptying
      has been increasingly recognized as an important factor in regulating glucose appearance into
      the circulation. Abnormalities in the pancreatic hormone amylin and the incretin GLP-1 have
      emerged as contributors to the alterations in gastric emptying and postprandial hyperglycemia
      in T2DM. Although much is know about the abnormalities related to postprandial hyperglycemia
      in adults with T2DM, little information is available in the pediatric population. This
      protocol will examine gastric emptying, glucagon, GLP-1 and amylin secretions in healthy
      lean, obese children with and without diabetes post-ingestion of a mixed meal. The subject
      will be age and Tanner stage matched. The goal of this project is to better understand the
      metabolic adaptations of postprandial glucose homeostasis in T2DM by comparing our study
      group to obese (normal glucose tolerance) and healthy (lean) controls. The long-term goal for
      the PI is to use the data gathered with this protocol to develop a K-23 proposal
      incorporating new therapeutic options through the use of amylin and GLP-1 analogs in children
      with T2DM to improve postprandial hyperglycemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Group A- Lean Adolescents a. Inclusion criteria: This group will consist of 20 lean
             adolescents between the ages of 12-18 years, Tanner stage 3-5 for pubertal
             development, have a BMI less than 85th and above 20th for age and an HbA1C less than
             or equal to 6% (normal range is 4-6%). They should not be taking any medications. A
             DXA scan will be performed to estimate lean and fat body mass. The body fat mass
             should be less than or equal to 25 % to be included in this group (in the lean range).
             The subjects will be matched for age and Tanner stage to the subjects in Group B and
             C. Menstruating females must have a negative urine pregnancy test for inclusion.The
             subject must weigh more than 43 kg.

          2. Group B- Obese Adolescents a. Inclusion criteria: This group will consist of obese
             adolescents, between the ages of 12-18 years and Tanner stage 3-5 for pubertal
             development. They must have: a BMI above or equal to 95th for age, but not greater
             than 40 kg/m2 . They must have a normal glucose tolerance, in other words subjects
             with undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes will not be considered for the
             study. To test them for diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance they will undergo a
             2-hour Glucose tolerance test (2hr-GTT). The ADA criteria will be used for the
             diagnosis of diabetes and/or impaired glucose tolerance (fasting plasma glucose &lt; 110
             mg/dl and a 2 hour postprandial blood glucose &lt; 140 mg/dl). They must have and normal
             liver function tests and not taking any medications. The subjects will undergo DXA
             scan for estimation of total lean and fat body mass. The fat mass should be more than
             or equal to 30% to be considered obese. The subjects in this group will be matched for
             age (plus minus 1year), Tanner stage (plus minus 1) and body fat mass (plus minus 5%)
             to the Type 2 diabetes adolescents?. Menstruating females must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test for inclusion. 3. Group C- T2DM Adolescents a. Inclusion criteria The
             study group will consist of adolescents with T2DM, between the ages of 12-18 years,
             Tanner stage 3-5 for pubertal development, BMI above or equal to 85th for age (but
             less than 40 kg/m2) and HbA1c less than 8.5%. They must have T2DM diagnosed for at
             least 2years, treated with diet , oral hypoglycemic agents and or insulin. If on
             medications they need to be on a stable dose of insulin and / or oral hypoglycemic
             agent over the last 2 months. The subjects must be otherwise healthy except for
             hypothyroidism stable on treatment. Menstruating females must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test for inclusion. -
