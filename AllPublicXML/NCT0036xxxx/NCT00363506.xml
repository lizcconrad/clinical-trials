      AMPS, the American Migraine Prevention Study Program is a home based nutritional study for
      migraine prevention. It is designed to evaluate a nutritional supplement along with proper
      diet, and trigger management that may prevent migraines or reduce the frequency, duration and
      intensity of migraine headache pain.

      The AMPS Program is availalbe nationwide. It is a home based study program.

      During the three month study period, participants will be asked to take a daily nutritional
      supplement and follow a recommended diet to avoid potential migraine triggers. Participants
      will be asked to maintain a headache log and submit headache questionnaires at the beginning
      and end of the study. Participants do not have to travel and can participate from their
      current location.
