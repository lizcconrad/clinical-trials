  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The number of adults with autism is expected to rise significantly in the near
      future, due to two main reasons: First, a dramatic increase in the estimates of the
      prevalence of autism starting in the mid 1980s; Second, the clinical diagnosis of autism was
      first introduced during the 1950s, and those diagnosed with autism back then are only now
      entering middle age. Few studies, however, have focused on the outcomes of adult autistic
      individuals, and very little is known about the course of autism in adulthood and on the
      familial burden resulting from caring for an autistic adult. We therefore propose to study
      adult outcomes in autism, and to examine the influence of raising an autistic individual on
      the parents.

      Working hypothesis and aims: The primary objectives of the study are:

        1. Determine clinical status and functioning of autistic adults.

        2. Study the influence of raising and caring for an individual with autism on the
           well-being of the parents.
