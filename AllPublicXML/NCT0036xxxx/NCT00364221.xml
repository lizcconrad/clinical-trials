  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome is a collection of health risks that includes obesity, high blood
      pressure, high triglycerides, high blood sugar, low good cholesterol, and resistance to
      insulin. The purpose of this study is to find out if the medication, rosiglitazone,
      influences levels of fat cell proteins and alters insulin resistance in nondiabetic persons
      with the metabolic syndrome. This is an early step to see if a medication, such as
      rosiglitazone, will be beneficial in people who have the metabolic syndrome.
