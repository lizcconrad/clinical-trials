      This study is to evaluate an investigational vaccine with the following objectives: (1) To
      demonstrate prevention of cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancers and related precancers,
      external genital lesions, and persistent infection caused by the HPV types in the study
      vaccine, (2) To demonstrate that the vaccine is well-tolerated in women, (3) To evaluate
      vaccine immune responses in women.

      This is an early phase trial and some specific protocol information is proprietary and not
      publicly available at this time. (Full information is available to trial participants).
