  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well rosiglitazone works in preventing oral cancer in
      patients with oral leukoplakia. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer
      from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of rosiglitazone may keep cancer from forming
      in patients with oral leukoplakia

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of clinical response of oral premalignant lesions (OPL) to 12 weeks
      of therapy with rosiglitazone (Avandia), 8 mg daily, defined as greater than or equal to 50%
      reduction in the measured product of perpendicular dimension of the target lesion, or
      improvement in the degree of dysplasia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate and degree of change of putative biomarkers of rosiglitazone
      efficacy including:

      COX-2, cyclin D1, Ki-67, p21/waf1, PPAR gamma, K1 cytokeratin, involucrin, transglutaminase
      expressions, and TUNEL.

      II. To estimate the correlation between DNA ploidy measurements in OPL with clinical response
      and or response of biomarkers to rosiglitazone therapy, and to estimate the efficacy of
      rosiglitazone therapy to normalize aberrant DNA ploidy in OPL.

      III. To thoroughly assess smoking patterns among trial participants and to examine the
      relationship of smoking to treatment response.

      IV. To assess the safety of this agent in short-term use in this population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral rosiglitazone once daily. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females with a suspected or histologically confirmed index oral premalignant
             lesion (excluding carcinoma in situ), 12mm or greater in size that has not been
             biopsied in the past 6 weeks; each index lesion must be either a:

               -  dysplastic measurable leukoplakia or erythroplakia in the oral cavity or
                  accessible oropharynx, or

          -  White blood cells &gt;= 3,000/uL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 125,000/uL

          -  LDH =&lt; 1.5 x ULN

          -  If the subject is female and of childbearing potential (women are considered not of
             childbearing potential if they are at least two years postmenopausal and/or surgically
             sterile), she:

               -  has been using adequate contraception (abstinence, IUD, birth control pills, or
                  spermicidal gel with diaphragm or condom) since her last menses and will use
                  adequate contraception during the study, AND

               -  is not lactating, AND

               -  has a documented negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to

          -  The effects of rosiglitazone (Avandia) on the developing human fetus at the
             recommended therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason, and because rosiglitazone
             has been associated with fetal death and growth retardation in rats and rabbits and
             placental pathology in rats, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her study physician immediately and will be removed from the trial

             rosiglitazone greater than 4 mg daily in combination with these therapies are not
             currently indicated; because this protocol uses the maximum recommended dose of 8 mg
             daily, subjects on insulin, sulfonylurea or metformin will be ineligible for
             participation in this trial); the subject is currently receiving thiazolidinediones;

          -  The subject has had chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy (other than HRT for
             menopause), or radiation therapy within 18 months of the Baseline visit

          -  The subject will need concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal (other than HRT
