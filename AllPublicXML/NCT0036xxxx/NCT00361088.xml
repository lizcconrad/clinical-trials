  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Phase I, patients will receive a combination of PS-341 (Velcade) and R115777 (Zarnestra)
      to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Once DLT is determined, patients in Phase II
      will be receive the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to complete 8 cycles of therapy. Treatment
      will continue if there is evidence of continued response for 8 cycles. Patients will receive
      follow up to include normal laboratory evaluations at least every 3 months and a skeletal
      survey will be performed at least every 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Phase I, patients will receive intravenous PS-341 (Velcade) and 3 different dose levels of
      oral R115777 (Zarnestra). Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) will be determined over a period of
      one cycle and dose escalation to the next level will not occur until all patients projected
      at each level complete one cycle of therapy. Once DLT is determined, patients in Phase I and
      all patients enrolled for the phase II component will be treated at the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) to complete 8 cycles of therapy. Treatment will continue beyond 8 cycles if there
      is evidence of continued response. The study regimen will consist of two weeks of treatment
      followed by one week off for a total cycle duration of three weeks. If disease stabilization
      occurs (noted on 2 consecutive cycles) after the standard 8 cycles are given, treatment will
      be discontinued.

      Patients are to be monitored for adverse events throughout the treatment phases and for a
      minimum of 30 days after their last dose of drugs. Follow up will include history and
      physical exam with laboratory evaluation at least every 3 months. Laboratories will include
      CMP, CBC, SPEP, UPEP, and quantitative immunoglobulins. A skeletal survey will be performed
      at least every 6 months.
