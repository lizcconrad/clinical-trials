  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      10 healthy volunteers will be enrolled to each receive two subcutaneous injections of ISIS
      113715 in the abdomen on Study Day 1. Each subject will receive their two injections within a
      5-minute period. On Study Days 2 and 8, each subject's injection sites will be assessed for
      dermatologic effects. The Isis Project Physician(s) will observe the injection sites on Study
      Day 2 and may also observe on Study Day 8.

      Routine clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis tests will be performed on Study Day 1
      and Day 8. Subjects will be contacted by telephone on Study Day 30 to monitor for the
      occurrence of new serious adverse events (SAEs). Thereafter, the subjects will be discharged
      from the study.

      Following a two-week period for subject screening, 10 eligible subjects will be dosed
      subcutaneously with ISIS 113715 on a single calendar date (Study Day 1). Each subject will
      receive two subcutaneous injections given within a 5-minute period. The first injection will
      be 200 mg ISIS 113715 given in 1.0 mL and will be injected about 7.5 cm to the left of the
      umbilicus. The second injection will be 200 mg ISIS 113715 given in 2.0 mL and will be
      injected about 7.5 cm to the right of the umbilicus. Both injections will be delivered using
      3.0-mL syringes outfitted with 30-gauge, 0.5-inch needles. To further minimize variability,
      all injections will be performed by a single individual, the Investigator or his designee,
      employing uniform technique for all of the injections.

      Dermatologic responses at injection sites will be assessed at 1 and 7 days after the
      injections (Study Days 2 and 8, respectively). Effects will be evaluated through completion
      of the Injection Site Assessment Questionnaires by the Investigator and the recording of
      adverse events reported by the subject or observed by the Investigator. The Isis Project
      Physician(s) will observe the injection sites on Study Day 2 and may also observe on Study
      Day 8.

      Routine clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis tests will be performed on Study Days
      1 (prior to administration of ISIS 113715) and 8.

      Subjects will be contacted by telephone on Study Day 30 to monitor for the occurrence of new
      serious adverse events. Thereafter, the subjects will be discharged from the study.
