  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help smokers quitting by vaccinating them with CYT002-NicQb.
      Upon vaccination, the smoker will generate antibodies directed against free nicotine. The
      antibodies will bind nicotine and prevent its passage into the brain. The successfully
      vaccinated smoker will have no reward effect after smoking, thus braking the vicious circle
      of nicotine addiction.
