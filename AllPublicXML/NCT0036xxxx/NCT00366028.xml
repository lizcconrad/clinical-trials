    <textblock>
      Evidence-based clinical practices (EBCPs) are often not widely adopted, despite extensive
      efforts to influence individual practitioners to use them. The aim of the project is to work
      with Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) 1, 10, and 23 and their medical centers to
      create and test organizations that facilitate the use of EBCPs. The research objectives are
      to: Test the effectiveness of the proposed organizational model in comparison with a more
      limited data-feedback strategy in improving system use of a selected EBCP; Identify and
      analyze organizational factors that affect model implementation; Test the feasibility of
      intervention activities to introduce and support the model.

      Background:

      The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) needs to develop efficient ways to broadly implement
      evidence based practices and foster a learning organization culture that systematically and
      continuously applies research to improve VA healthcare. Recognizing this need, VHA Health
      Services Research and Development (HSR&amp;D) invited applications in the fall of 2003 for
      collaboration HSR&amp;D investigators and Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) on a) implementing
      and evaluating an evidenced-based interventions or b) undergoing and evaluating an
      organizational or structural change to transform the VISN in to a learning organization that
      can efficiently implement evidence-based practices. Collaborations are intended to help
      improve clinical services locally within participating VISNs and provide templates for
      expanding successful changes nationwide.

      Objectives:

      Despite recognition that successful implementation of evidence-based clinical practices
      (EBCPs) usually depends on the on the structure and processes of the larger healthcare
      organization in which new clinical practices are introduced, the processes and dynamics of
      implementation are not well understood. The aim of this project was to deepen that
      understanding by testing an organizational model that we hypothesized would strengthen the
      ability of healthcare organizations to implement evidence-based clinical practices. The
      research objectives were to: - Test the hypothesis that medical centers with high fidelity to
      the organizational model would be more successful in improving system use of a selected EBCP;
      - Identify and analyze organizational factors that affect model implementation; - Test the
      feasibility of intervention activities to introduce and support the model.

      Methods:

      The three-year study used a mixed-methods pre-post comparison-group design to implement and
      evaluate the organizational model in medical centers in 3 VISNs in the Department of Veterans
      Affairs. The model posits that the implementation of evidence-based practices will be
      enhanced through the presence of three interacting components in the organization: 1) active
      leadership commitment to quality, 2) robust clinical process redesign to incorporate
      evidence-based practices into routine operations, and 3) use of management structures and
      processes to support and align redesign. The target clinical practice was hand-hygiene
      compliance. One VISN was randomly assigned to the intervention arm that implemented the
      organizational model; two VISNs were assigned to a comparison arm that participated in a more
      limited data feedback strategy. Measures included: 1) ratings of implementation fidelity, as
      measured on a 0-4 scale at the site level supported by narrative evidence by research team;
      2) percent compliance with national hand-hygiene guidelines for each site, as measured
      through structured observations by medical center staff; 3) staff ratings of team
      effectiveness and facility emphasis on quality, as measured through a written survey; and 4)
      factors affecting model implementation, as identified qualitatively through interviews and
      quantitatively through staff surveys

      Status:

      Data collection and analysis is complete. Manuscript preparation is ongoing.

    <measure>Effect Size of Improvement in Hand Hygiene Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months pre and post study intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The effect size of improvement in hand-hygiene compliance was calculated by comparing the baseline three-month periods to the last three-month periods of the study. To evaluate the statistical significance of changes in proportion adherence over time, we ran a weighted least squares regression model with time (i.e. month) as the independent variable and adherence proportion as the dependent variable. The sample size in each data collection period was used as the weight. Our interest is in the statistical significance of the coefficient associated with time. To evaluate the practical significance of the change pre and post intervention, we examined the effect size associated with the change in proportion adherence in the first 3-month period of data collection and the last 3-month period. Effect size was calculated as 2*arcsin(sqr(p2)) - 2*arcsin(sqr(p1)). Using Cohen's criteria, an effect size of .2 is interpreted as small, .5 as medium and .8 as large.</description>

Data Feedback Model: This is considered the non-intervention arm. The research team periodically interviewed the facilities and provided them with reported hand hygiene data.
The Control Arm included 735 individual participants across 9 study sites (medical centers) in total. Only 5 of the study sites are included in the reporting of outcome data due to incomplete data at 4 of the study sites.</description>

          <title>Fidelity to the Organizational Model</title>
          <description>Final fidelity to the Organizational Model was assessed by averaging scores for each component of the model. Scores ranged from 0 (no evidence of that factor present) to 4 (factor fully present and used as intended). The 3 main components of the model included 1) active leadership commitment to quality, 2) robust clinical process redesign to incorporate evidence-based practices into routine operations, and 3) use of management structures and processes to support and align redesign. Scores for each component of the model were measured by the study team using structured rating instruments based on data collected during interviews.
Sites with an overall fidelity score above 3.0 were considered to have high fidelity to the organizational model.</description>

        <title>Effect Size of Improvement in Hand Hygiene Compliance</title>
        <description>The effect size of improvement in hand-hygiene compliance was calculated by comparing the baseline three-month periods to the last three-month periods of the study. To evaluate the statistical significance of changes in proportion adherence over time, we ran a weighted least squares regression model with time (i.e. month) as the independent variable and adherence proportion as the dependent variable. The sample size in each data collection period was used as the weight. Our interest is in the statistical significance of the coefficient associated with time. To evaluate the practical significance of the change pre and post intervention, we examined the effect size associated with the change in proportion adherence in the first 3-month period of data collection and the last 3-month period. Effect size was calculated as 2*arcsin(sqr(p2)) - 2*arcsin(sqr(p1)). Using Cohen's criteria, an effect size of .2 is interpreted as small, .5 as medium and .8 as large.</description>

Organization Model: The organizational model contains three components: leadership support, a multidisciplinary redesign team, and management structures and processes to link the two.
The Intervention Arm included 7 study sites (medical centers). Of the 7 sites there were 4 with high fidelity to the Organizational Model and 3 with low fidelity to the Organizational Model.</description>

          <description>This arm is considered the intervention arm. Participants in this arm of the study will receive information regarding the organizational model and work closely with the research team throughout the project to implement various aspects of the model.
Organization Model: The organizational model contains three components: leadership support, a multidisciplinary redesign team, and management structures and processes to link the two.
Data Feedback Model: This is considered the non-intervention arm. The research team will periodically interview the facilities and provide them with reported hand hygiene data.</description>
