      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The study
      consists of two groups of subjects with major depression treated for ten weeks with a common
      antidepressant regimen, 20-40 mg of fluoxetine hydrochloride per day; and randomized to
      receive (in addition) either eszopiclone 3 mg or placebo for eight weeks. This study was
      previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon
      Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion
      Pharmaceuticals Inc.
