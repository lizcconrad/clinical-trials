  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postmenopausal state is associated with an increase risk for heart disease. Much of this
      increase in risk may be due to the loss of estrogen (the main female hormone) and the effect
      of this loss on lipids (blood fats). This loss of estrogen is often treated by estrogen
      replacement therapy. Estrogen replacement therapy seems to have a beneficial effect on lipid
      levels. The purpose of this research study is to understand 1) how menopause affects lipids
      and 2) how hormone replacement therapy effects the lipid metabolism of postmenopausal women.

      Women with the Metabolic Syndrome (central obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia) are
      at especially high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). The prevalence of the Metabolic
      Syndrome increases with menopause and may partially explain the acceleration in CHD after
      menopause. Menopause is associated with increased central adiposity, insulin resistance,
      dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia, increased low density lipoprotein (LDL), reduced high
      density lipoprotein (HDL) and small dense LDL particles), and increased
      thrombotic/inflammatory states, but there are no studies investigating the mechanisms that
      mediate these changes. The objectives of the proposed project are to investigate the
      emergence of the features of the Metabolic Syndrome in women followed prospectively through
      the menopause and determine if these features can be reversed with transdermal estrogen. We
      hypothesize that the increase in central adiposity with menopause will be a major contributor
      to the increased prevalence of the Metabolic Syndrome with menopause. This is the first
      prospective study to investigate the 1) effects of menopause and 2) estrogen replacement
      therapy (ERT) (oral vs. transdermal) on features of the Metabolic Syndrome. We will determine
      if the increase in central (intraabdominal)fat with menopause is associated with changes in
      lipids, insulin resistance, adipocytokines, and fibrinolytic/inflammatory markers. We will
      then determine if these changes can be reversed with transdermal ERT, as compared to oral
      ERT, which has pharmacologic effects on the liver.
