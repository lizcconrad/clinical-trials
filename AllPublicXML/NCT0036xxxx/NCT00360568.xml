          <description>All participants received levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG), delivered through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with jejunal extension (PEG-J), administered for up to 12 months (52 weeks). Starting dose of LCIG was based on the optimized oral levodopa-carbidopa dose that the participant was receiving just prior to randomization in Study S187.3.001 (NCT00357994) and Study S187.3.002 (NCT00660387), administered in the morning of the first day following Study Day 86 of these previous studies. The LCIG infusion was expected to infuse over approximately16 hours each day with a rate of infusion within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances.
In NCT00357994/NCT00660387 (previous study), these participants received double-blind, double-dummy treatment with LCIG + Placebo Capsules.</description>

            <description>All participants received LCIG, delivered through a PEG-J, administered for up to 12 months (52 weeks). Starting dose of LCIG was based on the optimized oral levodopa-carbidopa dose that the participant was receiving just prior to randomization in Study S187.3.001 (NCT00357994) and Study S187.3.002 (NCT00660387), administered in the morning of the first day following Study Day 86 of these previous studies. The LCIG infusion was expected to infuse over approximately16 hours each day with a rate of infusion within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances.
In NCT00357994/NCT00660387 (previous study), these participants received double-blind, double-dummy treatment with LCIG + Placebo Capsules.</description>

            <description>All participants received LCIG, delivered through a PEG-J, administered for up to 12 months (52 weeks). Starting dose of LCIG was based on the optimized oral levodopa-carbidopa dose that the participant was receiving just prior to randomization in Study S187.3.001 (NCT00357994) and Study S187.3.002 (NCT00660387), administered in the morning of the first day following Study Day 86 of the previous studies. The LCIG infusion was expected to infuse over approximately16 hours each day with a rate of infusion within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances.
In NCT00357994/NCT00660387 (previous study), these participants received double-blind, double-dummy treatment with Placebo Gel + Levodopa-Carbidopa Capsules.</description>

            <description>All participants received LCIG, delivered through a PEG-J, administered for up to 12 months (52 weeks). Starting dose of LCIG was based on the optimized oral levodopa-carbidopa dose that the participant was receiving just prior to randomization in Study S187.3.001 (NCT00357994) and Study S187.3.002 (NCT00660387), administered in the morning of the first day following Study Day 86 of these previous studies. The LCIG infusion was expected to infuse over approximately16 hours each day with a rate of infusion within the range of 1 to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances.
In NCT00357994/NCT00660387 (previous study), these participants received double-blind, double-dummy treatment with LCIG + Placebo Capsules.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Total Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The AIMS is an investigator-completed rating scale that has a total of 12 items rating involuntary movements of various areas of the participant's body. Items 1 through 10 are rated on a 5-point scale of severity from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe), and items 11 and 12 are yes/no questions concerning problems with teeth or dentures. The total AIMS score was calculated by summing items 1-10, with a possible range of 0-40; a negative change indicates improvement. The AIMS was to be performed at consistent times, when the subject was experiencing his/her worst &quot;On&quot; time (dyskinesia [involuntary muscle movement]).</description>

        <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) is a systematically administered instrument developed to track suicidal adverse events across a treatment study. The instrument is designed to assess suicidal behavior and ideation, track and assess all suicidal events, as well as the lethality of attempts. Suicidal ideation categories include the following: wish to be dead; nonspecific active suicidal thoughts; active suicidal ideation without intent to act; active suicidal ideation with some intent to act but no plan; active suicidal ideation with plan and intent. Suicidal behavior categories include the following: actual attempt; interrupted attempt; aborted attempt; preparatory acts or behavior; suicidal behavior; completed suicide.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily &quot;Off&quot; Time at Endpoint</title>
        <description>Based on the Parkinson's Disease Symptom Diary. &quot;On&quot; time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. &quot;Off&quot; time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. The diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected clinic visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e. 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. Negative change from baseline for &quot;off&quot; time indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily &quot;Off&quot; Time at Endpoint</title>
          <description>Based on the Parkinson's Disease Symptom Diary. &quot;On&quot; time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. &quot;Off&quot; time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. The diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected clinic visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e. 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. Negative change from baseline for &quot;off&quot; time indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Clinical Global Impression - Status (CGI-S) Score at Baseline and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) Score at Endpoint</title>
          <description>The CGI-S is a global assessment by the Investigator of current symptomatology and impact of illness on functioning. The ratings of the CGI-S are as follows: 1 = normal, 2 = borderline ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, and 7 = among the most extremely ill. The CGI-I is a global assessment by the Investigator of the change in clinical status since the start of treatment. The CGI-I ratings are as follows: 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, 7 = very much worse.</description>

These include: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. The PDQ-39 Summary Index is the sum of all answers divided by the highest score possible (i.e. number of answers multiplied by 4) which is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a 0-100 scale. Higher scores are associated with more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Mobility Domain Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson’s disease patients. The PDQ-39 Domain: Mobility (e.g., fear of falling when walking) includes 10 questions, each answered on a 5-point scale. The domain scores are calculated by first summing the answers to the questions in the domain. The sum is divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) and the quotient is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Stigma Domain Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson’s disease patients. The PDQ-39 Domain: Stigma (e.g., social embarrassment) consists of 4 questions, each answered on a 5-point scale. The domain scores are calculated by first summing the answers to the questions in the domain. The sum is divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) and the quotient is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) Communication Domain Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire which comprises 39 items addressing 8 domains of health in Parkinson’s disease patients. The PDQ-39 Domain: Communication includes 3 questions, each answered on a 5-point scale. The domain scores are calculated by first summing the answers to the questions in the domain. The sum is divided by the highest score possible (i.e., number of answers multiplied by 4) and the quotient is multiplied by 100 to put the score on a scale from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremor and stiffness.</description>

        <description>The ZBI is a 22-item questionnaire regarding the caregiver/subject relationship and evaluates the caregiver's health condition, psychological well-being, finances and social life. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (0=never, 1=rarely, 2=sometimes, 3=quite frequently, and 4=nearly always). The caregiver burden is evaluated by the total score (range 0 to 88) obtained from the sum of the answers to the 22 questions. Higher scores are associated with a higher level of burden for the caregiver.</description>
