  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug, called AEG35156, can be safely given
      to AML patients and whether it effectively reduces levels of a protein (XIAP) to increase the
      sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy (ara-C and idarubicin) in patients with
      refractory or relapsed AML.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, single-arm, open-label, study to establish the recommended dose and
      activity of AEG35156 administered as a daily x3 two-hour infusion prior to reinduction
      chemotherapy with idarubicin and ara-C followed by weekly two-hour AEG35156 infusions.
      Subjects eligible for study entry must have confirmed diagnosis of AML in first relapse after
      an initial CR that lasted less than 6 months or primary refractory AML. Fixed dose of
      idarubicin and ara-C will be given, plus one of eight doses of AEG35156: 12, 24, 48, 75, 110,
      165, 250 and 350mg/m2. A maximum of 54 patients will be treated in cohorts of size 3,
      starting at 12mg/m2, and not skipping any untried dose level when escalating. Following dose
      escalation, approximately 20 patients will be treated at the best acceptable dose as
      determined by the method of Thall and Cook (2004).

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subjects with relapsed or refractory AML, except those with APL (acute promyelocytic
             leukemia), that are about to receive their initial treatment for first relapse after
             an initial CR that lasted less than 6 months or for primary refractory AML that have
             an expected complete response rate ≤20%. The initial diagnosis of AML has to be based
             on the presence of &gt; 10% blasts in marrow or blood, and the diagnosis of
             relapsed/refractory AML based on the presence of either &gt; 10% blasts in marrow or
             blood or 5-10% blasts in either site together with cytopenia (Hb &lt; 10 g/dL, or
             platelets &lt; 100,000 /uL, or neutrophil count &lt; 1000 /uL).

          -  Peripheral AML blast count &lt; 50,000 /uL that is not projected to rise above 50,000 /uL
             within 5 days of beginning treatment.

          -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             ≤2.

          -  Subjects must be &gt;18 years old.

          -  Male, or female subjects who are post-menopausal (amenorrhagic for at least 12
             months), or surgically or biologically sterile. Females of childbearing potential with
             a negative serum pregnancy test 72-96 hours prior to the 1st infusion in the study and
             using adequate forms of contraception for the duration of the study, including 30 days
             after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception should be used by both
             male and female subjects.

          -  Subjects must have adequate organ and immune function as indicated by the following
             laboratory values:

               -  Parameter Laboratory Values

               -  Serum creatinine; &lt;2.0mg/dL

               -  Total Bilirubin &lt;2.0mg/dL

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;3 X ULN * *ULN: Institution's upper limit of normal.

          -  The subject must understand and be able and willing and likely to fully comply with
             study procedures, including scheduled follow-up, and restrictions.

          -  The subject, or the subject's legal guardian, must have given written personally
             signed and dated informed consent to participate in the study, in accordance with the

             study.

          -  Current evidence of invasive fungal infection (blood or tissue culture).

          -  Current evidence of an active second malignancy except for non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  Uncontrolled medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy, or of sufficient severity
             that in the opinion of the investigator, impair a subject's ability to give informed
             consent or unacceptably reduce the safety of the proposed treatment.

          -  Neurological or psychiatric disorders that would interfere with consent or study
             follow-up.

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study materials [or closely

          -  History of alcohol or other substance abuse within the last year.

          -  Use of another investigational agent or participation in a clinical trial within the
             last 14 days prior to enrolment. Subjects who have used a previous AS agent for at
             least 90 days will be excluded.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or females with a positive pregnancy
             test at screening must be excluded.

          -  Subjects that have previously been enrolled into this study and subsequently withdrawn
             must also be excluded.
