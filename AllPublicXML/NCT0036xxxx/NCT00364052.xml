      Null Hypothesis:

      There is no significant difference in the incidence of CMV infection when using oral
      valganciclovir or ganciclovir as prophylactic anti-viral therapy.

      Alternate Hypothesis:

      There exists a significant difference in the incidence of CMV infection when oral
      valganciclovir is used for CMV prophylaxis rather than oral ganciclovir. A formal hypothesis
      to be tested should be defined.

      The objective for this retrospective clinical study is to describe the incidence of CMV
      infection in orthoptic liver transplant recipients who receive oral valganciclovir or
      ganciclovir as their CMV prophylactic anti-viral therapy.

      Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoint

      CMV infection will be characterized as viremia, syndrome or disease by the abovementioned
      methods for up to one year post-transplantation.

      Secondary Endpoints

        1. Patient and allograft survival based on donor/recipient CMV status

        2. Incidence of graft rejection and loss associated with CMV infection

        3. Time to hepatitis C virus (HCV) occurrence

        4. Incidence of HSV, EBV and VZV reactivations

        5. Severity of HCV occurrence based on biopsy reports based on the Knodell score

        6. Safety and tolerability of oral valganciclovir and ganciclovir
