  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the main causes of death in the United States.
      Research has shown that individuals who maintain an active lifestyle are less likely to
      develop CVD. This study will examine how neighborhood environments influence CVD risk factors
      of residents in and around the Stapleton community of Denver, Colorado.

    <textblock>
      CVD is a major health problem in the United States. Individuals who live in an environment in
      which it is difficult to maintain an active lifestyle may be more at risk for developing CVD.
      Because of an increased interest in healthy living, urban planners and architects are now
      developing neighborhoods that are designed to encourage physical activity. Parks, walking and
      bicycle trails, wider sidewalks, and community recreation facilities are examples of
      amenities that are being included in these neighborhoods. By incorporating these
      enhancements, the Stapleton community in Denver, Colorado has been redeveloped as a more
      active living environment. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the
      neighborhood environment on the cardiovascular health of residents in five racially,
      ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods in or near the Stapleton community.

      In Years 1 and 2 of this study, 200 households from each of the five neighborhoods will be
      randomly chosen to complete a survey regarding their cardiovascular health, physical activity
      level, and use and perception of their neighborhood environment and facilities, for a total
      of 1,000 surveys. Interviews and focus groups with members of the community will also be used
      to gather information. Additionally, a neighborhood council composed of community members
      will be formed to study disparities among the five neighborhoods in their use of their
      neighborhood environments, their physical activity levels, and their cardiovascular risk
      factors. In Year 2, study researchers will analyze the collected data and distribute the
      findings within the communities. They will also begin testing culturally and community
      relevant programs aimed at reducing CVD risk factors.
