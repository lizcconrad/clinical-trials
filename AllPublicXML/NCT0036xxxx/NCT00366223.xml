  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the changing patterns of infection caused by
      Candida species in urban medical centers and its influence on patient outcomes. A
      retrospective cohort study design will be employed with the main outcome measure being
      hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes including microbiologic clearance of the infection,
      duration of hospitalization, and the intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay will also be
      assessed.

      The following information that was collected as part of the patient's clinical treatment will
      be collected: age, sex, occupation, hospital location at the time of positive culture (ER,
      medical ward, ICU, etc.), prior hospitalization, receipt of outpatient dialysis, home care or
      other regular medical care (eg, outpatient chemotherapy), presence of invasive devices,
      receipt of antibiotics, including their type and whether they were adequate for the
      resistance profile of the organism, prior positive microbiologic cultures, time and location
      of positive cultures, underlying diseases and severity of illness, presence of urinary or
      intravascular devices, recent immunomodulative therapies or radiation therapy, physical exam
      findings, laboratory and radiographical data, antimicrobial usage within 30 days of onset of
      the infection, microbiological data and resistance patterns, choice of antibiotics once
      organism identified, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results, demographic information,
      medications, clinical outcome, gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and past medical history.
      We will collect information retrospectively.

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.
