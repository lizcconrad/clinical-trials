    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Frequency of Satisfying Sexual Events (SSE) as Recorded in the eDiary.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For endpoints collected on the eDiary, responses are accumulated on a monthly basis using the following algorithms.
For satisfying sexual events:
Total monthly events = 28 x (sum of the number of events) / (sum of number of days entered)</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Monthly Sum of Responses Recorded in the eDiary to the Daily Desire Question.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the electronic diary (eDiary) Sexual Desire Monthly Total Score standardized to a 28-day period (score range 0-84). Change from baseline is calculated as the difference between the four week baseline period and Week 21 to Week 24. Patients were asked to record information daily in the eDiary throughout the trial. Every time the eDiary was completed, a desire question was asked. If a patient did not complete the diary on a given day, the patient was not asked to enter desire information for more than a 24-hour retrospective period. The desire item read &quot;Indicate your most intense level of sexual desire in the last 24 hours / since your last visit.&quot; Potential responses included &quot;no,&quot; &quot;low,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; and was scored 0-3, with 0 indicating no desire and 3 indicating the highest level of desire:
0 = No desire
= Low desire
= Moderate desire
= Strong desire</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in the electronic diary (eDiary) Sexual Desire Monthly Total Score standardized to a 28-day period (score range 0-84). Change from baseline is calculated as the difference between the four week baseline period and Week 21 to Week 24. Patients were asked to record information daily in the eDiary throughout the trial. Every time the eDiary was completed, a desire question was asked. If a patient did not complete the diary on a given day, the patient was not asked to enter desire information for more than a 24-hour retrospective period. The desire item read &quot;Indicate your most intense level of sexual desire in the last 24 hours / since your last visit.” Potential responses included &quot;no,&quot; “low,” “moderate,” or “strong” and was scored 0-3, with 0 indicating no desire and 3 indicating the highest level of desire:
0 = No desire
= Low desire
= Moderate desire
= Strong desire</description>
