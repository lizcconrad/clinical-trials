  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study was designed in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an AmBisome
      loading dose regimen, in a weekly administration schedule, during the aplastic phase
      following induction or consolidation chemotherapy for acute leukaemia, and during the initial
      phase of allogeneic stem-cell transplant, which are both high risk periods as far as severe
      fungal infections development is concerned.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male or female patients aged more than 18, Patients undergoing standard myelo-ablative,
        conditioning regimen and AGVHD ciclosporin prophylaxis for allogeneic stem cell
        transplantation, or Patients with acute leukaemia undergoing first induction therapy or
        second induction therapy after relapse, or consolidation therapy, Expected neutropenia &lt;
        0.5 giga/l for at least 2 weeks, Normal chest CT scan and/or normal X-ray of the chest at
        baseline, Patients with no sign or symptoms of fungal infection and no previous proven or
        probable IFI, Females of childbearing potential must be surgically incapable of pregnancy,

        or urine) at baseline, Understanding of the study and agreement of the patient to give
        written informed consent, Ability and agreement to comply with all study requirements,
        Patient willing to attend hospital appointments for each injection (infusions will be
        performed in hospital, under strict medical supervision). All patients will be hospitalised
        prior to, and remain in hospital for at least one day, after the first infusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Known hypersensitivity to amphotericin B, in particular known history of anaphylactic
        reaction to amphotericin B, Patients undergoing cord transplantation, Creatinine clearance
        &lt; 60 ml/min, Patient with moderate or severe liver disease as defined by AST or ALT &gt; 5
        times the upper limit of normal (ULN), Patients who are unlikely to survive more than 1
        month, Febrile patients (≥ 38.5°C), Patients who have received systemic antifungal therapy
        within 15 days prior to the inclusion, Any severe cardiovascular disease (such as
        arrhythmias, in particular) which may constitute a contra-indication to AmBisome®
        administration, Any severe disease other than the haematological diseases described in the
        second inclusion criteria, which in the investigator's judgement may interfere with study
        evaluations or affect the patient's safety, Pregnant or nursing females, Patients
        previously included in this study, Patients who have taken any investigational drug in the
        last 30 days prior to the inclusion.
