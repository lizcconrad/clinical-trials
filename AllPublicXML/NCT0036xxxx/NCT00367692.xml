      To evaluate the safety of an orally administered single dose of PSI-697 in subjects with
      scleritis, as a model of inflammatory disease. To evaluate by in vivo confocal microscopy
      (IVCM) the effect of a single dose of PSI-697 on leukocyte rolling in the scleral blood
      vessels of subjects with scleritis.
