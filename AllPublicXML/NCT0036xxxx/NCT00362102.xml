  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the response rate of cetuximab plus irinotecan combination therapy in subjects
      with EGFR-detectable metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have documented progressive disease
      to irinotecan-based chemotherapy and who have failed (progressive disease or intolerance)
      previous oxaliplatin-based and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapies.
