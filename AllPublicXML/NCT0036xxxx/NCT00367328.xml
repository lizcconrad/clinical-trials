      A research study to determine the efficacy of a 1320 nm laser device for the treatment of
      hidradenitis suppurativa.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hidradenitis Suppurativa is a chronic, scarring disease. The treatments available for this
      condition are not very effective and work only for some patients.

      Recently, a 1320nm laser device has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne and
      facial rejuvenation. Given the positive results seen with the use of this laser in the
      treatment of acne it is reasonable to hypothesize that a similar effect may be seen with the
      treatment of Hidradenitis suppurativa.

      The specific aim of the study is to determine the efficacy of this device for the treatment
      of hidradenitis suppurativa as it relates to the patient's established treatment.

      The investigators are trying to determine the efficacy of a laser for the treatment of
      hidradenitis suppurativa.

      Patients will:

        -  be examined and interviewed

        -  have photographs taken of the treatment site

        -  have a 4mm punch biopsy performed

        -  have wound culture swabs performed

    <description>a 4 mm piece of skin tissue (about the size of a pencil-head eraser) from the affected area. This procedure is called a punch biopsy and will be done to confirm your diagnosis. A culture swab similar to a Q-Tip will be used to wipe the affected areas during the first visit to determine any bacteria that may be present. A survey with questions will be given at the first visit, again after 3 months and at the last visit to measure the success of the treatment. Photographs will be taken prior to each treatment and one month following your last treatment. A laser, which is a very powerful light, will be used to treat half of the skin that is affected by your condition.</description>
