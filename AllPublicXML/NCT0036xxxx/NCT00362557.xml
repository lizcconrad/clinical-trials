  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Any patient already receiving a scheduled MR scan of the body for any clinical indication
      will be eligible for this program. If patients agree to participate in this program, it would
      require only a slightly longer examination time. This time would vary according to the body
      area/organ being visualized but would not exceed 30 minutes over the length of the clinical
      examination. Volunteers are eligible if they are willing to undergo an MR examination.

      Patients would not be required to make any additional visits beyond their
      clinically-indicated visits. The study duration would vary according to the body area/organ
      visualized but would not exceed 30 minutes over the length of the clinical examination.
      Volunteers would be required to keep one study appointment to include one MR imaging
      examination.

      There will be no interruption to the standard care given to patients who participate in this
      trial since the clinical portion of their examination will be completed prior to the study
      portion of the exam.
