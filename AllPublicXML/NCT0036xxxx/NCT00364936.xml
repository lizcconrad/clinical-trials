      The primary purpose of this study is to develop, implement and conduct a preliminary
      evaluation of a new service for people who are severely affected by multiple sclerosis. The
      investigators conducted open interviews with patients, families and staff, plus a literature
      review to model and pilot this new service. Then the investigators developed, tested and ran
      the service and will evaluate it using a randomised controlled trial, where people affected
      by MS are randomised to either receive the service immediately (fast track group) or after a
      three month wait (standard best practice). This methodology follows that of the Medical
      Research Council (MRC) framework for the development and evaluation of complex services and
      treatments. The investigators interview people and their carers in the fast track and
      standard practice groups, and followed them over time. This phase of trial enables us to
      calculate sample size and test proof of concept for a full randomised trial. However, our
      working hypothesis was that there would be no difference between those people who received
      the fast track service or the standard best practice in terms of symptom controlled, and
      carer needs.

      Palliative care has been proposed to help meet the needs of patients who suffer progressive
      non-cancer conditions but this has not been tested. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic disease
      affecting the central nervous system affecting over 2.5 million people worldwide, and is the
      commonest cause of neurological disability in adults under 60 years. It is associated with a
      wide spectrum of physical symptoms, including loss of function of legs, arms and in many
      instances bladder and bowel dysfunction, pain, spasms, swallowing and communication and
      cognitive difficulties, many of which are as severe as among patients with cancer. Therefore
      it seems appropriate to try to develop palliative care services for this group of patients.

      Our design followed the MRC Framework for the Evaluation of Complex Interventions. The
      investigators modelled a new palliative care and neurology service for patients affected by
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) by conducting qualitative interviews with patients, families and
      staff, plus a literature review to model and pilot the service. Then the investigators
      started to offer the service and designed a delayed intervention randomised controlled trial
      to test its effectiveness as part of phase II of the MRC framework. Inclusion criteria for
      the trial were patients identified by referring clinicians as having unresolved symptoms or
      psychological concerns. A disability of scoring greater than 8 on the Expanded Disability
      Scale was identified as a benchmark. Consenting patients newly referred to the new service
      were randomised to either receive the palliative care service immediately (fast-track) or
      after a 12-week wait (standard best practice). Face to face interviews were conducted at
      baseline (before intervention), and at 4-6, 10-12 (before intervention for the
      standard-practice group), 16-18 and 22-24 weeks with patients and their carers using standard
      questionnaires to assess symptoms, palliative care outcomes, function, service use and open
      comments. The investigators choice of outcomes was based on a systematic literature review of
      outcome measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of MS

          -  Living in South East London

          -  Having possible palliative care needs. Referrers were encouraged to identify people as
             severely affected with MS based on their clinical need, rather than relying on any
             standardised measures of disability. However, since a large Canadian population study
             identified that approximately 15% of people with MS have an Expanded Disability Scale
             Score of 8 or more (out of a possible 10)23, this was also suggested to referrers as a
             benchmark for disability that would prompt consideration of referral. Examples of
             palliative care needs were given as unresolved symptoms, psychosocial concerns, and
             end of life issues, progressive illness or complex needs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients deemed as having urgent needs (following independent review by a consultant
             in palliative medicine) because of rapid deterioration or severe symptoms - these were
             seen immediately by the service.
