  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to estimate the time to progressive disease for patients who receive
      LY573636 after two previous treatments for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Patients
      will receive an intravenous infusion of study drug once every 21 days. CT-scans will be done
      before the first dose and then after every other treatment.
