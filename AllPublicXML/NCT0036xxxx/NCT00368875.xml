      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given
      together with paclitaxel and bevacizumab and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with metastatic breast cancer and/or breast cancer that has recurred in the chest wall and
      cannot be removed by surgery. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Others interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Giving vorinostat together with paclitaxel and bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRiMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
      (vorinostat) in combination with weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab in patients with chest
      wall recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy (response
      rate, response duration, time to disease progression, time to treatment failure, and overall
      survival) and toxicity of oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (vorinostat) in combination
      with weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab in patients with chest wall recurrent or metastatic
      breast cancer. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether in vivo treatment with vorinostat induces a) acetylation of proteins
      including histone H3 and H4, b) ubiquitylation of proteins, and c) the levels of p21 and p27
      levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pre treatment vs. cycle 1 day 2 after 3
      VORINOSTAT doses but prior to paclitaxel.

      II. To determine whether in vivo treatment with vorinostat induces a) acetylation of proteins
      including histone H3 and H4, ubiquitylation of proteins, and c) the levels of Bim, Bak, tBID,
      p21 and p27 levels, as well as down regulate Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin in chest wall
      recurrent or metastatic breast cancer cells (pre treatment vs. cycle 1 day 2 after 3
      vorinostat doses but prior to paclitaxel).

      III. To determine whether in the primary breast cancer (and metastatic cancer if available)
      pretreatment levels of Her-2, Estrogen Receptor (ER)-alpha, Progesterone Receptor (PR), p21,
      p27, p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10 and SIRT2 levels predict for the response to
      treatment with VORINOSTAT plus paclitaxel.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, multicenter, dose-escalation study of vorinostat (SAHA) followed
      by a phase II, open-label study.

      Phase I: Patients receive oral SAHA twice daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17, paclitaxel IV
      over 1 hour on days 2, 9, and 16, and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 2 and 16.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The recommended phase II dose is defined as one
      dose level below the MTD.

      Phase II: Patients receive SAHA at the recommended phase II dose and paclitaxel and
      bevacizumab as in phase I.

          <title>Phase I + Phase II</title>
          <description>Phase I: Vorinostat dose (200 or 300 mg BID) was assigned at the time of registration. Vorinostat was administered orally twice daily on days 1–3, 8–10, and 15–17 of each 28-day cycle.
All patients also received paclitaxel at 90 mg/m2 as 1-hour infusion on days 2, 9, and 16 of every 28-day cycle. Bevacizumab was administered on day 2 and day 16 of the 28 day cycle at 10 mg/kg dose. Vorinostat dose escalation was carried out in the standard 3 + 3 phase I trial design based upon toxicity observed during the first cycle of therapy.
Phase II: Vorinostat was administered orally twice daily at the recommended phase II dose of 300 mg on days 1–3, 8–10, and 15–17 of each 28-day cycle.
All patients also received paclitaxel at 90 mg/m2 as 1-hour infusion on days 2, 9, and 16 of every 28-day cycle. Bevacizumab was administered on day 2 and day 16 of the 28 day cycle at 10 mg/kg dose.</description>

Vorinostat dose escalation was carried out in the standard 3 + 3 phase I trial design based upon toxicity observed during the first cycle of therapy.
Phase II: Vorinostat was administered orally twice daily at the recommended phase II dose of 300 mg on days 1–3, 8–10, and 15–17 of each 28-day cycle.
All patients also received paclitaxel at 90 mg/m2 as 1-hour infusion on days 2, 9, and 16 of every 28-day cycle. Bevacizumab was administered on day 2 and day 16 of the 28 day cycle at 10 mg/kg dose.</description>
