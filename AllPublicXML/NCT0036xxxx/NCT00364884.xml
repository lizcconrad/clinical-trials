  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keto-/amino acid supplemented low protein diet can reduce uremic symptoms, improve
      nutritional status, delay dialysis therapy and enhance health-related quality of life in our
      patients with stage V CKD in comparison to non-supplemented low protein diet.

      Fifty patients will be included into the study. The study comprises 9 visits. The treatment
      period covers 6 months, preceded by a 2-week screening period and a 1 month run-in period.
      Patients are required to visit the investigator two times before the start of active
      treatment.

      All patients who are qualified for this study will then be randomised by receiving their
      medication/introduction of dietary management using the standard simple randomization
      method.Group I patients will receive keto-/amino acid (Ketosteril) supplemented low protein
      diet during the active treatment period while Group II patients will receive non-supplemented
      low protein diet during the same period. The daily dose of keto-/amino acid for each Group I
      patient is one tablet every 5 kg body weight. The total daily dose will be divided into three
      times a day.
