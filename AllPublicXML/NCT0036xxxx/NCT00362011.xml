  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of Salvia hispanica L. Alba
      (Salba) to the conventional treatment for diabetes is associated with improvement in major
      and emerging cardiovascular risk factors in people with type 2 diabetes.

      Cohort studies have linked consumption of whole grain with a reduction in the risk of
      developing diabetes and heart disease. Grain of the plant Salvia hispanica alba (Salba)
      contain a high concentration of ω-3 fatty acids in addition to being a rich source of
      vegetable protein, fiber, calcium and antioxidants which have cardiovascular protective
      effect. To address the paucity of randomized, well-controlled clinical studies supporting the
      long-term cardioprotective benefits of whole grain we investigated the effects of a novel
      grain Salba in type 2 diabetes.

      Comparison(s): Participants on a conventional diabetes diet (50% carbohydrate, 20% protein,
      30% fat) receive either addition of Salba or matched control supplement for 12 weeks
      separated by a 4-week washout period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All men or postmenopausal women with Type 2 diabetes optimally or suboptimally
             controlled (HbA1C &lt; 9.0%) on oral hypoglycemic agents or diet only were asked to
             participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those receiving insulin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, or hormone replacement therapy,
             with BMI&gt;38 kg/m2, smoking or significant alcohol intake (&gt;2 drinks/day), serum TG
             &gt;4.0 mmol/L, and those with complications of diabetes were excluded. Subjects were
             also excluded if they regularly took fish oil and flax seed supplements or used
             steroids. Subjects were excluded during the course of the study if there were any
             changes to their regular antihypertensive, lipid, or oral hypoglycemic medications, if
             unable to consume &gt;50% of supplements provided, had a significant weight change
             (defined as &gt;2.5 kg), or if their level of physical activity did not remain constant
             over the course of the study.
