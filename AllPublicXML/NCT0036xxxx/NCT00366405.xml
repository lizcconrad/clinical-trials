  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes, amount of inflammation,
      endothelial cell loss, and the efficiency of a torsional handpiece compared to a conventional
      handpiece during surgery to remove your cataracts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the introduction of new phaco-emulsification systems, the cataract surgery has become a
      very safe procedure. The new machines combine fewer surges, lower amount of ultrasound and
      more controlled anterior chamber depth, as well as lower incidence of thermal burns of the
      incision site.1-4

      Alcon's Infiniti Vision System phacoemulsification machine includes now a torsional handpiece
      (OZiL™). The goal of OZiL™ is to minimize the surgery impact by reducing temperature
      increase, turbulence and incision stress. This handpiece has a sideways movement that does
      not repel the cataract during its extraction making the removal more continuous, maintains
      occlusion which facilitates vacuum build-up and reduces flow through the anterior chamber
      decreasing turbulence, therefore reducing the likelihood of lens particles damaging the
      corneal endothelial cells.

      The purpose of this study is to compare visual outcomes, induction of inflammation,
      endothelial cell loss and efficiency of the torsional handpiece vs. the conventional
      phacoemulsification handpiece when using the Alcon Infiniti Vision System.
