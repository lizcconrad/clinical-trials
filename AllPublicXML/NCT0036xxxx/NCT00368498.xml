  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the standard dosage of teicoplanin is
      adequate to produce timely the trough level &gt; 10 mg/L, which is considered to be effective in
      the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphyllococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our hospital, the minimum inhibitory concentration of 100 MRSA isolates in 2003 for
      teicoplanin is 2 mg/L. Due to its time-dependant bacteriocidal effect, the trough level
      should exceed 10 mg/L, particularly in the elderly, for MRSA bacteremia. However, it is known
      that standard dosage of teicoplanin often produces inadequate serum trough levels, and MRSA
      infections may recurred. Therefore, to evaluate the loading dose required to achieve
      therapeutic concentration timely, we compare the trough levels between those given standard
      dose (6 mg/Kg) and those given increasing loading dose (12 mg/Kg). We also monitor the
      occurrence of adverse drug effects and clinical response.
