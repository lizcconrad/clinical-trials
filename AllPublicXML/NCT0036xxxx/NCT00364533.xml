  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test in patients who have had hip replacement surgery the
      effectiveness (level of pain control) and the safety of 3 different dose levels of CG5503
      compared with placebo and with 10-mg oxycodone during the 72-hour double-blind period and to
      assess the safety of the drug for 9 days after patients completed the double blind period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing hip replacement often experience moderate to severe acute pain
      post-surgery. Normally such pain is controlled when patients receive repeated doses of opioid
      analgesics. However, opioid therapy is commonly associated with side effects such as nausea,
      vomiting, sedation, constipation, addiction, tolerance, and respiratory depression. CG5503, a
      newly synthesized drug also acts as a centrally acting pain reliever but has a dual mode of
      action. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness (level of pain control) and
      safety (side effects) of 3 dose levels of CG5503, in an immediate release, (IR) formulation,
      compared with no drug (placebo) or one dose level of oxycodone (an opioid commonly used to
      treat post-surgical pain). This study is a randomized, double-blind (neither investigator nor
      patient will know which treatment was received), active- and placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the treatment of acute pain from hip
      replacement surgery. The study will include a blinded 72 hour in-patient phase immediately
      following hip replacement surgery, during which patients will be treated with either 50-,
      75-, or 100-mg CG5503 base IR, a placebo, or 10-mg oxycodone, and pain relief will be
      periodically assessed. Following this phase, patients wishing to continue treatment with
      CG5503 IR may enter an outpatient voluntary nonrandomized, open-label extension phase for 9
      days during which they will receive 50- or 100-mg CG5503 IR. Assessments of pain relief
      include the pain intensity numeric rating scale (PI), pain relief numeric rating scale (PAR)
      and patient global impression of change scale (PGIC). Safety evaluations include monitoring
      of adverse events, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests. Venous blood samples
      will be collected for the determination of serum concentrations of CG5503 and oxycodone. The
      null hypothesis for the study is that efficacy results for all CG5503 IR dosage groups are
      equal to placebo based on the mean sum of pain intensity difference at 48 hours. The
      alternative study hypothesis is that at least 1 dose strength of CG5503 will be different
      from placebo in controlling pain at 48 hours. CG5503 base IR 50, or 75, or 100 mg, or
      oxycodone 10 mg, or placebo, 1 capsule taken by mouth every 4 to 6 hours during the 72 hour
      postsurgery phase of the study (one extra dose is allowed, if needed for pain); and CG5503,
      50 mg base capsules, 1 to 2 tablets taken by mouth every 4 to 6 hours for up to 9 days during
      the open label portion of the study. All doses of study treatment will be taken with
      approximately 120 mL of water with or with food.
