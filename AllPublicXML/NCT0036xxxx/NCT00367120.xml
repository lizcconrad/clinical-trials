    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients with Bacterial Sinusitis who will be treated with either Zmax
      (Azithromycin Extended Release) or Augmentin (Amoxicillin/Clavulanate). The purpose of the
      study is to compare early resolution of symptoms between the two treatments. Patients will
      report resolution of their sinusitis symptoms through a daily questionnaire. There will be
      two follow-up telephone interviews on days 12 and 28 to evaluate quality of life,
      satisfaction with therapy, and use of healthcare services.
