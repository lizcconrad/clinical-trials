    <textblock>
      The purpose of this current retrospective study is to perform follow-up analysis on the 22
      children from the study # 621-2004 It is important to examine whether an elevated biomarker
      of brain ischemia before and/or following cardiac surgery has any clinical or functional
      implications as the child ages.

      The N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor is unique to the brain. With brain injury or
      ischemia, fragments of the NMDA receptor (NR2) break off and appear in the bloodstream. These
      NR2 fragments generate an antibody response (NR2 ab) from the body. A recently developed
      blood test (CIS-Biotech, Inc) is able to measure these fragments (NR2) and the antibody (NR2
      ab) response. In adult patients who suffer from ischemic stroke, elevated blood levels of NR2
      ab correlate with the amount of brain damage on brain magnetic resonance imaging.

      The purpose of the past prospective study, “Blood Markers of Brain Injury from
      Cardiopulmonary Bypass and Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest in Infants and Children”,
      Emory #621-2004, was to observe the expression of blood markers of brain ischemia, NMDA
      receptor fragment (NR2) and antibody (NR2 ab) in infants with congenital heart disease before
      and after cardiac surgery.

      Our intent is to review hospital medical records, the cardiothoracic surgical database and
      neurological database at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta to assess their clinical and
      functional outcomes. We will review surgery information, clinic visits to Sibley Heart Center
      Cardiology, and echo, MRI and neurological testing results as well as mortality for these
      patients. No patient will be contacted. This retrospective study is important as a follow-up
      to the initial prospective pilot study as it will provide information regarding the clinical
      outcome of the patients.
