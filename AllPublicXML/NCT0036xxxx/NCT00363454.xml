    <textblock>
      Phase I dose escalation study of Triciribine Phosphate Monohydrate (TCN-PM) in patients with
      metastatic cancer whose tumors must be shown to be p-Akt positive. Study patients will be
      recruited from a Moffitt Cancer Center companion study (MCC-14474) &quot;Immunohistochemical study
      of phosphorylated Akt in solid malignancies.&quot;

      Each treatment cycle will consist of four weeks with TCN-PM being administered weekly (days
      1, 8 and 15 every 28 days). Labs, vital signs (BP, HR, Resp Rate, Temp), and hematology and
      serum chemistry profile are to be performed weekly and/or prior to each treatment dose. Body
      Surface Area (BSA) should be calculated approximately every 8 weeks. Imaging studies (CT/MRI
      of chest, abdomen, and pelvis) and tumor response assessments will be performed every eight
      weeks or more frequently if indicated. Unless unacceptable toxicity occurs, the duration of
      treatment will be based on tumor reassessment.

      Phase I dose escalation study of Triciribine Phosphate Monohydrate (TCN-PM) in patients with
      metastatic cancer. Study patients will be recruited from a companion study [MCC-14474
      &quot;Immunohistochemical study of phosphorylated Akt in solid malignancies&quot;], and potential
      subjects tumors' must be shown to be p-Akt positive.

      Pretreatment evaluations are chest roentgenogram (CXR) and CT/MRI scans of the sites of known
      disease, performance status, tumor biopsy, MUGA (EF only), and a pregnancy test. A CT/MRI
      scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis known sites of disease is required at baseline and an
      immunohistochemical (IHC) assay for determination of akt expression (positive) prior to study
      drug administration.

      Each treatment cycle will consist of four weeks with TCN-PM being administered weekly(days 1,
      8 and 15 every 28 days). Labs, vital signs (BP, HR, Resp Rate, Temp), and hematology and
      serum chemistry profile are to be performed weekly and/or prior to each treatment dose. Body
      Surface Area (BSA) should be calculated approximately every 8 weeks. Imaging studies (CT/MRI
      of chest, abdomen, and pelvis) and tumor response assessments will be performed every eight
      weeks or more frequently if indicated.

      Palliative and supportive care for other disease-related symptoms and for toxicity associated
      with treatment will be offered to all patients on this trial. Unless unacceptable toxicity
      occurs, the duration of treatment will be based on tumor reassessment done every eight weeks.
