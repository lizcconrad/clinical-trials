      lessons: introduction, caloric density of food, fats, vegetable and fruits, Whole grains and
      legumes, Healthy desserts . All the lessons will start with half an hour theoretical
      introduction, followed by a 2.5 hours &quot;hands on&quot; session under supervision of a medical chef.
      The study population will include women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. 72
      patients will be recruited and will be randomly divided into two groups: an intervention
      group of 36 will commence the workshop during 2007 and a control group of 36 who will take
      part in dietitian consulting sessions only.
