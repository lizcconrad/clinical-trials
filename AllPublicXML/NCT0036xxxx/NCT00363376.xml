      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      zonisamide therapy in the prevention of weight gain associated with olanzapine treatment for
      psychotic or bipolar disorders.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group, flexible-dose study in 60 outpatients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
      schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, psychotic disorder NOS, or bipolar disorder
      types I, II, or NOS by DSM-IV-TR criteria43 with a BMI &gt; 22 for whom treatment with
      olanzapine (5-20 mg/day) would be appropriate as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy. Subjects
      who meet entry criteria will be randomized to treatment with olanzapine plus zonisamide or
      olanzapine plus placebo. All subjects will receive Personal Wellness Solution Counseling
      (http://www.zyprexa.com/hcp/hcp_patient_c_solutions_print.jsp). Both before and after
      randomization to zonisamide or placebo, patients will not be permitted to have any other
      major psychotropic medications (antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, or
      anxiolytics) added to their medication regimens. The primary outcome measure will be change
      in weight. Secondary outcome measures will include the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS),44 the
      Inventory for Depressive Symptoms (IDS),45 the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale
      (PANSS),46 the Clinician Global Improvement (CGI) scale,47 the Binge Eating Scale (BES) 48,
      BMI, waist circumference, and metabolic variables (fasting lipids, glucose, insulin).

      Subjects will be inpatients or outpatients at the time of randomization to
      olanzapine-zonisamide or olanzapine-placebo. Throughout the study, psychiatric scales will be
      used to assess psychiatric symptoms, and the presence of treatment-emergent adverse events
      will be monitored and recorded.

    <description>Zonisamide will be administered at an initial dose of 100 mg/d for 7 days. Subsequently, zonisamide may be increased, based on clinical response and tolerability, by 100mg/d every 7 days to a maximum of 600 mg/d by the end of the sixth week of treatment. The maximum amount of zonisamide allowed during the study will be 600 mg/day. The minimum amount of zonisamide allowed during the study will be 100 mg/d. Zonisamide will initially be given as a single pm dose, but alterations in dosing will be permitted to reduce side effects (e.g., as BID dosing to reduce nausea).</description>
