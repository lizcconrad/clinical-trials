    <textblock>
      In patients known with migraine without aura a migraine headache or migraine like headache
      will be induced by infusion of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). The patients will then
      be stimulated with noxious heat via a thermode placed at the forehead. At the same time the
      Blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) response will be measured via functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), to estimate the central-nervous pain response. The regions of
      interest (ROI) will be thalamic region and medulla oblongata.

      Then the patients will be given pain relif in form of injection of sumatriptan and the effect
      of this will also be registered via measuring the BOLD response at the RIO's previously
      defined. A 3-Tesla MRI scanner will be used in this trail.

      This study will give us key knowledge of the trigeminal pain pathway and the central
      processing i.e sensitization during a migraine attach.
