  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CF
      trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CF is the most common inherited disease
      of Caucasians, with a carrier frequency of 1 in 25-30 individuals. Even with the impressive
      advances achieved in the understanding of the molecular basis and physiopathology of CF, it
      remains a life-threatening disorder that causes severe lung damage and nutritional
      deficiencies. It is generally accepted that early therapy could delay the progression of lung
      disease. A number of non-invasive methods are available to monitor disease activity in CF
      patients; however none of the currently used tools are able to monitor real-time events.
      Recently high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been used to monitor changes in lung
      structure. However, HRCT does not allow differentiating between acute and chronic lesions.
      Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) has already been used in
      a variety of settings to visualize inflammation or infection. FDG-PET imaging appears to be a
      promising new tool to quantify inflammation as it can detect clinically relevant changes even
      when no changes or minimal ones are detected by morphologic imaging. PET/CT may consequently
      be used to evaluate the severity of lung inflammation/infection in CF patients, and therefore
      the aim of this study is to evaluate the use of PET/CT for the assessment of the severity of
      lung inflammation/ infection in CF patients.

      Cystic fibrosis patients with active lung disease will undergo a high resolution
      PET-CT.PET/CT scans (GE ST Discovery PET/CT scanner) will be performed 60 to 90 minutes after
      injection of 5 MBq/kg of FDG. PET/CT will be repeated at the end of the treatment and
      compared with the results of the initial scan. PET and CT will be interpreted by a certified
      nuclear medicine physician and by a certified radiologist, respectively, blinded to clinical
      data, using the PET severity score (PSS), based on the number and the intensity of FDG uptake
      of lung foci. Intensity of uptake will be determined by calculating the mean value for the
      maximum standardized uptake values (MSUV) of all foci.

      (SUV = Activity concentration in ROI (region of interest) divided by injected dose / patient
      body weight). SUV will be measured in normal lungs to receive the normal baseline control for
      the calculations. The correlation with clinical data (FEV1% predicted) and sputum
      bacteriology will then be performed. Inflammation status will also be followed by cytokine
      analysis.
