      Patients with advanced esophageal cancer will receive thoracic radiation therapy 60Gy over 30
      fractions,and concurrent with s-1 and nedaplatin.

      Purpose: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of S-1 in
      combination with nedaplatin and thoracic radiotherapy in patients with advanced esophageal
      Cancer.

      Methods: Thoracic radiation therapy was administered in 2Gy fractions five times weekly to a
      total dose of 60 Gy.Concurrently, nedaplatin was given at a fixed dose of 75 mg/m2 on Days 1,
      and s-1 was given on Days 1-14,repeated every 4 weeks for four cycles. The dose of s-1 was
      initially 60 mg/m2/day and gradually increased to determine the MTD and RD of this regimen.
