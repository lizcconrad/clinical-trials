  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to estimate how many elderly people who have symptoms
      that look like influenza (i.e. an influenza-like illness) actually have the disease and how
      effective influenza vaccines are in preventing influenza in elderly people. The study will
      also examine the severity of the disease (e.g. how long are people ill, were there any
      complications) and how it affects everyday life (e.g. cost, medications, care by family
      members).
