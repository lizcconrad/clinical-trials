  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is permanently established by integrating a
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy into the human chromosome, a step also necessary to complete
      the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)replication cycle. Standard treatment of HIV infection
      suppresses Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)replication and has not been able to eliminate
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)from an infected person because of the integrated Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Raltegravir (RAL), the first approved antiretroviral (ARV) in a
      new class called integrase inhibitors, works by preventing integration of Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). For participants with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)who
      have never taken antiretroviral medications, this research study will test whether
      Raltegravir (RAL), a recommended first-line ARV, can eliminate Human Immunodeficiency Virus
      (HIV)from key immune system cells.

      This is a phase IV study comparing RAL to EFV ability to clear the HIV from mononuclear
      cells. Participants will be randomized 2:1 to either RAL plus co-formulated FTC/TDF or
      EFV/FTC/TDF (Atripla). The study will last a minimum of 24 weeks. Participants will come in
      three days before the weeks 4 and 24 visits to receive a subcutaneous injection of G-CSF, an
      FDA-approved medication that mobilizes certain cells. A minimum of 5 visits will be required
      after baseline for blood draws, safety monitoring, or G-CSF injections.
