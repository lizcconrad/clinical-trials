  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the incidence rate of Candida blood stream infection (candidemia)
      among people hospitalized in participating medical centers in Brazil, and will assess the
      antifungal drug susceptibility patterns of Candida clinical isolates. No hypotheses will be
      tested in the study. Candida blood stream isolates collected from people hospitalized for any
      reason during the study period will be sent to a core mycology laboratory for antifungal drug
      susceptibility testing. All people who develop candidemia while hospitalized will be
      considered participants in the study.

    <description>A candidemia case was defined as the first isolation of any Candida species from blood within a 30-day period during hospitalization. The incidence of candidemia was calculated as (number of participants / [number of total people hospitalized during the study period / 1000])</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Specific Candida Isolates Susceptible to Amphotericin B, Fluconazole, Voriconazole, Anidulafungin, and Caspofungin</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Candida bloodstream isolates were tested for susceptibility to antifungal drugs using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) microbroth dilution method with final readings recorded after 24 hours. The susceptibility cutoffs for antifungal drugs except amphotericin B were from the CLSI M27-S4 Reference Supplement (December 2012). The susceptibility cutoff for amphotericin B was obtained from the published literature.</description>
