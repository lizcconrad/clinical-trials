  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of mebendazole 500-mg
      chewable tablet formulation in a pediatric population. Mebendazole is a drug used for the
      treatment of soil-transmitted parasitic helminth (STH) (ie, parasitic worm) infections such
      as pinworm, whipworm, common roundworm, common hookworm, and American hookworm.

      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to study participant and
      investigator), single-center, single-dose, single-arm (ie, 1 treatment group) safety study.
      This study will consist of a screening visit on Day 1 at which time all study-related
      screening procedures will be performed. After all results are reviewed, children who meet all
      of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the
      open-label phase of the study. A single mebendazole 500-mg chewable tablet will be
      administered on Day 1 and the children will remain at the study site so that adverse events
      can be recorded at approximately 30 minutes postdose. Study participants will return to the
      study site 3 days (plus or minus 1 day) postdose at which time adverse events will be
      recorded again. Safety will be monitored during the study by assessing adverse events by
      direct observation at 30 minutes after dosing and at 3 days (plus or minus 1 day) after
      dosing, by direct observation of the study participant, report by the parent or guardian, or
      both. On Day 1, a single mebendazole 500-mg chewable tablet will be chewed and swallowed by
      each study participant. If desired, study participants will be allowed to drink water when
      administered study drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be an otherwise healthy child based on medical history, physical examination, vital
             signs, and concomitant medications and live in a high-prevalence area where parasite
             infection is endemic (ie, Prevalent in or peculiar to a particular locality, region,
             or people)

          -  Have teeth and be able to chew the mebendazole chewable tablet

          -  Girls must be premenarchal

          -  Parent(s)/guardians of study participants (or their legally-accepted representatives)
             must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand the
             purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to have their child
             participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history of clinically significant liver or renal insufficiency

          -  cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic
             (eg, anemia), rheumatologic, psychiatric, or metabolic disturbances that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, renders the candidate not suitable for mebendazole
             treatment

          -  Have a suspected massive intestinal parasitic infection, based on history and physical
             findings, as determined by the principal investigator

          -  Have any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the
             well-being of the study participant or the study or prevent the study participant from
             meeting or performing study requirements
