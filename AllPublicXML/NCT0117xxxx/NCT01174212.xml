      Subjects will be consented and then determined randomly whether they will receive antibiotics
      prior to their surgery or during their surgery. Each patient will have cultures taken before
      and during their surgery from the infected hip or knee. Results will be compared after
      completion of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is unknown whether giving pre-operative antibiotics affects the results of intraoperative
      bacterial cultures. This is an important question as antibiotics are often not given prior to
      surgery out of concern that accurate culture results will not be obtained. It is important to
      obtain accurate cultures so that targeted antibiotic therapy can be used. However, delaying
      the administration of antibiotics also delays the onset of treatment. Currently, the optimal
      course of action is unknown. The purpose of this study is to resolve this issue and determine
      if prophylactic antibiotics affect intra-operative culture results in patients undergoing
      revision hip or knee arthroplasty surgery for infection.

      This is a prospective randomized clinical study to determine if prophylactic antibiotics
      affect intra-operative culture results in patients undergoing revision hip or knee
      arthroplasty surgery for infection. Pre-operatively, patients will have their affected joint
      aspirated and this fluid will be sent for cultures. Patients are then randomized to receive
      prophylactic antibiotics (Vancomycin and Ancef) within one hour prior to surgery or to have
      pre-operative antibiotics withheld. Every patient then has their affected joint cultured
      intra-operatively. All samples will be evaluated for the presence of aerobic bacteria,
      anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungus. Pre-operative and post-operative cultures in
      both study populations are compared to determine the effects of pre-operative antibiotics.
