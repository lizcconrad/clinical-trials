  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The usual response to chemotherapy is decided through the image change by computed tomography
      (CT), which is taken at least 6-9 weeks.

      In order to predict the response to chemotherapy earlier, patients received FDG-PET scan at
      the first cycle of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was guided by the metabolic response by FDG-PET
      scan.

      Prospective, Open-label, Randomized phase II, single institution trial that compared
      chemotherapy guided by traditional evaluation based on RECIST versus chemotherapy guided by
      FDG-PET (metabolic) response.
