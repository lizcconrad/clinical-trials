  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It seems important to correlate real consumption in bioactives molecules of natural milk
      versus pasteurized with gut maturation in very preterm infants during small enteral feeding
      protocol. This objective will be reached through a clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      One hundred infants born between 28 and 30 weeks of gestational age will be enrolled in our
      clinical trial in two neonatal units of Marseille; they will receive small enteral feeding
      protocol with natural or pasteurized milk (according to the Neonatology Department). Infants
      monitoring will be conducted from birth until 32 weeks of gestational age through
      extra-uterine growth, dietary type evolution and determination of gut maturation markers
      levels in blood (Triglycerides and Cholesterol, PUFA, GLP-2, I and L-FABP, Gastrin,
      Citrullin) and faeces (Calprotectine). We will also look for new biological markers of
      intestinal growth, via metabolomic approach. Consumption of bioactives molecules (PUFA,
      sphingomyelin, sCD14, insulin, leptin, lactoferrin, sphingomyelinase acid and BSSL activity)
      will be quantified in milk 24h-representative samples received by each newborn. The benefits
      on digestive tract physiology evolution due to the molecules consumption will be observed
      from the 32nd week until the 36th week or the end of hospitalization.
