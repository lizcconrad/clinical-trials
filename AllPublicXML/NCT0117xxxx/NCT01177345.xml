  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer screening is a worldwide problem especially in the developing world of which
      Tanzania belongs. It is diagnosed late in the third world because there are no diagnostic
      facilities and resource people. It occurs in the age groups between 40 and above and
      therefore affects the productive age of the community. It is well known that women generally
      are the backbone of every community and specifically in the developing countries.

      The objective of this research is to analyze and quantify the burden of cervical cancer
      disease in the community. It will research the interpersonal and socioeconomic issues
      associated with cervical cancer disease in the family.
