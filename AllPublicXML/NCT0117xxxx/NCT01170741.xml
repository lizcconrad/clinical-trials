  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will draw from proven interventions to refine and pilot test a cue card driven
      computer-assisted intervention, along with HIV/STI testing, that will be tailored to each
      participant's demographic characteristics, risk behaviors, and biological test results. The
      specific aims of the proposed study are:

        1. To refine a cue card driven computer-assisted risk reduction intervention that will be
           tailored to each participant's demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnicity),
           risk behaviors, and biological test results (HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and
           herpes).

        2. To pilot test the tailored intervention's effects on sexual risk behaviors (e.g.,
           frequency of unprotected sex, condom use), drug use during sex and injection risk
           behaviors (e.g., direct syringe sharing, indirect sharing practices) using a two-group
           randomized design that compares the tailored intervention with a delayed treatment
           control condition.

        3. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the tailored intervention in a rural
           setting.

    <description>Participants assigned to the delayed treatment control condition will be offered biological testing and the tailored cue-card intervention upon completion of their 3- month follow-up interview. Use of a delayed treatment control group design will permit us to separate intervention effects on HIV risk behaviors from the general effects of participating in the study and completing a detailed HIV risk assessment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Tailored Cue Cards</intervention_name>
    <description>The proposed intervention uses education to increase knowledge and skill building to influence behavior-specific self-efficacy and outcome expectations. In addition to providing general information regarding drug use and diseases, the cue-cards include information that is designed to raise awareness regarding perceived threats (perceived susceptibility and perceived severity) related to HIV and other STIs and blood-borne infections, which increases motivation to reduce risk behaviors. The cue-cards also provide information regarding risk reduction strategies. The cue-cards also contain instructions on how to anticipate and avoid risky situations (e.g., using alcohol or drugs prior to sex). This information is augmented with an exercise that involves modeling and guided practice. This combination of information and exercises modifies outcome expectations by increasing confidence (i.e., perceived self-efficacy) that a protective action can be performed</description>
