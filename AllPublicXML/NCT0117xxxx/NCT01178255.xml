    <textblock>
      To assess the two components of individualized homeopathic treatment for acute depression,
      i.e., to investigate the specific effect of individualized Q-potencies versus placebo and to
      investigate the effect of different approaches to the homeopathic case history taking(defined
      in this study as case history taking type I and II).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Homeopathy is often sought by patients with depression. In classical homeopathy, the
      treatment consists of two main elements: the taking of the case history and the prescription
      of an individually selected homeopathic remedy. Homeopathic medicines are produced through
      sequential, agitated dilutions. A Q-Potency is prepared by grinding the raw material,
      followed by a process of consecutive 1:50.000 agitated dilutions.

      Previous data suggest that individualized homeopathic Q-potencies were non inferior to the
      antidepressant fluoxetine in a sample of patients with moderate to severe major depression.
      The question remains whether individualized homeopathic Q-potencies have a specific
      therapeutical effect in acute depression as this has not yet been investigated.
