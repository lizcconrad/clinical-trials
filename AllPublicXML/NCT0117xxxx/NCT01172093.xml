      OSA is prevalent among patients with type II DM
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been reported to be common (prevalence ranged from 23-86%)
      in previous studies involving Caucasian diabetic patients. The investigators aim at finding
      out the prevalence of OSA in Chinese diabetic patients and identify the clinical predictors
      associated with OSA.

      Recruited subjects will undergo overnight polysomnography, anthropometric measurements, blood
      tests including glycosylated hemoglobin, renal function, glucose level, blood pressure
      measurement both during the clinic visit and after admission for in-laboratory sleep study.
