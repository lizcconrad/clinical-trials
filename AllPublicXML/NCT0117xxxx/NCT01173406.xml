      The purpose of this study is to examine whether an education programme would enhance
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorders associated with excessive daytime
      sleepiness and cardiovascular disease. It is prevalent both in populations of western and
      eastern countries. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is an effective
      standard treatment and is widely prescribed for patients with OSA. However, the use of CPAP
      for such patients is disappointingly low. Low patient CPAP adherence limits the effectiveness
      of treatment. To determine whether there is a need for an extended education programme for
      the OSA patient in order to improve CPAP usage.
