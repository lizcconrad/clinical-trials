    <textblock>
      Nowadays, prostate cancer screening is largely widespread although it is not recommended yet.
      This screening includes primarily digital rectal examination and PSA.

      Recently, a new specific genetic marker of prostate cancer has been discovered. It is PCA-3
      gene.

      The main objective is to evaluate prospectively this new marker in patients treated for
      prostatic pathology (benign or malign) in the department.

      Nowadays, prostate cancer screening is largely widespread although it is not recommended yet.
      This screening includes primarily digital rectal examination and PSA.

      The main drawback is the poor PSA specificity. Prostate cancer diagnosis is only histologic
      diagnosis (mainly by prostate biopsies). However, prostate needle biopsies have a poor
      rentability and are negative in 60 to 80%. Recently, a new specific genetic marker of
      prostate cancer has been discovered. It is PCA-3 gene. This gene encodes for RNAm noncoding.
      So, RNA expression must be assayed by RT-PCR. The main objective is to evaluate prospectively
      this new marker in patients treated for prostatic pathology (benign or malign) in the
      department.

      PCA-3 assay will be made from urine specimens collected by vesical catheterism just before
      surgery. Moreover, the investigators will analyse expression of several prostatic markers
      (genes coding for androgen receptor and steroid alpha-reductase type 1 and 2). The main
      objective is to improve the prostate cancer diagnosis specificity. Gene expression will be
      assayed by RT-PCR.

      Prostatic cells in urine specimens will be confirmed by assay of PSA gene expression.
      Normalization of data will be performed using 3 housekeeping genes expression (ß-actin, K-a-1
      tubulin and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate).

      The originality of this clinical study compared to previous reports, consists to two
      elements. Firstly, all patients included in our study will be operated for a prostate cancer
      or a BPH. So, the risk to ignore a prostate cancer will be low unlike prostate biopsies made
      for a prostate cancer screening. Secondly, PCA-3 assay will be coupled with others prostatic
      specific markers.
