      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an established dialysis modality in patients with end stage renal
      disease (ESRD). However, there is growing awareness of the deleterious effect of high glucose
      content in PD solutions on the peritoneal membrane over time (1). Accordingly, development of
      new solutions to minimize glucose-induced toxicity and/or containing an alternative osmotic
      agent to glucose such as icodextrin and amino-acid were developed. Icodextrin is a mixture of
      high molecular weight, water soluble glucose polymers isolated by fractionation of hydrolyzed
      cornstarch (2). Unlike glucose which is absorbed from the peritoneal cavity primarily by
      diffusion across the peritoneal capillary endothelium, its absorption occurs mainly due to
      convective fluid movement out of the peritoneal cavity via the lymphatics (2). As a result,
      relatively constant osmotic pressure is created by icodextrin, thus it can provide sustained
      ultrafiltration during the long dwell.

      A number of studies have reported that icodextrin-based solution provides various clinical
      benefits compared with conventional glucose-based solutions (3-7). In particular, icodextrin
      has been successfully used in the fluid management of PD patients (4-5, 7). However,
      excessive ultrafiltration may induce underhydration, resulting in faster decline in residual
      renal function. This concern was first raised by Konings et al (8). In this study, a greater
      fall in residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was observed in patients using icodextrin
      compared to those using 1.36% glucose solution. In contrast, contradictory findings were also
      reported from the two studies indicating that residual renal function can be preserved by
      icodextrin solution (4, 9). Although the mechanisms are not clear, possible explanation
      includes the presence of high-molecular-weight icodextrin metabolites in plasma, which in
      turn may increase plasma oncotic pressure and hence preserve plasma volume and renal
      perfusion as suggested by Davies et al (10). Such discrepant findings may be explained by
      differences in study design, baseline fluid status, and other factors affecting residual
      renal function during the study. In the study by Konings et al (8), the comparative solution
      was 1.36% glucose, whereas 2.27% glucose was used in the study by Davies et al (4).
      Therefore, it can be speculated that volume status might differ depending on different
      concentration of glucose solution, thus leading to conflicting results. Also, these two prior
      studies are limited by residual renal function as secondary outcome, a short follow-up
      duration (4 mo vs. 6 mo), and small number of patients (32 vs. 50).

      To further explore the effects of icodextrin solution on residual renal function, the
      investigators will conduct a multicenter prospective randomized controlled open-label trial.
      Briefly, incident or prevalent adult CAPD patients with residual urine volume &gt; 750 ml will
      be included. Patients on APD will be excluded. After a 4-week screening period, patients will
      be randomly assigned to icodextrin or 2.5% glucose solution for the long dwell. Residual GFR
      and fluid status will be assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Residual GFR will be
      calculated as an average of urea and creatinine clearance from a 24-hour urine collection. To
      assess fluid status, the investigators will use three different assessment tools; 1)
      echocardiography for measuring intra vena cava (IVC) diameter and left ventricular end
      diastolic diameter, 2) measurement of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide, 3) bioimpedence
      analysis. Primary outcome is residual GFR change at 1-year and secondary outcome is change of
      fluid status during the study period. Also, biochemical laboratory data such as hemoglobin,
      hsCRP, plasma osmolality, and lipid profile, peritoneal equilibration test, dialysis
      adequacy, and daily peritoneal glucose exposure will be monitored. At least 50 subjects (a
      total of 100) would be required for each group to detect 50% difference of residual GFR
      between the two groups if type I error rate is 5% and type II error is 20% given 30% of
      drop-out rate during the study period.

      Preservation of residual renal function is of paramount importance because it is an
      independent risk factor of mortality in PD patients. In addition, achievement of adequate
      ultrafiltration is another crucial therapeutic goal to improve clinical outcomes in these
      patients. In this regard, if these two goals can be accomplished by icodextrin, it would be
      an ideal dialysis solution in PD practice. The investigators study will address this issue to
      answer the unresolved question on the effect of icodextrin on residual renal function.&quot;
