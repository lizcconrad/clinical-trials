      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the oral bioequivalence of the Mallinckrodt test
      fentanyl citrate oral transmucosal 400 mcg troche compared to Actiq 400 mcg (Cephalon, Inc.)
      under fasting conditions.

    <textblock>
      Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic with pharmacological effects similar to morphine. Fentanyl
      interacts predominately with the opioid µ-receptor. In clinical settings, fentanyl exerts its
      principal pharmacologic effects on the central nervous system. The fentanyl citrate oral
      transmucosal troche, Actiq (Cephalon, Inc.), is indicated only for the management of
      breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies who are already receiving and who are
      tolerant to prior therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain.

          -  Normal, healthy status confirmed by required screening assessments.

          -  Subjects must be able to provide written consent and agree to abide by the study
             requirements.

          -  Subjects must be able to demonstrate they understand and can perform the dosing
             procedure correctly using a placebo troche at check-in to Period 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If female, a positive pregnancy test at any time during the study, pregnant,
             lactating, or likely to become pregnant during the study.

             control within 30 days of dosing.

          -  History of conditions that might contraindicate or require caution be used in the
             administration of fentanyl or naltrexone, including: renal impairment, hepatobiliary
             or pancreatic disease, gastrointestinal obstruction, cardiac disease, obstructive
             pulmonary disease, acute or severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia, elevated
             intracranial pressure, depleted blood volume, paralytic ileus, or hypersensitivity or
             idiosyncratic reaction to fentanyl, naltrexone, or any opioids.

          -  History of any drug allergy, hypersensitivity, or intolerance which would compromise
             the safety of the subject or the study.

          -  History of chronic alcohol, drug, or narcotic abuse, chronic use of tranquilizers,

          -  Subjects presenting with acute illness.

          -  Administration of any other investigational drug during the 30 days prior to study
             entry.

             within 14 days prior to study entry, including that withdrawn during the conduct of
             any other clinical study.

          -  Positive test results for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

          -  Positive test results for drugs of abuse or alcohol.

          -  Any subject experiencing adverse events to the -13 and/or -1 hour doses of naltrexone,
             that in the investigator's opinion, are indicative of possible previous opioid
             use/abuse, or that would prevent tolerance of additional doses of naltrexone, will be
