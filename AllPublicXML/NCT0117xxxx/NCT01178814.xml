  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial of Revlimid for subjects who have a blood cell cancer called
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Cells in their marrow make proteins through messages that are
      carried from the genes. The amount of the message tells researchers if the protein it is
      going to make is high or low. This is known as expression of genes. The purpose of this study
      is to conduct a prospective trial testing the idea that expression of specific genes can help
      to predict which patients will respond to study drug administration with Revlimid
      (lenalidomide).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first Revlimid® study reported by List et al included all transfusion dependent MDS
      patients, but given the early experience which showed a better response in del(5q) patients
      and those with lower risk disease, more patients belonging to this category were entered on
      the trial. The subsequent multi-center studies were focused entirely on the low/Int-1
      patients who were transfusion dependent. In the present study, we would like to recapitulate
      the initial study by only treating the transfusion dependent, low and intermediate-1 risk MDS
      patients without deletion (5q). Since the predictive assay is most applicable for the
      non-del(5q) patients, and to avoid confusion resulting from an admixture of patients with
      del(5q) for whom the drug is already FDA approved, we have elected to restrict this clinical
      trial to only the non-del(5q) patients.

      In the present study, only the non-del(5q) transfusion dependent, low and intermediate-1 risk
      MDS patients will be treated with single agent Revlimid®. All patients will have their
      pre-therapy bone marrows studied by gene expression microarray, Luminex bead assay, and
      real-time PCR.

    <description>The trial will be testing the Revlimid® (lenalidomide) response signature in patients who have transfusion dependent, non-del(5q), low and intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in order to confirm the predictive value of the signature and to establish the boundaries of the z-score which can be used to pre-select patients in future clinical studies.</description>
