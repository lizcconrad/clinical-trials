      In this study feasibility of the MeDiNa concept is looked at, which means telemedical
      services for homely rehabilitation. With the help of microsystems technology, the relevant
      vital signs are measured at the patient`s home, then transmitted to the MeDiNa- Homebox-
      Tablet PC (by bluetooth) and then transferred into a central database, the MeDiNa eHealth-
      portal (by HSDPA, UMTS). These parameters can be continuously monitored by authorized network
      participants such as the family doctor or the patients themselves. In future, beyond cost
      advantages this will help to supervise risk patients or inspire patients to take more care of
      their health during homely rehab.

      Patients after myocard infarction who undergo homely rehab post stationary are divided into
      two groups of 10 patients each. The patients of group A undergo home monitoring for 4 weeks
      with the MeDiNa Homebox and afterwards 4 weeks without home monitoring. Group B starts vice
      versa, without home monitoring first and then undergoes home monitoring for 4 weeks (cross
      over,controlled intra-individually). During home monitoring with the MeDiNa Homebox patients
      measure vital parameters (weight, blood pressure, ECG (by chest strap including micro
      sensors), pulse and activity (also by chest strap including accelerometer) several times a
      day. The pseudonomized data which are transferred via the MeDiNa Homebox- Tablet PC to the
      MeDiNa eHealth Internet Portal (UMTS, HSDPA) to which the responsible authorized medicines
      will have access will be evaluated descriptively.
