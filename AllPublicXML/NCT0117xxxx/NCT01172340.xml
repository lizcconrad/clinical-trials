    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine if a culturally tailored diet and exercise intervention of 16
      weekly sessions with 8 weeks of followup phone support is effective in reducing waist
      circumference, weight, and related diet and exercise behaviors among women from underserved
      communities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity disproportionately impact economically disadvantaged and minority
      women. Overweight and obese women ages 25 to 50 are recruited from Census tracts with 25% or
      more residents living below poverty-level income. A skills-based intervention was designed
      with input from women in these communities gathered via focus groups and from a community
      advisory board. The intervention activities and strategies take into consideration the social
      and economic challenges of women with limited income, competing demands on their time and
      cultural beliefs about food preferences and body image.
