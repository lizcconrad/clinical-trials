    <description>The Virtue Male sling is a class II single use implantable sub-urethral, permanent, non-absorbable, support sling indicated for the surgical treatment of male stress urinary incontinence (SUI) resulting from intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD). The device consists of a knitted monofilament polypropylene mesh which provides surface area for supporting the bulbous urethra. The four arms are covered with polyethylene sleeves with braided polyester sutures attached at the end of the mesh arms providing proper attachment to the introducer for positioning of the sling. The single use introducer allows for implanting both the trans-obturator arms and pre-pubic arms of the mesh sling.</description>
