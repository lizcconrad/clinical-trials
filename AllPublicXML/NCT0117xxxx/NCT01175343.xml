      This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well RO4929097 works in treating
      patients with recurrent and/or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer,
      or primary peritoneal cancer. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumor activity of RO4929097 in recurrent and / or metastatic epithelial
      ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer by progression free
      survival rate at the end of 4 cycles.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumor activity of RO4929097 through secondary endpoints including:
      overall response rate and CA125 response rate (GCIC criteria).

      II. To assess the safety of single agent RO4929097 in advanced platinum resistant ovarian,
      fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers.

      III. To explore expression of Notch biomarkers in advanced platinum resistant ovarian,
      fallopian, and primary peritoneal cancers.

      IV. To explore the impact of RO49097 on ascitic fluid circulating tumor cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and
      15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood and tumor tissue samples are collected for correlative studies. Ascitic fluid may also
      be collected.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every month for at least 1 year.

    <time_frame>84 days (4 courses)</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the proportion of the study population that has not had tumor progression (symptomatic, RECIST progression, CA-125 progression) or died at the completion of the cycle four mark.
RECIST criteria for progressive disease (PD) in target lesions: &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. In non-target lesions: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
CA-125 PD is based on the progressive serial elevation of serum CA-125 according to:
A) elevated CA-125 pretreatment &amp; normalization of CA-125 or C) CA-125 in normal range pretreatment: CA-125 &gt;= 2x ULN on 2 occasions.
B) elevated CA-125 pretreatment that never normalizes: CA-125 &gt;= 2x nadir value on 2 occasions</description>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from start of treatment to time of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).
Evaluation of Target Lesions:
Complete response (CR) - disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial response (PR) - at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions:
Complete response (CR) - disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (&lt;10 mm short axis).</description>

             hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled psychotic disorders,
             serious infections, active peptic ulcer disease, psychiatric illness, or any other
             medical conditions that might be aggravated by treatment or limit compliance

          -  Currently no active, second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers

               -  NOTE: Patients are not considered to have a &quot;current active&quot; malignancy if they
                  have completed anti-cancer therapy and are considered by their physician to be at
                  less than 30% risk of relapse

          -  Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial

          -  The effects of RO4929097on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because Notch signal pathway inhibitors are
             known to cause interruption of the embryonic signaling pathway and may lead to serious
             or life-threatening birth defects, including brain deformities, facial malformation,
             heart problems, or abnormal organs; if women of childbearing potential do not abstain*
             from sexual activity they must use two forms of contraception (i.e., barrier
             contraception and one other method of contraception) at least 4 weeks prior to study
             entry; women of childbearing potential can either be abstinent or use two forms of
             contraception for the duration of study participation and for at least 12 months
             post-treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is
             participating in this study and for 12 months after study participation, the patient
             should inform the treating physician immediately

               -  Abstinent from sexual activity at least 4 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Pregnancy Testing: Women of childbearing potential are required to have a
                  negative serum pregnancy test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within
                  10-14 days and within 24 hours prior to the first dose of RO4929097 (serum or
                  urine); a pregnancy test (serum or urine) will be administered every 4 weeks if
                  their menstrual cycles are regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular
                  while on study within the 24-hour period prior to the administration of
                  RO4929097; a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test;
                  prior to dispensing RO4929097, the investigator or clinical staff must confirm
                  and document the patient's use of two contraceptive methods or abstinence, dates
                  of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's understanding of the
                  potential of RO4929097 to cause serious or life-threatening birth defects

               -  Female patients of childbearing potential are defined as follows:

                    -  Patients with regular menses

                    -  Patients, after menarche with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a
                       contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding

                    -  Women who have had tubal ligation

               -  Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the
                  following reasons:

                    -  The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral
                       salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy

                    -  The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period)
                       for 24 consecutive months

                    -  Pre-pubertal females; the parent or guardian of young female patients who
                       have not yet started menstruation should verify that menstruation has not
                       begun; if a young female patient reaches menarche during the study, then she
                       is to be considered as a woman of childbearing potential from that time
                       forward

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to RO4929097 or other agents used in the study

          -  Patients taking medications with narrow therapeutic indices that are metabolized by
             cytochrome P450 (CYP450), including warfarin sodium (Coumadin ®) are ineligible

          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity; caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 concurrently
             with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; patients who are taking
             concurrent medications that are strong inducers, inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4
             should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk; if such
             patients cannot be switched to alternative medications, they will be ineligible to
             participate in this study

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome, bowel obstruction, or other condition that would
             interfere with intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets

          -  Patients who are serologically positive for Hepatitis A, B or C, or have a history of
             liver disease, other forms of hepatitis or cirrhosis are ineligible

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia,
             hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the
             institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia other than chronic, stable atrial fibrillation, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RO4929097 is a Notch pathway
             inhibiting agent with the potential for serious or life-threatening birth defects or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with RO4929097,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with RO4929097; these
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RO4929097; in addition,
             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Cardiovascular (within 7 days prior to start of study treatment): baseline QTc &gt; 470
             msec (female), QTc &gt; 450 msec (male)

               -  History of risk factors for QT interval prolongation, including, but not limited
                  to family or personal history of long QT syndrome, recurrent syncope without
                  known etiology or sudden unexpected death

               -  History of torsade de pointes or other significant cardiac arrhythmias or the
                  need for concomitant meds with known potential to prolong QT interval or
                  antiarrhythmics

        <title>Four Cycle Progression-free Survival Rate</title>
        <description>Defined as the proportion of the study population that has not had tumor progression (symptomatic, RECIST progression, CA-125 progression) or died at the completion of the cycle four mark.
RECIST criteria for progressive disease (PD) in target lesions: &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. In non-target lesions: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
CA-125 PD is based on the progressive serial elevation of serum CA-125 according to:
A) elevated CA-125 pretreatment &amp; normalization of CA-125 or C) CA-125 in normal range pretreatment: CA-125 &gt;= 2x ULN on 2 occasions.
B) elevated CA-125 pretreatment that never normalizes: CA-125 &gt;= 2x nadir value on 2 occasions</description>

        <description>An exploratory analysis for potential predictive biomarkers was performed on archival, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue for components of the Notch Pathway: Jagged-1 and NICD. The percentage of positive cells were scored into four categories: 0 (0%), 1 (1-33%), 2 (34-66%), and 3 (67-100%). The product of the intensity and percentage scores was used as the final score and classified as negative (0-4) or positive (5-9).</description>
