    <textblock>
      Remote limb ischemic preconditioning is neuro-protective and anti-inflammatory for ischemia-
      reperfusion injury. As the extent of its effect is unknown, the investigators will use
      clinical outcome, serum biochemical markers and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
      (DW-MRI)to determine the extent of its neuro-protective and anti-inflammatory effect.

      BACKGROUND: Brain ischemia and injury contributed to perioperative morbidity and mortality in
      Carotid Artery Stenting. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon whereby brief
      periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion in one organ provide systemic protection from
      prolonged ischemia. To investigate whether remote preconditioning protects the brain injury
      in patients undergoing elective Carotid Artery Stenting, a randomized trial will be performed
      in current study.

      DESIGNING 60 patients will be randomized to Carotid Artery Stenting with RIPC group or
      conventional Carotid Artery Stenting group (control). RIPC consisted of five 5-min cycles of
      right upper arm ischemia/reperfusion, which was induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed
      on the right upper arm which was inflated to 200 mmHg for 5mins followed by deflating the
      cuff for 5mins. Cerebral injury was assessed by S-100b, NSE, hs-CRP and MMSE test in
      different time points.
