  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the adequate dose of intrathecal hydromorphone
      injection for postoperative pain relief after knee arthroscopic surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients who were undergoing unilateral knee arthroscopy randomly received unilateral
      spinal anesthesia with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 6 mg combined with normal saline 0.05 mL
      or hydromorphone 2.5, 5 or, 10 μg/0.05 mL. The verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) pain
      scores were measured at 30 minutes and 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours postoperatively, and the side
      effects of hydromorphone were recorded.
