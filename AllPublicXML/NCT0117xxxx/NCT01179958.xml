  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise leads improved
      cognitive function accompanied by increases in gray matter density and changes in functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns of task-related activation.

    <textblock>
      While animal and human studies indicate cognitive benefits from aerobic exercise across the
      lifespan, the great majority of controlled exercise studies in humans have been restricted to
      elderly individuals. Those studies have indicated that enhancing aerobic capacity has a
      beneficial effect on cognition. One study suggests that this benefit is seen particularly for
      executive control processes, precisely the processes affected by aging. These improvements
      have been accompanied by increases in gray matter density and changes in functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns of task-related activation. The goal of the proposed study
      is to extend the investigation of the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise to younger
      individuals, and to compare these effects in young and old.

      In this application the study team propose to conduct a study in which 270 sedentary but
      otherwise healthy and cognitively intact individuals in the 20-68 year age range are
      randomized to two training conditions, aerobic exercise and stretching/toning, to be
      completed at YMCAs and YMHAs in New York City. Participants will be assessed for aerobic
      capacity, cognitive task performance, and by structural MRI, resting cerebral blood flow
      scans (arterial spin labeling) and cognitive activation fMRI studies at study entry and after
      6 months of training.

      The study also proposes two complementary approaches to investigating the neural correlates
      of the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise on cognition: 1) imaging -- a combination of
      structural, metabolic, and cognitive activation fMRI studies to evaluate the neural
      substrates of the effect of aerobic exercise on cognition will be used. 2) important
      correlates -- the effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, inflammatory markers and
      cognitive reserve on the cognitive effects of aerobic exercise will be explored.
