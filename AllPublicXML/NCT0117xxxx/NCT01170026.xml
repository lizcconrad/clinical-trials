      This application will provide a test of one potential model for adding substance use
      assessment and brief intervention into a truancy court program. The primary goal of this
      study is to determine whether a motivational intervention will reduce substance use among
      adolescents referred to truancy court for school attendance problems. In this treatment
      development application, an open trial with 20 families referred by truancy court will first
      be conducted. This trial will be used to adapt an existing motivational intervention to
      include material relevant to school attendance and performance. Then 100 families
      participating in the Rhode Island Truancy Court Program with adolescents between the ages of
      13-16 years who report using substances will be randomly assigned to receive the experimental
      intervention plus standard truancy court procedures or psychoeducation plus standard truancy
      court procedures. The 2-session intervention protocol consists of an individual motivational
      interview plus the Family Check-Up (Dishion &amp; Kavanagh, 2003), a family based motivational
      interview. The experimental protocol provides a thorough assessment of both individual and
      family strengths and weaknesses with respect to substance use prevention and school
      attendance/performance. Follow-up interviews will be conducted at 3 and 6 months.
