  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM)belong to a group of
      inflammatory muscle disorders, of unknown cause, that are characterised by skeletal muscle
      inflammation and progressive muscular weakness, which can be debilitating and chronic in
      nature (occasionally fatal).

      The current treatment options for these conditions are steroids and various other
      immunosuppressive drugs. However, these are usually only partially effective at reducing
      symptoms, and their toxic side effects also limit their usefulness. In order to develop more
      specific treatments for myositis in the future (and therefore more effective), it is
      important to understand the exact mechanisms that cause the disease in the first instance. In
      other similar inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus
      (SLE), it is known that changes to the Human Leukocyte Antigen(HLA), as well as certain
      inflammatory cytokines, are involved in both the development and expression of the disease.

      As many of the inflammatory mechanisms that cause damage in PM, DM and IBM are similar to
      those in RA and SLE, it seems likely that similar genetic factors will also be involved in
      the development and expression of PM, DM and IBM.

      In order to understand the genetic aspects / causes of myositis, and ultimately develop more
      effective treatment therapies in the future, patients with PM, DM or IBM, will be asked to
      give 20 mls of blood. These blood samples, along with the patient's clinical details, will
      then be sent to the Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research (CIGMR), at The University
      of Manchester, where all of the genetic analyses will take place. By understanding the
      genetic cause of the disease, it should be possible to design specific drugs for treating the
      condition in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to understand the genetic aspects / causes of myositis, and ultimately develop more
      effective treatment therapies, it will be necessary to collect blood samples and clinical
      details from around 1000 patients with myositis. As the condition is very rare, it will not
      be possible to get the required number of patients from one centre alone, and therefore, a
      collaborative, multicentred approach will be needed. Consultant rheumatologists and
      neurologists throughout the UK, who have patients with PM, DM or IBM, will be approached, and
      asked if they would like to officially enter into the myositis genomic multicentred study.
      Once ethical and R&amp;D approval has been granted, consultants will be named as the 'Principal
      Investigators' at each of these 'research sites' and could then start to recruit suitable
      patients into the study.

      Patients from each research site, with definite PM, DM or IBM, will be asked by their own
      consultants (Principal Investigator) to give 20 mls of blood via venepuncture for genetic and
      antibody analysis. The PI will also complete a clinical/laboratory proforma, for each
      patient, regarding their disease characteristics, to allow subsequent confirmation that
      patients' disease is indeed definite, and this proforma and the blood sample will be sent to
      CIGMR. All of the genetic analyses, will take place at CIGMR, but storage of clinical details
      and certain patient identifiers will be stored at SRFT on a password protected NHS tust
      computer.

      This study will be coâˆ’ordinated by Dr RG Cooper through the Rheumatic Diseases Centre,
      Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust (SRFT), and Professor Bill Ollier from the Centre for
      Integrated Genomic Medical Research unit (CIGMR), Stopford Building, Manchester University.

        Potential participants will be identified at their routine attendance of myositis clinics
        at participating centres, by the study PI. Before recruitment, each prospective candidate
        will be given a full explanation of the study, provided with a patient information sheet
        (PIS) and consent form to read, and given the opportunity to ask any questions that may
        arise. Once all questions have been answered and the Principal Investigator is assured that
        the individual understands what is required, informed consent can then be sought.
