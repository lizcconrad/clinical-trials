  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that parent(s)/Legally Acceptable
             Representative(s) [LAR(s)] can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol
             (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits).

          -  A male or female between, and including:

               -  8 and 11 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination for subjects in the
                  &lt;6S and &lt;6NS groups or

               -  7 and 11 months at the time of the first vaccination for subjects in the 7-11S
                  and 7-11NS groups or

               -  12 and 23 months at the time of first vaccination for subjects in the 12-23S and
                  12-23NS groups (Note the second dose should be administered at 23 Months of age
                  at the latest to allow, if needed, compliance with the National Recommendations
                  on administration of the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine in
                  children with SCD as of 24 months of age).

          -  Written informed consent, signed or thumb printed, obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s)
             of the subject. Where parent(s)/LAR(s) are illiterate, the consent form will be
             countersigned by a witness.

        Additional inclusion criteria for children with SCD (&lt;6S, 7-11S and 12-23S groups):

          -  Children with diagnosis of sickle cell disease [homozygous sickle cell disease
             (hemoglobin SS disease), double heterozygous sickle hemoglobin C disease (hemoglobin
             SC disease) and the sickle ß-thalassemias] and confirmed hemoglobin status by
             hemoglobin chromatography and electrophoresis (&lt;6S group) or electrophoresis (7-11S
             and 12-23S groups).

          -  Free of any other known or suspected health problems (as established by medical
             history and clinical examination before entering into the study), that would
             contraindicate the initiation of routine immunizations outside a clinical trial
             context

        Additional inclusion criteria for healthy children (&lt;6NS, 7-11NS and 12-23NS groups):

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Children with negative diagnosis of sickle cell disease and confirmed hemoglobin
             status by hemoglobin chromatography and/or electrophoresis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned
             use during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs since birth. For corticosteroids, this will mean
             prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             during the period starting from 30 days before each dose of study vaccines and ending
             30 days after. Locally recommended vaccines (recommended through the EPI program or
             through national immunization campaigns) for example inactivated influenza vaccine are
             always allowed, even if concomitantly administered with the study vaccines, but should
             be documented in the eCRF.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  Previous vaccination or planned vaccination during the study with any pneumococcal
             vacccine.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine(s).

          -  Major congenital malformations.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned
             administration during the study period.

          -  Birth weight below 1500g.

          -  Serious chronic illness other than SCD.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C on oral, axillary or tympanic setting,
                  or ≥ 38.0°C on rectal setting. The preferred route for recording temperature in
                  this study will be tympanic.

               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory
                  infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.

        Additional exclusion criteria for children with SCD (&lt;6S, 7-11S and 12-23S groups):

        • Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, (including
        human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection) other than SCD related conditions, based on
        medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

        Additional exclusion criteria for healthy children (&lt;6 NS, 7-11NS and 12-23NS groups):

        • Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
        human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on medical history and physical
        examination (no laboratory testing required).
