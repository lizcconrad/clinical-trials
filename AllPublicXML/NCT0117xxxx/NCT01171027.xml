      This study is designed to be a United States multicenter prospective randomized controlled
      non-inferiority evaluation of transgastric and transvaginal Natural Orifice Translumenal
      Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) cholecystectomy compared to laparoscopic cholecystectomy in
      elective surgery patients. Up to 200 patients will be enrolled to obtain 70 NOTES
      cholecystectomies (35 transgastric and 35 transvaginal) and 70 laparoscopic cholecystectomies
      on a randomized basis. In order to evaluate the hypothesis that NOTES cholecystectomy has
      equivalent safety and efficacy to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, clinical and administrative
      outcomes will be measured.

      Primary To assess the safety and efficacy of transgastric and transvaginal cholecystectomy
      compared to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      To assess pain associated with transgastric and transvaginal cholecystectomy compared to
      conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Secondary To assess cosmesis associated with transgastric and transvaginal cholecystectomy
      compared to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      To assess objective operative cost and logistical comparisons between transgastric and
      transvaginal cholecystectomy compared to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      To identify unforeseen barriers to transgastric or transvaginal surgery adoption.

    <description>The transvaginal NOTES approach is accomplished by performing a posterior colpotomy. Instead of a conventional laparoscope, a flexible endoscope is used in order to provide working channels and visualization. The gallbladder is removed through the vaginal incision. The transgastric cholecystectomy requires the flexible endoscope to be placed orally. A gastrotomy is made through the stomach wall allowing the flexible endoscope to pass into the abdominal cavity. The gallbladder is removed from the abdominal cavity into the stomach and ultimately out the mouth. The goal of NOTES is to develop further so either of these approaches will not require any incisions in the abdominal wall.</description>

    <description>This technique utilizes the introduction of a laparoscope through a 1 cm incision in the fascia in or around umbilicus. Usually three additional 0.5- 1.0 cm incisions are employed for surgical instrumentation. Once separated from its attachments, the gallbladder is usually removed through the umbilical port. Sutures are used to close the larger port sites. The most devastating complication is injury to the major bile ducts which is avoided to the extent possible (incidence .2 to less than .01%)5 by careful visualization of the ductal structures.</description>
