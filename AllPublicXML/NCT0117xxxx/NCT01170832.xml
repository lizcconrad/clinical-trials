  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will test if, in patients with type 1 diabetes, wide blood glucose fluctuations
      lead to the injury to heart nerves , called cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN), and to
      impaired heart contractile (pumping) function and heart failure. It will also evaluate the
      natural history of heart failure and enhanced cardiac risk in patients with type 1 diabetes
      in the current standard of diabetes care.

    <description>Evaluation of heart rate variability and 24 hour blood pressure monitoring: electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure will be recorded while resting in a lying down position and during certain controlled procedures that include deep breathing and other clinical maneuvers such as standing up and exhaling deeply.</description>

    <description>Subjects will have a heart positron emission tomography (PET) scan, using a radioisotope called [11C] hydroxyl-ephedrine (HED). This type of heart PET scan allows mapping the heart nerves. You will also have another scan with a radioisotope called [11C]-acetate which will help us measure the metabolism of your heart and how efficiently it contracts.</description>

             are free of complications and age-and-sex-matched healthy control volunteers.

          -  Hemoglobin A1c greater than 7 %. (For Type 1 diabetics)

          -  If you are a woman of childbearing potential you must agree to use an acceptable birth
             control method throughout the duration of the study. The methods of birth control that
             you can use are: Oral contraceptives (birth control pill), IUD or a barrier method
             (e.g. diaphragm or condom with spermicide).

          -  You should have no history of any cardiovascular disease including any form of
             coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, known arrhythmias (irregular heart
             beats), valvular disease or high blood pressure.

          -  If you have any pacemaker or ICD, if you have any metallic foreign body such as
             surgical implants or clips or foreign bodies in the eye or orbits, wearing medication
             patches containing foil, or any other metal in the body or if you are claustrophobic
             you cannot participate in this study.

          -  You should be free of any diabetic complications (e.g. nephropathy or kidney damage,
             retinopathy or eye damage), have no history of previous kidney, pancreas or cardiac
             transplantation, any other severe chronic illness that has neuropathy (numbness,
             burning or tingling) and/or neurologic disease as a recognized complication (e.g.
             Parkinson's disease, epilepsy), or any other serious medical conditions that may
             shorten life span (e.g. disabling stroke, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease).

          -  You should be free of any malignancy other than basal cell skin cancer.

          -  No history of alcohol abuse.

          -  You should not use any agents or drugs that interfere with the imaging techniques
             described below.

          -  You must be able to cooperate with the test protocols that are described below and be
             willing to sign this consent form.

        Inclusion for Control group:

          -  BMI &lt;30

          -  If female, must not be pregnant or nursing

          -  Normal blood pressure

          -  Normal labs-(glucose and lipids)
