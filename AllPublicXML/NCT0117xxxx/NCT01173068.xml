    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the outcomes when using ertapenem for complicated
      urinary tract infections in the OPAt setting.

      The study hypothesis: Ertapenem is an efficacious and safe therapeutic option for complicated
      urinary tract infections in the OPAt setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enterobactericae spp. is a common cause of urinary tract infections. The prevalence of
      quinolone-resistance in Enterobactericae is rising and often co-exists with expression of
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL, limiting viable outpatient therapeutics options.

      In Singapore, there is an increasing trend of treating patients who respond favourably to
      initial antimicrobial therapy in the outpatient setting (Fisher, et.al, 2006). Ertapenem is
      one of several agents with excellent antimicrobial activity against Enterobactericae
      (including ESBL producers). In view of its safety profile and its viability in elastromeric
      pump, it has great potential to be used in OPAT patients.

      There is no study analyzing outcomes in a large cohort of patients with complicated urinary
      tract infections treated with ertapenem.
