  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Clinical Evaluation is a continuation in the assessment of the
      performance of the XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (XIENCE V® EECSS) in
      the treatment of patients with de novo coronary artery lesions in patients (Diabetic
      sub-study).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SPIRIT V Clinical Evaluation consists of two concurrent studies,the Diabetic sub-study
      and the Registry.

      The SPIRIT V Diabetic sub-study is a prospective, randomized, active-controlled, single
      blind, parallel two-arm multi-center study comparing the XIENCE V® EECSS to the TAXUS®
      Liberté™ in the treatment of diabetic patients with coronary artery lesions who will fulfill
      the eligibility criteria. Approximately 300 patients will be randomized (2:1) against the
      TAXUS® Liberté™ coronary stent system. These patients will be recruited in up to 40 selected
      sites.

      The long term safety and efficacy of the XIENCE V EECSS have been demonstrated in the SPIRIT
      FIRST trial up to 5 years, the SPIRIT II trial up to 4 years, and in the SPIRIT III
      Randomized Control Trial (RCT) up to 3 years. In addition, these pre-approval studies have
      shown low rates of Target Vessel Failure and Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) that were
      observed to plateau or gradually decline after about 1 year and were consistently lower than
      the comparator arm of each study. This benefit in MACE is sustained for up to 5 years and is
      also independent of the first year results.

      The post approval SPIRIT V study demonstrated that the use of the XIENCE EECSS in complex
      lesions in a real-world population resulted in 1 year MACE, Stent Thrombosis and Target
      Lesion Revascularization rates that are comparable to those of the previously mentioned
      pre-approval studies which included patients with more restricted inclusion / exclusion
      criteria.

      Therefore, based on existing data from these trials, Abbott Vascular has decided to
      discontinue further follow up in the SPIRIT V Diabetic study after 1 year.

      <recruitment_details>324 subjects were recruited at 32 sites. Eligible subjects invited to participate, in-hospital or in-clinic and required to provide signed informed consent prior to enrollment. Final eligibility based on angiographic inclusion criteria prior to the intended procedure. Dates of recruitment: April 28, 2007 to October 6, 2008.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were randomized via telephone randomization and stratified by insulin treatment status, number of lesions treated-single vs. multiple. Randomization only occurred after verification of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and successful pre-dilatation. See the Eligibility Criteria (inclusion/exclusion criteria) for details.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>This number represents the average of percent diameter stenosis found on examination of all the lesions analyzed.
This value calculated as 100 * (1 - MLD/RVD) using the mean values from two orthogonal views (when possible) by QCA.</description>
          <population>Analysis based on intention to treat (ITT) population. Patients were required to have angiographic follow-up to provide this endpoint information. Some patients not completing the study, did not have this follow up. The number of analyzed represents number of patients randomized.</population>

Stent thrombosis was defined according to the ARC guidelines as follows: definite: acute coronary syndrome and angiographic or pathological confirmation of stent thrombosis; probable: unexplained death ≤30 days or any MI that is related to acute ischemia in the territory of the implanted stent without angiographic confirmation of stent thrombosis; and possible: unexplained death &gt;30 days after stent placement.</description>

        <description>TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel performed for restenosis or other complication of the target lesion. The target lesion was defined as the treated segment from 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the stent.
TVR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass of any segment of the target vessel. The target vessel was defined as the entire major coronary vessel proximal and distal to the target lesion, including upstream and downstream branches and the target lesion itself.
A revascularization is considered clinically indicated if angiography at follow-up shows a %DS ≥ 50% and if one of the following occurs: history of recurrent angina pectoris due to the target vessel; signs of ischemia at rest or during exercise test due to target vessel; abnormal results of any invasive diagnostic test; TLR or TVR with a % DS ≥ 70% even in the absence of the above mentioned ischemic signs.</description>

        <description>TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel performed for restenosis or other complication of the target lesion. The target lesion was defined as the treated segment from 5 mm proximal and 5 mm distal to the stent.
TVR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass of any segment of the target vessel. The target vessel was defined as the entire major coronary vessel proximal and distal to the target lesion, including upstream and downstream branches and the target lesion itself.
A revascularization is considered clinically indicated if angiography at follow-up shows a %DS ≥ 50% and if one of the following occurs: history of recurrent angina pectoris due to the target vessel; signs of ischemia at rest or during exercise test due to target vessel; abnormal results of any invasive diagnostic test; TLR or TVR with a % DS ≥ 70% even in the absence of the above mentioned ischemic signs.</description>

        <title>Adjudicated Composite Endpoint of All Death, MI and Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR)</title>
        <description>Death defined by the Academic Research Consortium is as follows: All death is considered to be cardiac death unless an unequivocal noncardiac cause can be established. Specifically, any unexpected death even in patients with coexisting potentially fatal noncardiac disease (eg, cancer, infection) should be classified as cardiac.
Myocardial infarction: Myocardial Infarction Classification and Criteria for Diagnosis as defined by the Academic Research Consortium.
Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR): Target vessel revascularization is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass of any segment of the target vessel. The target vessel is defined as the entire major coronary vessel proximal and distal to the target lesion, which includes upstream and downstream branches and the target lesion itself.</description>
