  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The leakage of oropharyngeal secretions around high-volume low-pressure tracheal tube cuffs
      is usually considered as a major risk factor for bacterial tracheal colonization and
      subsequent development of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The rate of leakage around the
      cuff is related to the pressure differential across the cuff, namely the difference between
      the pressure of the subglottic fluid above the cuff and the tracheal pressure under the cuff.
      Consequently, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improves the sealing around the cuff
      towards fluid leakage. However, this preventive effect of PEEP is compromised during
      prolonged mechanical ventilation by tracheal suctioning manoeuvre, which may enhance fluid
      leakage, by decreasing tracheal pressure. Indeed, in a benchtop model, a suctioning
      manoeuvre, without disconnection of the ventilator, induced a constant fluid leakage past a
      high-volume low-pressure tracheal tube cuff when performed with a high level of suction
      pressure (- 400 mbar) and a large size of suction catheter size (16 French).

    <time_frame>48 hours after the beginning of the mechanical ventilation</time_frame>
    <description>The cuff pressure will be first checked and reset at 30 cm H2O if needed. Next, blue dye will be instilled just above the cuff through the lumen ending in the subglottic area of the Hi-Lo Evac tube. Then a suctioning manoeuvre will be performed with a suction pressure of - 400 mbar through a 16 French suction catheter. Thereafter, a fiberoptic bronchoscopy will be performed, looking for the presence of blue dye in the trachea and/or the bronchi.</description>
