  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized outcome trial of a social network HIV prevention intervention for
      at-risk labor migrants who have arrived in St. Petersburg, Russia, to seek work. Most come to
      St. Petersburg from Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine, and other poor post-Soviet
      republics. While living in Russia, labor migrants are also living in a city and country with
      high HIV prevalence. Many labor migrants have limited awareness of AIDS, and most are living
      in a location far from their spouses, family members, and others. For that reason, labor
      migrants are vulnerable to risk behavior for contracting HIV.

      This study hypothesizes that members of labor migrant social networks whose network leaders
      are trained to deliver HIV prevention messages will exhibit greater reductions in sexual risk
      behavior (unprotected intercourse with nonspousal partners) from baseline to 3- and 12-month
      followup assessments than will members of social networks whose members receive standard,
      individual HIV risk reduction counseling alone.

    <description>Leaders of labor migrant social networks will be trained to disseminate HIV prevention messages to the members of their social networks. The training will sequentially target ways to increase network members' HIV-related knowledge and norms, attitudes, intentions, and confidence in how to avoid risk. Leaders will be encouraged to have these discussions with network members between and after training sessions.</description>
