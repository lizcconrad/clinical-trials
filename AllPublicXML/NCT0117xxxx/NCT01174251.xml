    <textblock>
      Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, known as Torsades de Pointes (TdP), is a specific form
      of ventricular arrhythmia with a characteristic twist of the QRS complex around the
      isoelectric baseline. TdP can degenerate into ventricular defibrillation followed by sudden
      cardiac death. A predictor for the development of TdP is the length of the QT interval
      measured on an EKG recording. The QT interval is known to be prolonged by many medications
      used in a perioperative setting as well as by other conditions such as hypothermia and
      electrolyte imbalance. General anesthesia exposes most of the investigators patients to a
      combination of several of those medications and conditions and therefore might increase the
      risk for the development of QT prolongation. Moreover, patient related risk factors are well
      known and aggravate the individual risk for potential life threatening TdP events when
      exposed to QT prolonging medications perioperatively.

      Previous research suggests that more than 20% of the patients might develop QT prolongations
      perioperatively and are consequently on an increased risk for TdP; yet, no study has
      systematically investigated the magnitude of the problem and associated risk factors.

      The proposed pilot study is designed as a prospective observational cohort study to
      investigate the QT interval before, during and after general anesthesia. It aims to determine
      the incidence of perioperative QT prolongations. A customary long term EKG recording device
      will be connected to a random sample of patients undergoing general anesthesia. Using these
      continuous EKG tracings, the lengths of the QT interval will be analyzed during the
      perioperative period.
