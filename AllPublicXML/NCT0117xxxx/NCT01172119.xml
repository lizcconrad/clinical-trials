    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is &gt;18 years of age.

          -  The subject is an acceptable candidate for PTCA, stenting, and emergent CABG.

          -  Patients with multiple lesions as long as the last lesion to be treated fits the
             Inclusion criteria of the target lesion.

          -  The subject must have clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease or a positive
             functional study.

          -  The study stent target vessel must be a native coronary artery with a stenosis of &gt;50%
             and &lt;100%.

          -  The study stent target vessel reference diameter must be &gt;2.5 mm and ≤ 3.0
             mm.(Measurements may be made by careful visual estimate or on-line quantitative
             coronary angiography.)

          -  The study stent target lesion is a de novo lesion that has not been previously
             stented.

          -  The study stent target lesion must be ≤ 14 mm in length thus allowing for adequate
             lesion coverage with a single stent.

          -  The subject is male or, if female, is either not of childbearing potential or has had
             a negative pregnancy test within seven (7) days prior to the procedure.

          -  The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature of
             the study and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional
             Ethics Committee (IEC) of the clinical site.

          -  The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all
             required post-procedure follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple lesions to be treated in the same target vessel.

          -  Patients who require more than one BioFreedom stent except that an additional
             BioFreedom stent may be implanted in the target lesion for geographic miss or bailout

          -  A documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30% assessed within 6 months prior
             to procedure by echocardiography, during a previous angiography or as measured during
             pre-procedure angiography.

          -  A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, bivalirudin,
             ticlopidine and, clopidogrel, stainless steel, Biolimus A9, Paclitaxel or a
             sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          -  A platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt;700,000 cells/mm³, or a WBC &lt;3,000 cells/mm³.

          -  Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the intended treatment
             (defined as: Q wave or non-Q wave infarction having CK enzymes &gt; 2 times the upper
             laboratory normal with the presence of a CK-MB elevated above the institutions upper
             limit of normal).

          -  A previous coronary interventional procedure was performed either a.) within 24 hours
             prior to the procedure or b.) within 12 months prior to the procedure for any lesion
             in the target vessel.

          -  The subject requires planned interventional treatment of any lesion in either the
             target vessel within 12 months or in any non-target vessel within 30 days
             post-procedure.

          -  The target and non-target lesion require treatment with a device other than PTCA prior
             to stent placement (such as, but not limited to, directional coronary atherectomy,
             excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, etc.).

          -  The target vessel has angiographic evidence of thrombus or is excessively (2 bends &gt;
             90º to reach the target lesion) tortuous.

          -  The target lesion has any of the following characteristics:

               1. Lesion location is aorto-ostial, left main coronary artery, or within 5 mm of the
                  origin of the LAD, LCX, or RCA.

               2. Is at a &gt;45º bend in the vessel.

               3. Is moderately to severely calcified (visible by fluoro).

          -  Stenting of the target or non-target lesion would &quot;jail&quot; or cover a side branch &gt;2.0
             mm in diameter or occur at the ostium of the sidebranch.

          -  History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the prior 6 months or
             permanent neurologic deficit.

          -  History of upper GI bleeding within the prior 6 months.

          -  The subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions.

          -  Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 18 months.

          -  Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints. [Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were
             investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered
             investigational trials.]

          -  Any contraindications as mentioned in the TaxusTM LiberteTM Instructions for Use
             (IFU).
