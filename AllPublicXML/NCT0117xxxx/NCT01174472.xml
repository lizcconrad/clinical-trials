  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the feasibility and the effectiveness, by means of
      immediate and long-term results, of drug eluting balloon (DEB) versus conventional balloon
      angioplasty for the treatment of failing dialysis access.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total 40 patients already diagnosed with hemodynamically significant stenosis of the
      dialysis AVF or AVG (including venous outflow lesions), programmed to undergo percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty by our department, will sign informed consent and will be randomized
      to either receive DEB (Paclitaxel eluting balloon), or conventional balloon therapy. The
      protocol includes the description of patient's demographics (age, gender,dialysis access
      details, risk factors) and procedural details, as well as immediate results and long-term
      follow up.
