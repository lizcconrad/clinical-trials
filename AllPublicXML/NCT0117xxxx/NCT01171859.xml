  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to explore the potential benefits of a twelve-month doxycycline
      (at the best tolerated dose of 200 mg/day) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day)
      treatment on disease progression in patients affected by transthyretin amyloidosis,
      including: 1) patients not eligible for liver transplantation; 2) patients eligible for liver
      transplantation, as a &quot;bridge&quot; therapy between the time of diagnosis and surgery, with the
      aim of stabilizing the disease; 3) patients showing disease progression after liver
      transplantation performed since at least 1 year.

      It is a phase II, therapeutic exploratory, two-part, 18-month, single centre, prospective
      study.

      Part I is a 12-month, open label treatment period in which doxycycline (200 mg/day,
      continuously) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (750 mg/day continuously) are administered to 40
      consenting subjects with transthyretin amyloidosis. Part II is a withdrawal period in which
      subjects will be monitored for disease progression. During part I, subjects will be evaluated
      at baseline (study Day 0), and then after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of doxycycline plus
      tauroursodeoxycholic acid treatment or at premature treatment discontinuation; during part
      II, they will be assessed at months 15 and 18. Monthly phone contacts and blood tests will be
      performed to monitor potential adverse events.

             of green birefringent material in Congo red-stained tissue specimens;

          -  Molecular definition of the transthyretin (TTR) mutation or immunohistochemical
             staining of amyloid fibrils with anti-TTR antibody;
