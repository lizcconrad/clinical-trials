  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) polymorphisms influence 24h arterial pressure
      fluctuation. Resistant systemic arterial hypertension (RSAH) has an increased risk of end
      organ damage and unfavourable prognosis, whereas pseudo-RSAH usually respond favourably to
      drug therapy.

      To prospectively investigate, in subjects with RSAH in a tropical South American city: 1)
      Adverse cardiovascular events defined as fatal and non-fatal stroke or acute myocardial
      infarction (AMI); and 2) the association of RAAS polymorphisms and adverse cardiovascular
      events in this population.

      Study population: 212 hypertensives recruited from primary care assistance (time since first
      diagnosis of hypertension: 16.5±8.1 years) and without appropriate pressure control, between
      2001 and 2006, corresponding to 0.48% of all hypertensives under care (18 new cases/year),
      57±10 years old, 66% females. Under drug treatment schedule: three or more drugs including a
      diuretic. Ninety two randomly selected hypertensives basis had renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
      system genetic profile determined. Genetic assessment was carried out using a polymerase
      chain reaction assay amplification technique. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms
      were analyzed: renin (G1051A), angiotensinogen (M235T), angiotensin converting enzyme-ACE
      (I/D), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (A1166C), aldosterone synthase (C344T) and
      mineralocorticoid receptor (G3514C).

        <title>Polygenic Risk Score</title>
        <description>Among all analyzed, four renin-angiotensin-aldosterone polymorphisms had statistical significance relating to composite endpoint.
They were: Angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin II type 1 receptor and aldosterone synthase. Each polymorphism was arbitrarily weighted according to respective presentation in both alleles as follows: zero (low risk homozygosis), one (heterozygosis) and two (high risk homozygosis). In a following step, they were summed up for each subject, thus, creating a polygenic risk score.
The weights of the polymorphisms were, thus, defined:
Angiotensinogen: MM - zero, MT - one, TT - two
Renin: AA - zero, GA - one, GG - two
Angiotensin II type 1 receptor: CC - zero, AC - one, AA - two
Aldosterone synthase: CC - zero, TC - one, TT - two
The polygenic risk score value ranges from zero (all low risk polymorphisms in homozygosis) to eight (all high risk polymorphisms in homozygosis).</description>
