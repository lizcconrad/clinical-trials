      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of the
      combination of bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell
      lymphoma who are not eligible for high dose chemotherapy and autologous/allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation.

          -  First or second relapse or alternatively progression during therapy. Previous use of
             Bendamustine is permitted, if the patient has reached at least partial remission and
             progression occured more than 6 months after therapy. Previous high dose chemotherapy
             with auto-SCT is permitted, if the patient has reached at least partial remission and
             progression occured more than 12 months after therapy.
