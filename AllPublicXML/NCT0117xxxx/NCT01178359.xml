  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in cardiac arrest resuscitation survival from cardiac arrest is less than
      20-30% and new therapies are urgently needed. Sodium nitrite infused during resuscitation
      from cardiac arrest has recently been shown to improve survival in a mouse model of cardiac
      arrest and our group is eager to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial. Our overall
      hypothesis is that an infusion of 2 Î¼mole/kg sodium nitrite during resuscitation will
      increase the proportion of patients who will survive cardiac arrest. In preparation for a
      clinical trial, preliminary safety and efficacy data (phase 1) is needed which is the primary
      goal of this study.

      Sixteen patients will be randomized to receive normal saline (n=5) or doses of IV nitrite
      (n=11). During the nitrite infusion and for 120 min after the infusion is completed, blood
      pressure and heart rate will be monitored.

      The first 3 patients randomized to receive IV nitrite will receive the lowest dose (1 mg) of
      IV nitrite and compared to one placebo treated patient. If there is no significant decrease
      in blood pressure or elevation in heart rate, we will then dose escalate to the 6 mg dose in
      4 patients and placebo in two patients. Dose escalation to the highest (14 mg) dose will
      again be contingent on the absence of significant hypotension or tachycardia in the drug
      treated patients compared to the pooled (n=3) placebo treated patients. The final block of
      patients will be randomized to the high nitrite dose (n=4) or placebo (n=2). Final
      comparisons of all groups will be made to the pooled (n=5) placebo group
