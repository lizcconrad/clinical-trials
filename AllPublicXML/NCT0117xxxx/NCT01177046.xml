      The findings of this research will be used to develop a scale for measuring the quality of
      epidural pain relief achieved during labour and vaginal delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current lack of a tool to measure the overall quality of neuraxial pain relief provided
      in labour analgesia trials has produced studies unable to provide clear direction to clinical
      care and research. Our previous work explored and described the underlying dimensions and
      attributes of quality neuraxial analgesia from the perspectives of labouring women as the
      initial phase of development of an Index to measure this as an outcome in research. We now
      seek to confirm our findings as well as to generate additional items (descriptors) of quality
      neuraxial analgesia from the perspectives of parturients and experts (obstetrical
      anesthesiologists and experienced labour nurses). Once generated, the full list of items will
      be used to in a subsequent study involving only parturients (Item Reduction phase) to develop
      a scale permitting global measurement of quality neuraxial labour analgesia. The resulting
      scale, once validated, will provide researchers with a simple global measure for quality in
      labour analgesia research. This scale will be used later in our program of research to assist
      with validation studies of the larger Multi-attribute Health Index we are developing.
