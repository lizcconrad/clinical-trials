  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comorbid anxiety disorders affect as many as 80% of youth with autism spectrum disorders,
      causing substantial distress and impairment over and above the autism spectrum diagnosis
      alone. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the gold standard treatment among typically
      developing youth with an anxiety disorder and when adapted, shows promise in children with
      ASD and comorbid anxiety. However, there is currently no psychotherapy protocol tailored to
      meet the unique needs of young adolescents with Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and comorbid
      anxiety. Given this, the present study seeks to develop and test a new CBT therapy in
      adolescents with autism and comorbid anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect approximately 1 out of 150 children and adolescents in
      the United States, making them one of the most common neurobiological conditions. Comorbid
      anxiety disorders affect as many as 80% of youth with ASD, causing substantial distress and
      impairment over and above that caused by an ASD diagnosis alone. While cognitive-behavioral
      therapy (CBT) has been established as the gold standard treatment for anxiety disorders among
      typically developing youth, a protocol does not exist for early adolescents with ASD and
      comorbid anxiety disorders. Accordingly, we are proposing to develop a CBT protocol for
      anxiety and comorbid ASD in early adolescence.

      Initial protocol development efforts will focus on adapting relevant treatment elements from
      an effective CBT program for younger children with ASD and comorbid anxiety to the
      characteristics and clinical needs of early adolescents. Thereafter, protocol and measure
      development will be refined during Phases I and II of this study through our experiences
      treating a total of 20 young adolescents (ages 11-14 years - 10 will be treated at USF; 10 at
      University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)) with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorder(s). The
      CBT protocol will then be examined in a trial comparing CBT to a waitlist condition (N = 32
      total; 16 at each study site).

      The two recruitment sites for this study are the University of California, Los Angeles and
      the University of South Florida. The University of Miami will assist with quality assurance
      checks. Considering the rising number of youth diagnosed with ASD, and the lack of tested
      treatment options for those young adolescents with comorbid anxiety, our proposed work toward
      an efficacious CBT protocol will provide a timely contribution to public health efforts.

    <description>The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale is a clinician-rated scale assessing anxiety symptoms and the associated severity and impairment in children over the past week. The scale includes 5 items which are summed to form a total score, which represents anxiety severity. The scale score ranges from 0 to 25 with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule: Child and Parent Versions are clinician-rated scales assessing anxiety symptoms and the associated severity and impairment in children over the past month. The clinician interviewer interviews the child and parent separately about the nature and severity of the child's anxiety. If a child meets criteria for an anxiety disorder, a single item is rated by the interviewer, which represents anxiety severity. The scale score for this single item ranges from 0 to 8 with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>

The scale score ranges from 0 to 25 with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>

        <title>Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule: Child and Parent Versions</title>
        <description>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule: Child and Parent Versions are clinician-rated scales assessing anxiety symptoms and the associated severity and impairment in children over the past month. The clinician interviewer interviews the child and parent separately about the nature and severity of the child's anxiety. If a child meets criteria for an anxiety disorder, a single item is rated by the interviewer, which represents anxiety severity. The scale score for this single item ranges from 0 to 8 with higher scores indicating more severe anxiety symptoms.</description>
