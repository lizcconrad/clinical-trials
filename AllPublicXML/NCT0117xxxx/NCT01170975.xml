  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the effects of food (a high-fat meal) on the pharmacokinetics of
      tesetaxel.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine whether the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      tesetaxel administered as a capsule is affected by co-administration with food (a high-fat
      meal).
