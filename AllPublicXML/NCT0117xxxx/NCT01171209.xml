  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if Interferon-alfa is effective and safe in multiple
      sclerosis patients who developed neutralizing antibodies for Interferon-beta.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient with NAbs developed during IFN-β therapy do not have any longer beneficial effect of
      any IFN-β preparation and IFN-β has to be replaced with another therapy that may be less
      effective or carry along serious adverse effects. Hence, many NAb positive patients wish to
      continue IFN therapy, and these patients might benefit from treatment with IFN-α as both
      IFN-α and IFN-β are type I interferons that bind to the same interferon receptor (IFNAR). A
      full in vivo response to human IFN-α (Multiferon) comparable to that seen after IFN-β
      induction would suggest that the same therapeutic effect could be obtained with human IFN-α
      (Multiferon).We measure in vivo response of MxA 9-12 hours after administration of human
      IFN-α (Multiferon) and four other known IFN response markers measured with rt-PCR.

      As controls, NAb negative MS patients with a full in vivo MxA response will be studied.
