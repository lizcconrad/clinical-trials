    <textblock>
      Studies has found a connection between breakfast consumption and obesity and obesity-related
      complications, but only few studies examined the effect of breakfast size.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of breakfast size on several parameters in
      adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity has rapidly increased during recent decades, while the prevalence
      of skipping breakfast has increased.

      Several studies have reported inverse relationships between the consumption of breakfast and
      BMI and weight gain. A study that examined the effect of breakfast size, found that an
      increased percentage of daily energy consumed at breakfast was associated with relatively
      lower weight gain. Preliminary results of clinical research (unpublished) show a connection
      between a large breakfast and weight loss and increased feeling of satiety throughout the
      day.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of breakfast size on blood glucose
      balance, and its correlation with hormonal profile (including appetite hormones), adipokines
      and pro-inflammatory cytokines, weight and body composition and lipid profile in adults with
      type 2 diabetes.

      The study will use a randomized-controlled, non-blinded, prospective design, including 48
      participants with type 2 diabetes, who are not insulin dependent.

      The research group will receive instructions to eat a large breakfast compared with the
      control group that will receive instructions to eat a small breakfast.

      The estimated duration of the study is about three months.

    <description>The research group will receive instructions to eat a large breakfast, Dividing the total daily calories recommended to the patient to: breakfast - 1/8 of the total daily calories , lunch - 1/3 of the total daily calories and supper- 1/3 of the total daily calories.
(the rest of the calories will be snacks between the meals) In contrast, the control group that will receive instructions to eat a small breakfast.
Dividing the total daily calories recommended to the patient to: breakfast - 1/3 of the total daily calories , lunch - 1/4 of the total daily calories and supper- 1/4 of the total daily calories (the rest of the calories will snacks between the meals).
The instructions will be adapted to each patient individually</description>
