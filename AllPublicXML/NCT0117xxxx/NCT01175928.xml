    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the NormaTec PCD, a non-invasive
      pneumatic compression device with the patented peristaltic pulse pneumatic waveform, in the
      treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN).

      The study will compare treatment with a NormaTec PCD and a sham device to assess whether the
      NormaTec PCD improves the signs and symptoms of DPN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes frequently leads to decreased sensation in the legs caused by diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy (DPN). DPN is an important risk factor for the development of foot ulceration, one
      of the most common causes for hospital admissions and lower-limb amputations among diabetic
      patients. However, to date there are no medications currently approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration to treat DPN.

      The goal of this research project is to assess the effectiveness of a non-invasive, patented
      peristaltic pulse pneumatic compression device (the NormaTec PCD) in a home treatment program
      to improve the symptoms of DPN (e.g. numbness, pain, and tingling in the legs) and the
      underlying functioning of the nerves in the legs (as determined by sensory perception
      assessments and Nerve Conduction Studies testing).

      In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, subjects will be randomly placed in one
      of two groups: a control group using a sham NormaTec PCD (&quot;placebo&quot;); and an experimental
      group using a NormaTec PCD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes

          -  Patient diagnosed with distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) attributable to diabetes

          -  A1C â‰¤ 11%

          -  Abnormal peroneal motor nerve conduction study where CMAP amplitude is less than 4 mV
             bilaterally.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refuses consent

          -  Unlikely to be compliant with the research protocol as judged by the clinical
             investigator

          -  Neuropathy documented to be caused by something other than diabetes

          -  Medication for neuropathic pain initiated within the previous 3 months (to avoid
             confounding the results of the study)

          -  Medication for glucose control changed within the previous 3 months (to avoid
             confounding the results of the study)

          -  Documented DVT within the previous 3 months (since an acute DVT is a contraindication
             for Pneumatic Medicine treatment)

          -  Significant hepatic disease as judged by the clinical investigator (that might cause
             neuropathy unrelated to diabetes)

          -  Documented cancer treatment within the past 5 years (that might cause neuropathy
             unrelated to diabetes)

          -  History of exposure to neurotoxins or heavy metals (that might cause neuropathy
             unrelated to diabetes)

          -  Documented alcohol or drug abuse (that might cause neuropathy unrelated to diabetes)

          -  Documented major psychiatric disorder (that could contribute to non-adherence to the
             protocol)

          -  Presence of a major lower extremity amputation (since unable to perform bilateral
             distal sensory perception testing of the feet and NCS on the peroneal motor nerve)

          -  Significant peripheral arterial disease defined as an ankle-brachial index (&quot;ABI&quot;) &lt;
             0.6 (to avoid critical limb ischemia and thus the high likelihood of the patient
             requiring a major amputation in the near future with drop out from the study)

          -  Severe lower extremity edema as judged by the clinical investigator (in order to not
             confound the results)

          -  End stage DPN where the peroneal motor nerve conduction results of both legs show an
             Amplitude = 0 mV

          -  Currently participating in another clinical trial
