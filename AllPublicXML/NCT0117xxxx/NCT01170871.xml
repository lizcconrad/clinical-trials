      The purpose of the study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of Ixabepilone and
      Pemetrexed in advanced solid tumors and to obtain preliminary information regarding the
      activity of this combination.

      This research study is for research participants who have confirmed metastatic or
      unresectable solid tumors (lung, breast, ovary, cervix, uterus, mesothelioma, and prostate)
      for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or no longer effective.
