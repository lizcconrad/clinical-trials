      This study aims to test the following two hypotheses in women recruited in early pregnancy
      and whose children will be followed up till at least 9 years of age.

        -  Epigenetic changes in conceptual tissues obtained at birth reflect the environment that
           the fetus was exposed to during development.

        -  The pattern of epigenetic marks in gene promoters obtained from DNA in birth tissues,
           together with genotype, phenotype, and environmental exposures, can be utilized to
           assess how the perinatal environment affects subsequent metabolic, neurodevelopmental
           and other phenotypes.

    <textblock>
      The dramatic emergence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Asia has coincided with the
      rapid socioeconomic and nutritional transition taking place in the region, with the
      prevalence of diabetes rising five-fold in Singapore in less than four decades. One unique
      aspect of the epidemic has been the significant ethnic differences in predisposition among
      Asians and in the ethnic variation between BMI and the risk of developing insulin resistance.
      Apart from genetic factors, the differences in diet, lifestyle, cultural and religious
      practices might have altered the developmental programming through effects on the mechanisms
      of developmental plasticity. A center piece of this study is to examine how epigenetic change
      at birth both reflects past developmental influences and, in association with other factors,
      influences future trajectories of development and its relationship to NCDs. The longitudinal
      GUSTO birth cohort study allow us to examine associations between genomic variation and
      developmental-environmental interactions in the three distinct ethnic groups, Chinese, Malays
      and Indians, present in the Singaporean population.

Only women age 18 years and above who are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents. Participants have to intend to eventually deliver in NUH or KKH and to reside in Singapore for the next 5 years. Willingness to donate cord, cord blood and placenta.
