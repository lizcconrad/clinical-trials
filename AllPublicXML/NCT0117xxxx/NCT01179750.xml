  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasonic coagulating shears are made for performing for cutting and hemostasis at once
      during operation. It was proved that a laparoscopic gastric resection showed significantly
      shorter operative time and less work load distribution, and more stability of bleeding than
      before an introduction of ultrasonic coagulating shears .

      In an open gastric cancer surgery, ultrasonic coagulating shears have been often used for
      lymph node dissection or cutting of small vessels in some hospitals in Korea. However its
      usefulness or effectiveness has not been fully proved. There was only one report about using
      ultrasonic coagulating shears in open gastrectomy. The report contained small number of
      subjects and surgical procedures were different from the investigators.

      The investigators expect to reduce operative time and blood loss with ultrasonic coagulating
      shears. Ultrasonic coagulating shears will also enable us to dissect lymph node with closure
      of lymphatics. This may reduce the amount of drainage fluid from peritoneal cavity and
      shorten the removal time of a drain, which will also shorten the hospital stay.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and benefit of ultrasonic coagulating
      shears in open gastrectomy including usefulness and effectiveness by a randomized controlled,
      prospective study.
