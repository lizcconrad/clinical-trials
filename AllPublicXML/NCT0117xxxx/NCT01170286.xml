      The purpose of this phase 1b study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated
      epicutaneous applications of peanut proteins using a patch delivery system (Viaskin device)
      in peanut allergic subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is a common allergy in the United States, with a prevalence in the general
      population as high as 1%. So far, there is no approved treatment of peanut allergy. Peanut
      allergy management is based on strict peanut avoidance and injectable epinephrine after the
      allergic systemic reactions have started. Specific Immunotherapy methods currently available
      have shown some limitations in their use because of safety issues. Hence, there is an
      important unmet medical need for efficient and safe treatment of peanut allergy.

      DBV Technologies has developed an epicutaneous delivery system, called Viaskin, a method
      based on delivering precise quantity of the allergen on the upper layers of the skin.
      Avoiding contact between the allergen and the bloodstream should confer to epicutaneous
      immunotherapy (EPIT) a higher level of safety as systemic reactions should be circumvented.

      The aim of this phase 1b study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the epicutaneous
      immunotherapy method in subjects allergic to peanut. The trial will randomize 110
      participants. Four doses of peanut proteins, 20 mcg, 100 mcg, 250 mcg and 500 mcg will be
      repeatedly delivered on the skin by dose escalation in consecutive cohorts of 5 subjects,
      starting with the lowest dose. In each cohort of 5, 4 subjects will receive peanut proteins
      and one will receive placebo in a blinded manner. For each dose, the peanut proteins will be
      applied on the skin either every day or every other day. The total duration of the treatment
      for each subject is 2 weeks. Firstly, adult subjects (18 to 50 years) with a history of
      non-severe anaphylaxis to peanut (Grade ≤3) will enroll and safety information be reviewed.
      If there are no major concerns, adolescent cohorts (12 to 17 years) with history of
      non-severe anaphylaxis to peanut will then enroll and safety again be reviewed. If there are
      no concerns, then child cohorts (6 to 11 years) with history of non-severe anaphylaxis to
      peanut will finally enroll.

      Also, after the safety review of the treated adult non-severe cohorts is satisfactorily
      performed, adult subjects with a history of severe anaphylaxis to peanut (Grades 4 or 5) will
      enroll and dose escalation will undergo.

      For the safety review, all the following parameters will be checked at each patient visit:
      physical examination, vital signs, skin examination, lab values, PEF values. FEV1, skin prick
      test to peanut and peanut-specific IgE values will also be determined at screening and end of
      treatment visits.

          -  Male or Female age 6 to 50 years at enrollment, any race, and any ethnicity.

          -  Physician-diagnosed peanut allergy or convincing history of peanut allergy regardless
             of the degree of the reaction. Subjects with history of severe anaphylaxis to peanuts
             (Grades 4 or 5 with dyspnea, cyanosis, hypoxia, hypotension, or neurological
             compromise) can be enrolled only after assessment of the safety of DBV712 Viaskin in
             subjects with historic non-severe anaphylaxis (Grade≤3).

          -  A peanut-specific IgE measured by ImmunoCAP &gt;0.7 kU/L for all subjects and a positive
             skin prick test to peanut with a wheal diameter &gt;8 mm for all non-severe subjects. A
             skin prick test to peanut for severe subjects will be performed only if deemed
             necessary by the investigator.

          -  Use of an effective method of contraception by females of childbearing potential and
             agreement to continue to practice an acceptable method of contraception for the
             duration of their participation in the study. Women who have had a hysterectomy or
             tubal ligation at least 6 months prior to the screening visit or who have been
             post-menopausal for at least 1 year prior to the screening visit are not considered to
             be of childbearing potential.

             Society guidelines (1994).

          -  Able to understand the protocol and willing to comply with all study requirements
             during participation in the study.

          -  Provide signed informed consent and assent as appropriate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in a study using an investigational new drug in the last 30 days prior
             to the screening visit.

          -  Participation in any interventional study for the treatment of food allergy in the
             past 6 months prior to the screening visit.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Allergy or known hypersensitivity to the Viaskin patch or adhesives.

          -  Severe or poorly controlled atopic dermatitis or generalized eczema.

          -  FEV1 value &lt;80% predicted or any clinical features of moderate or severe persistent
             asthma at baseline and treated by doses greater than high daily doses of inhaled
             corticosteroids (as defined in dosing tables from the 2007 NHLBI guidelines).

          -  Use of steroid medications in the following manners: history of daily oral steroid
             dosing for &gt;1 month during the past year, or burst oral steroid course in the past 6
             months, or &gt;1 burst oral steroid course in the past year, prior to the screening
             visit. Use of oral steroids as described above after the screening visit and before
             randomization will render the subject non eligible for randomization.

          -  Asthma requiring 1 or more hospitalization(s) in the past year or &gt;1 emergency
             department visit in the past 6 months, prior to the screening visit. Occurrence of
             asthma in these conditions after the screening visit and before randomization will
             render the subject non eligible for randomization.

             eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, malignancy, psychiatric illness, or any other
             medical or surgical conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, place the
             subject at increased risk for participation in this study.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to sign informed consent or to provide assent (as
             appropriate).
