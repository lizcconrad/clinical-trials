    <textblock>
      The hypotheses for this study is that there is no transfer of testosterone from male (donor)
      subjects to female (recipient) subjects when contact is made 2 hours post application of 2%
      Testosterone MD-Lotion® if the donor has a covered application area with a T-shirt.
