      A study of PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) administered on a twice weekly
      schedule for 28 days followed by a weekly dosing schedule in patients with advanced solid
      tumors who have either failed to respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy
      exists.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written, signed, IRB-approved informed consent form.

          -  Pathologic (histologic or cytologic) confirmation of metastatic or locally advanced
             solid tumor.

          -  Patients must have a pathologically documented, definitively diagnosed, advanced solid
             tumor that is refractory to standard treatment, for which no standard therapy is
             available or the patient refuses standard therapy.

          -  One or more tumors measurable by RECIST criteria.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70%.

          -  Ejection fraction ≥ 50%, determined by echocardiogram.

          -  Life expectancy at least 3 months.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Acceptable organ function; normal hepatic, renal and hematopoietic function.

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test result in women of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known brain metastasis.

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction
             within 6 months of enrollment, or cardiac arrhythmia requiring medical therapy.

          -  Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled diabetes (requiring medication change within 30 days of
             screening), or requiring insulin therapy.

          -  Heparin therapy.

          -  Known infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

          -  Known allergy to hyaluronidase.

          -  Women currently breast feeding.
