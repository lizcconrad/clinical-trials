  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study of an investigational (FDA IND-BB 10091) treatment of
      subjects with castration-resistant prostate cancer resistant to Taxanes (docetaxel,
      cabazitaxel) and evidence of disease progression on androgen-axis inhibition and/or
      immunotherapy in the form of sipuleucel-T.

      The treatment is being evaluated for its effect on tumor growth. It consists of the placement
      (implantation) of small beads that contain mouse renal adenocarcinoma cells (RENCA
      macrobeads). The cells in the macrobeads produce substances that have been shown to slow or
      stop the growth of tumors in experimental animals and veterinary patients. It has been tested
      in 31 human subjects with different types of cancers in a Phase I safety trial. Phase II
      studies in patients with colorectal, pancreatic or prostate cancers are in progress.
