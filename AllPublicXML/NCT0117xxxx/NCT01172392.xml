  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the loss of HbsAg after a 48-week pegylated interferon
      alpha 2a in patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBeAg negativation)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide a therapeutical alternative to the use of an extended
      or undeterminated duration of treatment with prolonged nucleoside (s)/nucleotide (s)analog
      (s).

      The duration of administration is not consensual, and in most cases followed by a virological
      relapse, so that, the prolonged use could lead to the occurrence of viral resistance and
      mutations.

      It is therefore expected that treatment with pegylated interferon for 48 weeks in patients
      with undetectable HBV DNA by analog(s) may increase and promotes the loss of HbsAg and then
      promotes HbsAg seroconversion. In the absence of cirrhosis, the loss of HbsAg at 6 months
      would allow the end of treatment
