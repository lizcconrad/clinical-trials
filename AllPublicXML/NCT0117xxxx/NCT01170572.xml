  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies in chickens show that blood levels of a particular form of vitamin D (called
      24,25-dihydroxvitamin D) increase after bone fracture. Laboratory studies show that this form
      of vitamin D helps the bone healing process in chickens. The investigators want to find out
      whether blood levels of this form of vitamin D increase after bone fracture in humans.
      Previous research studies have not addressed this question. The results of this research
      could eventually lead to the development of new treatments to help bone healing after
      fracture.

      Patients will be asked to take part in this study if they are aged 16 years or older and come
      to the Royal London Hospital with a broken bone in the arm or leg or collar bone (clavicle).
      They will be asked to give a 20ml (about 4 teaspoons) blood sample on three occasions: at the
      start of the study, at 5-14 days after the fracture; and at 4-10 weeks after the fracture.
      The rest of their normal care would not be affected. Follow-up blood samples will be timed to
      coincide with routine clinic visits which are scheduled as part of normal clinical care.
      Patients' vitamin D level will be measured as part of the study, and those who have a low
      vitamin D level will be informed about this, and advised about appropriate vitamin D
      supplementation. The investigators will let the patient or their GP know if any blood tests
      are abnormal
