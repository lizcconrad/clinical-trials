  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) are major mediators of
      angiogenesis and are induced by tissue inflammation and hypoxia. While elevated serum VEGF
      levels have been reported in inflammatory lung diseases, especially with hemoptysis, there
      was no study to evaluate the Ang-2 levels in lung inflammatory diseases according to the
      presence of hemoptysis, inflammatory biomarker and hypoxia.

    <description>We'll measure the serum VEFG and Ang-2 level of enrolled patients within a week from the moment that patients agree to enroll this study. Therefore, Comparison of the serum VEGF and Ang-2 level (measured within a week from enrollment) according to the presence of hemoptysis will be primary outcome.</description>

    <description>We'll measure the serum VEFG, Ang-2 level, and other factors such as inflammatory biomarkers and PaO2 of enrolled patients within a week from the moment that patients agree to enroll this study. Therefore, Investigating association between angiogensis factors and other factors such as inflammatory biomarker and hypoxia, which were measured within a week from enrollment, will be secondary outcome.</description>
