  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) is a member of the FABP super family, is
      abundant in adipocytes and macrophages. Regulatory functions of A-FABP in lipid and glucose
      metabolism have been described, and it is suggested to play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome.We hypothesize that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may
      upregulate A-FABP production and thus causally contribute to metabolic dysfunction. Our group
      has recently demonstrated that A-FABP, expressed and secreted from adipocytes, is present in
      the blood stream .The levels of A-FABP correlated with various metabolic variates in the
      metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, we have obtained novel data in men with a range of sleep
      disordered breathing showed that the duration of oxygen desaturation correlated with
      circulating levels of A-FABP, independent of age and waist/body mass index. The current
      proposal aims to pursue this finding and further explore the role of A-FABP in the
      association of OSA and metabolic dysfunction.

      We hypothesize that there are changes in circulating A-FABP level which can be mitigated by
      effective treatment of OSA.

      The aim is to investigate the effect of CPAP treatment of OSA on circulating A-FABP, and
      other metabolic biomarkers and cardiovascular parameters
