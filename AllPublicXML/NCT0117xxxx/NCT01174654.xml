  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine abuse has a strong and consistent epidemiologic association with high-risk
      sexual behavior and both prevalent and incident HIV in men who have sex with men (MSM), and
      some authorities have advocated methamphetamine treatment as an HIV prevention strategy.
      However, methamphetamine interventions have not been evaluated in controlled trials, nor have
      they been implemented and assessed outside of substance abuse treatment programs. This
      application proposes preliminary investigations to adapt a methamphetamine treatment
      intervention previously associated with decreased sexual-risk taking among MSM for use as an
      early intervention among MSM in Seattle, Washington. Sixty methamphetamine-using MSM will be
      enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of contingency management (CM) versus no
      intervention. CM participants will have their urine tested for methamphetamine 3 times weekly
      for 12 weeks, and will receive vouchers of escalating value when their urines test negative;
      vouchers will be withheld when participants' urines test positive for methamphetamine or
      participants miss urine testing visits. All participants will undergo urine methamphetamine
      testing and audio-computer assisted self-interviews on sexual behavior and substance use at
      baseline and at 6 week intervals for 6 months. Participants will be tested for HIV, syphilis,
      rectal gonorrhea and chlamydial infection, and pharyngeal gonorrhea at baseline and at 3 and
      6 month follow-up. The study will determine how often MSM will initiate and complete the
      early intervention, and will longitudinally measure unsafe sexual behaviors among
      intervention and control participants. Study results will determine the feasibility of
      instituting and studying CM as an early intervention; define whether the intervention is
      sufficiently promising to justify a larger, definitive randomized controlled trial; and will
      provide estimates for defining the number of participants such a trial would require.
