  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine administration for minor procedure, such as extracorporeal shock wave
      lithotripsy, provides good quality of sedation and analgesia. Dexmedetomidine is a highly
      selective Î±2-adrenergic receptor agonist which causes sedative effects and reduces opioid
      requirements in the perioperative period. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy may cause
      pain and result in tachycardia and vasoconstriction-related hypertension. Surgical or
      procedural stress may induce inflammation and it may cause further microthrombosis. Both
      vasoconstriction and microthrombosis will alter the microcirculatory status. Dysfunction of
      microcirculation may impair tissue perfusion and result in organ dysfunction. Dexmedetomidine
      may induce vasodilation by slow intravenous infusion for sedation. Dexmedetomidine may also
      reduce inflammation. After reviewing the literature, the investigators found that the effect
      of dexmedetomidine on microcirculation was not well investigated. By application of the
      non-invasive technique of sidestream dark field imaging, the investigators can investigate
      the vessel density, percentage of perfused vessels, and microvascular flow index on
      sublingual vessels.

      The goal of this study is to identify the effect of dexmedetomidine on sublingual
      microcirculation in patient undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
