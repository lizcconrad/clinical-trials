  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strong evidence shows that physical activity (PA) has favorable psychological and health
      related outcomes. However, most employees do not perform enough PA to achieve health and well
      being benefits. Worksite interventions aimed at improving PA often yield modest effect sizes,
      and their theoretical ground is not profound. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), is a
      novel comprehensive theoretical model for health behavior change, that hasn't been studied as
      a whole in a worksite intervention study.

      The objectives of the proposed study are:

        1. To develop a coaching-based group intervention that will be both grounded in theory
           (HAPA) as well as applicable.

        2. To evaluate the feasibility of conducting this intervention among employed hospital
           nurses, using a randomized controlled design, interviews and other evaluation
           procedures.

      The proposed study will offer the most comprehensive empirical test to date of the full HAPA
      model.
