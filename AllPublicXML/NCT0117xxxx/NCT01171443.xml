      Since the pathophysiology of BIPN still remains unclear, in the present study we are going to
      assess the development of BIPN in newly diagnosed myeloma patients, based on clinical
      neurological examination and electrophysiological study (EMG) and trying to find out if there
      is any relationship between oxidative stress generation measured by serum malonyldialdehyde -
      (MDA) and urinary isoprostane, and the development of BIPN, which can explain important part
      of the BIPN pathophysiology and can suggest new ideas of treatment and prophylactic
      strategies of peripheral neuropathy.

      The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has shown impressive clinical activity alone and in
      combination with other novel agents for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM).

      Peripheral neuropathy is a significant dose limiting toxicity of bortezomib, which typically
      occurs within the first treatment cycles with bortezomib, reaching plateau around cycle 5,
      and does not appear to increase thereafter.

      Although bortezomib is known to be selective proteasome inhibitor, the mechanisms of
      cytotoxicity are poorly understood.

      It has been theoretically hypothesized that bortezomib abrogates the degradation of I-kB,
      which blocks the transcriptional activity of NF-kB, however, recent studies demonstrated that
      bortezomib elicits activation of multiple pathways in cancer cells, such as reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) pathway.

      The involvement of oxidative stress is supported by emerging studies showing that ROS
      generation plays a critical role in the initiation of the bortezomib induced apoptotic
      cascade.

      Oxidative stress is a complex and dynamic situation characterized by an imbalance between the
      productions of ROS and the availability and action of antioxidants.
