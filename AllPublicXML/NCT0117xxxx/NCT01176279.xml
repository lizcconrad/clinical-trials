  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The technique of blood samples extraction from the radial artery through an arterial catheter
      with a 3-way stopcock and automated washing with valve of fast flow is better than the one
      carried out through a fixed reusable arterial blood sample syringe and its manual washing
      because it shows a minor incidence of the complications originated from technical
      manipulation as infection, pseudo-aneurysm, ischemia or thrombosis of radial artery or
      obstruction of the catheter.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of adverse effects, of blood
      samples obtention using an arterial catheter with needless connector closed system or an
      arterial catheter with an arterial blood sample syringe.

      Also a second purpose is to compare once a day (at the same time) the values of glycose blood
      levels between bedside glucometer determination of arterial catheter extraction and capillar
      puncture, and lab determination of glycose from venous puncture, in order to determinate
      fluctuation in glycose levels due to peripherical hypoperfusion or to vasoactive drugs
      received by these in-intensive care unit patients.

    <description>Place in the radial artery the system of invasive monitoring of the blood pressure (BD DTXPlus ™). Insert in line a second 3-way stopcock above the one that has the BD DTXPlus ™; this second 3-way stopcock will be called proximal key. On the distal 3-way stopcock key (the one of TM BD DTXPlus ™), put the needless connector included in the kit to make the extractions of blood. Connect an arterial blood sampling syringe on the proximal 3-way stopcock key. With the assembled system, it is necessary to print a curve of invasive determination of the blood pressure.</description>

    <description>The extractions of the blood for the analysis of the glycaemia will be made puncturing the needless connector inserted in the distal 3-way stopcock key once an hour during 48 hours.
Obtain 2cc of blood using the arterial blood sampling syringe connected to the proximal key. This volume of rejection is reserved in the syringe itself.
In accordance with the current protocol of disinfection, the needless connector inserted on the distal key will be disinfected. With a disposable sterile syringe the needless connector is punctured and a minimum blood amount is obtained for the determination of the glycaemia.
Once the sample has been obtained, the rejection volume reserved is returned to the bloodstream. This arterial blood sampling syringe is cleaned aspirating serum manually in order to wash the line.
Additional line washing is made through the fast flow valve of the system BD DTXPlus ™.</description>
