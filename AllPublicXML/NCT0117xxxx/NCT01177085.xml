  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-year clinical trial to assess weight-loss, weight-maintenance, and biochemical
      parameters following a weight-control diet using either standard food guide pyramid alone, or
      standard food guide pyramid with substitution of mushrooms for meat.

      This intervention study has a primary aim to assess omnivorous adult males and females'
      ability to control their weight over a period of 1 year. The control group will be required
      to use 90% lean ground beef a few times per week for one year while maintaining their
      personalized diet plans. The experimental group will have to follow their personalized diets
      as well, but will be required to substitute mushrooms for meat at least three times per week.
      Biochemical measures will also be assessed in response to the diet and weight loss.
