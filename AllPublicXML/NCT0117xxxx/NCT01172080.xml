  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although systems are in place to ensure results of tests are communicated to patients, there
      is currently no generalized accepted strategy to ensure that patients undergo recommended
      follow-up testing. When follow-up tests are recommended months to years into the future,
      there is a high likelihood that the test will either be delayed or not performed resulting in
      the potential for poor outcomes and litigation. For this reason, there is a clear need for
      systems to be developed which automatically trigger patient communication when the date of a
      recommended follow-up test is approaching. The investigators propose to design a protocol for
      ensuring that patients are reminded to schedule follow-up tests and that this communication
      is documented in the online medical record. This work will provide the foundation for the
      creation of systems that significantly improve patient care, and can be easily adapted for
      use in many clinical departments and institutions.

      Aim 1. To use patient focus groups to help design a system for improving adherence to
      endoscopy follow up recommendations

      Aim 2. To develop a prototype endoscopy follow up system and test the effectiveness of the
      system on a cohort of patients due for a surveillance colonoscopy.
