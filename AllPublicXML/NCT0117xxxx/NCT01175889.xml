      The Megadyne Aceâ„¢ Incision/ Dissection study is a post market, prospective assessment of the
      E-Z Clean ACE electrosurgical electrodes using the ACE Blade in the ACE Mode for targeted
      procedures such as abdominoplasty, bilateral breast reduction, bilateral breast lifts,
      bilateral brachioplasty, bilateral lateral thigh and buttocks lifts, or any combination
      thereof.
