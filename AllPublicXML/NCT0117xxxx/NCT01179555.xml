      Pt. 1 Diabetic retinopathy is a common eye condition among diabetic adults and can lead to
      severe vision impairment and even blindness. African Americans are more likely to have vision
      loss from diabetic retinopathy due to a variety of factors, including cultural barriers to
      care. The investigators aim to increase the rates of eye exams in diabetic African American
      adults by providing culturally relevant home-based interventions. These interventions will
      increase the knowledge about diabetes and the eyes and the awareness of ocular risks due to
      diabetes.

      206 African American adults, over the age of 65, with diabetes will be recruited from primary
      care clinics at Thomas Jefferson and Temple University. Eligible patients who consent to
      participate will have baseline information taken about medical and ocular history,
      understanding of diabetes and a hemoglobin A1C level obtained. The subjects will then be
      randomized to one of two treatment conditions: Behavioral Activation or Supportive Therapy,
      each of which will be delivered over 4 sessions. Behavioral Activation will consist of
      educational materials, referral assistance for eye clinics, and addressing patient specific
      barriers to care. Supportive Therapy will consist of supportive but non-directional
      interaction with the patient exploring the impact of aging and diabetes on the patient's
      life. The investigators hypothesize that more patients who receive Behavioral Activation will
      have a dilated fundus exam (the primary outcome variable), understand the risks of diabetic
      complications and feel less depression then subjects who receive Supportive Therapy.

      An additional aim was added to this project, examining the effect of a telephone intervention
      on eye care adherence and comparing the efficacy of the intervention to usual care and
      automated telephone screenings.

      Glaucoma is a group of chronic, neurodegenerative diseases of the optic nerve, which leads to
      an increase in intraocular pressure, gradual changes in the visual field (VF), and
      progressive vision loss. Glaucomatous vision loss is preventable with proper eye care,
      including adherence to follow-up appointments and medications. Interventions that improve
      appointment adherence have the potential to prevent more severe glaucomatous disease. The
      primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention
      system, which includes a customized letter and personal telephone outreach, in improving
      appointment adherence in patients with glaucoma. In order to improve strategies to reduce the
      rate of appointment non-adherence, shared characteristics of adherent versus non-adherent
      patients with glaucoma will be identified and compared to patient characteristics in the
      previous literature. A secondary goal of this study is to analyze the cost-effectiveness of
      this multifaceted intervention on appointment adherence in patients with glaucoma.

    <description>Behavioral Activation (BA) is a behavioral technique to help people overcome avoidant tendencies through goal setting, activity scheduling, and graded task assignment. The key component of BA involves developing an &quot;Action Plan&quot;, and having the subject document each step of the plan as he or she implements it, reinforcing the steps towards goal attainment. &quot;Action Plans&quot; are easily applied to diabetes self-care tasks because the latter lend themselves to documentation of simple, step-by-step plans. In this study, a Community Health Educator (CHE) - interventionist will schedule and deliver four 45-60 minute in-home BA sessions within 3 months of randomization (i.e., one session every 2-3 weeks).</description>

    <description>The purpose of Supportive Therapy (ST) is to explore the impact of aging and diabetes on the subject's life. In contrast to the BA intervention, the interventionist does not discuss the importance of dilated eye exams. In subsequent sessions, ST facilitates and deepens knowledge about the subject's life situation in relation to his or her health and other life difficulties. The ST therapist encourages this process and creates an accepting, nondirective, and supportive opportunity for discussion.</description>
