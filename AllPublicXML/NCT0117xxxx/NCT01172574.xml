      The objective of this study was to explore the effectiveness of Motor Control Exercise on
      pain, postural alignment and spinal curvatures in women with osteoporotic vertebral
      fractures.

      Osteoporosis is a common metabolic bone disease that usually affects the aging population. It
      is an important public health problem, due to its association with vertebral and nonvertebral
      fractures leading to increased morbidity. Vertebral fractures are accompanied by kyphosis,
      reduced pulmonary function, loss of height, and are often associated with elevated pain while
      they may also lead to subsequent vertebral fractures. Osteoporotic individuals exhibit
      kyphosis in the erect standing position, which, in turn, is compensated by the deformation of
      other parts of the body. Improvement of postural alignment may lead to less stress on the
      spine, facilitate posture and proper body mechanics and may improve balance. The aim of the
      present study was to assess the effectiveness of Motor Control Exercise on pain, postural
      alignment and spinal curvatures in women with osteoporotic vertebral fracture against the
      results of a control group that received the basic therapies for osteoporosis.

    <description>Pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) of 11 numerical points (0='no pain', 10='worst imaginable pain'). Participants were asked to verbalize the presence of pain in their trunk and lower limbs during the previous 2 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Photographic measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Two-dimensional posture photography was performed using a digital Video Camera. With participants in their underwear, self-adhesive patches of 1.5 cm were placed over the left-side lateral landmarks. Women were instructed to stand in a comfortable posture with feet 20 cm apart. The participants were photographed twice at each time point. The photographs were analyzed by measuring the angles between a perpendicular line transcending the lateral malleolus, head of fibula, great trochanter, shoulder and ear. The mean of each angle of both photographs was used for statistical analysis.</description>

    <measure>Spinal curvatures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>These were measured using a Sounders digital inclinometer according to the instruction manual. Standing thoracic, lumbar, and lumbosacral angle were measured. The examiner repeated the procedure three times, and if the measurements differed by more than 5 degrees, they were repeated and the second set of measurements recorded.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Motor control exercise</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects of the exercise group underwent a 3-month (13-week) treatment program directed on 3-weekly 1-hr one-to-one sessions by the researcher who had experience in the specific exercise treatment of the spinal region. During the next 3 months, the subjects were urged to perform the exercises alone at home at least once a day, and compliance was monitored by the activity quota chart given to them at the beginning of each study-month.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Control group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group underwent treatment throughout a 6-month period, directed by each patient's medical practitioner. This consisted of the patients carrying out regular weekly general exercises (walking and swimming). Three of them regularly attended other treatment providers involving group general exercise programs. Two patients received the application of local pain-relieving methods such as heat, massage, laser and ultrasound and one did nothing except for receiving osteoporotic medication.</description>

    <intervention_name>Motor control exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants of the exercise group were trained to consciously co-activate the transversus abdominis, pelvic floor and thoracic erector spinae muscle, relax the lumbar multifidus and use the diaphragmatic breathing pattern. They were encouraged to activate the specific muscles of the trunk regularly during daily activities, particularly in situations where they anticipated or experienced pain such as walking, twisting, lifting low-lying objects and working with the hands in sitting or standing positions</description>
