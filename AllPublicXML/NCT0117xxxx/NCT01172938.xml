  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether apremilast is safe and effective in the
      treatment of patients with psoriatic arthritis, specifically in improving signs and symptoms
      of psoriatic arthritis (tender and swollen joints, pain, physical function) in treated
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis that occurs in 6-39% of psoriasis
      patients. The immunopathogenesis of PsA, which mirrors but is not identical to that seen in
      psoriatic plaques, reflects a complex interaction among resident dendritic, fibroblastic and
      endothelial cells, and inflammatory cells attracted to the synovium by cytokines and
      chemokines. Apremilast (CC-10004) is a novel oral agent that modulates multiple inflammatory
      pathways through targeted phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) enzyme inhibition. Therefore,
      apremilast has the potential to be effective in the treatment of PsA.

    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

    <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set; participants with a baseline value and at least 1 postbaseline value at or prior to Week 24 are included; LOCF imputation was used. The Week 16 value was carried over to Week 24 for participants who escaped early at Week 16.</population>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: • 28 tender joint count (TJC), • 28 swollen joint count (SJC), • Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; • Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0 to 76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

          <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: • 28 tender joint count (TJC), • 28 swollen joint count (SJC), • Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; • Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0 to 76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at Week 16</title>
        <description>The DAS28 measures the severity of disease at a specific time and is derived from the following variables: • 28 tender joint count • 28 swollen joint count, which do not include the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee; • C-reactive protein (CRP) • Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>Modified PsARC response is defined as improvement in at least 2 of the 4 measures, at least one of which must be tender joint count or swollen joint count, and no worsening in any of the 4 measures: •78 tender joint count, •76 swollen joint count, •Patient global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm visual Analog scale (VAS), where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest; •Physician global assessment of disease activity, measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = lowest disease activity and 100 mm = highest. Improvement or worsening in joint counts is defined as decrease or increase, respectively, from baseline by ≥ 30%, and improvement or worsening in global assessments is defined as decrease or increase, respectively, from baseline by ≥ 20 mm VAS.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dactylitis Severity Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet will be rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis severity score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present.</description>

Participants with a baseline dactylitis severity score &gt; 0 (i.e., pre-existing dactylitis) and at least 1 postbaseline value at or prior to Week 24 are included. LOCF was used. The Week 16 value was carried over to Week 24 for participants who escaped early at Week 16.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: • 28 tender joint count (TJC), • 28 swollen joint count (SJC), • Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; • Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8; Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10; Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22; High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

DAS28(CRP) scores range from 0 to approximately 10, with the upper bound dependent on the highest possible level of CRP. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission.</description>

Each question is answered on a 5-point scale, where 0 means &quot;not at all,&quot; and 4 means &quot;very much.&quot; The FACIT-Fatigue scale score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher scores denoting lower levels of fatigue. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set; participants with a baseline value and at least 1 postbaseline value at or prior to Week 24 are included; LOCF imputation was used. The Week 16 value was carried over to Week 24 for participants who escaped early at Week 16.</population>

        <description>A EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity and an attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the DAS-28 score. A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 compared with Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2. A Moderate Response is defined as either: • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or, • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2.</description>

          <description>A EULAR response reflects an improvement in disease activity and an attainment of a lower degree of disease activity based on the DAS-28 score. A Good Response is defined as an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 compared with Baseline and attainment of a DAS28 score less than or equal to 3.2. A Moderate Response is defined as either: • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of greater than 0.6 and less than or equal to 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of less than or equal to 5.1 or, • an improvement (decrease) in the DAS28 of more than 1.2 and attainment of a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 52</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 52</title>
          <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. Negative mean changes from Baseline in the overall score indicate improvement in functional ability.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Dactylitis Severity Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>Dactylitis is characterized by swelling of the entire finger or toe. Each digit on the hands and feet will be rated as zero for no dactylitis or 1 for dactylitis present. The dactylitis severity score is the sum of the individual scores for each digit. The dactylitis severity score, ranging from 0 to 20, is the number of digits on the hands and feet with dactylitis present.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the CDAI Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>The Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is a composite index that is calculated as the sum of the: • 28 tender joint count (TJC), • 28 swollen joint count (SJC), • Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS), where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest; • Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity -measured on a 10 cm VAS, where 0 cm = lowest disease activity and 10 cm = highest. The CDAI score ranges from 0-76 where lower scores indicate less disease activity. The following thresholds of disease activity have been defined for the CDAI: Remission: ≤ 2.8 Low Disease Activity: &gt; 2.8 and ≤ 10 Moderate Disease Activity: &gt; 10 and ≤ 22 High Disease Activity: &gt; 22.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with pre-existing enthesopathy whose MASES improved by ≥ 20% from Baseline after 52 weeks. The Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score quantitates inflammation of the entheses (enthesitis) by assessing pain at the following entheses (sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone): 1st costochondral joints left/right; 7th costochondral joints left/right; posterior superior iliac spine left/right; anterior superior iliac spine left/right; iliac crest left/right; 5th lumbar spinous process; and the proximal insertion of the Archilles tendon left/right. The MASES, ranging from 0 to 13, is the number of painful entheses out of 13 entheses. Two-sided 95% confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events During the Placebo-Controlled Period</title>
        <description>A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) is an AE with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of Investigational Product (IP). An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

        <description>A TEAE is an AE with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of Investigational Product (IP) and no later than 28 days after the last dose of IP. An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
