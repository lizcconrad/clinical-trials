    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to provide better information about contraception to women having
      an abortion so that they are less likely to have another unintended unwanted pregnancy.

      Participating subjects will receive their choice of contraception following their abortion
      and if this choice is an IUD they will be randomly assigned to one of two types of copper
      intrauterine devices.

      All participating women will fill out a survey about their contraceptive choices at the time
      of their abortion as well as at 3, 6, and 12 months afterwards. The investigators will also
      follow pregnancy rates at 1 through 5 years after the abortion to see which form of
      contraception was most effective.

      The investigators expect to find that IUDs are the most effective form of contraception but
      that the types of copper IUDs currently available in Canada are not known to be as effective
      as those available in other countries, for which high quality evidence is available. The
      investigators hope to use this data to determine the effectiveness of copper IUDs available
      in Canada.

      This prospective randomized controlled trial will examine satisfaction and effectiveness of
      post abortion contraception by comparing the two types of copper IUDs currently available in
      Canada, and including a non-interventional group of other contraceptive options.

      The primary outcome measure is one year expulsion rates of copper IUDs places post abortion.
      Secondary outcomes are satisfaction with current method at 3, 6, and 12 months post-abortion,
      retention rates and repeat abortion rate over one year. One and five year pregnancy rates
      will be analyzed using access to universal health care databases.

      Our results will provide the first information on the effectiveness of post abortion
      contraceptive methods currently available in Canada.

    <description>Participants who elect to have an IUD inserted at the time of abortion will be randomized to either Arm I or Arm II. In this arm participants will receive the Flexi T 380(+) IUD. The participant is counseled that she may leave the device in for up to five years. She will be followed for up to five years to determine expulsion rate, discontinuation rate, pregnancy rate, and overall satisfaction with form of contraception.</description>

Groups - Participants will be in one of the five following groups Group A - Oral contraceptive pill 28day supply provided after abortion Group B - Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-provera)150mg IM provided after abortion, lasts for 3 months Group C - Ethinyl estradiol and etonogestrel (Nuva ring) provided at time of abortion, lasts for 28 days Group D - Condoms provided at time of abortion Group E - Other</description>
