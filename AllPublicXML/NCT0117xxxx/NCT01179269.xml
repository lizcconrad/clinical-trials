  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer worldwide with approximately 1.2 million new cases
      each year. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for greater than 80% of all lung
      carcinomas in Western countries. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients
      with early stage disease (Stage I and II), but at least 50% of these patients will relapse
      locally and/or develop distant metastases. Furthermore, 70% of patients with NSCLC are
      non-resectable at the time of their diagnosis due to either locally advanced or metastatic
      disease. The long-term prognosis for patients with NSCLC remains poor with the overall 5-year
      survival rate less than 15%. The low survival rate may be attributed to the high incidence of
      unresectable disease at presentation and the inability of systemic therapy to cure metastatic
      disease. There is a clear need for improvement in the treatment of NSCLC.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate of pazopanib
      in combination with paclitaxel in the treatment of subjects with advanced NSCLC. Tumor
      response will be assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1). A subject is defined as a responder if he/she sustains a
      complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) for at least 4 weeks at any time during
      treatment. A subject without a post-baseline assessment of response will be considered a
      non-responder.

      A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pazopanib
      in combination with paclitaxel in the treatment of subjects with advanced NSCLC. Safety and
      tolerability endpoints will consist of the evaluation of adverse events (AEs), exposure,
      withdrawals due to AEs, dose reductions or interruptions, and changes from baseline in vital
      signs and clinical laboratory parameters.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of Stage IIIB (with confirmed
             malignant pleural effusion) or Stage IV NSCLC.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2

          -  No prior systemic first-line therapy for Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC with chemotherapy or any
             other biologic therapy. Prior surgery and/or localized irradiation for NSCLC are
             permitted. Palliative radiation therapy must have ended 14 days prior to first dose of
             pazopanib. Subject with recurrence after previous NSCLC that has been treated with
             surgery with or without adjuvant chemotherapy/radiation for curative intent are
             eligible, provided 12 months have passed since this treatment ended.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Appropriate for doublet therapy as first line therapy. At discretion of investigator.
