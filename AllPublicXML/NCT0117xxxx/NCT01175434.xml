  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this new translational project is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of
      implementing school-based directly observed therapy of preventive asthma medications in a
      real-world setting, using state-of-the-art web-based technology for systematic screening,
      electronic report generation, and communication between nurses, caregivers, and primary care
      providers. With the use of a novel method to improve adherence and subsequently reduce
      morbidity, the investigators hypothesize that this novel adaptation of school-based asthma
      care will; 1) be feasible and acceptable among this population and among school and community
      stakeholders, and 2) yield reduced asthma morbidity (symptom-free days, absenteeism, and
      emergency room / urgent care use for asthma care). The investigators anticipate that
      enhancing preventive healthcare for young urban children with asthma through partnerships
      with the schools using a novel technology will yield improved health, prevention of
      suffering, decreased absenteeism from school, and reduced healthcare costs.

    <description>The primary outcome is asthma morbidity between groups. We will measure asthma morbidity by looking at the average number of symptom-free days, over 2 weeks, at each bi-monthly follow-up time point over the school year. Number of days without asthma symptoms will be reported by the child's caregiver.</description>

    <description>We will evaluate the cost effectiveness to implement and sustain the web-based system in schools.

    <description>For children assigned to the School-Based Medication group, an asthma coordinator will send the child's primary care physician a report indicating the child's asthma symptoms, and will recommend that the child receive a preventive asthma medication at school. If the child's doctor agrees, the preventive asthma medication will be delivered to the child's school and to his/her home by a local pharmacy. The child's school nurse will begin directly observed therapy of the preventive asthma medication at school, and will routinely assess the child's asthma symptoms throughout the school year.</description>

               3. &gt;2 days per month with nighttime symptoms

               4. ≥2 episodes of asthma during the past year that have required systemic
                  corticosteroids

          3. Age ≥3 and ≤10 years.

          4. Attending school in participating Rochester City School District preschools or

        <title>Average Number of Symptom-free Days Over 14 Days; (Symptom-free Days Are Averaged Over 4 Bi-monthly Follow-ups)</title>
        <description>The primary outcome is asthma morbidity between groups. We will measure asthma morbidity by looking at the average number of symptom-free days, over 2 weeks, at each bi-monthly follow-up time point over the school year. Number of days without asthma symptoms will be reported by the child's caregiver.</description>

            <description>For children assigned to the School-Based Medication group, an asthma coordinator will send the child's primary care physician a report indicating the child's asthma symptoms, and will recommend that the child receive a preventive asthma medication at school. If the child's doctor agrees, the preventive asthma medication will be delivered to the child's school and to his/her home by a local pharmacy. The child's school nurse will begin directly observed therapy of the preventive asthma medication at school, and will routinely assess the child's asthma symptoms throughout the school year.</description>

        <description>We will evaluate the cost effectiveness to implement and sustain the web-based system in schools. We will review the cost of the intervention using three main categories of costs; programmatic costs (costs of initiating and running the program), productivity costs, and medical costs estimated at the individual child level.</description>
