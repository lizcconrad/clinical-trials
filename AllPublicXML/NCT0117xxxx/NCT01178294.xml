    <description>The initial serious (&quot;qualifying&quot;) bleeding episode for each subject was analyzed for the primary efficacy outcome measure. A 'positive response' is defined as 'effective' (bleeding stopped with clinical control and FVIII levels of 50% or higher ) or 'partially effective' (bleeding reduced with clinical stabilization and FVIII levels of 20% or higher) control of bleeding, as determined by the investigator using a 4-point rating scale (effective - partially effective - poorly effective - not effective). 'Poorly effective' is defined as 'bleeding slightly reduced or unchanged and FVIII levels of less than 50%'. 'Not effective' is defined as 'bleeding worsening and FVIII levels of less than 50%'.</description>

             the study

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with the study design, protocol requirements, or
             the follow-up procedures

Two US sites enrolled subjects under the expanded access protocol OBI-1-301a and subsequently under protocol OBI-1-301. Another 2 US sites enrolled subjects under OBI-1-301a only.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>29 subjects were enrolled and all were treated with OBI-1. Data from the expanded access subjects (Protocol 301a, n= 4) are included with the data from subjects enrolled under Protocol OBI-1-301 (n=25). 10 subjects discontinued prematurely and 18 completed the study.

        <description>The initial serious (&quot;qualifying&quot;) bleeding episode for each subject was analyzed for the primary efficacy outcome measure. A 'positive response' is defined as 'effective' (bleeding stopped with clinical control and FVIII levels of 50% or higher ) or 'partially effective' (bleeding reduced with clinical stabilization and FVIII levels of 20% or higher) control of bleeding, as determined by the investigator using a 4-point rating scale (effective - partially effective - poorly effective - not effective). 'Poorly effective' is defined as 'bleeding slightly reduced or unchanged and FVIII levels of less than 50%'.
