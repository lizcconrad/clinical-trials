    <textblock>
      In the recent decades, with technology development, computer workstation has become
      fundamental both at work and at home environments, and is now used routinely for many
      purposes. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are most often characterized by backaches, neck and
      upper extremities pain, discomfort and pain in joints, muscles and soft tissues. Since it has
      been found that many musculoskeletal disorders are connected, among others, to biomechanical
      and psychosocial factors relating to a person's work environment, the literature refers to
      them as Work Related MSD (WRMSD). Risk factors correlated with WRMSD include repetitive
      motions, awkward positions or static muscle loading over prolonged periods of time, use of
      high keystroke force, direct mechanical pressure, vibration and extreme temperatures.
      Computer operators found to be sitting statically for a long time in front of the computer
      and keyboard, with limited options of changing body position. Psychosocial factors have also
      been implicated in the workstation musculoskeletal disorders with computer operators. Workers
      with WRMSD may suffer from persistent pain, loss of function and work disability. Therefore,
      it may include changes in the employment and earnings for injured workers. The complex nature
      of these injuries suggests that workplace rehabilitation interventions are a crucial aspect
      of treatment management.

      The main objective of this study is to explore the use of biofeedback intervention, based on
      tele-rehabilitation principle, with computer operators suffer from WRMSD. Treatment efficacy
      will be tested by use of RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) method. Data analysis will be
      done by ANOVA Repeated Measures.

      Hypothesis: Biofeedback intervention, based on tele-rehabilitation principle, will be found
      effective with computer operators suffer from WRMSD.
