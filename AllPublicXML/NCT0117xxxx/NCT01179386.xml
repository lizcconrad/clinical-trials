      Adolescents suffering of ADHD may have impaired driving performance. The investigators would
      like to check the differences in driving performance in young adults(aged: 15-18 years) with
      ADHD by driving simulator and seat pressure mapping with and without methylphenidate
      medication.

    <textblock>
      Adolescents with ADHD who are treated with one of the methylphenidate medication that is in
      use in Israel(Ritalin,Ritalin SR,Concerta,Ritalin LA)will be tested by driving simulator and
      seat pressure mapping by 2 stages: 1.when they are taking the medication that they are taking
      every day to control ADHD and: 2. without medication ( after 4 day washout period).
