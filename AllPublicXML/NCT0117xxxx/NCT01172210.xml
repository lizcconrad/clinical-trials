      A substantial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) also meet criteria for a
      co-occurring substance use disorder, such as alcohol abuse or dependence; however, research
      examining this sub-group of patients with BN is limited. Understanding characteristics common
      to both eating and alcohol use disorders may enhance understanding of the mechanisms that
      could contribute to the co-occurrence and perpetuation of these disorders. Individuals with
      BN and alcohol use disorders appear to share some behavioral traits, and therefore, the
      primary aim of the current study is to compare patients with BN with and without an alcohol
      use disorder and normal controls on measures assessing an individual's mood and ability to
      perform certain tasks. Participants will be asked to complete computer-administered and
      paper-and-pencil assessments and two laboratory test meals on separate days. By probing the
      underpinnings of BN and alcohol use disorders, the investigators can determine whether these
      disorders have a shared diathesis, which will lay an essential foundation for future research
      to examine biological and genetic correlates of these disorders. Finally, as little is known
      about the treatment of patients with BN and a co-occurring alcohol use disorder, an
      exploratory aim of the current study is evaluate the suitability and efficacy of a 20-session
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) addressing both bulimic symptoms and alcohol use.

      A substantial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa (BN) also meet criteria for a
      co-occurring substance use disorder, such as alcohol abuse or dependence; however, research
      examining this sub-group of patients with BN is limited. Understanding characteristics common
      to both eating and alcohol use disorders may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that
      could contribute to the co-occurrence and perpetuation of these disorders. The primary aim of
      the current study is to compare patients with BN with and without an alcohol use disorder and
      normal controls on computer-administered and paper-and-pencil assessments and in two
      laboratory test meals (a binge meal and a normal meal) on separate days. Participants will
      also complete self-report and interview measures of eating disorder symptoms and alcohol
      consumption. By probing the underpinnings of BN and alcohol use disorders, we can determine
      whether these disorders have a shared diathesis, which will lay an essential foundation for
      future research to examine biological and genetic correlates of these disorders. Finally, as
      little is known about the treatment of patients with BN and a co occurring alcohol use
      disorder, an exploratory aim of the current study is to evaluate the suitability and efficacy
      of a 20-session cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) addressing both bulimic symptoms and
      alcohol use.
