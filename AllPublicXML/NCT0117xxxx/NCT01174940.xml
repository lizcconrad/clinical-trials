    <textblock>
      To study the effect of ECP with Uvadex® in conjunction with a standard myeloablative
      conditioning regimen on the incidence of acute and chronic GvHD in patients undergoing an
      allogeneic related or unrelated BMT or PBSC transplant, for treatment of hematologic or
      lymphoproliferative malignancies.

    <textblock>
      This study is to test the concept that using ECP treatment prior to and after an allogeneic
      bone marrow transplant (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant will prevent the
      development of GvHD. This study is not designed to detect a specific treatment effect.
      However, some statements about the outcome of the study are possible. A sample size of n = 21
      patients could detect a statistically significant difference between the expected rate of
      GvHD in an untreated population, 60%, and our hypothesized rate, 30%, for the
      matched-unrelated recipients. This calculation is based on a one-sample, two-sided chi-square
      test at the 5% level of significance with 80% power.

      Patients will receive ECP from day -10 and day -8 before transplant and then from day of
      engraftment absolute neutrophil count (ANC&gt;500) until day 90 after transplant. Patients who
      enter the study will receive a BMT or PBSC transplant from a donor who is matched unrelated
      (8/10 to 10/10 match). Rates of acute GvHD and chronic GvHD that occur in patients are 50-70%
      for the matched-unrelated donor transplant.

      The choice of sample size is 21 patients. The analysis will determine if there are favorable
      trends for a treatment effect. Comparison on survival, and rates of acute and chronic GvHD
      will be made with historical controls who have undergone similar myeloablative transplant
      from an unrelated donor.

    <description>Patients will receive 2 ECP treatments prior to the commencement of the high dose chemotherapy and then for two consecutive days every two weeks starting from post engraftment (ANC &gt; 500) up to day 90 (total of 10 treatments). This may be given as an outpatient procedure.
The dose of UVADEX® used to inoculate these cells will be calculated based on the treatment volume collected during the plasma/buffy coat collection process, using the following formula:
Treatment Volume in mL X 0.017 of UVADEX® (20 mcg/ml) required for administration into the recirculation bag = Amount of UVADEX® (in mLs) required for administration into the recirculation bag.
After the cells are inoculated with UVADEX®, the buffy coat/plasma suspension is irradiated with ultraviolet-A light and then re-infused back into the patient.</description>

          -  Patients are eligible if they have a diagnosis of one of the following hematologic or
             lymphoproliferative malignancies for which a treatment option would be an allogeneic
             BMT or PBSC transplant:
