      Oral administration has many advantages above intravenously administrated drugs for patients.
      Up to now, oral administration of docetaxel as single agent has not been feasible due to low
      and variable bioavailability. This low systematic exposure to docetaxel can effectively be
      increased after co-administration of ritonavir. The department of pharmacy of the Slotervaart
      Hospital and Netherlands Cancer Institute developed a solid oral dosage form for docetaxel,
      ModraDoc001 10 mg capsules.

      Two other novel dosage forms of docetaxel with improved pharmaceutical characteristics, have
      been developed: ModraDoc003 10 mg tablets and ModraDoc004 10/50 mg tablets. The systemic
      exposure after administration of those forms is now being investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bioavailability of docetaxel is limited due to metabolising cytochrome P450 (CYP)
      enzymes, which are abundantly present in the gastrointestinal tract.

      Inhibition of CYP3A4 enzymes with ritonavir (an anti-retroviral drug) has in previously
      conducted proof-of-concept and phase I trials, proven to enhance the bioavailability of oral
      docetaxel.

      Oral administration of docetaxel has been investigated in five clinical trials, all initiated
      by the Netherlands Cancer Institute - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital (NKI-AVL). The
      department of pharmacy of the Slotervaart Hospital and Netherlands Cancer Institute developed
      a solid oral dosage form for docetaxel, ModraDoc001 10 mg capsules. This formulation has now
      been investigated in more than 40 patients in a first clinical study. The preliminary results
      with ModraDoc001 10mg are promising and a linearity between systemic exposure to docetaxel
      and the applied dose of ModraDoc001 10mg capsules is seen. In an attempt to further improve
      and prolong the systemic exposure we will explore a twice daily dosing schedule.

      Two other novel dosage forms for docetaxel, ModraDoc003 10 mg tablets and ModraDoc004 10/50
      mg tablets, were developed. Both are spray-dried solid dispersions of docetaxel pressed in
      tablets. The distinction between both is that ritonavir is included in the co-formulation of
      ModraDoc004 10/50 mg tablets (10 mg docetaxel and 50 mg ritonavir). Both dosage forms will be
      investigated in arm B to see whether these new formulations have comparable pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of docetaxel to the capsule formulation.

      Arm A Arm A is a dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)of weekly
      bi-daily ModraDoc001 10 mg capsules. This study will be done with a classical dose escalation
      design. The starting dose will be 40 mg BID. This dose is based on a safety of weekly 80 mg
      single dose in the previously conducted study.

      Arm B ModraDoc003 10 mg tablets and ModraDoc004 10/50 mg tablets will be investigated in arm
      B to see whether these new formulations have comparable pharmacokinetic characteristics of
      docetaxel to the capsule formulation od ModraDoc001 10 mg.

      Another part of this study is the screening for 2 different polymorphism, C1236T (for
      MDR1)and CYP3A4*1B. Polymorphic variants may influence the absorption and elimination of
      docetaxel and ritonavir.

      Arm D is a dose escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)of weekly
      bi-daily ModraDoc006 10 mg tablets. This study will be done with a classical dose escalation
      design. The starting dose will be 20 mg BID. This dose is based on a safety of BID weekly
      ModraDoc001 mg in the previously conducted arm A.

    <description>The maximal tolerated dose (defined as the highest dose resulting in no more that 1/6 probability of causing a dose limiting toxicities defined in the protocol) of bi-daily ModraDoc001 10mg capsules with ritonavir will be assessed in Arm A.
