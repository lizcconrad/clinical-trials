  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy and safety of
      active acupuncture versus placebo acupuncture for the treatment of postpartum depression. The
      investigators hypothesis is that active acupuncture would be superior to placebo acupuncture
      in the short-term treatment of postpartum depression.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized, controlled, subject- and assessor-blind trial in patients
      with postpartum depression. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to active acupuncture
      or placebo acupuncture. The subjects will receive acupuncture treatment twice per week for 4
      consecutive weeks. The acupuncturist of this trial will not participate in data collection
      and data entry. The trial assessor will be blind to the subjects' treatment allocation.

    <description>Active acupuncture regimen consists of electroacupuncture stimulation on cranial and body acupoints which are empirical for treating depression in term of traditional Chinese medicine theory. It is done by a registered Chinese medicine practitioner with at least 3 years experience of providing acupuncture treatment. An electric-stimulator is connected to these needles to give an electric-stimulation in a continuous wave The needles will be left for 30 min and then removed. Acupuncture treatment will consist of two sessions per week for 4 consecutive weeks.</description>
