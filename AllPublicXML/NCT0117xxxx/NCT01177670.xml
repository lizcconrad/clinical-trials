      The Adiana Post-Approval Clinical Study (APACS) has been designed to compile information on
      the efficacy and safety of the Adiana Permanent Contraception System in the post market
      setting. Specifically, data will be collected that is relevant to the evaluation of the
      safety and efficacy of the Adiana System for women who desire permanent birth control by
      occlusion of the fallopian tubes. This study is an observational study that is not intended
      to test specific hypotheses.

      Adiana Post-Approval Clinical Study is a prospective, single armed, multi-center,
      observational study that is designed to provide additional efficacy and safety data regarding
      the FDA-approved Adiana Permanent Contraception System. This study will be conducted at 8-10
      clinical sites and enroll 1000 subjects. Enrolled subjects will have baseline data collected
      at the time of their Adiana procedure and will then be followed for a period of 2 years with
      visits occurring at 3 months following the Adiana procedure, 6 months following Adiana
      procedure (as applicable), 12 and 24 months post relying date.
