    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a 10 week Internet-delivered CBT
      treatment for patients diagnosed with IBS. The patients' work with the treatment and is
      supported through online contact with a therapist.

      Approximately 86 patients will be included in the study and randomized to either condition.

      All included patients are assessed one week before the treatment starts. After 10 weeks (post
      treatment). Follow-up assessments are conducted at 3 and 12 months follow-up after treatment.

      Patients in treatment condition are hypothesized to experience significant reduction IBS
      symptoms, societal costs and quality of life compared to patients on waiting list.
