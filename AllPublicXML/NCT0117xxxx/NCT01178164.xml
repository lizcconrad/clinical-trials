  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked multisytemic lysosomal disorder caused by
      alpha-galactosidase deficiency. Globotriaosylc√©ramide (Gb3) deposits are observed in almost
      all tissues examined. Signs of the disease appear earlier and are more severe in affected
      males than in females. Myocardiopathy, renal failure and neurological signs including chronic
      pain and peripheral neuropathies are the most frequent signs. The availability of two
      enzymatic replacement therapies now provides a specific and effective treatment for patients.
      The prevalence of FD is estimated between 1/40,000 and 1/117,000. The frequency of Fabry
      disease has previously been estimated in several series of patients presenting one single
      sign, ie renal failure, hypertrophic myocardiopathy and early onset stroke. However, no data
      are available about the prevalence of FD in populations of patients suffering from chronic
      pains of unknown origin.

      The diagnosis of FD will be performed by standard procedures following international
      recommendations. These require the search for a deficiency of alphagalactosidase A activity
      on leucocytes in males and genetic analysis of the GLA gene in females (Lidove et al. 2007).

      The patients in whom the diagnosis of FD is established during this study, will be call in
      for an additional visit in the Investigating Centre in order to confirm the diagnosis and
      propose suitable assessment and care.
