    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether a 6 week intervention is effective in
      preventing the worsening of depressive symptoms and development of clinical depression in
      low-income African American pregnant and recently delivered women who are enrolled in home
      visiting programs.

      This study will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with women from four Baltimore
      City home visiting programs. We will screen 200 women who are pregnant or have a child &lt; 6
      months for study inclusion; 91 women at elevated risk for developing postpartum depression
      (PPD) will be randomized to an intervention (MB Course) or usual home visiting control group.
      Women in the intervention group will receive the 6-week MB Course delivered in a group
      setting by the Study Clinician with reinforcing messages provided by home visitors during
      1-on-1 home visits, while women in the attention control will receive usual home visiting
      services and information on postpartum depression. Primary outcomes include depressive
      symptoms and depressive episodes.

    <description>Women in the intervention condition will receive 6 two-hour intervention sessions delivered weekly in a group format by the Study Clinician. Each session contains didactic instruction on core content, as well as activities and group discussion. One of the strengths of embedding the MB Course within home visiting is our ability to have home visitors reinforce the material presented by the Study Clinician. The 6-week curriculum is divided into three modules: (a) pleasant activities, (b) thoughts, and (c) relationships with others. Each module has two sessions. These sessions map onto core cognitive-behavioral concepts.</description>
