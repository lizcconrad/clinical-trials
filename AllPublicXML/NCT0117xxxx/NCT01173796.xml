      This prospective, randomized study aims to compare the impact of ablation of perimitral
      flutter only versus cardioversion and repeat isolation of pulmonary veins with ablation of
      additional triggers, on procedure outcome.

      Background: In recent years, catheter ablation has been accepted as the treatment-of-choice
      for drug-refractory atrial fibrillation (AF). It is centered around isolating pulmonary veins
      (PVs) and its success rate in curing AF is very high (56%-85%) (1). However, despite
      isolation of this dominant source of triggers, recurrent tachyarrhythmia is the major
      complication of this procedure with peri-mitral atrial flutter (PMFL) being the most common
      macro-reentrant arrhythmia in context of AF ablation (2). These often drug-refractory
      arrhythmias are frequently associated with more severe symptoms than the original AF (3) and
      warrant the necessity for redo-ablation.

      This study aims to compare the impact of two different redo-ablation strategies on the
      procedure outcome; (1) ablation of the perimitral flutter only and (2) cardioversion and
      repeat isolation of pulmonary veins (PV) with ablation of additional triggers.

      Study method: A total number of 65 AF patients presenting for redo-ablation and PMFL will be
      randomized to perimitral flutter ablation only or cardioversion and re-isolation (PVI) plus
      ablation of additional triggers. Additional triggers will be identified with the help of
      post-ablation drug provocation with isoproterenol. Patients will enter a follow-up period of
      12 months after the ablation procedure, when they will be monitored for recurrence of
      arrhythmia detected either by in-clinic or remote device interrogation at 1, 3, 6 and 12
      month post-procedure.
