    <measure>7-point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) Profiles at 12 Weeks and 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>7-point Self-monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) Profiles are measures of blood glucose taken 7 times a day at the morning pre-meal, morning 2-hours post-meal, midday pre-meal, midday 2-hours post-meal, evening pre-meal, evening 2-hours post-meal, and 0300 hour [3 am]. Each participant took measures on 3 non-consecutive days and the average was calculated for each of the 7 time points. The mean of the 7-point averages was calculated for all the participants at baseline, Weeks 12 and 24. The least squares (LS) mean was estimated from mixed-effects model with repeated measures that included the baseline value of the variable as a covariate, treatment, country, baseline glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)stratification level, week of visit, and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects, and participant and error as random effects.</description>

    <measure>Glycemic Variability From the 7-point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) Profiles at 12 Weeks and 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 7-point SMBG profile was calculated as the average blood glucose concentration across the 7 pre-specified time points in a day that was then averaged over 3 non-consecutive days in the 2 weeks prior to the 12 week visit and 24 week visit. Glycemic variability was calculated as the standard deviation of the 7-point SMBG profiles. Standard deviation was first calculated for each day and then averaged over 3 non-consecutive days for each visit. The least squares (LS) mean was estimated from mixed-effects model with repeated measures that included the baseline value of the variable as a covariate, treatment, country, baseline glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)stratification level, week of visit, and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects, and participant and error as random effects.</description>

    <measure>Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) Score at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ITSQ: validated instrument containing 22 items which are measured on a 7-point scale: 1 (no bother at all) to 7 (a tremendous bother) used to assess insulin treatment satisfaction. Items are divided into 5 domains: Inconvenience of Regimen (5 items: domain score range 5 to 35), Lifestyle Flexibility (3 items: domain score range 3 to 21), Glycemic Control (3 items: domain score range 3 to 21), Hypoglycemic Control (5 items: domain score range 5 to 35), Insulin Delivery Device (6 items: domain score range 6 to 42) lower scores reflect better outcome. ITSQ Total Overall Score ranged from 22 to 154. Raw domain scores transformed on 0-100 scale, where transformed domain score = 100×[(7-raw domain score)/6]. Higher scores indicate better treatment satisfaction. Least squares (LS) mean estimated from analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included baseline score as covariate and treatment, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) stratum, and country as fixed effects.</description>

    <measure>Perceptions About Medications-Diabetes 21 (PAM-D21) Questionnaire Score at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PAM-D21 is a validated questionnaire consisting of 21 items to assess a participant's perceptions about their diabetes treatment regimens and perceived emotional and physical side-effects. The PAM-D21 consists of 4 subscales: Convenience/Flexibility (items 1 to 3); Perceived Effectiveness (items 4 to 6); Emotional Effects (items 7 to 11); and Physical Effects (items 12 to 21). Item scores range from 1 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). Subscale scores were linearly transformed to a 0-100, with higher score corresponds to better perceptions about diabetes medications. The least squares (LS) mean was estimated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included baseline score as a covariate and treatment, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) stratum, and country as fixed effects.</description>

        <description>7-point Self-monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) Profiles are measures of blood glucose taken 7 times a day at the morning pre-meal, morning 2-hours post-meal, midday pre-meal, midday 2-hours post-meal, evening pre-meal, evening 2-hours post-meal, and 0300 hour [3 am]. Each participant took measures on 3 non-consecutive days and the average was calculated for each of the 7 time points. The mean of the 7-point averages was calculated for all the participants at baseline, Weeks 12 and 24.

        <title>Glycemic Variability From the 7-point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) Profiles at 12 Weeks and 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>The 7-point SMBG profile was calculated as the average blood glucose concentration across the 7 pre-specified time points in a day that was then averaged over 3 non-consecutive days in the 2 weeks prior to the 12 week visit and 24 week visit. Glycemic variability was calculated as the standard deviation of the 7-point SMBG profiles. Standard deviation was first calculated for each day and then averaged over 3 non-consecutive days for each visit. The least squares (LS) mean was estimated from mixed-effects model with repeated measures that included the baseline value of the variable as a covariate, treatment, country, baseline glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)stratification level, week of visit, and treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects, and participant and error as random effects.</description>

        <title>Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) Score at 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>ITSQ: validated instrument containing 22 items which are measured on a 7-point scale: 1 (no bother at all) to 7 (a tremendous bother) used to assess insulin treatment satisfaction. Items are divided into 5 domains: Inconvenience of Regimen (5 items: domain score range 5 to 35), Lifestyle Flexibility (3 items: domain score range 3 to 21), Glycemic Control (3 items: domain score range 3 to 21), Hypoglycemic Control (5 items: domain score range 5 to 35), Insulin Delivery Device (6 items: domain score range 6 to 42) lower scores reflect better outcome. ITSQ Total Overall Score ranged from 22 to 154. Raw domain scores transformed on 0-100 scale, where transformed domain score = 100×[(7-raw domain score)/6]. Higher scores indicate better treatment satisfaction.

        <title>Perceptions About Medications-Diabetes 21 (PAM-D21) Questionnaire Score at 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>PAM-D21 is a validated questionnaire consisting of 21 items to assess a participant's perceptions about their diabetes treatment regimens and perceived emotional and physical side-effects. The PAM-D21 consists of 4 subscales: Convenience/Flexibility (items 1 to 3); Perceived Effectiveness (items 4 to 6); Emotional Effects (items 7 to 11); and Physical Effects (items 12 to 21). Item scores range from 1 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). Subscale scores were linearly transformed to a 0-100, with higher score corresponds to better perceptions about diabetes medications. The least squares (LS) mean was estimated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included baseline score as a covariate and treatment, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) stratum, and country as fixed effects.</description>
