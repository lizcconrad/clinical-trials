  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a challenging complication of advanced liver disease, occurs in
      approximately 30-45% of patients with cirrhosis. The treatment of choice is non-absorbable
      disaccharides, such as lactulose and lactitol.Probiotics are effective in the treatment of
      minimal hepatic encephalopathy which precipitates hepatic encephalopathy. The investigators
      will assess the effects of lactulose and probiotics for the prevention of recurrence of HE
      (secondary prophylaxis) in patients after the recovery of an episode of overt hepatic
      encephalopathy.

    <textblock>
      Hepatic encephalopathy, a challenging complication of advanced liver disease, occurs in
      approximately 30-45% of patients with cirrhosis and 10-50% of patients with transjugular
      intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.Although the occurrence of episodes of hepatic
      encephalopathy appears to be unrelated to the cause of cirrhosis,increases in the frequency
      and severity of such episodes predict an increased risk of death.A small metaanalysis
      determined that lactulose and lactitol were equally effective in the treatment of
      HE.Probiotics alter the gut flora resulting in decreased ammonia production and absorption
      due to decreased intraluminal pH. Also shown to alter the short chain fatty acid production,
      &amp; decrease intestinal permeability.Various studies have shown some improvement in either the
      prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy or results in neuropsychological tests with the
      use of probiotics.Lactulose and probiotics improves minimal hepatic encephalopathy in
      cirrhotic patients and it has also been shown that minimal hepatic encephalopathy predisposes
      the cirrhotic patient to HE.We will assess the effects of lactulose and probiotics for the
      prevention of recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy (secondary prophylaxis) in patients after
      the recovery of an episode of overt hepatic encephalopathy.
