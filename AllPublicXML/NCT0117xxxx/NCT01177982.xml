    <textblock>
      Objectives: This project is a Stage II behavioral development study designed to answer
      remaining critical questions necessary before disseminating Reinforcement Based Treatment
      (RBT) to the larger treatment community. These questions focus on the levels of intensity of
      RBT most efficacious for substance-using pregnant patients. Design: The proposed study
      utilizes a novel approach to conducting a controlled clinical trial, the sequential multiple
      assignment randomized trial (SMART) design. Participants (N=220) will first be randomized at
      treatment outset into either treatment-as-usual RBT or a reduced intensity RBT. All
      participants will receive a subsequent randomization based upon an assessment of their
      initial two weeks of treatment compliance. Early-non-compliant participants will be
      randomized to receive either the same or an increased level of RBT treatment intensity while
      early-compliant participants will be randomized to receive either the same or decreased level
      of treatment intensity and scope. Primary outcome measures include treatment completion, and
      maternal heroin, cocaine, and other illicit substance use. Secondary outcome measures include
      maternal measures of HIV risk behavior, and psychosocial functioning and neonatal measures of
      length of hospitalization, and birth outcomes. Significance: The proposed project's
      innovation includes: the novelty RBT, use of a cutting-edge SMART model, application of
      advanced statistical techniques and inclusion of a cost-effectiveness approach. The proposed
      project's significance is exceedingly high, as it will lay the foundation for later Stage III
      studies focused on dissemination of stepped care treatment programs for drug-addicted
      pregnant women that can be implemented not only in comprehensive care clinics but in diverse
      community settings that provide services to such women.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Treatment entry at or before 34 weeks EGA with singleton fetus.

          2. Evidence of opioid, cocaine and/or other primary illicit substance use.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe medical or psychiatric concomitant condition interfering with treatment or
             needing hospitalization.

          2. Age 17 years or younger.

          3. Geographical constraints. These women are admitted only for a residential
             detoxification and often have plans to obtain aftercare in an outpatient or
             residential facility in closer proximity to their home. Thus, this greater distance
             from CAP increases the likelihood that these women will not return to CAP and will not
             deliver in a hospital that functions under similar protocols that operate in Baltimore
             City for treating drug-exposed neonates.
