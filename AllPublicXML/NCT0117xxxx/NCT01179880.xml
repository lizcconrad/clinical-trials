      The safety and pharmacokinetics of topical application with E6005 ointment compared to
      vehicle will be evaluated in Japanese male patients with atopic dermatitis. Additionally, the
      efficacy of topical application with E6005 ointment will be explored in Japanese male
      patients with atopic dermatitis.
