  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears are a common injury that lead to pain and loss of function for those who
      suffer from it. Treatment includes the use of arthroscopic surgery to return function to the
      patient and reduce their pain. This study is interested in a technique that has the potential
      to improve patient outcomes in terms of less pain and better function after their surgery.
      Autologous Conditioned Plasma (ACP) or Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is the intervention of
      interest, which is simply the patient's own blood that is withdrawn and spun down to obtain a
      high concentration of cells called platelets. Platelets release growth factors important for
      healing, as well as fibrin, which acts like a biological glue. The PRP is then re-injected
      into the shoulder at the time of surgery and again at 4 weeks. It has been shown to
      accelerate healing in other studies for injuries such as chronic elbow tendinopathy, but
      there is no randomized controlled trial that evaluates the effect of PRP in rotator cuff
      tears. It is on this basis that the study is being performed. Participating patients will
      receive either a PRP injection or a placebo (normal saline) and the effects will be compared
      at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks based on a pain score and return to function questionnaires.
      The primary hypothesis for this study is that ACP compared with placebo is effective in
      reducing pain at the site of a rotator cuff injury that has undergone arthroscopic repair. It
      is expected that ACP administered during surgery and 4 weeks post-surgery will reduce 6-week
      pain scores compared to the placebo group.

    <description>To investigate the effect of ACP compared to placebo on pain scores in rotator cuff tears undergoing arthroscopic repair at 6 weeks.
Pain severity will be measured using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Subjects will be asked to rate their worst pain in their shoulder for the previous 24 hours on a 100 mm vertical scale with &quot;0&quot; indicating no pain at all and &quot;100&quot; indicating the worst pain the subject can imagine.</description>
