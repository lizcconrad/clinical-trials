      RATIONALE: 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy may lessen side effects caused by
      palliative radiation therapy and improve the quality of life of patients with lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy
      works in reducing the side effects of palliative radiation in patients with lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate that using technically sophisticated
      3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for the palliative treatment of lung cancer
      patients will result in equivalent degrees of symptom relief and a reduction in the primary
      endpoint of oesophagitis.

      Single arm therapeutic clinical study.

      RT Treatment Regimens:

      17 Gy/2 fractions or 20Gy/5 fractions or 39Gy/13 fractions

      Primary Endpoint:

      -The occurrence of Grade 3 or higher oesophagitis in the interval between start and 1-month
      post completion of treatment as determined by CTCAE Version 4.02

      Patients will be assessed pre treatment, during treatment, 2 weeks post completion of
      treatment, one month post completion of treatment, three months post completion of treatment,
      and three monthly thereafter

      -All patients who complete treatment (and whose on-treatment toxicity is documented) will be
      evaluable.

      Secondary Endpoint:

        -  Quality of Life Assessment. All patients will be required to complete the EORTC
           QLQ-C15-PAL (Version 1) and the Lung Specific Module (LC 13)

        -  The occurrence of other AEs

      Safety Endpoint:

      -Radio-induced oesophagitis, acute and long term, using the CTCAE Version 4.02.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status of &gt; or equal to 40%

          -  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic small cell or non-small cell lung cancer

          -  The presence of intra-thoracic symptoms requiring palliative treatment

          -  WBI (if required) is permitted

          -  The patient's condition must permit waiting for the 3-dimensional design process to be
             implemented. This will be at the discretion of the Consultant Physician

          -  Patients presenting with pleural effusions - provided the pleural effusion does not
             prevent the reasonably accurate delineation of the target volume

          -  Intra-thoracic disease requiring palliation must be clearly evident on a diagnostic CT
             scan

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months (assessed by clinician)

          -  Provision of written informed consent in line with ICH-GCP guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -In the opinion of the Investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systematic
        disease (e.g. unstable or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac, hepatic or renal disease)
