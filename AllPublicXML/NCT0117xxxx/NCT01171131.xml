  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to determine if the biological fluids (blood/saliva) from chronic
      brain-injured patients (both blast and non-penetrating TBI) contain reproducible protein
      markers. To accomplish this two populations of chronic TBI patients who are receiving
      treatment at The Institute for Research and Rehabilitation (TIRR): blast injury victims and
      non-penetrating TBI will be studied. Using multiple proteomic approaches including mass
      spectrometry, multiplex ELISAs, and antibody microarrays, as well as RNA profiling, the
      investigators aim to identify biomarkers in the blood/saliva of patients suffering from
      chronic TBI and to determine the similarities/differences between the blast and
      non-penetrating injury groups. Identification of these biochemical changes will give insight
      into the long-lasting changes associated with head injury, and may identify new targets for
      treating the associated pathologies.
