    <textblock>
      Multicenter clinical trial, phase III, controlled by active medicine, open, randomized,
      enroll 962 children, 2 to 12 years old, that suffer acute inflammation upper airway
      characterized by non-productive cough, daytime/nighttime, with duration for at least 3 and no
      more than 5 consecutive days (without systemic/topic use of medication during this period)
      followed by nasal congestion, with or without associate other nasal symptoms (sneezing, runny
      nose, nasal itching and/or mouth breathing). The subjects will be allocated in 2 parallel
      groups, and will receive the medicines of study, according of the randomization.
