  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss commonly occurs in lung cancer patients, negatively influencing their quality of
      life, treatment response and survival. Gains in lean body mass are difficult to achieve in
      cancer unless specific metabolic abnormalities are targeted. It is our hypothesis that a
      nutritional supplement containing a high amount of essential amino acids will target the
      metabolic alterations of cancer patients. Preliminary research performed in our laboratory in
      elderly supports this hypothesis. We hypothesize that intake of an essential amino acid
      nutritional supplement will positively influence protein synthesis rate in advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Furthermore, insight in the underlying mechanism of the
      higher anabolic response of the essential amino acid supplement will be examined. This
      information will potentially enable us to formulate a supplement that is more effective than
      normal food intake, and that will reduce the need for muscle protein breakdown.

      In this study, we will test the following hypothesis: A high-leucine essential amino acid
      mixture stimulates whole body protein synthesis (and in this way protein anabolism) to a
      larger extent than a regular balanced mixture of total (essential and non-essential) amino
      acids in NSCLC patients with and without recent weight loss. The principal endpoint will be
      the extent of stimulation of protein synthesis rate as this is the principal mechanism by
      which either amino acid or protein intake causes muscle anabolism. This project will provide
      important clinical information, based on novel fundamental basic knowledge on the process and
      the specific underlying mechanisms of muscle wasting in patients with NSCLC, and the role of
      EAA as a potential anabolic substrate. In this way, it will provide preliminary data for the
      development of nutritional strategies that will prevent or even stop this process of ongoing
      muscle loss in NSCLC.
