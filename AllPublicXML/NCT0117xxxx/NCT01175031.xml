      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate diagnostic agreement and determine the accuracy
      of the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device compared to simultaneous, attended
      clinical polysomnography (PSG) in identifying breathing events in participants previously
      diagnosed with complex sleep apnea (CompSAS), complex sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes
      respiration (CSR), or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

      Study Objectives: To compare a positive airway pressure (PAP) device's detection of
      respiratory events and airway status during device detected apneas with events scored on
      simultaneous polysomnography (PSG).

      Design: Prospective PSGs of patients with sleep apnea using a new-generation PAP device.

      Settings: Four clinical and academic sleep centers.

      Patients: Forty-five patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and complex sleep apnea
      (Comp SA) performed a PSG on PAP levels adjusted to induce respiratory events.

      Interventions: None.

    <time_frame>During a single night of polysomnography lasting an average of 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The following breathing events: RERAs, central apneas, periodic breathing, obstructive apneas, and hypopneas in patients previously diagnosed with CompSAS or OSA detected by simultaneous Polysomnography and REMstar Auto with A-Flex were compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device Detected Apneas as Detected by Philips Respironics (PR) System One</measure>
    <time_frame>During a single night of polysomnography lasting an average of 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>All device-detected apneas were tabulated. Then they were broken down into obstructed airway apneas and clear airway apneas. The results are recorded below as apneas with obstructed airway and apneas with clear airway.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device-Detected Obstructed Airway Apnea Agreement</measure>
    <time_frame>During a single night of polysomnography lasting an average of 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Device-Detected Apneas were broken down and then reviewed with the manually scored apneas. Of the Obstructed Airway apneas they were broken down into a few different categories: Manually Scored Obstructive Apneas, Manually Scored Central Apneas, Manually Scored Hypopneas and Manually Scored RERAs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Device-Detected Clear Airway Apnea Agreement</measure>
    <time_frame>During a single night of polysomnography lasting an average of 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Device Detected Clear Airways were broken down and then reviewed with the manually scored apneas. Of the clear airway apneas they were broken down into a few different categories: Manually Scored Obstructive Apneas, Manually Scored Central Apneas, Manually scored, hypopneas and manually scored RERAs.</description>

    <description>Manipulation of positive airway pressure (PAP) will occur throughout the night to induce breaking events. PAP will be set to the participant's prescribed pressure, increased until breathing events are induced, and then returned to the prescribed pressure. This cyclic pattern will continue throughout the night. Events will be measured with REMstar Auto with A-Flex.</description>
