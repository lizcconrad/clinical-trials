      Background:

      -DOCK8 deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system and can lead to severe
      recurrent infections and possible death from infections or certain types of cancers,
      including blood cancers. A stem cell transplant is a life-saving treatment for this
      condition. In this study we are evaluating the efficacy and safety of transplant from
      different donor sources for DOCK8 deficiency. The donors that we are using are matched
      siblings, matched unrelated donors, and half-matched donors, so called haploidentical related
      donors, such as as mothers or fathers or half-matched siblings.

      Objectives:

      -To determine whether transplant of bone marrow cells from different types of donors corrects
      DOCK8 deficiency.

      Eligibility:

        -  Donors: Healthy individuals between 4 and 60 years of age who are matched with a
           recipient.

        -  Recipient: Individuals between 5 and 40 years of age who have DOCK8 deficiency, have
           suffered one or more life-threatening infections, or have had certain viral related
           cancers of cancer and have a stem cell donor.

      Design:

        -  All participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history.

        -  DONORS:

             -  Donors will donate bone marrow cells or blood stem cells. If donating blood stem
                cells, donors will receive injections of filgrastim to release stem cells into the
                blood. After 5 days of filgrastim injections, donors will have apheresis to donate
                stem cells and white blood cells that are present in the blood.

             -  Donors who provide the stem cells through bone marrow donation will have their bone
                marrow cells harvested in the operating room.

        -  RECIPIENTS:

             -  Recipients receiving matched related or unrelated donors will receive 4 days of
                chemotherapy with busulfan and fludarabine to suppress their immune system and
                prepare them for the transplant. Donors receiving haploidentical related donors
                will receive two doses of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, 5 days of
                fludarabine, 3 days of busulfan, and one dose of radiation to suppress their immune
                system and prepare them for the transplant.

             -  After the initial chemotherapy and radiation, recipients will receive the donated
                stem cells as a single infusion. Recipients may also receive white blood cells from
                their stem cell donor to encourage acceptance of the stem cells.

             -  After the stem cell transplant, recipients will receive two days of a chemotherapy
                called cyclophosphamide on day's + 3 and + 4 followed by two drugs tacrolimus and
                mycophenolate to prevent graft versus host disease where the donor cells attack the
                patient's body. All patients will remain in the hospital for approximately 1 month,
                and will be followed with regular visits for up to 3 years with periodic visits
                thereafter to evaluate the success of the transplant and any side effects.

      Background

      Mutations in the Dedicator of Cytokinesis-8 (DOCK8) gene are responsible for an
      immunodeficiency disease characterized by: severe cutaneous and sinopulmonary infections with
      bacterial organisms; extensive cutaneous viral infections with Herpes simplex, Herpes zoster,
      Molluscum contagiosum, and Human Papilloma Virus; a marked elevation in serum IgE levels and
      eosinophilia; homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the dedicator of cytokinesis 8
      (DOCK8) gene. Patients with DOCK8 deficiency die from severe infections, squamous cell
      carcinomas, or hematological malignancies. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) represents a potentially life-saving treatment for immunodeficiency diseases such as
      DOCK8 deficiency. In this study we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic HSCT
      for DOCK8 deficiency. We are particularly interested in determining whether allogeneic HSCT
      using different donor sources and conditioning regimens reverses the lethal disease phenotype
      in DOCK8 deficiency by reconstituting normal host defense. The development of lethal squamous
      cell carcinomas and lymphomas arising from the immunodeficiency in DOCK8 deficiency supports
      therapeutic intervention before overt malignancy arises.

      Objectives

      -To determine whether allogeneic HSCT reconstitutes T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte cells and
      myeloid cells with normal donor cells at one year post-transplant and reverses the clinical
      phenotype of severe recurrent infections in patients with DOCK8 deficiency.

      Eligibility

      Patients 5-35 years old with DOCK8 deficiency who have suffered one or more life-threatening
      infections, or who have developed lymphoma or squamous cell carcinoma, and have a 10/10
      matched related donor, a 10/10 matched unrelated donor, a 9/10 matched related donor, a 9/10
      matched unrelated donor, or a haploidentical related donor.

      Design

        -  DOCK8 deficiency patients with 10/10 matched related donors and unrelated donors will
           receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 40 mg/m2/day on
           days -6, -5, -4, and -3, and busulfan IV (dose based on pharmacokinetic levels) every
           day for 4 days on days -6, -5, -4, and -3. The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based
           upon a test dose of busulfan given prior to the start of the conditioning regimen. Donor
           hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0.

        -  Post-transplant immunosuppression for graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for
           recipients of 10/10 matched related and unrelated donors will consist of
           cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for 2 days on days +3 and +4, along with
           mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to approximately
           day 180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be
           stopped at approximately day +180.

        -  DOCK8 deficiency patients with 9/10 matched related or 9/10 matched unrelated donors
           will receive a pre-transplant conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.5
           mg/kg on days -6 and -5, fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and -2,
           busulfan IV (dose based on pharmacokinetic levels) once daily for three days on-4, -3
           and -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1. The busulfan dosing will be adjusted based upon a
           test dose of busulfan given prior to the start of the conditioning regimen. Donor
           hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0. Post-transplant immunosuppression for
           graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis for recipients of 9/10 matched related or
           unrelated donors will consist of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV once daily for two days on
           day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus
           from day +5 to day 180. If there is no evidence of graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus
           will be stopped at approximately day+180.

      DOCK8 deficiency patients with a haploidentical related donor will receive a pre-transplant
      conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg on days -6 and -5, busulfan IV
      (dose based on pharmacokinetic levels) once daily for 3 days on days -4, -3,and -2,
      fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on days -6, -5, -4, -3, and -2, and 200 cGy TBI on day -1. The busulfan
      dosing will be adjusted based upon a test dose of busulfan given prior to the start of the
      conditioning regimen. Donor hematopoietic stem cells will be infused on day 0.
      Post-transplant immunosuppression for GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclophosphamide 50
      mg/kg IV once daily for two days on day s +3 and +4, along with mycophenolate mofetil from
      day +5 to day +35 and tacrolimus from day +5 to day 180. If there is no evidence of
      graft-versus-host disease, tacrolimus will be stopped at approximately day+180.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40%, preferably by 2-D echo, obtained within 28
             days of enrollment. If the patient has radiological evidence of aortic, renal artery,
             or coronary artery vasculitis, a left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;30% is
             acceptable.

          -  Pulmonary Function Tests: FEV1 greater than or equal to 50% of expected value obtained
             within 28 days of enrollment.

             --Note: For children who are unable to cooperate for PFTs, the criterion is: No
             evidence of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and no requirement for
             supplemental oxygen therapy.

          -  Creatinine: Patients: less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl or creatinine clearance greater
             than or equal to 30 ml/min/1.73 m^2. Pediatric patients (&lt;18 years old): Creatinine

          -  Disease status: Patients with malignancy are to be referred in remission for
             evaluation, except in the case of viral associated malignancies. Should a patient have
             progressive disease or a donor becomes unavailable after enrollment, the patient will
             be referred back to their primary hematologist-oncologist for treatment. If this
             course of action is not in the best interest of the patient according to the clinical
             judgment of the PI/LAI, then the patient may receive standard treatment for the
             malignant disease under the current study. If under either of these settings, it
             becomes apparent that the patient will not be able to proceed to transplant, then
             he/she must come off study. Recipient-Subjects receiving a standard therapy will be
             told about the therapy, associated risks, benefits alternatives of the proposed
             therapy, and availability of receiving the same treatment elsewhere, outside of a

             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.

          -  Active CNS involvement by malignancy (patients with known positive CSF cytology or
             parenchymal lesions visible by CT or MRI). Except in the case of viral associated
             malignancies in which case the patient may benefit from the transplant to control the
             malignancy.

          -  Pregnant or lactating. The effects on breast-milk are also unknown and may be harmful
             to the infant; therefore, women should not breast feed during the interval from study
             entry to one year post-transplant.

          -  Sexually active individuals capable of becoming pregnant who are unable or unwilling
             to use effective form(s) of contraception during time enrolled on study and for 1 year

             implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy, partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom,
             diaphragm, or cervical cap), or abstinence. Males on the protocol must use an
             effective form of contraception at study entry, and for one year post-transplant. The
             effects of transplant, the radiation, and the medications used after transplant may be
             harmful to a fetus.

          -  Presence of active malignancy in another organ system other than the hematopoietic
             system, except when driven by viruses in which case the immune reconstitution after
             transplant may control the malignancy.

          -  No available 10/10 or 9/10 HLA-matched related or unrelated donor or haploidentical
             related donor.

          -  Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary central
             venous catheter for apheresis, if applicable.

          -  Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C
             antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections to
             the recipient.

          -  A donor who is lactating must be willing and able to interrupt breast-feeding or
             substitute formula feeding for her infant during the period of filgrastim
             administration and for two days following the final dose. Filgrastim may be secreted

             Subjects will undergo anesthesia consultation, and meet criteria for
             eligibility/enrollment. CD34+ fraction will be determined.

          -  Matched related donors that will have their cells collected via apheresis will also
             undergo the Donor Health History Screen to determine donor eligibility using standard
             DTM criteria in the Dowling Apheresis Clinic by skilled staff in the Blood Services

          1. A haploidentical donor that shares one haplotype in common with the recipient such
             that HLA compatibility will be a minimum of 5 out of 10 HLA loci matched. The HLA loci
             to be tested will be HLA A, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQB1. A minimum number of mismatches are
             desirable; however if several options are available the selection of a donor will be
             based on the loci where the mismatch occurs and the relative importance of its
             potential immunological function. Donor-recipient pairs will initially be typed
             molecularly to provide a low resolution typing (antigen-level) to aid in the selection
             of the potential donor. Upon review of the familial inheritance pattern, a qualified
             HLA staff member will review haplotype inheritance. High resolution (allele-level)
             typing will be performed. Final selection of a donor will be in consultation with NCI
             physicians and qualified HLA personnel. If more than one haploidentical related donor
             is available, we will evaluate each donor individually according to overall health,
             ABO matching, CMV, etc. to select the donor

          2. Age 4-60 years and weight of greater than or equal to 15 kilograms.

          3. At least one normal DOCK8 allele demonstrated by a CLIA-certified lab in a sibling
             donor.

          4. No history of life-threatening opportunistic infections

          5. Adequate venous access for peripheral apheresis, or consent to use a temporary central
             venous catheter for apheresis (if applicable).

          6. Donors must be HIV negative, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and hepatitis C
             antibody negative. This is to prevent the possible transmission of these infections to
             the recipient.

          7. Haploidentical donors will undergo marrow harvest with general anesthesia. Subjects
             will undergo anesthesia consultation, and meet criteria for eligibility/enrollment.
             CD34+ fraction will be determined.

          8. Subjects will also undergo the Donor Health History Screen to determine donor
             eligibility using standard DTM criteria in the Dowling Apheresis Clinic by skilled
             staff in the Blood Services Section for adult patients and age-appropriate questioning
             when indicated for pediatric subjects.

          9. Adult related donors would be preferred over related donors who are minors.

         10. Subjects will undergo follow-up evaluation within 1 week of donation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA-MATCHED RELATED DONOR:

        - History of severe cutaneous viral infections with herpes simplex, herpes zoster, or

        molluscum contagiosum.

          -  HIV infection.

          -  Chronic active hepatitis B. Donor may be hepatitis core antibody positive.

          -  Other medical contraindications to stem cell donation (i.e. severe atherosclerosis,
             autoimmune disease, iritis or episcleritis, deep venous thrombosis, cerebrovascular
             accident).

          -  History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone potentially
             curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-bycase basis. The
             risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable tumor cells
             at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient.

          -  Donors must not be pregnant. Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication under this
             protocol. The effects of cytokine administration on a fetus are unknown. Donors of
             childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception. Effective forms
             of contraception include one or more of the following: intrauterine device (IUD),
             hormonal (birth control pills, injections, or implants), tubal ligation/hysterectomy,
             partner s vasectomy, barrier methods, (condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), or
             abstinence.

          -  Other medical conditions that in the opinion of the PI constitute exclusion as a
             donor.

          -  Mutation of DOCK8 on both alleles.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - MATCHED UNRELATED DONOR:

        a) Failure to qualify as an NMDP donor.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - HAPLOIDENTICAL RELATED DONOR:

          -  HIV infection

          -  Chronic active hepatitis B. Donor may be hepatitis core antibody positive.

          -  History of psychiatric disorder which in the opinion of the PI may compromise
             compliance with transplant protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed

          -  Other medical contraindications that in the opinion of the PI constitute exclusion as
             a donor. History of prior malignancy. However, cancer survivors who have undergone
             potentially curative therapy may be considered for stem cell donation on a case-bycase
             basis. The risk/benefit of the transplant and the possibility of transmitting viable
             tumor cells at the time of transplantation will be discussed with the patient.
