  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The collection of Blood and/or Bone Marrow from patients with blood disorders, blood cell
      malignancies and associated conditions will serve as a convenient and comprehensive source of
      tissue to give us further information about the differences between normal blood cells and
      blood cells of affected individuals. This will be an invaluable asset for understanding the
      biology of blood disorders. The collected samples will be used by investigators for studies
      including immunology, molecular biology and genetics to name a few.

    <description>The study is designed to collect blood and bone marrow from patients with various hematological diseases. The samples will be used for various research studies for better understanding of biology of various blood disorders including hematological malignancies. Relevant clinical and laboratory features and subsequent changes will be noted for correlation with these studies. The tissue/cells will be additionally banked and/or used for other investigations in the future.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Selected patients over the age of 18 with hematologic malignancies or other blood
             disorders (leukemia, myeloproliferative disorders, lymphoma, other malignancies
             involving the bone marrow or patients with unexplained alterations in their complete
             blood count).

        Patients who are scheduled to undergo a bone marrow aspirate and/or phlebotomy for other
        clinical indications will be asked to participate. They will be asked to donate an
        additional small aliquot of bone marrow and/or blood during the course of their already
        scheduled bone marrow aspiration or phlebotomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with pre-existing medical conditions that might be exacerbated by the
             procedure of obtaining bone marrow or blood

          -  Patients who are allergic to Lidocaine, which is used as a local anesthetic, and who
             cannot receive a suitable substitute anesthetic.

          -  Patients who have a bleeding diathesis which might pose a problem with marrow
             aspiration.

          -  Patients unable to give informed consent.

          -  Pregnant patients
