  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether at least 1 dose of LY2216684 (12
      milligrams [mg] or 18 mg once daily) is superior to placebo once daily in the adjunctive
      treatment of participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) who were identified as partial
      responders to an adequate course of treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI) during an 8-week, double-blind, acute adjunctive treatment phase.

      Following the Confirmation Phase, participants were randomized to adjunctive LY2216684 or
      adjunctive placebo if they met the following randomization criteria: had &lt;25% improvement in
      the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score over the past 3 weeks and a
      current MADRS total score ≥14. Participants who did not meet criteria received adjunctive
      placebo to preserve the blind.

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Global Functional Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS was completed by the participant and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. The Global Function Impairment Score is the sum of the 3 items, and scores ranged from 0 to 30 with higher values indicating disruption in the participant's work life (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Impact Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FAsD is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The impact subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other, and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist. Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Global Functional Impairment Scale</title>
        <description>The SDS was completed by the participant and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item is measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. The Global Function Impairment Score is the sum of the 3 items, and scores ranged from 0 to 30 with higher values indicating disruption in the participant's work life (work/school impairment score), social life (social life/leisure activities impairment score), and family life (family life/home responsibilities impairment score). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Impact Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The FAsD is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The impact subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 7 through 13 (applicable items only). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other, and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The HADS is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression subscale. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale were considered to be a significant 'case' of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7 represent 'normal'. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Depression Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The HADS is a 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales: anxiety and depression. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale (0-3), giving maximum scores of 21 for anxiety and depression subscale. Scores of 11 or more on either subscale were considered to be a significant 'case' of psychological morbidity, while scores of 8-10 represent 'borderline' and 0-7 represent 'normal'. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline subscale score, treatment-by-visit and baseline subscale score-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS had a 10-item checklist (sadness [apparent], sadness [reported], inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties, lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts). Items were rated on a scale of 0 to 6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline item score, treatment-by-visit and baseline item score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Average Score and Experience Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The FAsD is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The experience subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 1 through 6, and the average score was the mean of Items 1 through 13 (derived by taking the mean of all applicable items for each participant). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other, and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

          <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Fatigue Associated With Depression (FAsD) Average Score and Experience Subscale Score</title>
          <description>The FAsD is a participant-rated scale with a total of 13 items. Six of the 13 items ask how often participants experience different aspects of fatigue with responses from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Seven of the 13 items ask how often fatigue impacts various aspects of the participant's lives with responses from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The experience subscale score was derived by taking the mean of Items 1 through 6, and the average score was the mean of Items 1 through 13 (derived by taking the mean of all applicable items for each participant). Item 12 applied only to participants with a spouse or significant other, and Item 13 applied to participants who had a job or who went to school. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-administered 16-item questionnaire that measures degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced in various areas of daily life during the past week on a 5-point, Likert scale (1=very poor and 5=very good). The total raw score is the sum of items 1 to 14 and ranges from 14 to 70. The raw scores are converted to and expressed as the percentage of the maximum possible score. Higher scores indicate higher levels of enjoyment/satisfaction. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS captured occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation was defined as a 'yes' answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which included a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as a 'yes' answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and behavior are defined as TE if not present at baseline. Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with suicide-related TE events by the total number of participants at risk, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Treatment Emergent (TE) Suicidal Ideation and Behaviors Assessed by Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
          <description>The C-SSRS captured occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Suicidal ideation was defined as a 'yes' answer to any 1 of 5 suicidal ideation questions, which included a wish to be dead and 4 different categories of active suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as a 'yes' answer to any of 5 suicidal behavior questions: preparatory acts or behavior, aborted attempt, interrupted attempt, actual attempt, and completed suicide. Suicidal ideation and behavior are defined as TE if not present at baseline. Percentage of participants was calculated by dividing the number of participants with suicide-related TE events by the total number of participants at risk, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Event module.</description>

        <title>Change From Randomization to Week 8 in Arizona Sexual Experiences (ASEX) Scale</title>
        <description>The ASEX scale was used to assess sexual functioning in both males and females. The ASEX total score for the male and female version was calculated as the sum of the responses (rated from 1 [extremely] to 6 [no/never]) to the 5 items of the ASEX scale. Total scores ranged from 5 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater sexual dysfunction. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit and baseline score-by-visit.</description>
