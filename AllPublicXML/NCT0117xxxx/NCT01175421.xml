      Purpose:

      In a retrospective cohort the investigators will validate, the goodness of a multidimensional
      index to classified the severity of patients with sleep disordered breathing that has been
      previously developed in a prospective longitudinal cohort.

      Methods. In the developing study, three variables were found as predictors of mayor outcomes
      and were incorporated in a multidimensional index: the apnea-hypopnea index, the severity of
      daytime sleepiness as quantified by the Epworth questionnaire and the presence of current
      cardiovascular disease. The index (OSA-SCORE) has a value between 0 (less risk) to 5 (more
      risk). For each point, a significant increment in the risk of death was found. In the
      retrospective validation study, a number of potential variables will be recorded, all of them
      also predictors of major outcomes. Data will be recorded by trained personnel on-site at the
      respiratory Sleep Units around the country. The final cohort will include 1100 subjects aged
      &gt; 18 years . The observation time will be considered since the time at diagnosis to fatal
      event and the patient will be censored when non-invasive ventilation was started or at the
      recorded time if the patient is alive. The primary outcome is all-cause death.
