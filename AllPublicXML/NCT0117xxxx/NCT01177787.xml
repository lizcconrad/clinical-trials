    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of reduction of local fat on
      ipsilateral thigh through cryolipolysis (zeltiq) and controlateral thigh using by amplitude
      modulated frequency (conventional) method.

      Cryolipolysis is a new concept to reduce fat since Zeltiq machine had been introduced several
      years ago. Several different trials such as high frequency, liposuction and chemical
      lipolysis to remove fat had been emerged and tried. Therefore, we would like to know the
      clinical efficacy of cryolipolysis through comparative experiment with former frequency
      method on each thigh on healthy Korean women.

      Healthy premenopausal women who want to reduce the fat on thigh were included. 28 healthy
      volunteered women recruited for this study, 15 subjects among participated after
      interviewing, sampling their metabolic variables at initial visit. A total of 15 subjects
      would be investigated through food diary(24hour), femoral CT, anthropometric, metabolic
      variables at initial, 4th, 12th week. Histological examination under skin(initial and 12th
      week), questionnaire(4th, 12th week) for satisfaction, adverse events would be monitored
      during 3 month.
