  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EVE- technology is intended for determination of intolerance or sensitivity to female sex
      hormones among women with hormone-related conditions and for further treatment by
      desensitization procedure inducing a tolerance to the hormones the women are sensitive to.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and the ability of the EVE- Skin-Test Panel to
      detect sensitivity to female sex hormones in subjects with Unexplained Recurrent Pregnancy
      Loss (URPL) and in Control parous, healthy women.

      The Skin Test Panel includes four female hormones and three control solutions.

      Hormones from the Skin Test Panel are injected intradermally during the luteal phase of the
      subject's menstrual cycle. The skin reactions are examined by physician for erythema and
      wheal after 20 minutes and 48 hours and self-assessed by the patient daily for the following
      month.

      Skin response monthly data is analyzed and compared between unexplained recurrent pregnancy
      loss (UPRL) and healthy groups.

      Following achievement of the significant differences between both groups the immune profile
      of the healthy and UPRL subjects will be investigated.
