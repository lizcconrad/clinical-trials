  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this first human study with CC-223 is to assess the safety and action of
      a new class of experimental drug (dual mTOR inhibitors) in patients with advanced tumors
      unresponsive to standard therapies and to determine the appropriate dose and tumor type for
      later-stage clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Initially, patients will be treated with oral CC-223 for one month. During this time, various
      tests (involving blood and urine collections, ECGs, etc) will be performed. Those whose
      tumors stabilize or regress may continue receiving treatment for as long as they benefit from
      CC-223. Different dose levels of CC-223 will be tested in a dose-rising study design.

    <description>Part A: (closed to enrollment) Dose level starts with 7.5mg daily taken by mouth in cycles of 28 days. Level increases for different patient cohorts in 100% or 50% increments until optimal dose level is established for further study. Treatment continues for as long as patient benefits (i.e., until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity). Part B: (closed to enrollment) Optimal dose is administered in 28 day cycles until disease progression.</description>
