    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to gather a small amount of blood for extraction of DNA for the
      study of the genetic basis of diabetes. The study population will include individuals with
      known diabetes, and controls without diabetes. Investigators aim to understand the genetics
      of diabetes, and will use the cells and serum from this blood to perform genotyping and gene
      expression studies of individuals with diabetes and relevant controls.

      This protocol is designed to collect a small amount of blood for extraction of DNA (genetic
      material) for the study of the genetic basis of diabetes. The study population will include
      individuals with known diabetes and controls without diabetes. Additionally, this protocol
      will recruit individuals from the following locations: the Qatar Diabetes Association, the
      governmental ministries of Qatar, and subjects who have participated in Dr. Bener's HMC
      protocol #231 entitled &quot;A preliminary study of genetic pre-disposition to diabetic mellitus
      in the state of Qatar.&quot; Individuals with diabetes may also be recruited from the Hamad
      Hospital outpatient adult diabetes clinics (there are eight diabetes clinics each week)
      and/or from the population of subjects who previously participated in Dr. Mushlin's IRB
      approved protocol #0608008703 entitled &quot;Comparing the Clinical Management and Genetic Markers
      of Diabetes in Qatar to International Standards&quot; at Hamad Medical Corporation or IRB approved
      protocol #0602008388 entitled &quot;The Impact of Cardiac and Genetic Risk Factors on Acute
      Myocardial Infarction and Cerebrovascular Stroke in Qatar: A Case-Control Study&quot;. In this
      protocol, researchers will survey medical records of patients with diabetes, in order to
      study the clinical characteristics of these individuals, and the researchers will collect
      blood to evaluate the genetic characteristics of individuals with diabetes. The researchers
      will also collect blood samples of individuals without diabetes to serve as control.

      Genomic DNA will be extracted, and genome wide SNP analysis and promoter sequences for genes
      will be obtained. The goal is to find single nucleotide polymorphims (SNP), small changes in
      single genes that affect disease risk, to see if they correlate with diabetes. Serum will be
      stored for future studies, for a period of 6 years, to look at levels of proteins. Subjects
      who consent to participate in this study will have their serum stored for up to 6 years,
      inorder to be used for future studies on genomics.

        Diabetes group will be taken from (1)individuals visiting the Medicine Department at the
        Hamad Medical Corporation(HMC), Qatar for standard clinical care, (2)outpatient adult
        individuals seen at the HMCdiabetes clinics, (3)individuals who have participated in the
        following IRB protocol #s:0608008703, #0602008388 and HMC protocol #231, (4)ndividuals who
        attend clinics at the Qatar Diabetes Association (QDA), and (5)Individuals who work at the
        governmental ministries of Qatar. Controls will be obtained from volunteers without a
        history of diabetes. Family members of patients may be asked to participate in the study.
