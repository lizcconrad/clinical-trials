      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the ability of Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation with H coil to prefrontal cortex , with an addition of cognitive brain training,
      to improve cognitive performance in patients with Alzheimer's disease which received drug
      treatment. This study is a single-center, double-blind 4 months duration trial.
