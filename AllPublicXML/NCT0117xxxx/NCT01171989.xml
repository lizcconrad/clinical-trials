  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current trial will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' GSK2202083A
      vaccine when administered as a booster dose following priming in the first year of life with
      the same vaccine.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT number = NCT00970307).
