  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Clinic Treatment Project tested two alternative methods of delivering evidence-based
      practices within public community-based mental health clinics, using training and supervision
      procedures designed for the settings and users.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Clinic Treatment Project focused on ethnically diverse youths aged 7-13 who were referred
      to community-based mental health clinics for problems involving disruptive behaviors,
      depression, anxiety, and any combination of these. Using a randomized block design,
      therapists were randomly assigned to deliver usual treatment procedures (usual care, or UC)
      in their clinics or evidence-based practices deployed in two forms: (a) standard manual
      treatment (SMT), using full treatment manuals, one at a time, exactly as they have been
      tested in clinical trials, and (b) modular manual treatment (MMT) in which therapists learn
      the component practices of the standard manuals but individualize the use of the components
      for each child using a guiding clinical algorithm. Unlike the SMT approach, the MMT approach
      allows the duration and sequencing of techniques to be individualized in an effort to fit the
      child's needs and allows the clinician to draw techniques from outside the target disorder
      domain when needed (e.g., to address noncompliance during the course of treating depression).
      Both SMT and MMT were supported by training and supervision procedures designed to fit
      providers and their clinic contexts. Assessments were carried out at pre-treatment, at
      post-treatment, and at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month follow-ups. Assessments carried out
      at pre-treatment included(a) individual youth problems and disorders; (b) individual youth
      functioning at home and school; and (c) clinic staff beliefs and attitudes toward their work
      and workplace. Assessments carried out at post-treatment and follow-up only included measures
      of (a) youth, parent, and therapist satisfaction with treatment; (b) youth, parent and
      therapist views on the quality of the therapeutic relationship; and (c) treatment costs.
      Assessments carried out at follow-up only included (a) parent reports of any mental health
      service use following project treatment, and (b) therapist reports on the extent to which the
      treatment procedures they used in the project are continued after project termination.
      Analyses will address critical questions about deployment of evidence-based youth practices
      to clinical care settings.

    <measure>Brief Problem Checklist (BPC, parent and child forms)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 267</time_frame>
    <description>Youth and parents were contacted weekly to report changes in youth functioning. Each person was asked to rate their own or their child's behavior on 12 items (6 internalizing and 6 externalizing behaviors) that were adapted from the Youth Self Report and the Child Behavior Checklist. Children and caregivers completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, every week during treatment, and at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 267 days (SD = 124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment.</description>

    <measure>The Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes-Child and Parent Forms (ChIPS/P-ChIPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 267</time_frame>
    <description>The ChIPS/P-ChIPS are structured psychiatric interviews designed to assess psychopathology according to DSM-IV criteria in children and adolescents ages 6-18 years. ChIPS/P-ChIPS assess twenty behavioral, anxiety, mood, and other syndromes as well as psychosocial stressors the child might have experienced. Symptoms are assessed using a &quot;yes/no&quot; question format. Onset, offset and duration data are gathered for each disorder. On average, youth and caregivers completed the post-treatment assessment 267 days (SD=124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment.(Used as a measure of clinical outcome.)</description>

    <measure>Top Problems Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 712 (24-mo follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Youths and parents were asked to identify &quot;The three most important problems for which you need [or &quot;your child needs&quot;] help.&quot; at the intake assessment. The six resulting problems (3 from youth, 3 from parent) were then rated on a scale of 0 (&quot;Not serious at all&quot;) to 10 (&quot;Very serious problem&quot;) by youth and parent. Youths and parents completed the pre-treatment assessment on Day 1, at post-treatment assessment which occurred on average 267 days (SD = 124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment, and at 3-, 6-, 9-, 12- and 24-month follow-up from Day 1. (Used as a measure of clinical outcome.)</description>

    <measure>Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment (Day 267)</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of youths' working alliance with their therapists was assessed via the Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Children (TASC, Shirk &amp; Saiz, 1992). The 7-item scale comes in both a youth-report form and a parent-report form (parents reporting on their youth's relationship with the therapist). On average, children and caregivers completed the post-treatment assessment 267 days (SD = 124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment. (Available for supplemental analyses.)</description>

    <measure>Brief Symptom Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over time from Day 1 to Day 267</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) is a parent self-report form that is the short form of the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised instrument. The BSI provides a screen for psychological problems. This inventory reports profiles of nine primary symptom dimensions and three global indices of distress (Derogatis, 1993). It can also be used to measuring patient progress during treatment or in the assessment of treatment outcomes. On average, caregivers completed the post-treatment assessment 267 days (SD = 124 days) after the pre-treatment assessment. (Available for supplemental analyses.)</description>
