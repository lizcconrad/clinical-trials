  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevention of recurrent suicidal about people who have made a suicide attempt is a major
      strand in the prevention of suicide. It is estimated that 10-15 % of people who made a
      suicide attempt die by suicide. Recidivism rate of suicide increases even faster than the
      subject is close to the index suicide attempt. A one month recurrence rate is 5 %, 12-25 % at
      one year. Most people who made a suicide attempt receive ambulatory monitoring. On this
      population, there is a low adherence to care.

      The main objective of the study is to test the effectiveness of a prevention program of
      recurrent suicidal acts for people who made a suicide attempt.

      The secondary objectives of this study are the assessment of adherence to care; the
      identification of sub - populations benefiting most from this program; the evaluation of the
      possible generalization level of the program (eligibles persons rate) and its feasibility
      level.

      This is a randomized, controlled and prospective trial comparing an experimental group (usual
      treatment + interventions) to a control group (usual treatment only). All participants are
      evaluated after one year of monitoring. The search duration is 2 years (one inclusion year
      and one year of follow-up). It is planned to include 330 patients, 165 patients in each
      group.

      The program (experimental group) includes three interventions:

        -  A series of three telephone calls ( the second week , one month and three months after
           discharge from hospital )

        -  A systematic telephone contact with the referring physician

        -  A telephone helpline for people who made a suicide attempt and referring physicians.
