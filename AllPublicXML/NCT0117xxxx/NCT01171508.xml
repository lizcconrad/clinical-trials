  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate circadian disturbances after breast cancer
      surgery by means of monitoring sleep and heart-rate variability, by measuring a metabolite of
      melatonin in urine and by questionnaires and a sleep-diary.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of studies have shown that circadian variation in the excretion of
      hormones, the sleep-wake cycle, the core body temperature, the tone of the autonomic nervous
      system and the activity rhythm are important both in health and disease processes. More
      attention is being paid towards the circadian variation in endogenous rhythms in relation to
      surgery and whether this can affect postoperative recovery, morbidity and mortality.

      Studies have been done on circadian disturbances after major and minor surgery but never in
      relation to breast cancer surgery.

      This study will investigate circadian disturbances in this specific group of patients by
      using Actigraphy, Polysomnography (PSG), Holter-monitoring (HRV), the primary metabolite of
      melatonin in urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), questionnaires and a sleep-diary.
