    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at 12-Week Endpoint in the BPI-Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BPI-Severity Scale was a self-reported scale that measured the severity of pain based on the average pain over the past 24-hours. The severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). A negative change indicated an improvement in the participant's condition. LS mean was calculated using MMRM and adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at 12-Week Endpoint in the CGI-S Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S was administered by the investigator in the presence of the participant and measured the severity of illness at the time of assessment compared with start of treatment; CGI-S scores ranged from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants). A negative change indicated an improvement in the participant's condition. LS mean was calculated using MMRM and adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) Scale at 12-Week Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PGI-I was self-reported and measured a participant's perception of improvement at the time of assessment compared with the start of treatment. Scores ranged from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). LS mean was calculated using MMRM and adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at 12-Week Endpoint in the Sensory Subscale of the SF-MPQ</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-MPQ was a self-reported instrument that consisted of 11 sensory descriptors describing pain. The descriptors were rated on an intensity scale from 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe). Three (3) pain scores were derived from the sum of the intensity rank values of the words chosen for sensory descriptors. The SF-MPQ sensory subscale was the sum of the 11 scores (ranged from 0 to 33, with 33 being the worst pain). A negative change indicates an improvement. LS mean was calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator and baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at 12-week Endpoint in the BPI Interference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BPI-Interference Score was a self-reported scale that measured the interference of pain based on the average of the 7 questions assessing the interference of pain for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. The average interference scores ranged from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). A negative change indicates an improvement in the participant's condition. LS means was calculated using MMRM and adjusted treatment, pooled investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline at 12 Week Endpoint in the SDS Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SDS was self-reported and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social life (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item was measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. SDS total score was the sum of the 3 items and ranged from 0 to 30, with higher values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work/social/family life. Scores ≥5 were associated with significant functional impairment. A negative change indicated an improvement in the participant's condition. LS mean was adjusted using MMRM and adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline at 12-Week Endpoint in the BPI-Severity Scale</title>
        <description>BPI-Severity Scale was a self-reported scale that measured the severity of pain based on the average pain over the past 24-hours. The severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). A negative change indicated an improvement in the participant's condition. LS mean was calculated using MMRM and adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>ITT principle was applied: All participants with a baseline and 12-week, 24-hour BPI-Severity score based on the randomized group were analyzed.</population>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline at 12-Week Endpoint in the Sensory Subscale of the SF-MPQ</title>
        <description>SF-MPQ was a self-reported instrument that consisted of 11 sensory descriptors describing pain. The descriptors were rated on an intensity scale from 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe). Three (3) pain scores were derived from the sum of the intensity rank values of the words chosen for sensory descriptors. The SF-MPQ sensory subscale was the sum of the 11 scores (ranged from 0 to 33, with 33 being the worst pain). A negative change indicates an improvement. LS mean was calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator and baseline.</description>

        <description>SDS was self-reported and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social life (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item was measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. SDS total score was the sum of the 3 items and ranged from 0 to 30, with higher values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work/social/family life. Scores ≥5 were associated with significant functional impairment. A negative change indicated an improvement in the participant's condition. LS mean was adjusted using MMRM and adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline at 12 Week Endpoint in the SDS Total Score</title>
          <description>SDS was self-reported and used to assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on their work (Item 1), social life (Item 2), and family life (Item 3). Each item was measured on a 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) point scale with higher values indicating greater disruption. SDS total score was the sum of the 3 items and ranged from 0 to 30, with higher values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work/social/family life. Scores ≥5 were associated with significant functional impairment. A negative change indicated an improvement in the participant's condition. LS mean was adjusted using MMRM and adjusted for treatment, pooled investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline score and baseline score-by-visit interaction.</description>
