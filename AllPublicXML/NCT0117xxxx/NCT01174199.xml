      RATIONALE: Temsirolimus and vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving temsirolimus together with vorinostat may kill
      more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      temsirolimus and vorinostat in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended Phase II dose of
      temsirolimus in combination with vorinostat in patients with metastatic, hormone refractory,
      chemoresistant prostate cancer. II. To obtain preliminary evidence of response in prostate
      cancer patients treated with temsirolimus and vorinostat. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To
      determine the partial and complete objective response rates in metastatic hormone-refractory,
      chemo-resistant prostate cancer patients with measurable disease treated with temsirolimus
      and vorinostat. II. To determine the progression free survival and overall survival in
      patients with metastatic hormone refractory, chemo-resistant prostate cancer. III. To
      determine the PSA response, the duration of PSA response, time to PSA progression, PSA
      doubling time and PSA slope in metastatic hormone refractory, chemo-resistant prostate cancer
      patients treated with temsirolimus and vorinostat. IV. To assess changes in expression levels
      of bone remodeling markers (N telopeptides and bone alkaline phosphatase) and
      angiogenesis-related gene and protein expression (VEGF/HIF1-alpha) in blood and circulating
      tumor cells, and when available, in tissue, and correlate them with cancer and treatment
      related outcomes. V. To assess the changes in tumor metabolism with FDG/IIC-Choline PET/CT
      scan. OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14 and temsirolimus IV
      on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days
      and then every 3 months thereafter.
