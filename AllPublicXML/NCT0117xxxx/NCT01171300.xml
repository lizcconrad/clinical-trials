  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer is a frequent but curable malignancy in the Western world. The golden standard
      in treating these patients consists of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by
      extensive surgery regardless of tumor response. The main question is whether extensive
      surgery can be avoided holding in mind that already a significant amount of patients reach a
      pathological complete response after radiochemotherapy. The goal of this study is dual. First
      of all, the investigators want to investigate the value of DW-MRI and 18FDG-PET in the
      assessment of response after neoadjuvant CRT in 100 patients with rectal cancer, to select
      those patients eligible for less invasive surgery. In the same patient group, the
      investigators will examine the biomarker potential of molecular characteristics of the tumor
      in blood and tissue. Using both molecular and radiological findings, the investigators want
      to predict pathological response after chemoradiotherapy and to select patients who may
      benefit from treatment adjustments during chemoradiotherapy.

          -  Patient's body weight is ≤ 120 kg.

          -  Histologically proven and evaluable (according to RECIST criteria) adenocarcinoma of
             the rectum (tumour &lt;15 cm from the anal verge), staged T3-4 N0 and T1-4N1-2.

          -  WHO PS ≤ 2

          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function (assessed within 14 days prior to
             study entry):

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L,

          -  Platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L,

          -  Presence of adequate contraception in fertile patients. Adequate methods of
             contraception are: intra-uterine device, hormonal contraception, condom use with
             spermicide.

          -  Written informed consent must be given according to ICH/GCP and national/local
             regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of distant metastases.

          -  Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for rectal cancer.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Significant impairment of intestinal resorption (e.g. chronic diarrhea, inflammatory
             bowel disease).

          -  Known allergies to intravenous contrast agents.

          -  Contra-indications for magnetic resonance imaging (metal implants, claustrophobia,
             etc. ).

          -  Previous or concurrent malignancies at other sites with the exception of surgically
             cured or adequately treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix and non-melanoma skin
             cancer.

          -  History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric
             disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant precluding informed
             consent or interfering with compliance for oral drug intake.

          -  Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.
