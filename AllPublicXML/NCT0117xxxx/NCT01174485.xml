  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liposuction is the most popular aesthetic surgery in Brasil and worldwide. Evidence showing
      that adipose tissue is a metabolically active tissue led to the suggestion that liposuction
      could be a viable method for the improvement of metabolic profile through the immediate loss
      of adipose tissue. Studies about the effects of liposuction on metabolic profile are
      conflicting. A few studies report the improvement of insulin sensitivity, inflammatory
      markers and lipid profile, others observe no changes and a few report the worsening of
      metabolic profile. In addition, animal studies show a compensatory growth of intact adipose
      tissue in response to lipectomy. Physical exercise improves insulin sensitivity, lipid
      profile, inflammatory balance, adipose tissue distribution and increases or preserves free
      fat mass. Therefore, liposuction and physical exercise seem to act on similar tissues of the
      body. To the investigators knowledge, there are no studies about the associated effects of
      liposuction and exercise in humans. However, one can suggest that exercise training
      associated with liposuction could: [1] attenuate or block the possible fat recovery or
      compensatory growth; [2] block or reverse the possible harmful effects of liposuction; or [3]
      exert an additive or synergistic effect to the possible beneficial effects induced by
      liposuction on metabolic and hormonal profile and inflammatory balance.
