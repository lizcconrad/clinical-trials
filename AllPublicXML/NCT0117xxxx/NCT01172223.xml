      Open-label, multicenter phase I/II trial. Patients with HER2-positive (overexpressing or
      amplified), invasive breast cancer with T1c N1-2 or T2 N0-2 disease will be treated with

        -  Non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (NPLD; Myocet, 60 mg/m^2 i.v. day 1 q3 weeks),

        -  Paclitaxel (175 mg/m^2 i.v. day 1 q3 weeks), and

        -  Lapatinib (GW572016, Tykerb, 750-1500 mg/d orally daily until the day of the definitive
           surgery) Treatment is planned for 6 cycles unless there is evidence of unacceptable
           toxicity, disease progression or inadequate efficacy (defined as a decrease in tumor
           size &lt;25% after 4 courses measured by ultrasound or MR-mammography), or if the patient
           requested to be released.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting females in northern Europe and North
      America, corresponding to an age-corrected annual incidence of 100 to 120 per 100000 females.
      Approximately 30-40% of all patients treated with curative intent will develop metastatic
      disease. Perioperative systemic treatment has made a major impact on relapse-free and overall
      survival of women with early-stage breast cancer [ , ] with therapeutic strategies being
      based on the endocrine responsiveness and the estimated risk of relapse defined by tumor
      size, axillary lymph node involvement, histologic and nuclear grade, lymphatic and/or
      vascular invasion, HER2/neu-overexpression and age [ ]. Perioperative therapy has
      traditionally been administered postoperatively, but chemotherapy is increasingly utilized in
      the preoperative setting as it can significantly improve the rate of breast conserving
      surgery, and new regimens can be evaluated rapidly and more precisely.
