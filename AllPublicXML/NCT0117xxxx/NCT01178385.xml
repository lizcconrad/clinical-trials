  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders affect as many as 1 out of 150 children and are related to
      significant impairment in social, adaptive, and school functioning. Co-occurring conditions,
      such as anxiety, are common and may cause substantial distress and impairment beyond that
      caused by the autism diagnosis. Although effective interventions have been developed for
      typically developing youth with anxiety disorders, this approach needs to be adapted for
      children with autism. Accordingly, we are proposing a randomized controlled trial to examine
      the effectiveness of CBT relative to treatment as usual (TAU) in 46 youth ages 7-11 with
      autism spectrum disorders and comorbid anxiety disorder(s).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorders affect as many as 1 out of 150 children (Centers for Disease
      Control, 2007), with many higher-functioning children not being diagnosed until elementary
      school or later (Fombonne, 2003). Significant impairment in social, adaptive, and school
      functioning is prevalent and longstanding (Howlin et al., 2004). In addition, comorbid
      psychological disorders are common in the ASD population (Simonoff et al., 2008), and may
      cause substantial distress and impairment beyond that caused by the ASD diagnosis. Comorbid
      anxiety disorders, in particular, affect as many as 80% of children and adolescents with ASD
      (Bellini, 2004; de Bruin et al., 2007; Klin et al., 2005; Muris et al., 1998). Although
      efficacious interventions have been developed for otherwise typically developing youth with
      anxiety disorders, the linguistic; cognitive; and social characteristics of ASD may render
      standard treatment approaches less effective for children with ASD (Volkmar &amp; Klin, 2000).
      Thus, there is a clinical need for the modification of existing treatment modalities for this
      unique group. To date, few studies have experimentally tested the efficacy of CBT for youth
      with a comorbid presentation of anxiety and ASD. This gap in the literature is of particular
      concern given the prevalence of comorbid anxiety among children, consequences of untreated
      anxiety, unknown efficacy of antidepressant medication for anxiety in ASD, and potential
      safety and tolerability issues related to medication use. Accordingly, we are proposing a
      randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of CBT relative to treatment as usual
      (TAU) in 46 youth ages 7-11 with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorder(s). In the proposed grant,
      we will: (1) examine the acute efficacy of CBT relative to TAU, and (2) evaluate the
      short-term maintenance of treatment gains. Forty-six children (ages 7-11 years) with ASD and
      comorbid anxiety disorder(s) will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment
      conditions. Primary outcomes will be assessed by an independent evaluator, and will include
      change in anxiety symptom severity; response rates; and remission rates. Considering the
      rising number of children diagnosed with ASD, our proposed work toward the advent of an
      efficacious CBT protocol will provide a timely contribution to public health efforts.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Outpatient children with an autism spectrum disorder (see #2 below) between the ages
             7-11years.

          2. Meets criteria for a diagnosis of autism, Asperger syndrome (AS), or PDD-NOS using
             scores from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation
             Schedule.

          3. Meets DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of one of the following anxiety disorders:
             separation anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia,
             or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) as determined by the ADIS-IV-C/P (with CSR 4)
             and all available information.

          4. Minimum score of 14 on the PARS Severity Scale; this score indicates clinically
             significant anxiety symptom severity (RUPP, 2002) and has been used in recent major
             clinical trials (e.g., Walkup et al., 2008).

          5. Child has a Full Scale and Verbal Comprehension IQ &gt; 70 as assessed on a commonly used
             IQ test.

          6. Subjects with co-morbid depression, ADHD, tic disorder or disruptive behavior
             disorders will be acceptable as long as the anxiety disorder is primary (i.e., most
             impairing/distressing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Receiving concurrent psychotherapy, social skills training, or behavioral
             interventions (e.g., applied behavior analysis). Families will have the option of
             discontinuing such services to enroll in the study. Those randomized to TAU will be
             able to continue or initiate psychosocial interventions (psychotherapy, social skills
             training, applied behavior analysis, or family therapy) whereas those randomized to
             CBT will not receive these interventions concurrent with CBT.

          2. New Treatments: Initiation of an antidepressant within 12 weeks before study
             enrollment or an antipsychotic 8 weeks before study enrollment. No new alternative
             medications, nutritionals or therapeutic diets within 8 weeks of study enrollment.

          3. Established Treatment changes: Any change in established psychotropic medication
             (e.g., antidepressants, anxioloytics) within 8 weeks before study enrollment, or any
             change in alternative medications that might have behavioral effects within 6 weeks
             prior to the study baseline assessment. Those randomized to TAU may make medication
             changes following randomization, including starting a medication; those randomized to
             CBT will remain stable on medications during the study.

          4. (a) Current clinically significant suicidality or (b) individuals who have engaged in
             suicidal behaviors within 6 months will be excluded and referred for appropriate
             clinical intervention.

          5. Lifetime DSM-IV bipolar, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders; or Substance
             abuse in past 6 months.

          6. Unwillingness of parents to make the commitment to accompany their child for multiple
             study visits.

          7. Presence of a significant and/or unstable medical illness which might lead to
             hospitalization during the study.
