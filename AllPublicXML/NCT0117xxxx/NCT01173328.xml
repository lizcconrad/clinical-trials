  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pursed-lip breathing (PLB) has been advocated to reduce respiratory rate and improve oxygen
      saturation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at rest. Although
      PLB is a strategy that potentially reduces expiratory flow limitation, there are only few
      studies addressing its effects on exercise.

      This study aimed to assess the ability of PLB to change the breathing pattern, degree of
      dynamic hyperinflation (DH) and arterial oxygenation in COPD patients during exercise.
      Exercise tolerance was evaluated by endurance time and respiratory mechanics was evaluated by
      forced oscillation technique.
