      The focus of this study is to create a database containing information about patients with
      celiac disease. This database will allow us to examine clinical and epidemiologic features of
      the University of Chicago Medical Center patient population. We have the largest population
      of patients with celiac disease in the mid-West and as such this study using information
      gathered from our database can greatly contribute to our current understanding of this
      disease.
