  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how balloon kyphoplasty (surgical repair of the
      patient's fracture using balloons and bone cement) compares to non-surgical treatment in
      reducing vertebral compression fractures while providing pain relief and improved function
      and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center study designed to compare balloon kyphoplasty to
      non-surgical management (NSM) in the treatment of mildly painful, acute vertebral body
      compression fractures in multiple myeloma patients. Because of the pilot nature and the small
      sample size of the study, patient randomization will NOT be stratified. Patients with mildly
      symptomatic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) will undergo a 1:1 randomization either
      balloon kyphoplasty or non surgical management. Randomization assignments will be generated
      by computer and investigator notified once the patient enrolled.

      The observational arm will be compared to each of the other two arms; control and
      intervention arm using the same outcome variables and statistical methods.

    <description>Two small metal tubes will be inserted through the skin into the collapsed bone. Inflatable bone tamps (balloon catheters) will be inserted through each of these two tubes into the bone. The balloons will be inflated with a liquid that can be seen on xrays (contrast) to return the bone toward its natural shape and create a cavity. The balloons will then be deflated and removed. The cavity in the bone will be filled with bone cement to stabilize the broken backbone.</description>

             Analog Scale [VAS]) ≤ 4 or no back pain (VAS=0) on a stable analgesic regimen) related
             to vertebral compression fractures (at least one and up to 8 index fractures from T3
             to L5) as seen on magnetic resonancy imaging (MRI), computed axial tomography (CT)
             scan or plain radiographs.

             requirements), or with epidural disease on magnetic resonance imaging. Spinal cord
             compression , canal compromise and /or spinal instability requiring decompression.

          -  Patients with a bleeding disorder which cannot be adequately managed perioperatively.

          -  Patients with pain unrelated to the VCF according to the investigators.

          -  Patients with estimated survival less than 6 months.

          -  Known allergy to bone cement or all contrast media used in the treatment of study
