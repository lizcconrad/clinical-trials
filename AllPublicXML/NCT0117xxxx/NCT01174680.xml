    <textblock>
      The register study CGM@CAD will examine whether cardiogoniometry can provide additional
      information concerning the indication for a diagnostic coronary angiography and if so, which
      additional value it has. Therefore, an additional cardiogoniometry will be carried out in
      consecutive patients who have been diagnosed with myocardial ischemia by means of established
      methods (exercise ECG, stress echocardiography, myocardial scintigraphy, or stress-MRT) and
      for whom an intracardiac catheter examination is regarded as indicated. The results of the
      different methods - particularly the results of the exercise ECG and the cardiogoniometry -
      will be checked against the results of the invasive examination as gold standard and the
      discharge diagnosis with regards to any correlation.

    <description>The protocol defines that the medical examination is to be preformed at hospital adimssion and again at discharge. Aim is to examine if cardiogoniometry can provide additional information for the decision to perform a diagnostic coronary angiography and if so, which additional value it has.</description>
