  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is to find out if opioid dependent chronic pain patients
      who are judged by their physician to be eligible to change their current opioid medicine and
      to participate in this study can be successfully adjusted to a stable dose of EMBEDA
      (morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride). The study will also assess each patient's
      risk for prescription opioid abuse, misuse and diversion.

      The decision to terminate the trial was based on a lack of study drug supply. The decision
      was not based on any safety concerns. The termination letter was sent on 11March2011.

    <description>Rescue pain medications were used for supplemental analgesia for breakthrough pain during titration phase. Morphine sulfate IR tablet (less than 20 percent of the total daily dose of EMBEDA per IR dose), ibuprofen (up to 400 milligram (mg)/dose; not to exceed 1200 mg/day), and acetaminophen (up to 1000 mg/dose, not to exceed 4000 mg/day) were used as rescue medications.</description>

    <description>BPI is an 11-item self-report questionnaire: consist of 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, relief) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each question answered on a scale range:0-10 (0%-100% for relief), '0=No pain/no relief/no interference and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine/complete relief/ complete interference'.Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>

Each question answered on a scale range:0-10 (0%-100% for relief), ‘0=No pain/no relief/no interference and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine/complete relief/ complete interference’.Measure can be scored by item, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.</description>
