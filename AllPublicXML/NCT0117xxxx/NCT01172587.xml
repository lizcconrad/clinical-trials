    <textblock>
      As they move from preadolescence to adolescence and adulthood, children need nurturing and
      supportive environments to realize their potential. Unfortunately, many children reside in
      destructive families that often result in negative short and long-term outcomes. As
      well-chronicled in the scientific and lay press, an all-too-common example involves parental
      substance abuse. Indeed, children living with a parent who abuses substances often have
      significant emotional, behavioral, and social problems. It has long been recognized that
      interventions are needed to address the clinical needs of these youth and to help prevent the
      development of problems that may emerge in early adulthood. To date, the majority of
      treatments have focused on either treating the children individually, or in the context of
      family therapy. Although directly involving these youth in treatment may be ideal, the
      majority of custodial parents who enter treatment for substance abuse are very reluctant to
      allow their children to engage in individual or family therapy. Thus, interventions for
      substance-abusing parents that do not directly involve children, but serve to improve the
      family environment as a whole, may have the greatest potential for reaching the most children
      and thereby positively influencing their overall adjustment and well-being.

      From this vantage, a promising approach is Behavioral Couples Therapy [BCT] for alcoholism
      and drug abuse, a comprehensive psychosocial intervention for substance abuse that focuses
      both on reducing addiction severity, improving couple adjustment, reducing interparental
      conflict and intimate partner violence (IPV), and improving the family environment and
      psychological functioning. In a series of preliminary studies, the PI found that children
      whose substance-abusing fathers and nonsubstance-abusing mothers participated in BCT
      displayed higher psychosocial adjustment at posttreatment and during an extended follow-up
      than youth whose substance-abusing fathers participated in individual-based treatment (IBT)
      or whose parents participated in a couples-based attention control treatment. These findings
      indicate that BCT may extend beyond the couple to their children and may provide an entry
      point into the family system from which to improve the adjustment of these youth.

      The present study is the next important step for this line of research. First, the present
      study is a far more developed examination of the potential effects of BCT on multiple
      dimensions of youth functioning, taken from multiple perspectives. Second, we do not know
      &quot;how&quot; BCT works. The positive effects of BCT on parents (reduced addition severity, improved
      dyadic adjustment, reduced partner violence, improved parenting, and improved parental
      psychological adjustment) may have positive &quot;trickle down&quot; effects on youth; however, we have
      not undertaken an empirical examination of these potential mechanisms of action. If we can
      understand how it works, we will be able to use that information to refine BCT to enhance the
      mechanisms that benefit youth. Thus, the present study will examine possible curative
      mechanisms. Third, we have a very limited understanding for &quot;whom&quot; it works. Thus, we will
      examine whether BCT may operate differently for children of different stages of development.
      If we can understand this moderating effect, we may be able to develop and refine BCT to meet
      the needs of families with children of different ages.

      To address these issues, the present study will examine how BCT is associated with changes in
      the emotional and behavioral adjustment, beliefs, and behaviors, including serious problem
      behaviors, of youth ages 5 to 18 (as rated by mothers, fathers, and the children themselves).
      We will also focus on potential mechanisms of action that are positively influenced by BCT.

      The present study provides the next important step for this line of research. First, the

      If we can understand this moderating effect, we may be able to develop and refine BCT to meet
      the needs of families with children of different ages.

      To address these issues, the present study will compare the emotional and behavioral
      adjustment, beliefs, and behaviors, including serious problem behaviors, of youth ages 5 to
      18 (as rated by mothers, fathers, and the children themselves) whose mothers or fathers take
      part in BCT to an Intent-to-Treat group. We will focus on potential mechanisms of action that
      are positively influenced by BCT.

      We intend to use the information collected from the proposed investigation to refine and
      modify BCT to enhance its positive effects on children. This process of (a) examining
      multiple dimensions of functioning and (b) evaluating theoretically and empirically
      identified mediators and moderators to inform intervention development and refinement has
      been used successfully for over a decade with BCT, resulting in empirically informed BCT
      variants for alcoholic patients, drug-abusing patients, patients who engage in domestic
      violence, female substance-abusing patients, and so on. Thus, this project provides the next
      critical step for BCT refinement and interventions for couples entering BCT who have
      custodial children, the latter of whom we may only be able to help by helping their parents.
