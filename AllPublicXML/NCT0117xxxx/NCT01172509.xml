  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall objective is to apply Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to develop measures
      of human synaptic plasticity and of brain excitatory:inhibitory ratio (E:I ratio), which we
      propose as novel biomarkers and outcome measures that will expedite clinical trials of
      treatments for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). One potential therapeutic agent, R-baclofen
      will be investigated under this protocol.

      TMS is a safe, inexpensive and noninvasive means to focally stimulate the human brain.
      Presently, TMS is in extensive use as a means to measure regional brain excitability, which
      is dependent on local synaptic strength. TMS can be used to temporarily alter synaptic
      strength as well as to acutely measure levels of cortical excitability and short and long
      interval inhibition. Since altered synaptic plasticity and an imbalanced
      inhibitory:excitatory ratio are cited as fundamental abnormalities in ASD, we hypothesize
      that both severity of ASD-related learning deficits and their improvement after therapy will
      correlate with TMS measures of synaptic plasticity and E:I ratio. We propose to embed TMS
      measures of synaptic plasticity and E:I ratio in a 'Proof of Principal' trial of R-baclofen
      and to examine:

      Aim 1: Whether R-baclofen (a potential therapeutic agent for ASD) predictably alters TMS
      measures of synaptic plasticity and E:I ratio as a function of plasma concentration in adult
      volunteers. We will test the following hypotheses:

        1. R-baclofen produces a significant change in TMS measures of LTD and E:I ratio; and

        2. R-baclofen plasma levels and TMS measures of LTD and E:I ratio show a predictable
           exposure-response relationship.

      Exploratory Aim 1: Whether the presence of genetic polymorphisms of the BDNF and GABA-B
      receptor genes has a moderating effect on TMS measures and on R-baclofen effects. We will
      test the following hypotheses:

        1. Presence of the BDNF val66met allele will be associated with decreased long-term
           depression (LTD) of cortical excitability

        2. Polymorphisms of GABA-B receptor genes will be associated with altered magnitude of
           response to R-baclofen as measured by TMS

      The design is a double-blind placebo controlled 5 way crossover trial of a single dose each
      of placebo x 2 (0 mg), 3, 10, and 25 mg of R-baclofen followed by plasma levels at 0, 30, 60,
      90, and 140 minutes after each dose; and TMS testing at 0, 30, 60, 90 (cTBS application at 90
      minute time point), 95, and then periodically every 5-10 minutes until the MEPs return to
      baseline. There will be a total of 7 visits. Patients will come in for a screening visit,
      then scheduled to return for 1 baseline visit (cTBS without drug) and 5 crossover visits. At
      each crossover visit a venous line will be placed for blood sampling and a single dose of
      study drug at one of the five dose levels will be given orally at time 0. There will be a
      one-week washout between each of the crossover arms (R-baclofen has a mean Tmax of
      approximately 80 minutes and a terminal half life of 4.9 hour).

    <description>Synaptic plasticity or LTD will be measured using the MEP in response to stimulation set at 80% of the active motor threshold. This MEP will be measured at 90 minutes after study drug dose to establish baseline MEP amplitude then LTD will be induced with the cTBS procedure. The amount of LTD remaining at the different time points, post-cTBS will be quantified by measuring the MEPs and dividing it by the baseline MEP. This will yield a percent of baseline MEP at the various time points.</description>
