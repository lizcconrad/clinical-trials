  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse noxious inhibitory control In order to quantify central sensitization in chronic pain
      patients, the Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control (DNIC) model has been used frequently. DNIC
      relies on painful conditioning stimulation of one part of the body to inhibit pain in another
      part, to remove the &quot;noise&quot; and to focus on relevant stimuli.

      Earlier studies provided evidence for malfunctioning of DNIC in Fibromyalgia (FM) patients.
      However, the cause of this impairment is not yet elucidated, and further study is required to
      unravel the pathophysiology of DNIC in FM.

      Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis Besides neural mechanisms, also hormonal
      abnormalities could cause altered pain processing. Cortisol is released in answer to pain to
      suppress the pain. Given the evidence for hypofunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      axis and the lower cortisol release in response to stressors in a proportion of FM patients
      and in chronic whiplash associated disorders (WAD) patients, the relation between pain and
      cortisol in these patients may be an interesting topic to consider.

      Neurocognitive performance Besides chronic pain, people with chronic WAD and FM suffer from
      severe concentration difficulties and decreased neurocognitive capabilities (reduced reaction
      time, short term memory deficits etc. The decreased neurocognitive performance is known to be
      related to pain severity in various chronic pain populations. It is hypothesized that
      malfunctioning of descending inhibitory pathways and subsequent chronic pain experience
      precludes optimal neurocognitive performance.

      Objectives The present investigation addresses the (patho)physiological mechanisms of DNIC in
      chronic pain populations.

        1. Firstly, patients with FM, chronic WAD and healthy controls are compared regarding
           functioning of DNIC, cortisol levels and response and neurocognitive performance
           (case-control).

        2. Secondly, the possible interaction between the functioning of DNIC, cortisol and
           neurocognitive performance is studied in patients with FM, WAD and healthy control
           subjects (cross-sectional).

        3. Thirdly, to examine whether a fatiguing neurocognitive stressor changes DNIC and
           cortisol levels in patients with FM, chronic WAD or healthy sedentary control subjects.

        Thirty patients with FM, 30 patients with WAD and 30 healthy pain-free control subjects
        will be enrolled. All three groups will be comparable for age, gender, education level and
        socioeconomic status; both patient groups will be comparable for illness duration. Sample
        size was calculated based on a power analysis (0.80), based on the assumption of a 20%
        difference of DNIC functioning after neurocognitive testing.
