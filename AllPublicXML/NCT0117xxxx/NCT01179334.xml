    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a severe progressive disease with a high mortality.
      Although several drugs are available for the treatment of PAH none offer a cure, therefore
      there is still a high medical need for new treatments.

      Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is one of the chemicals involved in the pathways controlling
      vascular tone, which is impaired in patients with PAH. This causes constriction and
      thickening of the blood vessels wall in the lungs and increase of blood pressure in the
      lungs. This can lead to the very debilitating symptoms of PAH such as tiredness, shortness of
      breath on exertion, collapse and often the inability of the patient to perform their daily
      life activities.

      Inhalation of Nitric Oxide, which activates sGC is used to treat PAH, but its effect wears
      off as soon as inhalation stops. Direct stimulation of sGC using this new compound Riociguat
      may be a new approach for the treatment of PAH.

      The phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5)-inhibitor Sildenafil is one of licensed treatments for PAH.
      The Patent Plus is a double-blind, placebo-controlled safety study, designed to investigate
      the effect of Riociguat on blood pressure in patients with PAH when given in combination with
      Sildenafil.

      Main objective: Evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effect of the combination of Sildenafil and
      Riociguat on blood pressure and other safety parameters in patients with symptomatic PAH
      Secondary objectives:To investigate the safety of the riociguat/sildenafil combination and
      changes in 6-minute walk test, World Health Organization (WHO) functional class, N terminal
      pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and variables obtained during right-heart catheterization
      after 12 weeks of treatment; pharmacokinetics of riociguat and sildenafil.

      The study consists of one part. In study Part 1 only subjects (18) on stable sildenafil
      treatment of 20 mg tid have been enrolled. Study Part 2 will not start.

    <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured as standard vital sign parameter. Range allowed in this study: &lt;= 180 mmHg. In addition, SBP must be &gt;=95 mmHg in the first 2 hours after intake of background treatment with sildenafil. The maximum change from baseline at each visit was defined as the within-subject maximum decrease from baseline (or zero if baseline was lower than all subsequent SBP measurements in that profile) within 4 hours post-dose.

      <recruitment_details>Only participants with symptomatic Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) could participate in this study. Subjects must be on pre-treatment with sildenafil at a dose of 20 mg three times daily (tid) (20 or 25 mg tid in New Zealand) for at least 90 days.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>24 subjects were enrolled in 11 study centers in 5 European countries. Six of the 24 subjects were screened but not randomized (screen failure [6]). 18 of the 24 participants were randomized. All of the 18 randomized participants received study medication.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured as standard vital sign parameter. Range allowed in this study: &lt;= 180 mmHg. In addition, SBP must be &gt;=95 mmHg in the first 2 hours after intake of background treatment with sildenafil. The maximum change from baseline at each visit was defined as the within-subject maximum decrease from baseline (or zero if baseline was lower than all subsequent SBP measurements in that profile) within 4 hours post-dose. Baseline was the last SBP recorded at and within 30 minutes before intake of study drug.</description>

        <title>Maximum Change From Baseline in Standing Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Within 4 Hours Post-dose at Visit 6 (Week 12)</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured as standard vital sign parameter. Range allowed in this study: &lt;= 180 mmHg. In addition, SBP must be &gt;=95 mmHg in the first 2 hours after intake of background treatment with sildenafil. The maximum change from baseline at each visit was defined as the within-subject maximum decrease from baseline (or zero if baseline was lower than all subsequent SBP measurements in that profile) within 4 hours post-dose. Baseline was the last SBP recorded at and within 30 minutes before intake of study drug.</description>

        <title>Area Under Effect Curve (AUEC) of Standing SBP Within 4 Hours Post-dose at Visit 6 (Week 12)</title>
        <description>The area under effect curve (AUEC) at each visit of standing SBP describes an average within-subject change in SBP from baseline over a time-period of 4 hours post-dose (Note that the area only takes values below the individual baseline for the respective visit into account. The area that would result from an increase from baseline is not taken into account for the calculation of the area). Baseline was the last SBP recorded at and within 30 minutes before intake of study drug.</description>
