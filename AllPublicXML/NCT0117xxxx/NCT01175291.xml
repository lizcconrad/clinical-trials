  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new drug, MK-0646, in metastatic
      colorectal cancer. MK-0646 is an investigational or experimental anti-cancer agent that has
      not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in metastatic
      colorectal cancer or any other disease.

      This study will assess whether adding MK-0646 to an FDA-approved standard of care
      chemotherapy improves participants' duration of progression-free survival. MK-0646 is
      believed to inhibit the receptor of a protein called IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor) which
      is thought to contribute to cancer development and growth. However, there is no guarantee
      that MK-0646 will slow cancer development and growth.

      Other purposes of this study include:

        -  looking at the safety and tolerability of MK-0646

        -  comparing MK-0646 + standard of care chemotherapy with placebo + standard of care
           chemotherapy (placebo is a substance that looks like an active drug but has no active
           ingredient) The standard of care chemotherapy in this study is called FOLFOX 7. FOLFOX 7
           includes the drugs oxaliplatin with leucovorin, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), and bevacizumab.

      Participants randomized to ARM A will receive modified FOLFOX 7 every other week + MK-0646
      every week:

      5-FU 400 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 2-5 minutes Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 by intravenous
      infusion over 2 hours Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 2 hours (with
      leucovorin) Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes (+/- 15 minutes)
      following infusions may be given over 10 minutes (+/- 10 minutes) if the first infusion is
      tolerated well.

      5-FU 2400 mg/m2 by continuous intravenous infusion over 46 hours (may be delivered via
      automated outpatient pump) Antiemetics (drugs that prevent nausea and vomiting): 5-HT3
      receptor antagonist (e.g. ondansetron) and dexamethasone are recommended prior to
      chemotherapy.

      MK-0646 10 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every week (participants larger than
      100 kg [220 pounds] will receive their infusions over 120 minutes).

      Participants randomized to ARM B will receive modified FOLFOX 7 every other week + placebo
      every week:

      5-FU 400 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 2-5 minutes Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 by intravenous
      infusion over 2 hours Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 2 hours (with
      leucovorin) Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes (+/- 15 minutes);
      following infusions may be given over 10 minutes (+/- 10 minutes) if the first infusion is
      tolerated well.

      automated outpatient pump) Antiemetics: 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (e.g. ondansetron) and
      dexamethasone are recommended prior to chemotherapy Placebo by intravenous infusion over 60
      minutes every week (participants larger than 100 kg [220 pounds] will receive their infusions
      over 120 minutes).
