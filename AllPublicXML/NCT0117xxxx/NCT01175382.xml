      The primary aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of combined behavioral +
      drug therapy compared to behavioral treatment alone and drug therapy alone as a way to
      improve outcomes in the treatment of OAB symptoms in men. We hypothesize that combined
      therapy will result in better outcomes than either behavioral or drug therapy alone. The
      second aim is to compare two methods of implementing combined therapy: simultaneously as
      initial therapy vs. stepped therapy, in which therapies are combined following initial
      behavioral or drug therapy alone. The third aim is to examine the costs and
      cost-effectiveness of combined behavioral + drug therapy compared to behavioral or drug
      therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a very common, distressing condition that manifests as bothersome
      symptoms of urgency, frequent urination, urge incontinence, and nocturia, and impacts the
      lives of millions of men. OAB symptoms are most often treated with pharmacologic therapies
      (alpha-blocking agents and/or antimuscarinic agents) or behavioral treatments. Although drug
      therapies (even combined drug therapies) and behavioral treatments reduce OAB symptoms, few
      patients are completely cured with either treatment alone. Therefore, there is a need to
      improve interventions for this common problem. The primary purpose of this study is to test
      the effectiveness of combining behavioral treatment and drug therapy as a way to improve
      outcomes in the treatment of OAB symptoms in men. This is a 3-site, 2-stage, 3-arm randomized
      clinical trial of behavioral treatment, drug therapy, and combined drug + behavioral therapy
      for men with OAB, to examine the efficacy of combined therapy and whether it yields higher
      success rates than either therapy alone. 204 men with OAB were enrolled and randomized to 1)
      drug therapy alone followed by combined therapy, 2) behavioral treatment alone followed by
      combined therapy, or 3) combined therapy as initial treatment.

    <description>Bladder diaries completed prior to randomization and following each phase of treatment will be used to calculate changes in urgency associated with each void and incontinent episode using the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS). IUSS asks patients about the degree of urgency, as meant to describe the urge to urinate. Patients are asked to rate the degree of urgency and its impact on the completion of activity or tasks during the time that the urgency sensation is present and before reaching the toilet for a toilet void. Four distinct, subjective degrees of urgency severity were identified, including 1) no sensation of urgency, 2) awareness of urgency but easily tolerated, 3) urgency that is somewhat uncomfortable and 4) extreme urgency discomfort.</description>

    <description>Behavioral treatment is implemented in 4 clinic visits over a period of 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of combined behavioral + drug therapy. Behavioral treatment consists of behavioral training and includes skills and strategies for postponing urination, controlling urgency and preventing urge incontinence. This includes pelvic floor muscle training, incremental delayed voiding, and daily bladder diaries, supplemented with instructions for daily home practice between clinic visits. In addition to daytime training, nocturia is managed with fluid restriction (3 hours before bedtime and during the night) and with urge strategies.</description>

          1. Community-dwelling men

          2. Age 40 years or older

          3. Patient-reported urgency and 9.0 or more voids per 24-hour day (on average) on the
             7-day baseline bladder diary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Urinary flow rate &lt; 8.0 mL/sec on a void greater than 125 ml.

          2. Post-void residual volume greater than 150 mL (based on bladder ultrasound after
             voiding in the presence of a normal urge to urinate).

          3. Urinary tract infection (defined as growth of greater than 10,000 colonies per ml of a
             urinary pathogen on urine culture). Patients will be referred for treatment with
             antibiotics and may be enrolled if OAB symptoms persist after the infection is
             resolved.

          4. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), simple prostatectomy, or other benign
             prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) related surgery within the past 5 years.

         16. Current use of an anti-muscarinic agent for OAB. Evaluation will be delayed until the
             drug has been discontinued for 2 weeks.

         17. If on a diuretic, dose has not been stable for at least 4 weeks.

         18. If taking dutasteride or finasteride, dose has not been stable for at least 6 months.

         19. If on an antibiotic for prostatitis. Patients will be offered re-evaluation if OAB
             symptoms persist when antibiotics are completed.

          <title>Behavioral Treatment Alone</title>
          <description>Behavioral treatment implemented in 4 clinic visits over a period of 6 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of combined behavioral + drug therapy. Behavioral treatment consists of skills and strategies for postponing urination, controlling urgency, and preventing urge incontinence. This includes pelvic floor muscle training, urge suppression techniques, incremental delayed voiding, and daily bladder diaries to track increasing voiding intervals and enhance awareness of bladder habits. Training is supplemented with instructions for daily home practice between clinic visits. In addition to daytime training, nocturia is managed with fluid restriction (3 hours before bedtime and during the night) and with urge strategies.</description>

        <description>Bladder diaries completed prior to randomization and following each phase of treatment will be used to calculate changes in urgency associated with each void and incontinent episode using the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS). IUSS asks patients about the degree of urgency, as meant to describe the urge to urinate. Patients are asked to rate the degree of urgency and its impact on the completion of activity or tasks during the time that the urgency sensation is present and before reaching the toilet for a toilet void. Four distinct, subjective degrees of urgency severity were identified, including 1) no sensation of urgency, 2) awareness of urgency but easily tolerated, 3) urgency that is somewhat uncomfortable and 4) extreme urgency discomfort.</description>

        <title>Change in Urgency Score From 6 Weeks to 12 Weeks (Last Observation Carried Forward)</title>
        <description>Bladder diaries completed by subjects prior to randomization and following each phase of treatment will be used to calculate changes in urgency associated with each void and incontinent episode using the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS). IUSS asks patients about the degree of urgency, as meant to describe the urge to urinate. Patients are asked to rate the degree of urgency and its impact on the completion of activity or tasks during the time that the urgency sensation is present and before reaching the toilet for a toilet void. Four distinct, subjective degrees of urgency severity were identified, including 1) no sensation of urgency, 2) awareness of urgency but easily tolerated, 3) urgency that is somewhat uncomfortable and 4) extreme urgency discomfort.</description>

            <description>Combined behavioral and drug therapy implemented in 4 clinic visits over a period of 6 weeks, followed by an additional 6 weeks of combined therapy. Behavioral treatment consists of behavioral training and includes skills and strategies for postponing urination, controlling urgency and preventing urge incontinence. This includes pelvic floor muscle training, incremental delayed voiding, and bladder diaries, supplemented with instructions for daily home practice. Nocturia is managed with fluid restriction (3 hours before bedtime and during the night) and with urge strategies. Drug therapy consists of an anti-muscarinic (sustained release tolterodine 4 mg) + an alpha blocker (tamsulosin 0.4mg daily).</description>

          <title>Change in Urgency Score From 6 Weeks to 12 Weeks (Last Observation Carried Forward)</title>
          <description>Bladder diaries completed by subjects prior to randomization and following each phase of treatment will be used to calculate changes in urgency associated with each void and incontinent episode using the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS). IUSS asks patients about the degree of urgency, as meant to describe the urge to urinate. Patients are asked to rate the degree of urgency and its impact on the completion of activity or tasks during the time that the urgency sensation is present and before reaching the toilet for a toilet void. Four distinct, subjective degrees of urgency severity were identified, including 1) no sensation of urgency, 2) awareness of urgency but easily tolerated, 3) urgency that is somewhat uncomfortable and 4) extreme urgency discomfort.</description>

        <title>Change in Urgency Score From Baseline to 12 Weeks (Last Observation Carried Forward)</title>
        <description>Bladder diaries completed by subjects prior to randomization and following each phase of treatment will be used to calculate changes in frequency of urgency associated with each void and incontinent episode using the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS). IUSS asks patients about the degree of urgency, as meant to describe the urge to urinate. Patients are asked to rate the degree of urgency and its impact on the completion of activity or tasks during the time that the urgency sensation is present and before reaching the toilet for a toilet void. Four distinct, subjective degrees of urgency severity were identified, including 1) no sensation of urgency, 2) awareness of urgency but easily tolerated, 3) urgency that is somewhat uncomfortable and 4) extreme urgency discomfort.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks on the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) to measure urinary symptoms related to BPH. The I-PSS is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).</description>

Behavioral treatment consists of behavioral training and includes skills and strategies for postponing urination, controlling urgency and preventing urge incontinence. This includes pelvic floor muscle training, incremental delayed voiding, and bladder diaries, supplemented with instructions for daily home practice. Nocturia is managed with fluid restriction (3 hours before bedtime and during the night) and with urge strategies. Drug therapy consists of an anti-muscarinic (sustained release tolterodine 4 mg) + an alpha blocker (tamsulosin 0.4mg daily).</description>

          <title>Change in International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) From Baseline to 12 Weeks (Last Observation Carried Forward)</title>
          <description>Change from Baseline to 12 weeks on the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) to measure urinary symptoms related to BPH. The I-PSS is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).</description>
