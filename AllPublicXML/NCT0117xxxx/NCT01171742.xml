  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion (IHIO), also called Pringle maneuver, is a safe and
      effective procedure for major hepatectomy in patients with liver disease. In addition,
      ischemic preconditioning with IHIO has been reported to have protective effects in patients
      undergoing liver resection. The role of IHIO, however, has not been fully elucidated in
      donors and recipients during living donor liver transplantation.

      Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion (IHIO) by clamping of the portal triad, also called
      Pringle maneuver, is a safe and effective procedure in major hepatectomy in patients with
      liver disease. IHIO minimizes blood loss and operation time during liver resection. In
      addition, ischemic preconditioning with IHIO has been reported to have protective effects in
      patients undergoing liver resection. In the setting of living donor liver transplantation
      (LDLT), one of the most important concerns is liver donor safety. Several studies have shown
      the safety of IHIO in donors for liver transplantation (LT). However, the effect of
      preconditioning with IHIO during donor hepatectomy on LDLT recipients remains unclear.
      Several small series have assessed the effects on recipients of ischemic preconditioning
      during whole liver transplantation from deceased donors. The role of IHIO, however, has not
      been fully elucidated in liver donors and recipients during LDLT. In this randomized,
      prospective study, we'll evaluate the efficacy of IHIO in the recipients and donors.

    <description>Biopsy samples'll be taken from donors at the time of laparotomy, just before portal vein and hepatic artery clamping after parenchymal resection, and from recipients two hours after reperfusion. Hepatocyte injury will be determined by measuring the concentrations of caspase-3, and malondialdehyde (MDA) by ELISA.</description>

    <description>Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion (IHIO) by clamping of the portal triad, minimizes blood loss and operation time during liver resection. In addition, ischemic preconditioning with IHIO has been reported to have protective effects in patients undergoing liver resection. IHIO'll be usually performed 3 times during donor liver parenchymal resection, with each IHIO consisting of clamping of the hepatoduodenal ligament for 15 minutes, followed by reperfusion for 5 minutes.</description>
