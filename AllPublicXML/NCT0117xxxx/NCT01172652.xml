    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      ziprasidone monotherapy in comparison to placebo in the treatment of ambulatory bipolar
      disorder with co-morbid lifetime panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder and current
      at least moderately severe anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 8-week trial of
      ziprasidone compared to placebo in outpatient subjects with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or NOS
      disorder, a lifetime panic or generalized anxiety disorder, and current diagnosis at least
      moderately severe anxiety symptoms. Approximately 50 subjects will be randomized. Subjects
      will be randomized to ziprasidone or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. No concomitant psychotropic
      medication will be allowed throughout the study except for prn lorazepam during the first two
      weeks for the management of affective and anxiety symptoms, prn zolpidem and zaleplon for the
      management of insomnia and benztropine for the management of EPS. Throughout the study,
      psychiatric scales will be used to assess psychiatric symptoms and the presence of
      treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored and recorded.
