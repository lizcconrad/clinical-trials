      The purpose of this study is to study the molecular effects of the chemopreventative agent,
      finasteride, in combination with dietary soy supplementation in patients at high risk for the
      development of prostate cancer. Also, the investigators intend to create a large database
      with health information from men who are at high risk of developing prostate cancer, along
      with serum and tissue samples from those patients who are willing to provide tissue and serum
      samples.

    <textblock>
      Over 180,000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year,
      making prostate cancer the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men. With an estimated 28,660
      deaths occurring in 2008, prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men.
      In Kansas, prostate cancer is also the most frequent cancer among men and ranked third (253
      deaths in 2006) behind lung cancer (884 deaths in 2006) and colorectal cancer (273 deaths in
      2006) in cancer related mortality. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality related to
      this disease, screening and treatment approaches remain controversial and there is
      significant morbidity related to the treatment of early stage disease. Preventative
      strategies and strategies which identify patients at highest risk are needed desperately.

      The goal of this proposal is to study the molecular effects of the chemopreventative agent,
      finasteride in combination with dietary soy supplementation in patients at high risk for the
      development prostate cancer.
