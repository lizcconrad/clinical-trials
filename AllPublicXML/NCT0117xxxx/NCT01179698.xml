      Bone tumor near the articular cartilage is hard to remove sufficiently without damaging
      adjacent joint. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of
      navigation-assisted surgery for saving joint in bone tumor resection or curettage. In this
      study, the investigators hypothesized that computer-assisted surgery is feasible method to
      get both enough margin and joint salvage. Each of them is important intermediate factor for
      either oncologic outcome or functional outcome respectively. The investigators designed this
      study to find what proportion of patients who underwent computer-assisted resection could get
      enough margins using some criteria obtained by overlapping preoperative and postoperative
      images. The investigators also evaluated whether computer-assisted surgery can be feasible
      for joint saving using some criteria including functional outcome.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. First condition is that the benign tumor is located deeply in bones of extremities, or
             pelvis, so we anticipate the difficulty to find the tumor and to assess the adequacy
             of resection without the aid of computer-assisted navigation during operation.

          2. Second condition is when the violation of joint or growth plate is expected during
             removal of tumor due to its close proximity to joint or growth plate.

        In case of malignant bone tumor, the sufficient preservation of joint anatomy should be
        required even with resection margin of 1.5 cm away from reactive zone of tumor. The
        sufficient preservation of joint is defined when at least 1 cm subchondral bone is remained
        after tumor resection, because 1 cm subchondral bone is required for fixation with
        allograft in subsequent reconstruction. The sufficient preservation of joint is also
        defined when articular surface is removed, but more than 50% of articular surface has to be
        saved.

        Exclusion criteria were

          1. Patients who denied to perform navigation surgery after explanation of navigation
             surgery protocol

          2. Medically high-risk patients who could not withstand long surgical time for joint
             reconstruction

          3. Patients whose feasibility of joint preservation was not fulfill the above inclusion
             criteria at initial presentation, although the tumor size was decreased enough to
             fulfill the inclusion criteria in MRI after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
