  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common type of heart disease, is caused by hardening
      of the arteries, or atherosclerosis that is an inflammatory process in which immune
      mechanisms interact with metabolic risk factors to initiate, propagate, and activate lesions
      in the arterial trees. Epidemiological studies have found that increased cardiovascular risks
      are associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin-6 [IL-6] and
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha[TNF-alpha]) or their hepatic product, C-reactive protein (CRP).
      Higher expression of interleukin-Ibeta(IL-1beta),IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1
      (MCP-1), and TNF-alpha were observed in epicardial adipose tissues in patients with CAD.
      These findings suggested that the pericoronary tissues could be a source of inflammatory
      mediators or act as paracrine that lead to vascular inflammation on CAD pathogenesis.
      However, adiponectin, a kind of adipocytokine, produced and secreted exclusively by adipose
      tissue, has been reported to have a variety of anti-inflammatory functions against
      atherosclerosis, resulting in risk reduction for incidence of CAD events. It remains unclear
      whether adiponectin and inflammatory mediators in mediastinal adipose tissue contribute to
      CAD. We therefore aim to analyze the expression of adiponectin and inflammatory mediators in
      mediastinal adipose tissue between patients with CAD and with valve diseases, and to
      correlate these parameters with clinical atherosclerotic risks, medications (statins or
      antiplatelet), and blood sugar.

      Adipose tissue biopsy samples from mediastinal fat, epicardial fat, subcutaneous fat in
      thoracic region or abdominal region and subcutaneous fat in leg were obtained soon after
      sternotomy or thoracotomy before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass.
