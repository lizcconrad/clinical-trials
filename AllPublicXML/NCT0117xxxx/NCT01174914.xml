  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the vast majority of those infected with HIV virus who are untreated, there is
      deterioration in immune health over a period of months or years inevitably leading to
      full-blown AIDS and demise. Treatment with ARV's stop or slow down this deterioration if
      started before a certain degree of progression occurs and has saved millions of lives. The
      investigators' study hypothesis is that effectiveness of a very low dose of an FDA-approved
      medication, naltrexone hydrochloride, (Low-Dose Naltrexone, or LDN) will compare favorably to
      ARV's to prevent progression of HIV+ toward immune deterioration and full-blown AIDS.

      The LDN (low-dose naltrexone) vs ARV (anti-retroviral drugs) Effectiveness Study in Mali
      sponsored by The Ojai Foundation in California-USA is a clinical research study endorsed and
      approved by the Malian Government. Naltrexone hydrochloride is a generic, FDA-approved since
      1998 drug, an opioid antagonist that has clinically shown immune enhancing/modulating
      qualities in very low dosage and may offer an alternative to ARV drugs that is effective,
      non-toxic, easily available, inexpensive, with simple once-daily at bedtime administration.
      LDN capsules must be created by compounding pharmacists to get these ultra-small doses. Due
      to toxicity of current ARV drugs and need for special medical management young HIV infected
      children are largely neglected particularly in developing countries; LDN can also be made
      available in a transdermal cream for infants and children who are HIV infected.
