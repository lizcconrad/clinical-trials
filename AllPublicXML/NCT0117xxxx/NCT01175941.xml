  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to examine the effect of alpha adrenergic stimulation of the anal canal and
      rectum on parameters affecting the control of defecation in subjects with faecal
      incontinence. The study will investigate the effects of rectal suppositories containing 10 mg
      NRL001 given for seven days, once daily. Rectal compliance and median anal resting pressure
      will be considered the primary objective of the study. A pharmacokinetic evaluation plus
      safety and tolerability assessment including monitoring of electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood
      pressure and heart rate will also be evaluated as secondary objectives.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patient volunteers aged 40 to 85 years without clinically significant
             or uncontrolled cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease (as determined by medical
             history, physical examination, laboratory test values, vital signs, and
             electrocardiograms [ECGs] at screening)

          -  Patients with mild/moderate passive faecal incontinence based on clinical symptomology
             and demonstrating the following criteria:

          -  ARP ≥20mmHg and ≤80mmHg

          -  Intact IAS as demonstrated by endoanal ultrasound

          -  Rectal capacity ≥150ml

             by serum FSH at screening), or surgically sterile, practising true sexual abstinence,
             or using Investigator-approved methods of contraception throughout the study until
             after post study physical examination and have a negative pregnancy test at screening

             fissures). Conditions considered not interfering with the study medication are allowed

          -  Clinically relevant ECG-abnormalities with evident QTc prolongation and/or acute

          -  Use of any medication currently or within the last 30 days which the investigator
             believes may affect the study participation or results

          -  Unstable regimen of any statin, hypertensive or diuretic medication (patient
             volunteers must be on a stable regimen for at least 2 months)

          -  Participation in a clinical drug study during the 90 days preceding the initial dose
             in this study

          -  History of any allergy to nifedipine or any alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist or latex

          -  Consumption of alcoholic beverages within 24 hours prior to each dosing

          -  Volunteers who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unsuitable for participation
             in the study
