      This double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of STAHIST
      vs. placebo over a 2-week period in 100 study subjects with a history of SAR for at least two
      years. The study will take place in two sites, Louisville, KY and South Bend, IN. SAR
      symptoms to be scored and compared include: nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching,
