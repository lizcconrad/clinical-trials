      The primary aim of the study is to assess and follow-up subjects that received
      AdGVVEGF121cDNA in IRB protocol #0794-894 entitled &quot;Phase I Study of Direct Administration of
      a Replication Deficient Adenovirus Vector (AdGVVEGF121.10) Containing the VEGF121 cDNA to the
      Ischemic Myocardium of Individuals with Diffuse Coronary Artery Disease&quot; and IRB protocol
      #0297-693 entitled &quot;Phase I Study of Direct Administration of a Replication Deficient
      Adenovirus Vector (AdGVVEGF121.10) Containing the VEGF121 cDNA to the Ischemic Myocardium of
      Individuals with Diffuse Coronary Artery Disease Via Minimally Invasive Surgery&quot;.

      A research coordinator from Weill Cornell Medical College will survey the medical records of
      all 31 subjects, and obtain contact information for all living subjects. Living subjects will
      be called by the research coordinator at Stony Brook University Medical Center and invited to
      participate in the current follow-up study, which will entail a full medical chart review. If
      the potential subject is interested, he/she will be invited to Stony Brook University Medical
      Center where Dr. Rosengart or a designated co-investigator conducts the informed consent
      process. However, subjects who are unable to travel to Stony Brook University Medical Center
      will be mailed the consent form. Those who consent to participate will compile their medical
      records and send them to Stony Brook University Medical Center. The research coordinator at
      Stony Brook will conduct a chart review in order to collect information regarding the
      subject's medication, evaluation and surgical history over the past 10 years. This
      information will include cardiac health evaluations such as 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT, treadmill
      exercise tolerance test and cardiac specific blood tests. These parameters will be compared
      to evaluations done at baseline and evaluations done at the subject's last visit as a
      participant of either Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol #0794-894 or #0297-693.

    <description>The Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Score will be graded as:
Grade I Stable angina develops upon strenuous, rapid, and/or prolonged exertion during work or recreation but is not induced by ordinary physical activity..
Grade II
Stable angina is characterized by a slight limitation of ordinary activity and is induced by:
Walking uphill or climbing stairs rapidly Walking or stair-climbing after meals Walking more than two level blocks or climbing more than one flight of ordinary stairs at a normal pace and in normal conditions Emotional stress During the few hours after waking
Grade III Stable angina is characterized by marked limitation of ordinary physical activity. It is induced by walking one or two level blocks and climbing one flight of stairs in normal conditions and at a normal pace.
Grade IV Stable angina is characterized by an inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Angina syndrome may be present at rest.</description>
