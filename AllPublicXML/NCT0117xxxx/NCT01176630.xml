  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a survey to answer the specific question, &quot;What is the prevalence of metabolic
      syndrome in maintenance hemodialysis patients?&quot; Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions
      that increase an individual's risk for developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Risk factors for metabolic syndrome will be collected for each consented patient. They
      include elevated serum triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, hypertension, elevated fasting
      blood sugar concentration and abdominal obesity. The investigator will measure waist
      circumference of each consented patient in a secure area according to standardized
      procedures. The other data is available from the patient's medical record.
