      This is a Humanitarian Use Device study. A Humanitarian Use Device is a medical device
      intended to benefit patients in treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that affects
      or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 individuals per year in the United States. This consent
      and authorization form explains why this HUD study is being done and what your role will be
      if you choose to take part. This form also describes the possible risks connected with being
      in this study. After reviewing this information with the person responsible for your
      enrollment, you should know enough to be able to make an informed decision on whether you
      want to take part in the study. You may choose not to take part in this study

      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have liver cancer and are not
      eligible for surgery. You are being asked to receive humanitarian use device (HUD -- a device
      used only in patients with rare diseases) treatment at The University of Texas MD Anderson
      Cancer Center (&quot;MD Anderson&quot;).

      The goal of this study is to learn more about the patient experience, including any reported
      side effects and possible benefit related to the use of the TheraSphere device for treatment
      of liver cancer. Because treatment using the TheraSphere device must be designed specifically
      for each patient, the treatment process will also be monitored.

      The Humanitarian Use Device Program is for FDA approved device that is safe and provides
      probable benefit.

      TheraSphere is a humanitarian use device that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      rare disorders affecting less than 4,000 people in the U.S. each year.

      Up to 200 patients will receive the treatment. All will be enrolled at M.D. Anderson.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TheraSphere is a medical device containing yttrium-90 (Y-90), a radioactive material that has
      been used to treat liver tumors. When Y-90 is put into microscopic glass beads, called
      microspheres, it can be injected directly into the liver by artery. This allows a large dose
      of radiation to be delivered directly to the tumor, which lowers the risk of experiencing
      toxic radiation side effects from the radiation to in other parts of the body, or to healthy
      liver tissue. The radiation from TheraSphere treatment stays in the body and begins to lose
      its effect within 12 days, due to physical decay (please refer to the package insert for more
      information for more information regarding this). The glass microspheres will stay in the
      body from that point on, but should not cause any health problems.

      All visits and procedures related to the TheraSphere treatment will be performed on an
      outpatient basis. About 2 weeks before the treatment begins, a small tube (catheter) will be
      inserted into an artery that goes to the liver, usually in the thigh.

      TheraSphere Treatment:

      TheraSphere (microspheres filled with Y-90 as described above) will be injected into the
      tumor in the liver through a catheter that you have already had placed into an artery during
      an earlier procedure.

      You will receive at least 1 TheraSphere injection while you are receiving the treatment. If
      the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a second injection about 1 month later. The
      number of TheraSphere injections you will receive will depend on the size and location of the
      tumors. The injection should take about 5 minutes to complete each time.

      After receiving the TheraSphere injection, you will stay at the hospital for several hours so
      that the staff can check you for possible side effects. If you experience any serious
      problems or complications after receiving the injection, you may be admitted to the hospital
      for observation and possible additional treatment.

      Length of Treatment:

      You will continue to receive the HUD treatment indefinitely.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of unresectable intrahepatic HCC. The histopathology confirmation criterion
             may be waived in patients with a radiographically identifiable liver mass, known

             alphafetoprotein (AFP)^21 and clinical findings. Guidelines from the American
             Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for
             the Study of the Liver (EASL) describe in detail the approach and algorithm for
             diagnosing HCC.

             preclude catheterization.

          3. Evidence of potential delivery of greater than 16.5 mCi (30 Gy absorbed dose) of
             radiation to the lungs in a single treatment

             treatment or, in the judgment of the physician, place the patient at undue risk

         11. Pregnancy

         12. Tumor type demonstrated on imaging to be infiltrative, tumor volume &gt; 70% of the
             target liver volume, or tumor nodules too numerous to count, or tumor volume &gt; 50%
