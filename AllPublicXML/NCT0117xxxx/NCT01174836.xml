  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: The majority of Emergency physicians and patients do not feel that specific
      informed consent should be obtained for ED CT scans.

      Secondary Hypothesis: Emergency attending physicians and residents will have similar
      attitudes about CT scan consent issues. Physician attitudes toward obtaining consent for CT
      scans will change after an educational program about the associated risks.

    <textblock>
      ED residents and ED attendings who attend grand rounds will be given a survey and asked to
      anonymously complete the first portion before grand rounds (Figure 1, example A). The first
      portion will assess basic demographics, CT ordering patterns and experiences, and attitudes
      about informed consent. They will be provided with an educational program at grand rounds
      that reviews current literature relevant to CT utilization and consent issues. After the
      lecture they will be asked to complete the second section of the survey (Figure 1, Example
      B). Both portions of the survey will be simultaneously returned in a sealed envelope and
      placed in a collection box at grand rounds.

      ED attendings who do not attend grand rounds will only be asked to complete the first portion
      of the survey (Figure 1, example A). Resident or attending consent to participate will not be
      coerced, and participation will be implied by completion of the survey.
