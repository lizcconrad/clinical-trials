      The objective of this study is to define the clinical significance of the Neuregulin/ErbB
      signaling pathway and novel echocardiographic measures of cardiac function in predicting
      incident risk of chemotherapy cardiotoxicity.

      The overall study objectives are:

        1. To determine the longitudinal relationships between circulating NRG-1β levels and
           incident risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients exposed to anthracycline,
           trastuzumab, or a combination of the two agents. We hypothesize that a sustained
           increase in NRG-1β, indicative of enhanced cardiac stress with exposure to
           chemotherapeutic agents, is predictive of an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction and
           heart failure.

        2. To study the SNP/haplotype variation in the Neuregulin/ErbB signaling pathway on
           incident risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We hypothesize that there will be
           SNP/haplotypes variations that are associated with incident cardiovascular outcomes.

        3. To determine the longitudinal relationships between echocardiographic measures of strain
           and strain rate and incident cardiac dysfunction in patients exposed to anthracycline,
           trastuzumab, or a combination of the two agents. We hypothesize that early declines in
           strain and strain rate are predictive of an increased risk of future cardiac dysfunction
           and heart failure.

        4. To explore the changes in NRG-1β levels and the relationships with novel
           echocardiographic measures of cardiac function.

        5. To create a biobank as a future resource for additional questions in novel biomarkers
           and genetics.

        6. To determine the long-term effects of cancer therapy cardiotoxicity by following
           patients yearly for a total of 5 years after their exposure to cancer therapy.

        Subjects with breast cancer will enter the cohort prior to chemotherapy initiation and be
        evaluated at baseline and at regular intervals during the first approximately 15 months
        after chemotherapy is initiated. Furthermore, given that our goals are to grow our
        understanding of the late effects of these regimens, we will follow patients once yearly
        after 1st year of exposure to cancer therapy for a total of 5 years from when they began
        treatment.
