      Summary: (Objectives and methodology of the project) AIM: To evaluate the clinical
      effectiveness of Community physiotherapy intervention on chronic diseases (heart disease,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, back pain, mechanical neck pain, fibromyalgia,
      osteoarthritis lower limbs, neurological and cancer survivors) and a group of healthy
      patients cardiovascular risk factors. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, prospective study.
      SUBJECTS OF STUDY: Patients with chronic disease go to the Local Sports Torremolinos Center
      INTERVENTION: Establishment of a control group that give you some advice education care
      (brief advice) and a group common experimental multimodal program of 12 weeks therapeutic
      exercise with health education (brief advice). It will follow up complete with ratings pre
      and post intervention to both groups and follow up at 6 and 12 months for long-term effect
      through specific questionnaires for each subgroup chronic disease and pain score (visual
      scale analog), quality of life (EuroQol-5D) and state health general (Short-Form 12, SF-12)
      VARIABLES: The intervention physical therapy Community. Result: Specific questionnaires for
      each subgroup, pain (Visual analogue scale), quality of life (EuroQoL) and general health
      status (SF-12). DATA ANALYSIS: descriptive statistics, measuring central tendency and
      dispersion of the variables study. Inferential statistics will be made between intervention
      of key variables and outcome (Chi square, Student t, ANOVA, Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon, by type
      and normal variables). Likewise, establish measures of effect size in main outcome variables,
      by reduction relative risk, absolute risk and odds ratio with their respective confidence
      intervals.

    <description>The intervention was an 8-week programme of MMPP combined with DWR, delivered by physiotherapists in groups of 8 to 10 participants. One-hour sessions were conducted 3 times per week, consisting of DWR and an individualised MMPP of therapeutic exercises combined with education based on cognitive-behavioural principles. Each session was comprised of 30 minutes of land-based exercise followed by 20 minutes of DWR, with an additional 10 minutes of warm-up and cool-down time. Deep water running stimulates running using a flotation device in water levels over head height. During the first two weeks of the intervention, participants undertook a low-intensity adaptation interval to learn proper exercise technique. For the remaining six weeks, participants were instructed to maintain a constant speed to achieve the prescribed HRAT. If experiencing pain while exercising, participants were asked to temporarily reduce intensity and return to target HR as capable.</description>
