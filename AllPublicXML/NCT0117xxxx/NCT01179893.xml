  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunomodulation is effective in treating patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), but prior
      studies have not adequately defined if plasma exchange (PLEX) in superior to intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. This study aimed to determine if
      PLEX was superior to IVIG in the treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis.

      Patients with MG requiring immunomodulation are randomized to IVIG or PLEX and treated with a
      full course of immunomodulation. The quantitative myasthenia gravis score (QMGS) will be
      evaluated as the primary efficacy parameter at day 14 to determine if PLEX is superior to
      IVIG.
