  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-blinded, prospective study of 20 subjects aged 13 through 18 with
      mild to moderate acne. Study subjects will be randomized to an internet survey group, in
      which an email link for a survey ascertaining the status of the subject's acne is sent
      weekly, or to a control group. All study subjects will use benzoyl peroxide 5% gel, and
      adherence and clinical improvement will be monitored over 12 weeks. The investigators
      hypothesis is that subjects in the internet survey group will have improved adherence to the
      study medication and clinical outcomes, because the weekly survey will remind subjects to use
      their medication.

    <measure>The Measured Adherence by the MEMS Cap in Relation to the Patient Reported Adherence Via the Internet Survey.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence will be objectively measured with the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) cap and the percentage of prescribed doses taken will be reported. Study subjects' self-reported adherence (in the intervention group, via the weekly internet survey) will be compared to objectively measured adherence via MEMS caps. Adherence was monitored objectively with electronic monitors that recorded the date and time when the medication containers were opened (medication event monitoring system caps). Adherence was rated as a percentage of days the medication container was opened; adherence could be greater than 100% if the container was opened more than once per day.</description>
