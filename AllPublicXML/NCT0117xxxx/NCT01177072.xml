      1. That the psychotherapeutic intervention - Components-Base Interventions (CBI) - is
           effective in reducing the severity of mental health symptoms experienced by torture
           survivors in Southern Iraq.

        2. That the psychotherapeutic intervention - Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) - is
           effective in reducing the severity of mental health symptoms experienced by torture
           survivors in Southern Iraq.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each intervention, participants will undergo 12 sessions (CBI or CPT) that are
      standardized by training and manual for community mental health workers (CHMWs). CMHWs will
      be trained in only one intervention. Prior to the starting sessions, a baseline assessment of
      depression, anxiety and trauma symptoms and function will be carried out. A follow up
      assessment will be carried out after the 12 sessions have been completed. Expected time
      between sessions is one week. The total time per client is expected to last about 4-5 months
      to complete the 12 therapy sessions.

      Participants will be randomized (within CMHW) to either immediate intervention or wait-list
      control. Participants that are wait-list control will be contacted monthly for assessment of
      condition. Any participant (intervention or control) with suicidal thoughts or distress that
      does not abate will be referred for psychiatric care.
