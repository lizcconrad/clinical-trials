    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the 5 year locoregional control rate after
      External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) in the patient with locally advanced differentiated thyroid
      cancer. In a prior retrospective trial for this same group of patients, the 5 year
      locoregional control rate was 85% in EBRT group and 70% in no EBRT group. For the total
      number of patients to detect a minimum of 20% improvement in 5 year locoregional control rate
      with 80% of statistical power and the 5% significance level, the table for sample size
      planning given by Makuch and Simon was chosen. Forty-three patients are required for this
      regimen to regard as worthy of further investigation. Considering 15% follow up loss, 50
      eligible patients will be enrolled.

      The standard approaches to the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer include surgical
      resection, radioactive iodine treatment, and thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression. The
      role of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), however, remains controversial.

      The purpose of this phase II study is to evaluate the impact of EBRT on the locoregional
      control in locoregionally advanced or recurrent differentiated thyroid cancer patients.

    <description>Definition of target volume:
Gross tumor volume (GTV) = gross tumor defined with intravenous bolus contrast administration given CT scan
Clinical target volume (CTV) = GTV + included volumes of clinical and suspected subclinical involvement (draining lymph nodes)
Planning target volume (PTV) = CTV + 5-10 mm of lateral, craniocaudal, and anteroposterior margins.
Radiation dose and planning :
Total dose 65 Gy for gross tumor, 62.4 Gy for microscopic involved area, 58.5 Gy for high risk lymph node area and 52 Gy for elective lymph node area in 26 fractions during 6 weeks
Dose prescription: 90% isodose volume of prescribed dose encompassed PTV
The dose-volume histogram (DVH) of targets, such as GTV, CTV, and PTV, and the normal tissues, such as the esophagus, lung, contralateral normal thyroid, arytenoids, vocal cord and spinal cord, etc., was calculated.</description>
