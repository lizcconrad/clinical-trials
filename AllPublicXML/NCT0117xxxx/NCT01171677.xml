  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addiction to illicit and prescribed drugs, alcohol and tobacco is associated with a panoply
      of brain changes that contribute to structural and micro-structural deficits, altered
      metabolism and neurotransmission, and related cognitive deficits affecting executive
      function, decision-making, reward salience and motivation. Many of these deficits may act as
      barriers to recovery, compromising the same spectrum of cognitive processes that established
      interventions (motivational enhancement, cognitive behavioral therapy, therapeutic
      communities, etc.) depend on for successful outcomes. Even where there are medications that
      target a specific addiction (e.g., methadone for opiates), meaningful, sustained recovery
      relies on the acquisition of adaptive skills and strategies. As such, there is a need to
      develop interventions for substance use disorders that have the potential to improve health
      and cognitive and psychosocial functioning, and to be embraced by the treatment community. A
      growing body of basic and clinical research suggests that physical exercise may reduce drug
      use and improve cognitive-executive function, mood, and motivation. There is also a growing
      literature on the effectiveness of positive affirmation as a cognitive-behavioral
      intervention for depression and PTSD both of which frequently co-occur with addiction.
      Building on this, we hypothesize that a combined exercise and affirmation intervention
      (IntenSati) will lead to improved cognitive and psychosocial function. To test this, we
      propose to conduct a two-arm randomized clinical trial - in adult volunteers with a history
      of longstanding substance use and who are in treatment in a residential therapeutic community
      setting (Odyssey House) - to examine cognitive and psychosocial function before, during, and
      after randomization to either a twelve-week IntenSati intervention condition or to a
      twelve-week no-exercise/no-affirmations control condition. This is a pilot study intended to
      collect data on feasibility and effect size. The population and sample size were selected on
      the basis of likelihood to benefit from the intervention, likelihood for good adherence, and
      the realities of completing a low-cost pilot study within a one-year timeframe. Overall there
      were no substantial differences between IntenSati and TAU on measures of cognition, mood, and
      psychosocial functioning. Limitations include the small sample size, limited exercise
      intensity and capacity, missed exercise classes, dropout because of placement, work schedules
      and non-study-related medical conditions.

    <description>IntenSati (a blending of the words &quot;intention&quot; and &quot;sati,&quot; the Pali term for &quot;mindfulness&quot;) combines simple yet vigorous physical movements taken from yoga, martial arts, kickboxing and dance with spoken positive affirmation (e.g. &quot;I believe I will succeed&quot;, &quot;I am strong&quot; and &quot;I am confident&quot;) that are recited simultaneously with the execution of the movements. Indeed, one of the most common reports of IntenSati practitioners is the power of the spoken affirmations to &quot;stick in your head&quot; long after the workout is complete. The literature suggests that both the kind of high level aerobic exercise provided by IntenSati as well as the positive affirmations may have measurable beneficial effects on cognitive function, mood, self efficacy and self esteem.</description>

          <description>Odyssey House delivers a rich array of services which are typically embedded in Enhanced Therapeutic Community (ETC) settings. The ETC incorporates a highly structured, peer-driven social learning model supported by professional medical, psychiatric, vocational and educational services. Clients create a self-directed treatment plan with definable goals and outcomes and participate in structured group and individual counseling sessions with trained professional staff while living onsite for a period of six to twelve months. Clients attend onsite educational classes and/or participate in onsite job training through job-related tasks and functions within the facility. Regular seminars are conducted to teach life skills, including parenting, anger management, and relapse prevention with the goal of eventual successful reintegration into the community.</description>

          <description>IntenSati (a blending of the words &quot;intention&quot; and &quot;sati,&quot; the Pali term for &quot;mindfulness&quot;) combines simple yet vigorous physical movements taken from yoga, martial arts, kickboxing and dance with spoken positive affirmation (e.g. &quot;I believe I will succeed&quot;, &quot;I am strong&quot; and &quot;I am confident&quot;) that are recited simultaneously with the execution of the movements. Indeed, one of the most common reports of IntenSati practitioners is the power of the spoken affirmations to &quot;stick in your head&quot; long after the workout is complete. The literature suggests that both the kind of high level aerobic exercise provided by IntenSati as well as the positive affirmations may have measurable beneficial effects on cognitive function, mood, self efficacy and self esteem.</description>

        <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) assesses Verbal learning and memory, immediate recall, delayed recall, and delayed recognition. The HVLT is comprised of three subscales: HVLT Total Recall, HVLT Delayed Recall, and HVLT Delayed Recognition. HVLT Total Recall is the sum of 3 trials in which twelve words are read to and repeated back by subject. The HVLT Total Recall scale ranges from 0-36, the higher score associated with greater verbal learning.</description>

        <description>Stroop Color Word Test assesses cognitive flexibility, resistance to interference from outside stimuli, creativity, psychopathology and cognitive complexity. The Stroop consists of three subscales: Word, Color, and Color-Word. The Stroop Word test is the first subscale administered. The raw score is determined by the number of correct responses within a 90-second period. The scale ranges from 0-100, the higher score the greater the cognitive flexibility.</description>

            <description>IntenSati (a blending of the words &quot;intention&quot; and &quot;sati,&quot; the Pali term for &quot;mindfulness&quot;) combines simple yet vigorous physical movements taken from yoga, martial arts, kickboxing and dance with spoken positive affirmation (e.g. &quot;I believe I will succeed&quot;, &quot;I am strong&quot; and &quot;I am confident&quot;) that are recited simultaneously with the execution of the movements. Indeed, one of the most common reports of IntenSati practitioners is the power of the spoken affirmations to &quot;stick in your head&quot; long after the workout is complete. The literature suggests that both the kind of high level aerobic exercise provided by IntenSati as well as the positive affirmations may have measurable beneficial effects on cognitive function, mood, self efficacy and self esteem.</description>

            <description>IntenSati (a blending of the words &quot;intention&quot; and &quot;sati,&quot; the Pali term for &quot;mindfulness&quot;) combines simple yet vigorous physical movements taken from yoga, martial arts, kickboxing and dance with spoken positive affirmation (e.g. &quot;I believe I will succeed&quot;, &quot;I am strong&quot; and &quot;I am confident&quot;) that are recited simultaneously with the execution of the movements. Indeed, one of the most common reports of IntenSati practitioners is the power of the spoken affirmations to &quot;stick in your head&quot; long after the workout is complete. The literature suggests that both the kind of high level aerobic exercise provided by IntenSati as well as the positive affirmations may have measurable beneficial effects on cognitive function, mood, self efficacy and self esteem.</description>

          <title>Trailmaking Test B</title>
          <description>Trailmaking Test A and B measures cognitive shifting, visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, mental flexibility, as well as executive functioning. The test generally requires ability to sequence (Parts A and B), ability to shift cognitive set (Part B), and processing speed (Parts A and B). Part A and Part B are scored separately and expressed in terms of the number of seconds it takes the participant to complete each section, the higher the score the longer it took the subject to complete the test. Trailmaking Part B examines executive functioning and ability to shift cognitive set. The lower the score the faster the ability to shift cognitive set.</description>

The scale is comprised of four subscales: negative affect, social/positive, physical and other concerns, and withdrawal and urges. Overall abstinence self-efficacy score is calculated by summing each item. The scale ranges from 10-50, the higher the score the higher the self-efficacy for abstinence.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life (QoL)</title>
        <description>The Quality of Life (QoL) assessment is adapted from Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q). The 23-item QoL consists of five subscales: physical health/activities, feelings, leisure time activities, social relations, and general activities. The scale ranges from 23-115; the higher score indicates higher quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction.</description>

            <description>IntenSati (a blending of the words &quot;intention&quot; and &quot;sati,&quot; the Pali term for &quot;mindfulness&quot;) combines simple yet vigorous physical movements taken from yoga, martial arts, kickboxing and dance with spoken positive affirmation (e.g. &quot;I believe I will succeed&quot;, &quot;I am strong&quot; and &quot;I am confident&quot;) that are recited simultaneously with the execution of the movements. Indeed, one of the most common reports of IntenSati practitioners is the power of the spoken affirmations to &quot;stick in your head&quot; long after the workout is complete. The literature suggests that both the kind of high level aerobic exercise provided by IntenSati as well as the positive affirmations may have measurable beneficial effects on cognitive function, mood, self efficacy and self esteem.</description>
