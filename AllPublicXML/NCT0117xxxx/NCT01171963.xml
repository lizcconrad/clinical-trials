  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of GSK
      Biologicals' liquid human rotavirus vaccine in healthy Chinese infants 6 to 16 weeks of age.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects can receive routine childhood vaccination according to the expanded program of
      immunisation recommendations in China.

      There will be two treatment groups (liquid human rotavirus vaccine and placebo). The study
      will also have two immunogenicity subgroups comprising of few subjects from both the
      treatment groups. The immunogenicity subgroup 1 will assess the immunogenicity of the liquid
      human rotavirus vaccine and the immunogenicity subgroup 2 will assess the immunogenicity of
      liquid human rotavirus vaccine and also the immunogenicity of oral poliovirus vaccine and
      diphtheria tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine given concomitantly with liquid human
      rotavirus vaccine or placebo.

      This protocol posting has been updated following the Protocol Amendment 2, dated 05 August
      2011. The impacted section in the protocol posting is: Outcome Measures Section.

      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were assigned to 2 sub-cohorts (1:1 ratio). Sub-cohort 1 and Sub-cohort 2 subjects received their OPV and Infanrix™ EPI vaccination respectively independently of, and concomitantly with their Rotarix™/placebo vaccination. 3340 subjects were allocated study subject number allocated and 3333 vaccinated .</pre_assignment_details>

As part of the routine childhood vaccination according to the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) recommendations in China, subjects in this group also received 3 doses of Infanrix™ vaccine and 3 doses of the oral poliovirus vaccine manufactured by the Institute of Medical Biology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (OPV). The Infanrix™ and the OPV vaccines were administered independently of (Sub-cohort 1) or concomitantly with (Sub-cohort 2) the Rotarix™ vaccine. When administered concomitantly, subjects received the 3 doses of Infanrix™ vaccine at Months 1, 2 and 3, and the 3 doses of the OPV vaccine at Day 0, Month 1 and Month 2. The Rotarix™ and OPV vaccines were administered orally; the Infanrix™ vaccine was administered intramuscularly in the left anterolateral thigh.</description>

A seronegative subject was defined as a subject with anti-RV IgA antibody concentration lower than (&lt;) 20 U/mL.</description>
        <time_frame>At Month 2 and at 12 months of age</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity Sub-cohort 1, which included subjects vaccinated with at least 1 dose of HRV vaccine/Placebo, complying with protocol, with EPI childhood vaccinations completed according to Chinese recommendations and available immunogenicity data at post sampling time-point.</population>

The Infanrix™ and the OPV vaccines were administered independently of (Sub-cohort 1) or concomitantly with (Sub-cohort 2) the Rotarix™ vaccine. When administered concomitantly, subjects received the 3 doses of Infanrix™ vaccine at Months 1, 2 and 3, and the 3 doses of the OPV vaccine at Day 0, Month 1 and Month 2.

        <description>Antibody assessment was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Concentrations were expressed as geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) in ELISA units per milliliter (EL.U/mL). The cut-off of the assay was the seropositivity cut-off (≥ 5 EL.U/mL) for all antibodies assessed (anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN). This outcome measure concerns solely subjects in Sub-cohort 2, who received the EPI vaccination concomitantly with study vaccination with the Rotarix™ vaccine/placebo.</description>

        <population>Analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity Sub-cohort 2, which included subjects with OPV and Infanrix™ vaccines co-administered with the study vaccine, complying with protocol, with EPI childhood vaccinations completed according to Chinese recommendations and available immunogenicity data at post sampling time-point.</population>

The Infanrix™ and the OPV vaccines were administered independently of (Sub-cohort 1) or concomitantly with (Sub-cohort 2) the Rotarix™ vaccine. When administered concomitantly, subjects received the 3 doses of Infanrix™ vaccine at Months 1, 2 and 3, and the 3 doses of the OPV vaccine at Day 0, Month 1 and Month 2. The Rotarix™ and OPV vaccines were administered orally; the Infanrix™ vaccine was administered intramuscularly in the left anterolateral thigh.</description>
