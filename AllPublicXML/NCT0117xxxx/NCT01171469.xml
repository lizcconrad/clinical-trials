  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center Phase I study to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with allogeneic brain tumor stem cells
      administered as a vaccination in children and adults with recurrent brain tumors. Once the
      MTD has been determined, we will conduct a phase II study to determine efficacy.

      Clinical trials that utilize DCs for immunotherapy have demonstrated significant survival
      benefit for patients who exhibit robust immune responses against tumor cells. Unfortunately,
      at the present time the majority of tumor patients are unable to mount an adequate immune
      response and thus succumb to their tumors. We postulate that the inability to generate an
      appropriate immune response in these patients is due to a lack of sufficient numbers of
      appropriate T cells due to an inadequate source of tumor antigens.

      Autologous DCs will be obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each
      patient by leukapheresis. An established BTSC line will be used as an allogeneic source of
      tumor antigen. Approximately 4 weeks will be required after the leukapheresis for vaccine
      production and the first vaccine administration.

      Each patient will receive an injection of DCs at his/her assigned dose once every 2 weeks
      during the first 8 weeks, followed by injections every 4 weeks for an additional 10
      vaccinations. Imiquimod will be applied to the vaccination site just prior to and 24 hours
      after each vaccine administration.

      This study will use an accelerated dose escalation design (1 subject per level) until dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) is encountered, after which a traditional phase I design (3 subjects
      per level) will be implemented. DLT is defined as grade 3 or greater treatment related
      toxicity. A total of 6 patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or, in
      the absence of DLT, at dose level 3.

    <description>Imiquimod (INN) is a prescription medication that acts as an immune response modifier. Imiquimod is marketed as 5% Aldara cream in 250 mg packets, providing a total dose of 12.5 mg per packet and sufficient to cover 20 square centimeters. The contents of ½ of a packet will be applied as a thin film to cover approximately 10 square centimeters of skin in the area of the planned vaccination.</description>
