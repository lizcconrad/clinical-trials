  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is a major public health problem. Current therapeutic
      options for this patient population remain limited. With all available treatments, only a
      sub-set of those patients who achieve an antidepressant response are likely to achieve
      treatment-induced remission. The need for antidepressant medication that can provide both
      rapid and long lasting relief of TRD symptoms is widely recognized. There is new evidence
      that drugs that block NMDA glutamate receptors (NMDA antagonists) are promising candidates
      for meeting this need. Existing studies in TRD have used only a low-dose, brief infusion of
      ketamine that would not be expected to re-sensitize the NMDA receptor; in agreement with this
      theory, these prior studies have found only temporary improvements of depression. Our key
      hypothesis is that a higher-dose, longer-term ketamine infusion, such as that used in chronic
      pain studies, would provide a more robust and lasting improvement from depression.

      Accordingly, we will be test whether a 100-hour ketamine infusion would be more effective
      than the standard 40-minute ketamine infusion currently used in other TRD studies. We will
      randomize subjects to one of 2 arms: (1) 100-hour (+/- 4 hours) ketamine infusion plus
      clonidine for the entire infusion (2) 40-minute ketamine infusion (plus clonidine) following
      a 100+/- hour saline infusion. All subjects will receive clonidine, an alpha-2 agonist, to
      minimize side effects of ketamine (namely, brief/mild psychotic and cognitive symptoms).

      A subset of 20 patients with TRD will receive a 100-hour (+/- 4-hours)ketamine infusion with
      head MRIs pre (2) and post (1) infusion. Little research has been done on the mechanism of
      ketamine's putative antidepressant action. There is now a consensus that, in early stages of
      the novel treatment development for depression, clinical studies should be paired with
      mechanistic studies (neuroimaging) to understand the underlying mechanism and validate this
      as a treatment target. Ketamine is thought to have an antidepressant effect by increasing
      synaptic connections and therefore increasing connectivity in critical cognitive/emotional
      circuits.

    <textblock>
      This experiment is a pilot study involving up to 20 healthy males or females between the ages
      of 18-65 to test whether a 100-hour ketamine infusion plus clonidine would be more effective,
      with longer lasting results, then the standard 40-minute ketamine infusion (plus clonidine).
      Each of the 2 arms, will be evaluated using a between subject, double-blind, randomized
      design. An additional subset of 20 non-randomized patients, separate from the original
      randomized clinical trial (RTC), will receive an MRI pre and post ketamine infusion.

        1. a. Controlled 100-hour IV ketamine infusion b. clonidine safener PO prior to infusion

        2. a. Controlled 40-minute IV ketamine infusion b. clonidine safener PO prior to infusion
           c. 100-hour(+/-)IV placebo (saline) infusion

        3. a. Controlled 100-hour IV ketamine infusion b. clonidine safener PO prior to infusion c.
           MRI pre and post ketamine infusion

      In both conditions and the neuroimaging subset, participants will be admitted to the
      Washington University School of Medicine Clinical Research Unit at Barnes-Jewish Hospital for
      approximately 108-hours (Monday morning-Friday evening). Pulse, blood pressure,
      pulse-oximetry, and an electrocardiogram strip will be routinely monitored. Serial labs and
      clinical/safety ratings will be done pre-, during, and post-infusion, with the last
      assessments being used to assure that subjects have returned to their &quot;baseline&quot; prior to
      discharge from the research unit. Participants will continue to see their primary
      psychiatrist throughout the study.
