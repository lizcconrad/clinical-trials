    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that QuickOpt optimization can be as an
      alternative method for CRTP/D patients' optimization in clinical practice through the
      comparison of the improvement differences between the CRTP/D patients with different
      optimization at 12 months after implantation.The hypothesis is that the Heart Remolding
      parameter (LVESV) improvement of patients using QuickOpt parameters at 12 months after
      implant is not inferior (10%) to the patients by Echo optimization。

      Clinical studies have demonstrated that the AVTI from QuickOptTM related significantly to the
      max aorta VTI (AVTI) by Echo, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was so high from
      0.96 to 0.99.

      But up to now, there are no clinical trials to evaluate mid-long term clinical outcome for
      CRTP/D patients by QuickOptTM and Echo optimization, this is indeed the main purpose of the
      study; in addition, the clinical impact, the status of arrhythmia and agents of all the
      enrolled patients, will be evaluated at 1 year after implant.
