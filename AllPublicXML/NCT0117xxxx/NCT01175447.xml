      Elderly patients with esophageal cancer will receive thoracic radiation therapy 54Gy over 30
      fractions, and concurrent with s-1 on days 1-14 and 29-42 at the following dosages: 60, 70,
      and 80 mg/m(2)/day.

      Purpose:evaluated the dose-limiting toxicity and recommended dose of S-1 for a future phase
      II study when administered concurrently with thoracic radiation in elderly patients (&gt;70
      years old) with esophageal Cancer.

      Methods:S-1 was administered on days 1-14 and 29-42 at the following dosages: 60, 70, and
      80mg/m(2)/day. Thoracic radiation therapy was administered in 1.8Gy fractions five times
      weekly to a total dose of 54 Gy.
