  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Manipulation of object is a multisensory experience that includes tactile motion between the
      object and the fingerpad, visual motion elicited by the motion the object and the movement of
      the hand, and the active motor commend to control upper limb and hand conformation. It
      remains to be determined how such a complex interaction between touch and vision could be
      achieved effortlessly. In the present study, we will investigate how the motion information
      is transformed between touch and vision using the most novel approaches in human
      psychophysics, neuropsychology and monkey neurophysiology. Specifically, we will present
      tactile motion on primate fingerpads using a recently developed ball stimulator with a design
      in which we vary the direction of motion with respect to the skin surface and also vary the
      hand conformation and position. This setup allows us to systematically sample the possible
      scenarios involving coordinate transformation between the somatosensory and visual systems in
      conditions that could occur in hand exploration and object manipulation in daily life. We
      will present these tactile stimuli on normal human subject as well as stroke patients such as
      patients with spatial hemineglect. Finally, we will record from macaque monkeys in cortical
      areas that are thought to underlie the transformation of coordinates, such as the primary
      somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex. The results of the present study will
      contribute to the understanding of multisensory integration and the rehabilitation for
      patients with impaired use of spatial information.

    <description>Detail description for time frame of assessment:
(1) for stroke patients, the assessment will be performed &quot;in average&quot; 6 months after the onset of stroke (2) for normal subjects: assessment will be done when the subject is willing to participate (3) the subject might come to the lab more than once if the experiment can not be completed in one session
Assessment:
We present tactile motion using tactile stimulators to (1)different digits (2)different hand conformations and (3) different hand positions relative to the trunk</description>

        We will recruit 40 normal healthy adult subjects (equal to and more than 18 years old); the
        exclusion criteria are subjects with brain pathology, peripheral neuropathy and limb
        amputation. We will also recruit 50 stroke patients, the including criteria are stroke
        patients with stable medical condition and being capable of receiving the evaluations. In
        this group, stroke patients with peripheral neuropathy, and unstable medical condition.
