  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is an opportunistic infection that primarily affects
      recipients of solid organ transplants (SOTs) and patients with chemotherapy- induced
      neutropenia.Although both of these populations are at high risk for IPA, they differ with
      regards to the specific defects in host defense mechanisms that increase their risk for IPA.
      Chemotherapy- induced neutropenia is the principal defect affecting patients with hematologic
      malignancies, whereas transplant recipients tend to have dysfunctional T cells and
      phagocytes, as a result of immunosuppressive drug therapy. Thus, the patterns of IPA-related
      infection and inflammation may differ according to the type of underlying immune defect.
      Although the clinical and radiological features of IPA in patients with neutropenia have been
      extensively studied, little is known about the characteristics of IPA in SOT recipients. The
      investigators therefore compared the IPA- related clinical and radiological findings in SOT
      recipients with those of neutropenic patients.
