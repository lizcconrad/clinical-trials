  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to test the effect of Licorice Root Extract- Licogen on
      postmenopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. Specifically, the study will also test the
      effect of the licorice extract on vaginal dryness.

    <textblock>
      The estrogenic properties of glabridin, the major isoflavan in licorice root, were tested in
      view of the resemblance of its structure and lipophilicity to those of estradiol. The results
      indicate that glabridin is a phytoestrogen, binding to the human estrogen receptor and
      stimulating creatine kinase activity in rat uterus, epiphyseal cartilage, diaphyseal bone,
      aorta, and left ventricle of the heart. The stimulatory effects of 2.5-25 mg/animal glabridin
      were similar to those of 5 mg/animal estradiol. Chemical modification of glabridin showed
      that the position of the hydroxyl groups has a significant role in binding to the human
      estrogen receptor and in proliferation-inducing activity. Glabridin was found to be three to
      four times more active than 2*-O-methylglabridin and 4*-O-methylglabridin, and both
      derivatives were more active than 2*,4*- O-methylglabridin. The effect of increasing
      concentrations of glabridin on the growth of breast tumor cells was biphasic. Glabridin
      showed an estrogen receptor-dependent, growth-promoting effect at low concentrations (10
      nM-10 mM) and estrogen receptor-independent antiproliferative activity at concentrations of
      &gt;15 mM. This is the first study to indicate that isoflavans have estrogen-like activities.
      Glabridin and its derivatives exhibited varying degrees of estrogen receptor agonism in
      different tests and demonstrated growth-inhibitory actions on breast cancer cells.
