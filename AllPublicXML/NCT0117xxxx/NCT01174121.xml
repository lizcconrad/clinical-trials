  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood
      cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving
      the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL
      and we have given this type of treatment to over 200 patients with melanoma. Researchers want
      to know if TIL shrink s tumors in people with digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or
      ovarian/endometrial cancers. In this study, we are selecting a specific subset of white blood
      cells from the tumor that we think are the most effective in fighting tumors and will use
      only these cells in making the tumor fighting cells.

      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to see if these specifically selected tumor fighting cells can
      cause digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or ovarian/endometrial tumors to shrink and to see
      if this treatment is safe.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 18-70 with metastatic digestive tract, urothelial, breast, or
      ovarian/endometrial cancer who have a tumor that can be safely removed.

      Design:

      Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and undergo
      a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed.

      Surgery: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo surgery
      to remove a tumor that can be used to grow the TIL product.

      Leukapheresis: Patients may undergo leukapheresis to obtain additional white blood cells.
      {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells from the
      patient.}

      Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the
      conditioning chemotherapy, the TIL cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for
      about 4 weeks for the treatment.

      Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects,
      lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1
      year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits will take up to 2 days.

      Background:

        -  Metastatic digestive tract cancers, in particular esophageal, gastric, pancreatic and
           hepatobiliary carcinomas, are associated with poor survival beyond five years and poor
           response to existing therapies.

        -  Data from the Surgery Branch and from the literature support that metastatic cancers are
           potentially immunogenic and that TIL can be grown and expanded from these tumors.

        -  In metastatic melanoma, TIL can mediate the regression of bulky disease at any site when
           administered to an autologous patient with high dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a
           nonmyeloablative but lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen.

        -  The recent young-TIL approach, in which TIL are minimally cultured in vitro, not
           selected for tumor recognition, before rapid expansion and infusion to metastatic
           melanoma patients, has lead to objective response rates comparable to previous trials
           relying on TIL screened for tumor recognition, with no added toxicities.

        -  In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD-1 antibody enhances the
           anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells.

        -  With the approval of amendment Z, we propose to investigate the feasibility, safety, and
           efficacy of TIL adoptive transfer therapy with the addition of pembrolizumab at the time
           of progressive disease as treatment in Arm 4, including a 7th cohort (glioblastoma).

      Objectives:

      -With Amendment Z, to determine the ability of autologous TIL infused after minimal in vitro
      culture in conjunction with high dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative
      lymphodepleting preparative regimen and then the addition of anti-PD-1 at time of progressive
      disease per RECIST criteria to mediate tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancers.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are 18 years of age or older must have:

        -  Metastatic digestive tract, urothelial, breast, ovarian/endometrial cancer, or
           glioblastoma refractory to standard chemotherapy, originating from the a) gastric,
           gastroesophageal junction, b) pancreas, liver or biliary tree, c) colon or rectum, d)
           bladder, e) breast, or f) ovarian/endometrial;

        -  Normal basic laboratory values.

      Patients may not have:

        -  Concurrent major medical illnesses

        -  Severe hepatic function impairment due to liver metastatic burden

        -  Unpalliated biliary or bowel occlusion, cholangitis, or digestive tract bleeding

        -  Any form of immunodeficiency

        -  Severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study

      Design:

        -  Patients will undergo resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for generation of autologous
           TIL cultures and autologous cancer cell lines, and for frozen tissue archive. Lymph
           nodes, ascites,peritoneal implants, and normal tissue adjacent to metastatic deposit
           will also be obtained when possible for ongoing and future research as described in
           03-C-0277.

        -  With the approval of amendment X, all patients on Arm 4 will receive a non-myeloablative
           lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by
           the infusion of autologous TIL and then begin high-dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg IV
           every 8 hours for up to 12 doses).

        -  Once patients meet progressive disease by RECIST criteria, Pembrolizumab will be
           administered within 4 weeks after PD for up to 8 doses..

        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated at the first follow-up evaluation
           following the last dose of study drug.

        -  Twenty-one patients will be initially enrolled in each group to assess toxicity and
           tumor responses. If two or more of the first 21 patients per groups shows a clinical
           response (PR or CR), accrual will continue to 41 patients, targeting a 20% goal for
           objective response.

        -  Up to 332 patients may be enrolled over 3-8 years.

             with the past 3 weeks, as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.

         13. Four weeks must have elapsed since any prior antibody therapies to allow antibody
             levels to decline.

         14. Subjects must be co-enrolled in protocol 03-C-0277.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities.)

          9. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
             this study.
