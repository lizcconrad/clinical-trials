      To compare the efficacy in terms of the pathological complete response rate (pCR) to

      Currently Herceptin has moved to Neoadjuvant treatment combined with chemotherapy. Paclitaxel
      and Carboplatin are two of the best partners with high pCR. The significant efficacy and good
      safety profile of Herceptin® combination with taxane as adjuvant treatment on EBC are
      accepted; 1 year of Herceptin as adjuvant treatment is one standard therapy. This study is
      one small Phase II trial to explore the efficacy and safety of QW and Q3W of PCH as
      Neoadjuvant treatment, we only plan 60 pts and the trend of the two curves is anticipated

    <description>Primary Endpoint is efficacy. To compare the efficacy in terms of the pathological complete response rate (pCR) to preoperative administration of qw or q3w Paclitaxel, Carboplatin and Trastuzumab (PCH). The primary efficacy variable is the rate of pathological complete response (pCR). Time to recurrence will be measured as the time from when the patient was randomized to the time the patient is first recorded as having disease recurrence or the date of death if the patient dies due to causes other than disease recurrence.</description>
