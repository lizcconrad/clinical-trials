  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      M0002, an orally active, selective non-peptidergic antagonist of the vasopressin V2 receptor
      inhibits vasopressin-induced water reabsorption from the kidney. Therefore the aquaretic
      effect of M0002 has a potential clinical benefit in the treatment of ascites and
      hyponatreamia in cirrhotic patients.

    <description>Started at 0.3 mg/day and increased every 3 days (to 1, 3 and 6 mg/day)
for hyponatraemic subjects: dose was increased until the evening serum level was between 132 mmol/l and 145 mmol/l;
for normonatraemic subjects the dose was increased until a 500 ml increase in the 24-h urine volume compared with Day-1 was reached.
Once the required response or max dose was achieved, subjects entered a maintenance phase where they remained on the same dose of M0002 or placebo until 15 days.</description>

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with any form of cirrhosis with ascites and who had at least 1 paracentesis
             of at least 4 liter in the last 6 months.

          2. Dose of diuretics of spironolactone and furosemide was to be stable for at least one
             week prior to the screening visit or subject was refractory to diuretics.

          3. Subjects had to have been on a salt restricted diet (&lt; 5.2 grams sodium/day, 90 mmol)
             during the screening period prior to the trial drug administration.

          4. Other treatment for the management of cirrhosis and ascites should be stable for at
             least 2 weeks prior to trial drug administration.

          5. Child-Pugh B and C liver cirrhosis score lower than 12.

          6. Subjects with hyponatraemia with sodium level between 120 and 132 mmol/l or
             normonatraemia with sodium level between 133 and 145 mmol/l measured at screening
             visit and day 1.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP)

          2. Functional transjugular intrahepatic portasystemic stent shunt (TIPS), peritoneovenous
             shunt

          3. Liver transplantation

          4. Budd-Chiari syndrome
