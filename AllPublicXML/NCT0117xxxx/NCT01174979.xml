    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study on patients suffering from
      inner ear diseases with tinnitus as a principal symptom.

      The study will investigate the transtympanic treatment with a 1,5 % caroverine solution.

      Each patient will undergo treatment for 2 cycles of 48 hours each.
