  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of G-CSF and bortezomib is safe
      and effective in blood cell mobilization.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to use VELCADE for two doses followed by G-CSF given for 4 doses as is
      standard for mobilization with G-CSF alone. The rationale for VELCADE prior to the G-CSF is
      because VELCADE causes thrombocytopenia, similar to how cyclophosphamide is given followed by
      G-CSF for stem cell mobilization. Usually a cycle of VELCADE for myeloma therapy consists of
      4 doses, but this may result in more significant drop in the platelet count. Low platelet
      counts may preclude adequate stem cell collection. The mobilization with VELCADE and GCSF
      will be approximately 3 -4 weeks after completion of the initial therapy for the primary
      disease.

      Patients meeting eligibility criteria and who give informed consent will be mobilized using
      bortezomib at 1.3mg/m2 on day -11 and day -8. Subsequently G-CSF will be administered
      subcutaneously from day -4 to day -1 as a once daily injection at the standard /established
      dose of 10mcg/kg. Stem cell collection will be done on day 0 per standard of care regimen and
      protocol with processing of 4 -5 blood volumes. Stem cell enumeration by flow cytometry will
      be done prior to the collection by flow cytometry. The number of CD 34 positive cells (stem
      cell phenotype) / kg obtained each day of collection will be noted. G-CSF will be continued
      daily until adequate numbers of stem cells are obtained for the performance of a single
      autologous transplant (&gt; 2.5 million CD 34 cells/kg of weight. Subsequently the data for
      engraftment of neutrophils and platelets will be monitored as is routine for all patients
      undergoing autologous transplant.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  Female subject is either post-menopausal for at least 1 year before the screening
             visit, or surgically sterilized or if they are of childbearing potential, agree to
             practice 2 effective methods of contraception from the time of signing the informed
             consent form through 30 days after the last dose of VELCADE, or agree to completely
             abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          -  Male subject, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status post vasectomy) must agree to
             1 of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
             treatment period and through a minimum of 30 days after the last dose of study drug,
             or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.
