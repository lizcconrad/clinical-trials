      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of erythrocyte-mediated
      delivery of dexamethasone in steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) presents a constant challenge.
      Corticosteroids are effective in the majority of patients, but benefits are offset by adverse
      events. For steroid-dependent patients therapeutic choices are limited to
      azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate and infliximab; however, 25% of more patients do
      not respond, become intolerant, or have contraindications (e.g. history of neoplasia) to
      these drugs.

      A novel method of corticosteroids delivery by loading dexamethasone 21-phosphate into red
      blood cells has been validated. Owing to their long life span in the circulation and the
      capability of their cellular membrane to be opened and resealed in appropriate conditions,
      erythrocytes are excellent drug carriers. An ideal drug to be encapsulated into erythrocytes
      is Dex 21-P, a biologically inactive compound which undergoes dephosphorylation by
      intra-erythrocyte enzymes releasing the active metabolite, dexamethasone, by simple passive
      diffusion through cell membranes. In a previous pilot study in a cohort of steroid-dependent
      patients with inactive inflammatory bowel disease, Dexamethasone 21-phosphate loaded into
      autologous erythrocytes allowed to complete withdrawal of systemic steroids, and the overall
      cumulative exposure to corticosteroids from Dex 21-P-encapsulated erythrocytes (about 5-10 mg
      per month) was far less than conventional corticosteroids, and this translated into a lower
      rate of steroid-related events.
