      The purpose of The Veteran Health Study (CSP #569) is to better understand the mental and
      physical health of veterans as they get older. We are inviting approximately 10,000 members
      of the Vietnam Era Twin (VET) Registry to participate. As veterans approach their
      mid-sixties, it is important to understand the impact of wartime deployment on health and
      mental health outcomes nearly 40 years later.

      The investigators will assess the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
      other mental and physical health conditions for Vietnam era veterans, and explore the
      relationship between PTSD and other conditions.

      CSP #569 involves 3 phases of data collection. In Phase I, VET Registry members are invited
      to complete a paper and pencil questionnaire including items on physical and mental health,
      disability, health behaviors, demographic information and use of health care services. After
      completing Phase I, VET Registry members are invited to Phase II which involves a telephone
      interview about mental health. In Phase III, some of those who participated in Phase I will
      be invited to a sub-study confirming self-reported heart disease and diabetes using a
      provider survey.

      Data collected for CSP #569 will be combined with existing VET Registry data. This will
      provide a rich picture of the health of Vietnam era veterans and the influence of PTSD on the
      lives of veterans.

    <description>The Vietnam Era Twin (VET) Registry is a closed cohort composed of 7,369 middle-aged male-male twin pairs both of whom served in the military during the time of the Vietnam conflict (1965-1975). The Registry is a United States Department of Veterans Affairs resource that was originally constructed from military records; the Registry has been in existence for more than 15 years. It is one of the largest national twin registries in the US and currently has subjects living in all 50 states. Initially formed to address questions about the long-term health effects of service in Vietnam the Registry has evolved into a resource for genetic epidemiological studies of mental and physical health conditions. Several waves of mail and telephone surveys have collected a wealth of health-related information on Registry twins. Other data collection efforts have focused on specific sets of twin pairs and conducted detailed clinical or laboratory testing.</description>
