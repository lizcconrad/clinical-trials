    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old and not
             older than 35 years old at the time of the pre-operative examination;

          -  Both eyes must have a BSCVA of 20/20 or better;

          -  Both eyes must have a manifest refractive error from -2.00 D to -6.00 D, a cylinder
             component up to -1.50 D, and a maximum manifest spherical equivalent of -6.00 D;

          -  Both eyes must have at least 0.2 microns RMS HOA

          -  Both eyes must have a minimum pupil size of at least 6.0mm in dim illumination on
             wavescan;

          -  Both eyes must demonstrate refractive stability confirmed by clinical records or
             previous glasses. Refractive stability shall be documented by a change of less than or
             equal to 0.50 diopter (sphere and cylinder) at an exam at least 12 months prior to the
             baseline examination. The astigmatic axis must also be within 15 degrees for eyes with
             cylinder greater than 0.50 D; and

          -  Subjects should be willing and capable of returning for follow-up examinations for the
             duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of systemic or ocular medications that may affect vision

          -  Subjects who use concurrent topical or systemic medications that may impair healing,
             including but not limited to: antimetabolites, isotretinoin (Accutane®) within 6
             months of treatment, and amiodarone hydrochloride (Cordarone®) within 12 months of
             treatment; NOTE: The use of topical or systemic corticosteroids, whether chronic or
             acute, is deemed to adversely affect healing and subjects using such medication are
             specifically excluded from eligibility.

          -  Subjects with a history of any of the following medical conditions, or any other
             condition that could affect wound healing: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune
             disease, immunodeficiency diseases, ocular herpes zoster or simplex, endocrine
             disorders (including, but not limited to unstable thyroid disorders and diabetes),
             lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis; NOTE: The presence of diabetes (either type 1 or 2),
             regardless of disease duration, severity or control, will specifically exclude
             subjects from eligibility.

          -  The subject must not have a history of prior intraocular or corneal surgery (including
             cataract extraction), active ophthalmic disease or abnormality (including, but not
             limited to, blepharitis, recurrent corneal erosion, dry eye syndrome,
             neovascularization &gt; 1mm from limbus), clinically significant lens opacity, clinical
             evidence of trauma (including scarring), or with evidence of glaucoma or propensity
             for narrow angle glaucoma in either eye; NOTE: This includes any subject with open
             angle glaucoma, regardless of medication regimen or control.

          -  Subjects who have Amblyopia or strabismus

          -  Subjects with known pathology that may affect visual acuity; particularly retinal
             changes that affect vision (macular degeneration, cystoid macular edema, proliferative
             diabetic retinopathy, etc.)

          -  Subjects with diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g. macular degeneration, or
             other retinal disorders) that are predicted to cause future acuity losses to a level
             of 20/30 or worse

          -  Subjects who may be expected to require retinal laser treatment or other surgical
             intervention

          -  Subjects with pupil abnormalities (non-reactive, tonic pupils, abnormally shaped
             pupils, or pupils that do not dilate at least 4.0 mm under mesopic/scotopic
             conditions)

          -  Contact lens usage within 6 months for PMMA contacts lenses, 1 month for gas permeable
             lenses or 1 week for extended-wear and daily-wear soft contact lenses

          -  Subject must not have any evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal
             videokeratography in either eye;

          -  Subjects with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the
             medications used in the post-operative course;

          -  Patients who cannot obtain a Wavescan capture; and

          -  patients seeking monovision.
