      The investigators are attempting to demonstrate a decrease in the frequency and severity of
      sedation-induced respiratory arrhythmias(central and obstructive apneas) with pharmacological
      pre-treatment in this pilot project and then eventually to understand the mechanisms behind
      this decrease. The efficacy and mechanisms of these treatments, while evaluated during sleep
      in Obstructed Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients, have not been systematically studied during
      sedation in either normal subjects or OSA patients. The agent to be assessed in this study in
      physostigmine versus placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most serious side effects of drugs administered for sedation is untoward
      respiratory events. The relative prevalence of such events is thought to be high, occurring
      in up to 41% of patients in some cohorts. Many specific drugs and combinations have been
      recommended for moderate sedation, particularly when provided by a non-anesthesiologist. The
      use of an opioid and a benzodiazepine is the most frequent combination, partly because the
      availability of antagonists for both drugs may make a &quot;rescue&quot; easier. However, this
      combination results in frequent respiratory arrhythmias (combinations of obstructions, pauses
      and changes in respiratory patterns).There has not been a comprehensive study of the
      mechanisms underlying the disruptions of respiratory rhythm caused by agents commonly used
      for moderate sedation. This specific research, and the line of research it opens, has the
      potential to make the administration of anxiolytics and analgesics safer for patients at high
      risk for respiratory events.

    <description>Physostigmine is a centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that has been proposed as a treatment for sleep disordered breathing. It is currently FDA approved and used commonly by Anesthesiologists in the post anesthetic setting to reverse confusion caused by central anticholinergic medication effects.</description>

          <description>Each subject received the sedation protocol as described below:
Midazolam : The sedation will be initated with a midazolam infusion with an effect-site target of 100 mg/ml intraventously Remifentanil : 0.3 mg/ml intravenously continuously Then, subjects were randomized to the specific order of each four arms. Physostigmine (PS) vs. Placebo were randomized by DAYS. Then, on each day, subjects were randomized to receive oxygen or room air first or second. But each subject went through BOTH days and both oxygen and room air on each day.
There were eight total possible sequences.</description>

            <description>Physostigmine (PS), a centrally-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is most commonly used by anesthesiologists in the post-anesthetic setting to reverse confusion caused by central anticholinergic medication effects. It has also been proposed as a treatment for sleep disordered breathing.We investigated whether PS was effective in decreasing the frequency of ventilatory arrhythmias (VA) produced during moderate sedation with midazolam and remifentanil in both room air (RA) and 2 l/m nasal O2. Midazolam : The sedation will be initated with a midazolam infusion with an effect-site target of 100 mg/ml intraventously Remifentanil : 0.3 mg/ml intravenously continuously Capsaicin : 0.075% topical cream application Subjects were breathing oxygen via nasal cannula at 2 liters/minute</description>

Mild disordered breathing would correspond to a value of 5 to 10 events per hours; moderate 10-25; severe would be over 25</description>

          <description>We are attempting to demonstrate a decrease in the frequency and severity of sedation-induced respiratory arrhythmias (central and obstructive apneas) with pharmacological pre-treatment in this pilot project and then eventually to understand the mechanisms behind this decrease. The efficacy and mechanisms of these treatments, while evaluated during sleep in OSA patients, have not been systematically studied during sedation in either normal subjects or OSA patients. The agent to be assessed in this study is physostigmine versus placebo.</description>
