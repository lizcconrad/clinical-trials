      A national priority for health care providers is to initiate early communication about
      palliative and end-of-life care (PC/EOL) for children with a poor prognosis. Communication
      about prognosis and advanced care planning is critical to empowering parents to make
      decisions about PC/EOL for their children. A single-group study to refine and pilot test a
      PC/EOL communication intervention is entitled, Communication Plan: Early through End of Life
      (COMPLETE). COMPLETE is designed to be delivered during parent meetings and features: (a) a
      physician-nurse (MD/RN) team approach to PC/EOL communication; (b) printed visual aids and
      parent resource forms; and (c) hope and non-abandonment messages tailored by a MD/RN team to
      their communication style and parental preferences for information. During Phase I, an
      interdisciplinary approach involving nurses, physicians, PC/EOL expert consultants, and
      bereaved-parent consultants met to develop a standardized protocol and training procedures.
      During Phase II, this protocol will be evaluated with 24 parents and MD/RN teams. The
      investigators will evaluate parental outcomes regarding the COMPLETE's influence on: (a)
      information needs, emotional needs/resources, appraisal of MD/RN information and of symptom
      management; and (b) parental distress, uncertainty, decision regret, hope, satisfaction with
      MD/RN communication, and advance care planning over time. Findings from this study address
      NIH priorities related to: 1) an underserved population (i.e., parents of children with brain
      tumors); 2) an under-examined ethical concern about early integration of PC/EOL communication
      for parents of children with poor prognosis; 3) improved communication about PC/EOL among
      physicians, nurses, and parents; and 4) the potential for changing health care practice.

      Physicians and nurses (MDs/ RNs) struggle to communicate effectively about palliative and
      end-of-life (PC/EOL) care with parents when their child's prognosis is poor, and rarely
      collaborate as a team in this difficult process. The aim of this study was to develop and
      evaluate training strategies for MD/RN dyads to collaboratively deliver a PC/EOL
      communication intervention called, Communication Plan: Early through End of Life (COMPLETE),
      to 24 parents of children with brain tumors. During Phase I, training strategies were based
      on principles from a Relationship Centered Care perspective. The training was delivered to 3
      pediatric neuro-oncologists and 5 oncology nurses by a team of parent advisors and a team of
      expert consultants (i.e., medical ethics, communication, and PC/EOL). Our 2-day training
      included 4 modules: family assessment, goal directed treatment planning, anticipatory
      guidance, and staff communication and follow-up. Each module included: didactic content,
      small group reflective sessions, and communication skills practice with bereaved parent.
      Evaluations included dichotomous (agree/disagree) ratings and qualitative comments on
      didactic content, small group reflection, and skills practice for each module. Helpful
      aspects of our training strategies included: parent advisers' insights, emotional presence,
      emphasis on hope and non-abandonment messages, written materials to facilitate PC/EOL
      communication, and a team approach. For this presentation we will discuss insights gained
      regarding use of a parent advisory panel, strategies to help the MD/RN dyads feel comfortable
      working as a team to communicate with parents, and ways to improve training procedures and
      our intervention.

      Pediatric oncology physicians and nurses found PC/EOL care communication training strategies
      and content as helpful and useful. During Phase II of our study, our PC/EOL care
      communication intervention is planned to be implemented and evaluated with 24 enrolled
      parents. If effective, this intervention will facilitate integration of quality PC care
      practices into the care of children with brain tumors.

        The target sample size is 24 parents of 12 children diagnosed with a brain tumor. Our
        sample size is sufficient to complete descriptive analyses of Aims 2 and 3, and adequate
        precision for the estimation of effect sizes and preliminary tests of single-arm efficacy
        in Aim 4.1. This study is powered for adequate estimation of effect sizes, not for
        efficacy; that is, the study is powered to appropriately detect large effect sizes with
        lower power for medium effect sizes. If 10% or fewer participants withdraw after COMPLETE
        Session 1, we will be able to collect data from about 22 parents at least once. Twenty-two
        parents will provide 61% power for detecting a difference of 0.5 times standard deviation
        for a two-sided paired t-test with alpha of .05. The same test would have 70% power to
        detect a difference of .55 standard deviation. This approach is typical and justifiable in
        pilot feasibility studies to achieve 80% power for detecting only large effect sizes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligibility criteria include parents who are:

          -  18 years of age or older;

          -  the primary decision makers (i.e., single parent or couple-dyad) for their child
             (birth to 18 years of age);

          -  the biological parents, step-parents, or legal guardians (e.g., adoptive parent);

          -  single or married;

          -  informed that their child is diagnosed with a brain tumor with a poor prognosis as
             determined by the primary neuro-oncologist (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme, PNET, WHO
             grade 3/4 brain tumor, or metastatic medulloblastoma); [3, 33, 38, 41, 42, 175]

          -  able to read, speak, and understand English.

          -  Our rationale for these criteria is to include: (a) parents of children who are at
             high risk of not receiving timely PC/EOL and b) parents who are likely to be mature
             enough to make difficult decisions on their own. In addition, we recognize the
             importance of providing sensitive PC/EOL communication to all parents; however, it is
             beyond the scope of the R21 mechanism to develop scripts in other languages.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Parents will be excluded from the study if:

          -  the child's brain tumor has a good prognosis (e.g., a non-metastatic medulloblastoma);

          -  the child has been treated previously for another type of cancer;

          -  the parents have neurological and/or cognitive impairments, as reported by the site
             MD/RN team, preventing them from understanding the treatment options and completing
             the questionnaires;

          -  either parent in a decision-making couple (i.e., dyad) declines consent.
