      To assess the benefits of oesophageal stenting and external beam radiotherapy over
      oesophageal stenting alone in patients with inoperable oesophageal cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A majority of patients with oesophageal cancer present with inoperable disease and require
      rapid and long lasting palliation of dysphagia.

      STUDY AIM: To compare dysphagia relief in patients treated with oesophageal stenting and
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), versus oesophageal stenting alone and to assess overall
      survival, treatment related complications, and quality of life in the two groups.

      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with inoperable oesophageal cancer with high grade dysphagia
      to be randomised to receive oesophageal stenting alone (Group I), versus a combination of
      stenting followed by EBRT (Group II). Dysphagia relief, treatment related complications,
      overall survival, and quality of life to be assessed in the two groups.

Grade 1: Difficulty in swallowing solid food Grade 2: Difficulty in swallowing semisolid food Grade 3: Difficulty in swallowing liquids Grade 4: Difficulty in swallowing even saliva The dysphagia scores will be assessed 1 week after intervention (stenting and radiotherapy)in the two groups</description>
