    <textblock>
      This is an extension study that will allow patients to continue to receive study treatment
      when the original studies into which they were enrolled have reached their designated
      end-dates.

    <textblock>
      This is an open label extension protocol for patients who have been treated in previous ARQ
      197 studies that have reached their designated end-dates. Patients enrolled in this extension
      protocol will receive either ARQ 197 as monotherapy or in combination with other drug(s) at
      the same dose(s), and same schedule(s) in which they were originally enrolled.

      This extension study is designed to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of ARQ 197
      monotherapy or in combination with other drug(s) when given to patients who tolerated
      previous treatment well and may benefit from the continuing treatment. ARQ 197 will be
      administered twice daily, orally, with meals (regardless of the original protocol
      requirements).
