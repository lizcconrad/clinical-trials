    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop a measure of endogenous opioid tone that might serve as a
      biological marker for drive for palatable food. Using a 'naltrexone probe,' the investigators
      will assess whether individual response to one dose of an opioid receptor antagonist,
      naltrexone, is related to non-homeostatic eating in non-pregnant women.

      Hypothesis 1: Naltrexone Response will be related to non-homeostatic eating.

      Hypothesis 2: Response profiles to the 25 mg dose will be slightly less in magnitude than the
      50 mg dose. However, responses will be similarly related to non-homeostatic eating measures.

      Hypothesis 3: Response to naltrexone will be highly stable within individuals across time, in
      the absence of an intervention.

    <description>1) To examine criterion validity by testing whether level of opioid tone (based on response to naltrexone probe) is associated with self reported scores on non-homeostatic eating measures, behavioral and cognitive tasks assessing constructs related to addiction (eg, impulsivity) and ideal dosage (25 vs. 50 mg) in 60 obese women.</description>

    <description>3) To examine the reliability of home based measures. In other words, we will test whether cortisol and nausea responses taken in clinic, which are taken at highly controlled (accurate) times, are comparable to the responses from samples taken at home using saliva measures.</description>
