      The purpose of this study is:

        -  to identify how knowledge about keloid scars and self-treatments differs between
           patients who use the Internet as a source of information and patients who do not

        -  to determine if patients who are at a high risk of developing additional keloid scars
           are more or less likely to change their behavior based on an educational information
           talk about keloid scar prevention
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keloids scars differ from other scar types in that they grow beyond the borders of the injury
      that caused them. Patients with darker pigmented skin are more likely to develop keloids, and
      blacks are especially predisposed to keloid formation. Treatment options for keloids are
      limited in that new keloids often form at the treated location. The limited efficacy of
      professional treatment options and the harmless appearance of small keloid scars may lead a
      patient to try to manage their keloid scars on their own. One source of information that
      patients may turn to for self-treatment advice is the Internet.

    <measure>To Assess the Impact of an Educational Lecture on Knowledge About Keloid Scars by Comparing Mean Scores Between Knowledge Assessment Questionnaires Administered Before an Educational Lecture and Immediately After an Educational Lecture</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately before and after a 5 minute educational lecture</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects completed a written questionnaire to assess knowledge about keloid scars before an educational lecture about keloids, immediately after the educational lecture about keloids, and 3 months after the educational lecture about keloids. This written questionnaire to assess knowledge about keloid scars contained 19 questions related to risk factors for developing keloid scars, keloid scar prevention, and keloid scar treatment. A correct response to a question was awarded 1 point and all correct responses were summed to achieve a total score. Possible total score ranged from 0 to 19. A score of 0 is associated with worse knowledge about keloid scars and a score of 19 is associated with better knowledge about keloid scars.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Between August 2010 and June 2011, 40 subjects were recruited from patients seen for keloid scars at Northwestern University’s dermatology clinic in Chicago, Illinois, and from the general population by advertisements in a local newspaper and Internet classified ads.</recruitment_details>

          <title>Keloid Scar</title>
          <description>Subjects over the age of 18 with a clinical diagnosis of keloid scarring were included in the study. First, subjects completed a written questionnaire to collect demographic data, including personal history of keloid scarring, past and present use of keloid scar treatments, and internet access and use to find information related to keloid scars. Second, subjects completed a written questionnaire to assess knowledge about keloids. Next, subjects listened to a scripted, 5 minute educational lecture about keloid scars and then completed a written questionnaire to assess knowledge about keloids. Finally, subjects were contacted by phone 3 months later to complete a questionnaire to assess knowledge about keloids and to answer questions about keloid-related behaviors over the previous 3 months.</description>

        <title>To Assess the Impact of an Educational Lecture on Long-term Knowledge Retention About Keloid Scars by Comparing Mean Scores Between Knowledge Assessment Questionnaires Administered Before an Educational Lecture and 3 Months After an Educational Lecture</title>
        <description>All subjects completed a written questionnaire to assess knowledge about keloid scars before an educational lecture about keloids, immediately after the educational lecture about keloids, and 3 months after the educational lecture about keloids. This written questionnaire to assess knowledge about keloid scars contained 19 questions related to risk factors for developing keloid scars, keloid scar prevention, and keloid scar treatment. A correct response to a question was awarded 1 point and all correct responses were summed to achieve a total score. Possible total score ranged from 0 to 19. A score of 0 is associated with worse knowledge about keloid scars and a score of 19 is associated with better knowledge about keloid scars.</description>

            <description>Participants with keloid scars completed a written questionnaire to assess knowledge about keloid scars. Participants then listened to a scripted, 5 minute educational lecture about keloid scars. 3 months after the educational lecture, subjects completed an identical verbal questionnaire to assess knowledge about keloid scars.</description>
