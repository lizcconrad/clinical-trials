  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and activity of ARN-509 in men with
      advanced castration resistant prostate cancer. Patients will first be enrolled into Phase 1
      of the study to identify a tolerable dose for the Phase 2 portion of the study. In the Phase
      2, 3 different cohorts of patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety and activity of
      ARN-509.
