  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ureteral stents has become an indispensable instrument for urology practice as a result of
      widespread use of endourological interventions. Removal of stents could be sometimes
      neglected by patients or physicians. This omission may lead to legal and medical problems for
      urologists, health institutions and also for patients. In this study, the investigators offer
      a computer program providing two sided recall to prevent this nasty complication with sending
      automatic message by short message service (SMS) to both the patient and the urologist.

      In this study, first an institutional subscription agreement was signed between our
      university and a mobile phone cell company which is supporting SMS sending program. In the
      second step, by making software plug-in to our hospital's patient follow up program, two
      programs were integrated. According to this integration, after stent insertion, in case of
      entering the numerical code corresponding of ''ureteral stent application'' procedure during
      the stage of epicrisis preparation, the patient follow up system warns the official recording
      the epicrisis to enter the stent removal time. Patient follow up system transfers this
      information to SMS sending program. After several weeks of the procedure, if the stent needs
      to be removed, the software automatically sends a warning message to the patient and the
      physician. If the patients attends to urology department and undergoes stent removal, the
      official enters the code of &quot;endoscopic stent removal&quot; to the patient follow-up program. Then
      the program stops to send warning message.

      By the software plug-in to patient follow up program, SMS sending was made mandatory not to
      forget or skip none of the patients during the epicrisis writing procedure.

    <description>Primary Outcome Measure will be evaluated with;
Number of the patients who admitted for stent removal will be compared with the patients who did not admit. So the effectivity of the SMS sending proram will be evaluated.
The percentage of complication of forgotten ureteral stent will be calculated. And this rate will be compared with the previous rate of same department and the rates reported in the literature.
Patient satisfaction surveys
The time of the patients admitted. The data obtained from this study will be compared with previous data.</description>
