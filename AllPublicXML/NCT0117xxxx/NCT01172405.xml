  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on established therapeutic effect of ibuprofen in the treatment of headache attacks,
      and the action of caffeine in promoting better results when combined with treatments of first
      choice in the treatment of headache, this study is designed to:

        -  evaluate the efficacy of therapy with ibuprofen + caffeine in headache patients compared
           to ibuprofen alone;

        -  evaluate the tolerability of the association ibuprofen + caffeine compared to ibuprofen
           alone.

      The hypothesis is that the association is superior to treatment with ibuprofen alone in terms
      of efficacy, while maintaining good tolerability.

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of efficacy will be determined based on comparison of the intensity of headache before and after initiation of treatment, using the Functional Disabling Scale. The opinion of the investigator will be established based on the Likert scale and duration of symptoms after the treatment will be checked as a measure of comparison between treatments in the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability of study treatment compared with control to relieve headache symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability will be assessed by the investigator through the number of adverse events definitely related to study medication. This relationship will be defined by applying the Naranjo algorithm.</description>
