  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the Berlin questionnaire and STOP-BANG (snore,
      tired, obstruction, pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, neck, gender) as effective
      screening tools for Chinese subjects who are suspected to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep related breathing disorder associated with
      excessive daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular disease. It is prevalent in both western
      (4-26%) and eastern countries (4-19%). In recent studies, it has been estimated that at least
      70-80% of middle aged individuals with sleep apnea are undiagnosed and untreated. The
      prevalence of undiagnosed OSA subjects within the community suggests the need for a greater
      awareness and a high index of suspicion of this disease entity as well as its associated
      short- and long-term comorbidities.

      A reliable and easy-to-use screening questionnaire is required for efficient prediction of
      OSA and treatment arrangement. It would be helpful to prioritize patients who require sleep
      study according to the probability of suffering from sleep apnea. It reduces the use of sleep
      study for those with low probability of having OSA, but giving treatment to those who are
      with more severe OSA first. Meanwhile, it enhances the cost effective management of disease
      especially with limited resources in our society.
