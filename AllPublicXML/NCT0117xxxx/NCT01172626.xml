  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the side effects of
      valproate sodium in the treatment of epilepsy in Han Chinese and the genetic polymorphisms of
      drug metabolizing enzymes and pharmacokinetics of valproate sodium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Valproate sodium is a widely applied agent in the treatment of epilepsy. Although Valproate
      sodium is effective in clinic, it is able to induce several side effects, including weight
      gain, thinned hair, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, hepatotoxicity, hematotoxicity,
      thrill, etc. However, the remarkable variability of the reactions to the drug -- the
      incidence of side effect or the outcome of the treatment -- has been observed among patients.
      Valproate sodium is metabolized by some enzymes in the liver to transform it into several
      unreactive chemicals for excretion. Among them there are two toxic metabolites catalyzed by
      the specific metabolic enzymes. This study is designed to explore the genetic variation among
      individuals in the key processes of the deactivation and elimination of Valproate sodium in
      order to find out whether these genetic factors are associated to the side effects or
      efficacy. The further understanding into the factors concerning on the drug might imply
      possible solution to minimize the incidence of side effects in epileptic patients.
