      shrink or slow the growth of pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      (VEGFR), and its anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The
      investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and the maximum
      tolerable daily dose is 850 mg. The hypothesis of this clinical research study is to discover
      if the study drug apatinib can shrink or slow the growth of triple-negative breast cancer.
      The safety of apatinib will also be studied. Patients physical state, symptoms, changes in
      the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research
      team decide if apatinib is safe and effective in pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast
      cancer patients.

    <description>Apatinib was administratered at 750 mg/d in Phase IIa. The actual average dose intensity delivered was 525 mg/d due to toxicities. So, in Phase IIb, the starting dose of apatinib will be 500mg/d. Two dose reductions will be allowed to 375 and then 250 mg/d.</description>

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  Women diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer (breast cancer is estrogen receptor
             negative (ER-), progesterone receptor negative (PgR-) and human epidermal growth
             factor receptor negative (HER2-). HER2- is defined as 0 or 1+ staining on
             immunohistochemistry or FISH/CISH negative for gene amplification.

          -  Metastatic breast cancer, confirmed by histological analysis.

             regimens(including adjuvant and neo-adjuvant setting).

          -  Duration from the last therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, target therapy and
             operation) is more than 4 weeks (Duration for nitroso or mitomycin is 6 weeks).

          -  Have at least one extracranial measurable site of disease according to RECIST 1.1
             criteria that has not been previously irradiated. If the patient has had previous
             radiation to the marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of disease progression since
