      The aim of the study is to find for one or more serum or tissue markers of molecular biology
      in head and neck cancer patients used for early diagnosis, predicting prognosis and being
      sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy

    <textblock>
      Head and neck malignant tumors, especially nasopharyngeal carcinoma in southern China with
      the high incidence, its incidence, treatment, prognosis or tumor markers in serum has been a
      hot research with little progress.In our study, we collect NPC-based collection including the
      blood samples of laryngeal, hypopharyngeal cancer, separating serum and white blood cells
      stored in -80 degrees，while tissues are frozen in liquid nitrogen and embedded in paraffin。
      Patient treatment and prognosis are combined in order to find for markers of molecular
      biology used for early diagnosis, predicting prognosis and being sensitive to chemotherapy
      and radiotherapy.
