    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the antitumor activity and safety profile of
      cetuximab when given in combination with cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for the first-line
      treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Head and Neck (SCCHN) in
      Asian subjects.
