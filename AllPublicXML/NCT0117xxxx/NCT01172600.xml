  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural injection will be completed under fluoroscopy and all patients will receive 1-4 mg
      of Midazolam for relaxation before procedure and, if needed, 50-100 mcg of Fentanyl
      intravenous (IV). Radiopaque contrast (Omnipaque 300), for confirming the epidural position
      of the needle, steroids and local anesthetic agents will be used according to the physician
      performing the block and will not be controlled by the study. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive either inhaled Entonox along with the interventional block they are
      scheduled for or oxygen. They will be blinded about the treatment they are receiving. Those
      randomized to Entonox will inhale the gas through a mouthpiece throughout the procedure and
      also continue to receive it for a total of 4 hours in the recovery. Those randomized to the
      oxygen group will receive oxygen through a similar mouthpiece for the entire duration of the
      procedure and recovery for 4 hours. Following completion of procedure the patient will be
      transferred to recovery and monitored for 3-5 hours then discharged home with instructions.
      Possible side effects will be monitored and recorded, pain score of patient will be recorded
      before discharge. All the patients will receive standard instructions regarding physical back
      exercises. This will be repeated for every procedure up to maximum of three blocks.

      The patients will be followed during each block and over a period of 1, 3, 6 and 12 months
      and on each follow-up visit will complete computerized set of questionnaires as they did
      before the procedure. The patients charts will be then reviewed for one year after the
      initial procedure to determine if further epidural steroid injections or surgery for the
      presenting problem were required. It is anticipated that the appropriate number of patients
      will be enrolled within six months of study initiation.
