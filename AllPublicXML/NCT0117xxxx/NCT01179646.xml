      The objective of this study was to determine the single-dose bioequivalence of the test
      product, a potential generic 40 mg pantoprazole delayed-release tablet formulation, compared
      with the reference product, a pantoprazole 40 mg delayed-release tablet formulation
      (Protonix, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), following a single dose in the fasted state.

      The 90% CI for pantoprazole ln(Cmax), ln[AUC(0-t)], and ln[AUC(0-inf)] for the comparison of
      the test product (pantoprazole) versus the reference product (Protonix) should be within the
      80 to 125% range required for the conclusion of bioequivalence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non tobacco/nicotine-using (6 months minimum) healthy males and females between 19 and
             50 years of age.

          -  Body weight from 15% below or 15% above, inclusive, the ideal weight for height and
             estimated frame, as adapted from the 1983 Metropolitan Life Table.

          -  Female subjects were surgically sterile, at least two years postmenopausal, or if
             sexually active, had a partner who had been vasectomized for at least 6 months, or
             agreed to utilize one of the following forms of contraception: barrier (condom with
             spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide), IUD, or hormonal (oral, implant, transdermal
             patch, or injection) for the following specified times.

        Subjects using hormonal contraceptives were on a stable dose for 3 months prior to dosing,
        or they agreed to also use a barrier method of birth control from screening through
        completion of the study. Subjects having an intrauterine device (IUD) must have had the IUD
        in place for at least 2 months prior to dosing, or they agreed to also use a barrier method
        of birth control from screening through completion of the study. For other forms of birth
        control, the subject had used the method at least 2 weeks prior to screening and agreed to
        use the method through completion of the study.

          -  Voluntary consent to participate in this study as demonstrated by signing the informed
             consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             cardiovascular disease, or any other condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of the
             study results.

          -  History of hypersensitivity, allergic or adverse response to pantoprazole or related
             drugs.

             hepatitis C antibody screen.

          -  Participation in a previous clinical trial within 30 days prior to study initiation.

          -  Donation of one pint or more of whole blood within 56 days prior to study initiation.

          -  Donation of 2 units of red blood cells within 112 days prior to study initiation.

          -  Donation of plasma with 7 days prior to study initiation.

          -  Difficulty in swallowing medication or any gastrointestinal disease that could affect
             the drug absorption.

          -  Abnormal diet or substantial changes in eating habits within 30 days prior to study
             initiation. Examples included, but were not limited to, vegetarian, fasting, or liquid
             supplement, etc.

          -  Treatment with any known enzyme-altering agents (barbiturates, phenothiazines, or
             cimetidine, etc.) within 30 days prior to study initiation.

          -  Use of any prescription medication (except hormonal contraceptives for females) within
             14 days prior to study initiation.

          -  Use of any over-the-counter (OTC) medication, including mega-dose vitamins,
             analgesics, herbal/nutritional supplements, and antacids, within 7 days prior to study
             initiation.

          -  Positive urine screen for alcohol or drugs of abuse.

          -  Unwilling to eat the food as provided in the study menu.

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;12.0 g/dL.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse within 2 years prior to dosing.
