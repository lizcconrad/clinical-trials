      The purpose of the study is to determine if the medication, ranolazine (study drug), can help
      improve blood flow to your heart, increase your exercise capacity and improve your quality of
      life (QOL). For this study, you will be asked to perform several tests in order to determine
      if your heart function, exercise capacity, chest pain and QOL have improved after 3 months of
      treatment with ranolazine. Ranolazine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of angina.

    <textblock>
      This study is looking to enroll patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is abnormally
      high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart need
      to work harder than normal and is usually caused by a narrowing of the small arteries of the
      lung. This narrowing makes it harder for the right side of the heart to circulate the blood
      to the lungs. Over time, the right side of the heart may become enlarged and symptoms (such
      as angina [chest pain] shortness of breath, fatigue, edema) begin to appear.

      Ranolazine is a safe, well-tolerated, and FDA-approved medication for the treatment of
      chronic stable angina. Ranolazine may potentially improve blood flow to the right ventricle
      (RV), thereby relieving angina while simultaneously improving RV performance and
      contractility. This latter effect may increase stroke volume and cardiac output which could
      translate into benefits in exercise capacity and improved quality of life.

      The purpose of this single center, non-randomized, prospective pilot study is to investigate
      the effects of 3 months treatment with ranolazine on pulmonary artery hemodynamics, exercise
      capacity and quality of life in patients with PAH and symptoms of angina or angina
      equivalent.

    <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. The scores are averaged and transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status and was performed at the conclusion of the study.</description>

    <measure>RV Perfusion on Cardiac MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The majority of patients did not undergo cardiac MRI because it was difficult for the patients to tolerate the imaging study. Therefore, we were not able to assess change in RV perfusion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute RV Longitudinal Strain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in absolute right ventricular (RV) longitudinal strain as assessed by exercise stress echocardiography with speckle-tracking echocardiography at baseline and conclusion of the study. An increase in exercise-induced change in RV longitudinal strain between baseline to conclusion of the study is indicative of improved RV function. If absolute RV longitudinal strain increases with exercise, that is a sign that the RV is working well. If absolute RV longitudinal strain decreases with exercise, that is a sign that the RV is not working well. Therefore, between baseline and conclusion of the study, if exercise-induced change in RV strain increases that means that the RV is working better at the conclusion of the study.</description>

        <description>Change in absolute right ventricular (RV) longitudinal strain as assessed by exercise stress echocardiography with speckle-tracking echocardiography at baseline and conclusion of the study. An increase in exercise-induced change in RV longitudinal strain between baseline to conclusion of the study is indicative of improved RV function. If absolute RV longitudinal strain increases with exercise, that is a sign that the RV is working well. If absolute RV longitudinal strain decreases with exercise, that is a sign that the RV is not working well. Therefore, between baseline and conclusion of the study, if exercise-induced change in RV strain increases that means that the RV is working better at the conclusion of the study.</description>
