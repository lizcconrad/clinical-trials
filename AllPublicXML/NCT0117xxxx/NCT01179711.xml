    <textblock>
      In most clinics, physicians reduce diopter of hyperopic glasses in older patients with
      accommodative esotropia. However, there are risks of decompensation in that practice. The
      authors are going to try measure the change of stability of eye alignment after reducing
      diopter of hyperopic glasses.

      Inclusion criteria :

      patients with accommodative esotropia

      At initial visit(of study), the physician will reduce the diopter of hyperopic glasses as
      much as the patient can maintain their eye alignment (maximum amount 1.5D).

      Outcome measure :

      Follow-up examinations are scheduled at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after the
      patients begin wearing under-corrected spectacles. At every visit, symptoms such as
      asthenopia, diplopia, or blurred vision will be documented and ocular examinations, including
      visual acuity and ocular alignment status for distance and near will be performed. Tests of
      fusion and stereoacuity will be performed at the 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up
      visits.
