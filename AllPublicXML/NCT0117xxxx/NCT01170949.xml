    <textblock>
      Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of miltefosine on
      skin lesions in patients with treatment resistant chronic urticaria. Treatment resistance is
      defined by insufficient treatment response after a minimum of 1 week therapy with the maximum
      labelled dose of a non-sedating antihistamine. Eligible subjects will be enrolled at baseline
      8 (+/- 1) days after screening. 75 Patients will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to one of the
      following treatment groups as add-on to the ongoing therapy with a non-sedating antihistamine
      for treatment period of 4 weeks: 25 placebo and 50 active drug Efficacy and safety
      evaluations are done at baseline day 7, 14, 21 safety, only) and 28 (or end of treatment) and
      at day 56 (28 days after end of treatment).

    <description>The weekly UAS was calculated by adding the daily scores over one week. During the whole course of the study patients recorded the amount of wheals and the intensity of itching as well as the occurrence of swelling in ranges between 0 and 3. These daily scores were used to calculate urticaria activity scores (UAS) as follows: Daily UAS are calculated by adding the score points obtained for the symptom categories &quot;number of wheals&quot; and &quot;intensity of pruritus&quot;. &quot;Number of wheals&quot; is scored as 0 = no wheals, 1 = some wheals (&lt;20), 2 = moderate number of wheals (20-50), 3 = more than 50 wheals. &quot;Intensity of pruritus&quot; is scored as 0 = no itching; 1 = mild itching, not irritating; 2 = moderate itching, normal daily activity and sleep is possible; and 3 = severe itching, normal daily activity and sleep is impaired. The maximum score is 42.</description>

        <title>Urticaria Activity Score (% Change From Baseline)</title>
        <description>The weekly UAS was calculated by adding the daily scores over one week. During the whole course of the study patients recorded the amount of wheals and the intensity of itching as well as the occurrence of swelling in ranges between 0 and 3. These daily scores were used to calculate urticaria activity scores (UAS) as follows: Daily UAS are calculated by adding the score points obtained for the symptom categories “number of wheals” and “intensity of pruritus”. “Number of wheals” is scored as 0 = no wheals, 1 = some wheals (&lt;20), 2 = moderate number of wheals (20-50), 3 = more than 50 wheals. “Intensity of pruritus” is scored as 0 = no itching; 1 = mild itching, not irritating; 2 = moderate itching, normal daily activity and sleep is possible; and 3 = severe itching, normal daily activity and sleep is impaired. The maximum score is 42.</description>

          <title>Urticaria Activity Score (% Change From Baseline)</title>
          <description>The weekly UAS was calculated by adding the daily scores over one week. During the whole course of the study patients recorded the amount of wheals and the intensity of itching as well as the occurrence of swelling in ranges between 0 and 3. These daily scores were used to calculate urticaria activity scores (UAS) as follows: Daily UAS are calculated by adding the score points obtained for the symptom categories “number of wheals” and “intensity of pruritus”. “Number of wheals” is scored as 0 = no wheals, 1 = some wheals (&lt;20), 2 = moderate number of wheals (20-50), 3 = more than 50 wheals. “Intensity of pruritus” is scored as 0 = no itching; 1 = mild itching, not irritating; 2 = moderate itching, normal daily activity and sleep is possible; and 3 = severe itching, normal daily activity and sleep is impaired. The maximum score is 42.</description>
