  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional pulmonary rehabilitation programs improve exercise tolerance, peripheral muscle
      strength, and health related quality of live but not pulmonary function in patients with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The role of breathing retraining techniques in
      the rehabilitation of patients with COPD remains unclear. The hypothesis to be tested in this
      study is that pulmonary function, cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity, health related quality
      of life and cardiac autonomic modulation of patients with COPD who undergo pulmonary
      rehabilitation plus breathing retraining will be better than that of patients undergoing a
      conventional pulmonary rehabilitation.

      To address this uncertainty, we performed a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects
      of a 4-week rehabilitation program including breathing retraining on pulmonary function
      (PFT), cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity (CPET), health related quality of life (HRQL) and
      cardiac autonomic modulation (CAM).

      A randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of a conventional 4-week pulmonary
      rehabilitation program with those of a 4-week pulmonary rehabilitation program plus breathing
      retraining on pulmonary function (FEV1), cardiopulmonary exercise capacity (6-minute walking
      distance, 6MWD), health related quality of life (chronic respiratory questionnaire, CRQ) and
      cardiac autonomic function (rMSSD) was performed.

    <description>In order to train effortless diaphragmatic breathing techniques the biofeedback loop starts at the sensor that measures the patient's breathing rhythm at both umbilical and abdominal level. The sensor is connected to an amplifier that converts the electrical impulses into acoustical and visual outputs. Patients were encouraged to regulate their breathing patterns at a 10-20% slower respiration rate resulting in increased tidal volumes. Furthermore, the patients were encouraged to reduce dynamic hyperinflation by completing the expiration prior to the initiation of the next breath while using pursed-lips breathing. Patients were trained to breath as comfortable as possible with predominant abdominal expansion during the inhalation and smooth abdominal contraction during exhalation.</description>
