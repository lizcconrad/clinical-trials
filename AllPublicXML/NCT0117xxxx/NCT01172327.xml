  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness and safety of a self-directed
      physical activity program relative to a self-directed dietary program in adults with
      arthritis. A process evaluation will also be conducted to examine program reach,
      participation/dose, fidelity, and participant compatibility/satisfaction.

    <description>This arm is a self-directed, multicomponent, exercise intervention. Participants exercise on their own and follow a progressive stepped program that occurs in the following order: cardiorespiratory exercises, flexibility exercises, strength (upper and lower body) exercises, and balance exercises. Participants also complete a daily log of their exercises and return the logs every week for 12 weeks.</description>
