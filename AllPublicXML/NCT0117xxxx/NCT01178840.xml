      This is a comparative, open-label two-period crossover study of up to 505 couples comparing
      the PATH Woman's Condom to the FC2 female condom. California Family Health Council will
      enroll up to 505 couples to have 375 complete both periods. The study will provide data on
      functional performance, vaginal semen exposure, safety, and acceptability of the two female
      condoms.

      Both partners will be required to come to the clinic to be consented for the study. If both
      members of the couple meet all eligibility requirements, they will each sign an informed
      consent form and will be enrolled as a couple. The couples will be randomized to one of two
      female condom use sequences for the two periods (WC then FC2 or FC2 then WC). For the first
      period of 2-4 weeks, the couple will be asked to have sex once without a condom and 4 times
      using the first assigned female condom. For the second period of 2-4 weeks, the couple will
      be asked to have sex 4 times using the second assigned female condom. In the first period,
      the couple will have one act of unprotected sex for which they will collect pre- and
      post-coital vaginal swabs. The couple will also use 4 female condoms of the assigned type.
      They will be asked to collect pre- and post-coital vaginal swabs and a post-coital swab from
      the condom interior. The couple will complete a detailed Condom Use Questionnaire together
      after each condom use. An Acceptability Questionnaire will be completed separately by males
      and females at the end of each study period. Couples may have additional acts of sex during
      each period as they desire but will not have sex at least 48 hours prior to each study sex
      act. After a follow-up visit, the procedures will be repeated with 4 of the second assigned
      condom type but without the collection of vaginal swabs at unprotected intercourse. Each
      couple will be enrolled for about 2-3 months, depending on the intervals between sex acts.
      Clinicians evaluating product-relatedness of AEs will be blinded to the condom type used.
      Male partners will be requested to attend the final visit, and, if they experience adverse
      events, the followup and/or unscheduled visits.

      Purpose: To compare the performance of a new female condom (PATH Woman's Condom) with an
      FDA-approved female condom (FC2), as assessed by reported clinical failure and vaginal PSA

      Design: This is a comparative, open-label two-period crossover study of up to 505 couples
      comparing the PATH Woman's Condom to the FC2 female condom. We will enroll up to 505 couples
      at the California Family Health Council to have 375 complete both periods. The study will
      provide data on functional performance, vaginal semen exposure, safety, and acceptability of
      the two female condoms.

      Primary objective: To compare the performance of the PATH Woman's Condom (WC) to the FC2, as
      assessed by self-reported total clinical failure and its components (clinical breakage,
      slippage, misdirection, and invagination).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the ability of the WC and the FC2 to prevent vaginal exposure to semen, as
           indicated by detection of PSA within the vagina

        -  To calculate the sensitivity and specificity of reported failures using PSA as the gold
           standard for the presence of semen

        -  To compare acceptability of the WC and FC2

      Study Population: Healthy heterosexual couples at least 18 years of age and at low risk for
      pregnancy or STIs.

      Study Size: up to 505 couples divided between multiple recruitment locations under one
      center.

      Study Duration: Accrual will require approximately 14 months. Each couple will be expected to
      complete the study in 2-3 months. Therefore, the clinical portion of the study should be
      completed within approximately 17 months. Data preparation, analysis, and report writing are
      expected to require up to 7 months after completion of the clinical portion.

      Treatment Regimen: The couples will be randomized to one of two condom use sequences (WC then
      FC2 or FC2 then WC). Four condoms of each type will be used by couples over two 2-4 week
      periods. For first period, one set of pre- and post-coital vaginal swabs will be collected
      around unprotected intercourse. For each coital act where a condom is used in the period, pre
      and post-coital vaginal swabs and a post-coital condom swab will be collected. A Condom Use
      Questionnaire will be completed after each condom use. An Acceptability Questionnaire will be
      completed at the end of each period. After a follow-up visit, these procedures will be
      repeated with the second 4 condoms, without collection of vaginal swabs at unprotected
      intercourse.
