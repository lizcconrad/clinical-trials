  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In anesthetized patients the airway needs to be secured due to lack of protective reflexes.
      Golden standard is the endotracheal intubation. In patients undergoing lung surgery single
      lung ventilation is essential. In these cases a double lume tube is commonly used. The double
      lume tube has a proximal tracheal and a distal bronchial end reaching into the left or the
      right side of the lung dependant of the model of the tube. Thus it is possible to operate on
      one collapsed side of the lung while ventilating the other side.

      Due to length and stiffness resulting of the construction of the device more side effects
      than after intubation with a conventional single lumen tube is expected. Possible side
      effects may be bleeding, swelling, sore throat or croakiness.

      The EZ-Blocker is a new device promising to overcome these side effects. The EZ-Blocker is a
      device placing a balloon into one bronchus to be able to provide single lung ventilation like
      the double lume tube. However, the EZ-Blocker is a catheter pushed through a conventional
      single lume tube after intubation with a hook on one and a balloon on the other distal end.
      The hook prevents the device from being pushed too far to be able to harm the lung. Inside
      the EZ-Blocker is a small lumen able to deflate the lung which is blocked with the balloon.
      The device is easily positioned using a bronchoscope and when the anaesthesiologists
      confirmed the correct position of the device, the balloon can be inflated and deflated as
      needed.

      Due to the easier approach the investigators expect less side effects as mentioned earlier
      using the EZ-Blocker compared to the double lume tube. As well the stress caused by
      intubation may be reduced.
