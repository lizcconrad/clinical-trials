    <textblock>
      This single center, open label, randomized, two-period, two-sequence cross-over study is
      designed to evaluate the relative bioavailability of a treprostinil diethanolamine 1 mg
      tablet in reference to treprostinil diethanolamine 1 mg oral solution (administered as four
      0.25 mg doses every 2 hours for a 1 mg total dose) in twenty-four healthy volunteers. Other
      secondary outcomes of interest include assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters of
      treprostinil diethanolamine 1 mg tablets and a treprostinil diethanolamine 1 mg oral solution
      administered as four doses (0.25 mg every 2 hours for a 1 mg total dose) and evaluation of
      the safety and tolerability of each treatment regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is healthy between the ages of 18-55 years of age

          -  Female subjects must weigh between 55 and 100 kg, with a BMI between 19.0-29.9. kg/m2;
             inclusive at screening. Male subjects must weigh between 55 and 120 kg, with a BMI
             between 19.0-32.0 kg/m2; inclusive at screening.

          -  Subject has a medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG and clinical
             laboratory results within normal limits or considered not clinically significant by
             the Investigator at Screening.

          -  Female subjects with childbearing potential will practice abstinence or effective
             birth control methods from the time of providing written informed consent to the end
             of the study. Effective birth control is defined as an intrauterine device (IUD),

             contraceptives) for 14 days prior to starting study procedures and to abstain from
             taking any non-prescription medications (except multivitamins) or herbal supplements
             for 7 days prior to beginning study procedures until discharge from the study (unless

          -  Subject has a predisposing condition that could interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

          -  Subject has donated blood or plasma or has lost a significant volume of blood (greater
             than 450 mL) within four weeks prior to Period 1.
