  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aerobic training has been shown to favorably alter several of the known risk factors for
      coronary artery disease including hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and diabetes (1). It
      seems logical that if these risk factors were aggressively controlled in patients with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) by implementing lifestyle changes (e.g., diet and exercise
      training) to support the pharmacologic interventions that are necessary for the control of
      the disease, then the rate of progression of the disease may be altered. However, to date,
      there is no clear research evidence to support this hypothesis. Therefore the aims of the
      proposed study are:

        1. To test the hypothesis that lifestyle interventions (i.e., dietary modification and
           regular, long-term aerobic exercise training) will favorably alter the natural
           progression of CKD in a sample of patients compared to a control group who will receive
           the current standard care.

        2. To explore possible mechanisms that could contribute to the observed changes.
