  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the lung deposition and distribution pattern of
      Beclometasone and Formoterol using a gamma-scintigraphic technique after inhalation of a
      single dose of 99mTc-radiolabelled BDP/formoterol fixed combination administered Via the NEXT
      DPI in healthy volunteers, asthmatic and COPD patients. Additionally, the systemic exposures
      to formoterol, BDP and its monopropionate metabolite (B17MP) will be investigated.
