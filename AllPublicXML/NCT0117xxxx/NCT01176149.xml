    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the validity and feasibility of an educational
      approach involving nurses, combined with SMBG, aimed at lifestyle modification and timely
      changes in therapy, when needed.

    <description>Patients will receive specific educational interventions to teach them how to perform Self monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG), how to modify diet and level of physical activity according to blood glucose levels, and the actions to be undertaken in case of abnormal values (hypoglycemia, particularly elevated glucose levels). Patients will be instructed to modify their lifestyle habits (diet, physical activity) in order to reach specific goals (weight reduction, reduction in fat consumption intake, reduction in saturated fat intake, increase in fiber intake, regular physical activity.</description>
