  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no clear involvement of families/caregivers in the care for postpartum
      mothers that develop postpartum psychosis. The lack of knowledge on causes of postpartum
      psychosis may influence the nature of perceived social support that mothers receive from
      caregivers. It is hoped that the provision of a culturally adapted version of family
      psychoeducation will bridge the knowledge gap and provide the much needed information. We
      therefore hypothesized that the involvement of a family member of a postpartum mother with a
      psychotic illness in a weekly session of family psychoeducation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum psychosis causes distress to the mother, baby, spouse and other primary
      caregivers. This is especially true for Uganda where cultural beliefs for the causation of
      the illness place blame on supposedly the postpartum mother's promiscuity during pregnancy
      (COX, 1979). Cultural perceptions on the causes of postpartum psychosis may affect the nature
      of social support the mothers perceive from their families when they develop the illness.
      Other perceptions regarding postpartum psychosis in Uganda lay blame on supernatural causes
      like witchcraft.

      Family psychoeducation which sets out to inform families of the nature of the illness is
      called for so as to demystify the illness.
