    <textblock>
      The purpose is to investigate daptomycin pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients with
      suspected or verified bacteremia with Gram-positive cocci undergoing combined continuous
      hemodiafiltration at a filtration rate of 35ml/kg/h and to establish a dose recommendation
      for continuous hemodiafiltration at a filtrate rate of 35ml/kg/h.

    <measure>Determination of daptomycin plasmaconcentrations and pharmacokinetics in 15 patients with gram positive infection undergoing CRRT do determine adequate dosing.</measure>
    <time_frame>PK on days 1, 3, and 5</time_frame>
    <description>15 patients are devided in 3 cohorts of 5 patients each. PK data(measured on day 1, 3 and 5) of the first 5 patients receiving daptomycin 6mg/kg/day during 5 consecutive days additionally to standard antibiotic treatment are compared with PK data of daptomycin 6mg/kg/day in healthy volunteers and dose is adapted in the next 5 patients based on these results. The same is done for the last 5 patients.</description>
