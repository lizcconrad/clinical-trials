  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The face is arguably the most critical aesthetic unit of the body. As humans begin to age,
      numerous changes occur to the face. Changes include the formation of wrinkles, soft-tissue
      atrophy, gravitational descent resulting in sagging skin, loss of skin and muscle tone, and
      changes in bony architecture. These changes are potentiated in our population secondary to
      sun exposure and smoking. To combat the effects of aging on the face, a multitude of products
      and procedures exist to attempt to reverse the effects of sun damage and aging to achieve a
      youthful and rejuvenated appearance. There has been a shift from invasive procedures such as
      a facelift to noninvasive means using filling agents to restore lost contour deformities.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the use of dermal filling agents effectively delays the
      need for invasive procedures such as facelifts, and that patient satisfaction has increased
      with the evolution of recent dermal filling agents.

      The first part of this study will involve a retrospective review of patients who have had a
      dermal filler injection between 01/01/1998 through 12/31/2008 and then following up with one
      (1) patient satisfaction survey. The first part of the study, which is retrospective, may
      involve approximately 500 subjects. The data collected from the retrospective review will be
      the subject's name, medical record number, and address for contact information. Any other
      data collected will come from the answers on the questionnaire.

      The second part of this study will be a prospective study involving 100 subjects who are
      scheduled to have a dermal filler injection. These subjects will be asked to complete one (1)
      patient satisfaction survey two weeks after injection. Facial photos will be taken before the
      injection and then two weeks after injection at the follow up visit. This will complete the
      subject's participation in this study.
