  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee
      consumption has acute effects on subjective appetite feelings, energy intake and biochemical
      markers related to appetite, inflammation and glucose metabolism compared to water
      consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coffee is a pharmacologically active, widely consumed beverage. Scientific interest in
      relation to coffee consumption has been revisited the last decade in the light of new, mainly
      epidemiological, evidence indicating its potential health benefits. In specific, both
      cross-sectional and prospective studies indicate that coffee consumption is associated with a
      lower risk for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, an inverse association has been found between
      coffee consumption and markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in healthy and/or
      diabetic participants, although the opposite effect has also been reported, mainly in
      relation to inflammation markers. In relation to body weight, epidemiological data suggest
      that increment in caffeine consumption is associated with lower mean weight gain and energy
      intake during a 12-y period.

      However, information from clinical studies is scarce. Acute caffeine and/or coffee
      consumption have been associated with impaired glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. In
      relation to inflammation, animal studies have indicated a beneficial or no effect of coffee
      consumption, whereas a clinical study in humans found an increase in adiponectin and a
      decrease in interleukin-18 (IL-18) blood concentrations after a monthly intervention
      including daily consumption of 8 cups of coffee. As far as energy balance is concerned, there
      is an early experiment demonstrating that the ingestion of 300 mg of caffeine prior to food
      intake, compared to the non-caffeine intake, significantly reduced energy intake by 21.7% in
      men, but not in women. A more recent study has found that the combination of caffeine and red
      pepper is positively associated with energy expenditure and negatively with energy intake,
      whereas, it has also been reported a positive association between habitual caffeine intake
      and body weight loss achieved through a very-low-calorie diet.

      Taking into consideration the limited clinical evidence regarding the acute effect of coffee
      consumption on appetite-related markers, subsequent energy intake and inflammatory markers,
      we undertook a clinical study of crossover design to investigate the short-term changes on
      energy intake, subjective appetite ratings, appetite hormones, inflammation markers and
      glucose metabolism after caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption.

Three combinations of treatment sequences were used:
Caffeinated coffee, then decaffeinated coffee, then water
Decaffeinated coffee first, then water, then caffeinated coffee
Water first, then caffeinated coffee, then decaffeinated coffee.
Each treatment was separated by the other by at least one week interval.
The first volunteer entered the study received the first combination, the second volunteer the second combiation, the third volunteer the third combination, the forth volunteer the first combination of treatments, etc.</description>

          <description>Total area under the curve was defined as the sum of the areas under and over the baseline using the trapezoidal rule. The time points for the calculations were 15 min before beverage consumption, immediately after beverage consumption, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 min postconsumption.</description>

        <description>Serum samples, collected 15 min before ingestion, immediately after ingestion, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min and 150 min after ingestion were analyzed for the ex vivo serum resistance to oxidative stress, that was induced by copper sulfate (CuSO4). The analysis of all collected samples was performed by the measurement of conjugated diene formation, which was monitored for every sample of all time points every 2 min for a 3.5 h period at 234 nm in a microplate spectrophotometer.
Total area under the curve was defined as the sum of the areas under and over the baseline using the trapezoidal rule. The time points for the calculations were 15 min before beverage consumption, immediately after beverage consumption, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 min postconsumption.</description>
