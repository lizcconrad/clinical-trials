  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimum 24 subjects aged 8-12 with a diagnosis of ADHD will be prescribed extended release
      guanfacine (Intuniv) to assess impact, if any, on working memory. Pre and post testing using
      a standardized battery of tests for effect on symptoms of ADHD and working memory will be
      administered and assessed.
