  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD) and affect the quality
      of life of affected patients.

      Rasagiline is a potent, highly selective, irreversible, second-generation, monoamine oxidase
      type-B (MAO-B) inhibitor with a 24h dopaminergic effect.

      It is well known that dopaminergic treatment closely interacts with SWD. This study aims to
      assess the effect of Rasagiline on SWD in PD patients. In this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo controlled study in clinical phase IV, 60 subjects will be treated with rasagiline
      1mg po once daily or placebo over 8 weeks. The study is planned to be conducted in 6-9 Swiss
      centers. Questionaires will be used to assess SWDs: sleep disturbances (Parkinson's Disease
      Sleep Scale, PDSS), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS), fatigue (Fatigue
      Severity Scale, FSS), apathy (Apathy Evaluation Scale Self, AES-S), disability (Sheehan
      scale) and QoL in PD patients.
