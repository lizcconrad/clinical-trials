         20. Unwilling to avoid excessive sunlight exposure

         21. Use of drugs which might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that prolong
             the QT/QTc interval within 10 days prior to administration or during the trial, and
             CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, amodiaquine, paclitaxel, rosiglitazone,
             pioglitazone and repaglinide or CYP2C9 such as warfarin, tolbutamide, phenytoin,
             losartan, acenocoumarol within 1 month or six half lives (whichever is greater)

         22. A marked baseline prolongation of the QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a
