  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of cardiac disease/coronary artery
      disease and diagnostic yield of different non-invasive methods in patients with type 2
      diabetes 40-75 years of age at examination. Exercise tests, Doppler echocardiographic
      examination with Tissue Velocity Imaging, stress Echocardiography, transthoracic Doppler of
      coronary arteries with coronary flow reserve, and cardiac MRI with late enhancement at rest,
      and perfusion after vasodilatation stress will be used in the study. A subpopulation will in
      addition measure forearm vasodilation(FMD) and CFR before and after 4 months of exercise
      training.
