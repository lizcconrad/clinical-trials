    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study to evaluate if patients with ST depression Acute Coronary
      Syndrome who are taken directly to the catheter laboratory for angiogram and angioplasty +/-
      stents will fare better that patients who are taken to the ward area and managed with drug
      therapy and stabilised for 24 hours before being taken to the catheter laboratory.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria Patients presenting with symptoms (onset of symptoms ≤ 12 hours) of a
        suspected acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or MI without persistent ST elevation)
        characterised as follows

          -  Clinical history consistent with ongoing ischaemic chest pain and/or symptoms AND

          -  &gt;1mm ST depression AND/OR ≥2mm T wave inversion in at least two adjacent ECG leads
             Pathological T wave inversion in leads 1+4 suggesting 'LAD Syndrome' Or Ischaemic ST
             depression/T wave inversion not fulfilling the above criteria that is felt in the
             opinion of the attending physician to represent an acute coronary syndrome. AND

          -  Written informed consent Main exclusion criteria

               1. ≤ 18 years of age

               2. Previous Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting surgery

               3. ST elevation myocardial infarction

               4. Left bundle branch block (LBBB)

               5. ST depression seen in patients during paced mode only

               6. Heart rate ≥ 150bpm

               7. Cardiogenic shock or other catastrophic state

               8. If in the opinion of the physician the patient is not suitable for
                  revascularisation due to co-morbidity

               9. Patient participating in another clinical trial such that randomisation to DANCE
                  would result in deviation from the protocol stipulations of either trial.
