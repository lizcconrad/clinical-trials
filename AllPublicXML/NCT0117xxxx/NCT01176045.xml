    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine how pre &amp; post-operative tear osmolarity
      levels relate to rates of dry eye symptoms related to refractive surgery and if differences
      exist in patients who are pre-treated with ocular lubricants vs. those treated only
      post-operatively.

      Dry eye disease is a common and major source of disability, whether occurring as a primary
      disorder or as a component of other diseases and its onset may be triggered or modified by
      exposure to systemic drugs, contact lens wear, ocular surgery and adverse environmental and
      work conditions. The development of a reliable, highly sensitive and specific test for the
      clinical diagnosis of dry eye is a major unmet clinical need, particularly to differentiate
      it from common conditions such as ocular allergy which exhibit similar presenting symptoms.
      Tear hyper-osmolarity is central to the dry eye disease process and the measurement of tear
      osmolarity could serve not only as a highly accurate diagnostic test but also as a measure of
      disease severity and a means to monitor treatment efficacy.

      Recently, there have been reports in the literature regarding dry eye disease; both early and
      chronic following refractive surgery, with many cases potentially being previously
      inadvertently undiagnosed dry eye disease.

    <ipd_description>Study data has been shared in Vienna 2011. Patients with pre-operative hyperosmolarity (≥ 308 mOsms/L) demonstrated worse long-term uncorrected visual acuity. An abnormal tear film may cause inaccurate wavefront aberrometry. For patients with preoperative osmolarity ≥ 308 mOsms/L, it may be important to continue therapy for at least 3 months. Similarly, surgeons should measure tear osmolarity preoperatively as staining was too insensitive to identify at-risk patients. Patients treated pre-operatively with AMO Blink® Tears achieved normal osmolarity faster than those untreated before surgery.</ipd_description>
