  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impetigo is a common, highly infectious skin disease caused by bacterial infection and
      characterized by crusting skin lesions. It is most common in children, particularly children
      in unhealthy living conditions. In adults, it may follow other skin disorders. Impetigo is
      caused primarily by the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes and/or Staphylococcus aureus, which
      can also be isolated from impetigo lesions.

      This is a pilot phase II study to evaluate the tolerability and safety and to monitor the
      clinical efficacy of Topical Minocycline Foam FXFM244 in impetigo patients.

      A randomized, parallel-group, double (Investigator, patient) blind, comparative dose range
      finding clinical trial.

      The study will involve two treatment groups. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive
      either FXFM244 - 1%, FXFM244 - 4% , in a blinded fashion. Patients will be treated twice
      daily for 7 days. Following the screening period and baseline visit, study subjects will
      return at days 3, 7 and 14. At each visit, patients will be evaluated via lesion count,
      global assessment tolerability and safety.
