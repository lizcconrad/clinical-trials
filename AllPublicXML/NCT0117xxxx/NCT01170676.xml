      This is a research study that compares the effectiveness of a web-based program (known as
      Puff City) and another web-based program (of internet sites such as the American Lung
      Association, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology, etc) that targets five key
      asthma management issues among rural youth:

        1. Improving adherence to asthma controller medication use;

        2. Improving compliance of carrying a rescue inhaler at all times for use at the first sign
           of asthma symptoms;

        3. Improving inhaler technique;

        4. Smoking reduction or cessation in those who are smokers; and

        5. Avoidance of second-hand smoke exposure.

    <description>Puff City is an NHLBI-funded (C. Joseph, PI; Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, MI), web-based intervention that targets three key asthma management issues in youth: 1) smoking reduction or cessation in those who are smokers, 2) improving adherence to asthma controller medication use, and 3) improving compliance of carrying a rescue inhaler at all times for use at the first sign of asthma symptoms. Puff City Ga. is a replication study in the rural southeastern United States that adds biological assessments in addition to self-report data.</description>
