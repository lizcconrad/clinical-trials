  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mastocytes were proven to have a central rule in their development of the lipoid plaque of
      the vascular system. Mastocytes also has an important role in the stabilisation of the plaque
      in the building of the brain barrier. Different animal studies show that the inhibition of
      the mastocyte activity decreases significantly the risk of secondary bleeding post ischaemic
      stroke.It was also shown that post stroke inflammation process was also blocked by the
      inhibition of mastocytes.Other studies showed up to 100% decrease in the brain barrier
      disruption and post stroke oedema, after treatment with mastocyte inhibitors.

      Cromolyn is a synthetic drug which has an anti-allergic effect by inhibition of the
      mastocytes. This drug is a well known,safe drug and is the main sub-substance that was used
      in the previously mentioned studies.
