    <textblock>
      Management of dental pain emergencies is a challenge for the clinician, particularly when
      pain is due to endodontic infection.

      Tested hypothesis is intradiploic anesthesia is more effective and quicker than inferior
      alveolar nerve block for mandibular molars anesthesia.

      The aim of the study is the evaluation of Quicksleeper efficiency used in first intention
      versus inferior alveolar nerve block used in most current dental treatment.

      Management of dental pain emergencies is a challenge for the clinician, particularly when
      pain is due to endodontic infection. Failure rate of local anesthesia highly increases with
      irreversible pulpitis or inflamed periradicular tissue.

      Tested hypothesis is intradiploic anesthesia is more effective and quicker than inferior
      alveolar nerve block for mandibular molars anesthesia (from teeth 35 up to 38 and from 45 up
      to 48).

      The primary aim of the study is the evaluation of Quicksleeper efficiency used in first
      intention versus inferior alveolar nerve block used in most current dental treatment.

      Four clinical situations are evaluated : pulpitis; periapical abcess; pulpal hyperemia;
      asymptomatic decayed tooth.

      Evaluated parameters are : speed of sedation, ability of cure, additional anesthesia needed,
      total of needles and cartridges used, side effects. Time and validation of complete
      anesthesia is controlled by pulp tester.

      Studied population is patients cared in restorative, endodontics department.

      Pulpal and periapical molar and premolar sedation is randomly managed by inferior alveolar
      nerve block or Quicksleeper intraosseous anesthesia, among studied population (divided in 2
      groups of 50 patients). Pulp-tester measures anesthesia minute by minute.

      The comparison of study results to bibliography, guidelines and advantages for using
      mechanical Quicksleeper anesthesia system will be discussed.
