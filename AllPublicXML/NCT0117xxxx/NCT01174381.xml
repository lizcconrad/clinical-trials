    <textblock>
      Sri Lanka as a developing nation needs to identify feasible and cost effective measures to
      face the epidemic of NonCommunicable Diseases(NCDs) in the future. Experiences gained over
      many years in the developed countries can be of great value in planning and implementing NCD
      prevention and control activities in the developing countries Results from many studies have
      emphasized the fact that merely providing risk reduction measures for clinically high-risk
      people in health service settings would have only a limited impact in the whole country. On
      the other hand, if the population as a whole were to be targeted, even a modest risk factor
      and healthy lifestyle change would potentially have a huge public impact.This study attempts
      to implement a lifestyle intervention programme aimed at changing the dietary habits,
      physical activity and alcohol and tobacco consumption in the 25-60year old adults in the MOH
      area, Ragama and measure the effectiveness of the programme. Outcome measures are process
      indicators, as measured by change in the dietary patterns, alcohol and tobacco consumption
      and physical activity. Short term outcome indicators would be blood pressure and
      anthropometric measurements. The long term outcome indicators such as morbidity and mortality
      due to NCD will not be measured as this will be a short term study.
