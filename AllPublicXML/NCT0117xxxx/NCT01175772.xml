  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical studies showed that metronomic chemotherapy can induce tumor regression secondary
      to apoptosis of the tumor blood vessels. This effect was increased by combining metronomic
      chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic drugs. Metronomic chemotherapy has already proved clinical
      effects too, especially on patients with breast or prostate carcinoma. This study is aimed to
      test the efficacy of an experimental metronomic chemotherapy regimen in a cohort of patients
      with ovarian cancer. Patients will receive the proposed regimen as maintenance treatment
      following response induction by the conventional maximal tolerated dose (MTD) regimen of
      Carboplatin and Paclitaxel. Our regimen will include Cytophosphan combined with two agents
      which are expected to act as indirect angiogenic inhibitors: (a) celecoxib, as a selective
      COX-2 inhibitor and (b) low-dose Methotrexate, as successfully practiced for suppressing the
      inflammatory manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis. All components of our regimen will be
      administered orally and continuously for one year based on the hypothesis that its
      anti-angiogenic properties will be able to suppress the recovery of residual disease, thus
      extending the time to progression (TTP), and possibly the overall survival as well.
