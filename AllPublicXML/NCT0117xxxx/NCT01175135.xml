        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - Positive, Negative, and General Subscales Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>PANSS - positive, negative, and general subscales assesses positive, negative and general psychopathological symptoms associated with schizophrenia respectively. Seven (7) items each make up the positive scale (for example; delusions, conceptual disorganization, and hallucinatory behavior) and negative scale (for example; blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal) and 16 items make up the general scale (for example; somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, mannerisms and posturing, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, disorientation, poor impulse control, pre-occupation). Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Total scores range for positive as well as negative subscale is 7 to 49 and for general subscale is 16 to 112; higher subscale score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - Marder Factors Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>PANSS is a 30-item scale to assess the neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). PANSS Marder positive symptoms subscale consists of 8 items with total score equal to sum of 8 items ranging from 8-56; Marder negative symptoms subscale and Marder disorganized thoughts (Dis. Thought) subscale, each consists of 7 items with total score equal to sum of 7 items each, ranging from 7-49, Marder uncontrolled hostility/excitement (Uncon. Hos/Exc) subscale and Marder anxiety/depression (Anx/Dep) subscale, each consists of 4 items with total score equal to sum of 4 items each ranging from 4-28. Higher subscale score indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - Derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Core Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>PANSS is a 30-item scale to assess the neuropsychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia. PANSS derived BPRS is an 18-item clinician rated scale which assesses symptoms such as hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations, grandiosity, and a number of other psychiatric symptoms. Items scored on a 7-point scale (1=not present and 7=extremely severe), with higher score indicating greater severity of symptom. BPRS core score consists of 4 items (Conceptual disorganization, Hallucinatory behavior, Suspiciousness/persecution, Unusual thought content) with total score equal to sum of the 4 items, ranging from 4 to 28, with higher score indicating greater severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>GAF is a 100-point, clinician rated single item scale that rates the severity of illness-related impairment in psychological, social and occupational functioning of participants on a hypothetical continuum of mental illness to mental health. The scale values range from 1 to 100 with lower score indicating greater severity of illness and is divided into 10 equal intervals (descriptors): from 1-10 (persistent danger of hurting self - serious suicidal acting with clear expectations of death) to 91-100 (superior functioning - no symptoms). Each descriptor has a nine-point range to allow for some variability of severity within the descriptor.</description>

It consists of a 14-item questionnaire which comprises of 3 specific scales (effectiveness, side effects, convenience) and 1 global satisfaction scale. Effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction scale are rated on a 7-point scale (0= Extremely Dissatisfied, 1= Very Dissatisfied, 2= Dissatisfied, 3= Somewhat Satisfied, 4= Satisfied, 5= Very Satisfied, 6= Extremely Satisfied) and side effects are rated on a 5-point scale (0= Extremely Dissatisfied, 1=Very Dissatisfied, 2= Somewhat Dissatisfied, 3= Slightly Dissatisfied, 4= Not at all Dissatisfied). Scale scores are transformed into scores ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more satisfaction.</description>

        <description>ESRS-A is a clinician rated scale consisting of 24 items to assess severity of extra-pyramidal symptoms for following parameters: parkinsonism (10 items), dystonia (6 items), dyskinesia (6 items) and akathisia (2 items). Each item is scored on a 6-point Likert scale (0=absent, 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe, 5=extreme). Total score for a parameter is average of individual item scores included under the parameter, ranging from 0 to 5, with higher score = more affected.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Movement Disorder Burden Score for Dystonia (MDBS-D) at Week 4</title>
        <description>MDBS-D score reflects the numbers and durations of movement disorder adverse events for dystonia, the severity of the events, required treatment, and the total number of days the participant received study treatment. MDBS-D score = (S * D * C)/TTD; where S= Movement Disorder Severity Score for Dystonia (possible values: 1 [mild]; 2 [moderate]; 3 [severe]), D=adverse event duration (in days), C=concomitant medication factor (C=1.5 if an anti-cholinergic or beta blocker is used for the treatment of a movement disorder; C=1 if no concomitant medication is used), TTD=total treatment days for the participant. Value for MDBS score may range from zero to infinity. A higher MDBS-D score indicates a greater movement disorder adverse event liability compared to baseline.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Response to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>Data relevant to the assessment of suicidality is mapped to the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) event codes. C-SSRS assesses whether participant experiences following: suicide attempt (Event code 2) (Response of “Yes” on “actual attempt”), preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (Event code 3) (“Yes” on “aborted attempt”, “interrupted attempt”, “preparatory acts or behavior”), suicidal ideation (Event code 4) (“Yes” on “wish to be dead”, “non-specific active suicidal thoughts”, “active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act/some intent to act without specific plan or with specific plan and intent), self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent (Event code 7) (“Yes” on “Has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior”). Number of participants with &quot;Yes&quot; response for above mentioned categories are assessed. Baseline is defined as the Week 0 measurement.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Response to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
          <description>Data relevant to the assessment of suicidality is mapped to the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) event codes. C-SSRS assesses whether participant experiences following: suicide attempt (Event code 2) (Response of “Yes” on “actual attempt”), preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (Event code 3) (“Yes” on “aborted attempt”, “interrupted attempt”, “preparatory acts or behavior”), suicidal ideation (Event code 4) (“Yes” on “wish to be dead”, “non-specific active suicidal thoughts”, “active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act/some intent to act without specific plan or with specific plan and intent), self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent (Event code 7) (“Yes” on “Has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior”). Number of participants with &quot;Yes&quot; response for above mentioned categories are assessed. Baseline is defined as the Week 0 measurement.</description>
          <population>Safety analysis set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication.</population>
