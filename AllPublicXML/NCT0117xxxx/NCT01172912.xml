      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. An autologous stem cell
      transplant may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving high-dose chemotherapy
      together with stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      metastatic germ cell tumors that have not responded to first-line therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy comprising carboplatin and etoposide
           (CE) in combination with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation using the CE
           regimen as initial salvage treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory, metastatic
           germ cell tumors that did not respond to first-line treatment.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity associated with this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate biological correlates of outcome in patients with available tissue pre- and
           post-treatment.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Conventional-dose chemotherapy: Patients receive ifosfamide on days 1 and 2, followed by
           cisplatin and etoposide on days 3-5, and dexamethasone on days 1-5. Patients undergo
           leukapheresis daily for stem cell harvest. Patients also receive conventional filgrastim
           (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once a day beginning 48 hours after completion of
           chemotherapy until adequate collection of stem cells are obtained. Treatment repeats
           every 21 days for 1 or 2 courses.

        -  High-dose (HD) chemotherapy: Patients receive HD carboplatin and etoposide once a day on
           days 1-3. Treatments repeat every 30-40 days for 2 courses.

        -  Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo reinfusion of
           autologous stem cells on day 6 (after HD chemotherapy on days 1-5). Patients then
           receive one dose of pegfilgrastim SC beginning 6 hours after completion of stem cell
           infusion or conventional filgrastim SC once daily beginning 4 days after completion of
           stem cell infusion and continuing until blood counts recover.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed germ cell tumor (GCT) based on pathologic review at INT Milan

               -  Metastatic disease

               -  Relapsed or refractory disease

          -  Prior chemotherapy treatment for GCT without a pathologic diagnosis due to unequivocal
             clinical evidence of GCT and an urgent need to start therapy (elevated
             alpha-fetoprotein [AFP] or human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG] with pattern of
             metastases consistent with GCT and high tumor burden) allowed

          -  Unequivocal progression of measurable disease, consisting of abnormalities on
             2-dimensional imaging or raised tumor markers, following 1 line of cisplatin-based
             chemotherapy as documented by either of the following:
