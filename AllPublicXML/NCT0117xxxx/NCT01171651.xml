    <description>Patients will receive a total dose of 1e9 per treatment starting with one IV dose on Day 1 and injected intratumorally in 1-5 intrahepatic tumors on Day 8 and 22. Starting on Day 25 (3 days after the final JX-594 dose) patients will initiate oral sorafenib therapy twice daily according to standard approved guidelines. An optional maintenance JX-594 dose may be given intratumorally at Week 12 (sorafenib briefly interrupted).</description>
