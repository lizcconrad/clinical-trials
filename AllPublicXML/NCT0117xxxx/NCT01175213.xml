  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The original purpose of the study was to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and
      practicability of the subcutaneous (SC) treatment with Immune Globulin Subcutaneous Solution
      (IGSC), 10% facilitated with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) in participants with
      Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PID) who had completed Baxalta (formerly Baxter) Clinical
      Study Protocol No. 160603.

      Following a discussion with the FDA at the end of July 2012, all participants still active in
      the study stopped treatment with rHuPH20 to assure safety of the participants participating
      in the study and went into a safety follow-up.

      During this safety follow-up period, participants underwent either SC treatment with IGSC,
      10% or intravenous (IV) treatment with Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10%. The
      IV or SC administration route was at the discretion of the participant and the investigator.

    <time_frame>Throughout the efficacy period only (from 60 to 729 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The point estimate of the annual rate of validated acute serious bacterial infections (VASBIs) per participant per year was provided during subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous Solution (IGSC), 10%, after SC administration of human recombinant hyaluronidase (rHuPH20).
This efficacy outcome measure was only applicable prior to the safety follow-up i.e. before discontinuation of rHuPH20.</description>

    <measure>Trough Levels of IgG Maintained During the Study Period in Relation to Dose Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the efficacy period only (from 60 to 729 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Immunoglobulin (IgG) steady state trough levels were measured in relation to dose frequency by measuring in relation to treatment interval (2-, 3- or 4-week intervals).
Initially participants were administered subcutaneous (SC) infusions of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous Solution (IGSC), 10%, after SC administration of human recombinant hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) [or IV infusions of IGSC, 10% only] at the treatment intervals and dose determined by epoch 2 of study 160603 (3- or 4-week intervals).
After 3 treatment intervals (either 3- or 4- week intervals), participants changed to a 2-week treatment interval, if agreed with participant and investigator, with the dose adjusted to 1/2 of the 4-week dose or 2/3 of the 3-week dose, whichever was applicable. The rHuPH20 dose was adjusted relative to the new IGSC, 10% dose in order to achieve a dose ratio of 75 U/g IgG.
This efficacy outcome measure was only applicable prior to the safety follow-up i.e. before discontinuation of rHuPH20.</description>

        <title>Trough Levels of IgG Maintained During the Study Period in Relation to Dose Frequency</title>
        <description>Immunoglobulin (IgG) steady state trough levels were measured in relation to dose frequency by measuring in relation to treatment interval (2-, 3- or 4-week intervals).
Initially participants were administered subcutaneous (SC) infusions of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous Solution (IGSC), 10%, after SC administration of human recombinant hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) [or IV infusions of IGSC, 10% only] at the treatment intervals and dose determined by epoch 2 of study 160603 (3- or 4-week intervals).
After 3 treatment intervals (either 3- or 4- week intervals), participants changed to a 2-week treatment interval, if agreed with participant and investigator, with the dose adjusted to 1/2 of the 4-week dose or 2/3 of the 3-week dose, whichever was applicable. The rHuPH20 dose was adjusted relative to the new IGSC, 10% dose in order to achieve a dose ratio of 75 U/g IgG.
This efficacy outcome measure was only applicable prior to the safety follow-up i.e. before discontinuation of rHuPH20.</description>

        <description>Categories presented as Preferred Term-Seriousness-Relatedness-Severity. The following codes are to be used:
Seriousness: non-SAE-non-serious AE; SAE-serious AE Relatedness to study drug: R (related to either study drug); NR (not related to either or both study drugs). Study drugs are Immune Globulin Subcutaneous Solution, 10% (IGSC, 10%) and recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) Severity: Mild; Mod (Moderate); Severe</description>
        <time_frame>Throughout entire study period (up to 3 years). Duration of participation for each participant is variable depending on date of enrollment and their anti-rHuPH20 binding antibody titer.</time_frame>

            <description>All participants were included in the Safety Follow-up. Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>

            <description>All participants were included in the Safety Follow-up. Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>

Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>

            <description>All participants were included in the Safety Follow-up. Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>

Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>

Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>

Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>

            <description>All participants were included in the Safety Follow-up. Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>

Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>

Safety Follow-up occurred after discontinuation of treatment with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) and included participants who had been treated with intravenous administration of Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV), 10% only throughout the study (e.g. had never received rHuPH20 in this study).
At Safety Follow-up, the decision for treatment with either subcutaneous (SC) administration of Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human) (IGSC), 10% or IV administration of IGIV, 10% was at the discretion of the investigator and participant.
Note: IGIV, 10% is the same product as IGSC, 10%.</description>
