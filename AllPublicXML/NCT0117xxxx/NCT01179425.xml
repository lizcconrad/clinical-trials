    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore sex differences in cognitive functioning and
      responses to marijuana-related items, and to determine whether stress impacts these measures.

      Hypothesis 1: Attentional bias will be greater for marijuana cues in male marijuana-dependent
      subjects relative to female marijuana-dependent or non-dependent male controls.

      Hypothesis 2: Marijuana-dependent females will exhibit greater stress-induced changes in
      attentional bias and cognitive functioning than marijuana-dependent males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ample evidence implicates both environmental cues and negative affective states in
      maintaining drug use or triggering relapse. However, although 'craving' is believed to drive
      continued drug use, it is not well understood how cognitive processes influence craving and
      relapse, nor how they may differ between the sexes. Therefore, the goal of this study
      protocol is to provide insight into sex differences in the cognitive aspects of drug craving
      and to assess the impact of stress on attentional bias for drug-related cues as well as on
      the availability of cognitive resources.

    <description>The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT-C), has been modified for use as a computerized laboratory-based stressor. Single digits are presented, and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it and click on the appropriate answer. Failure to do so in the allotted time results in a noxious error sound.</description>
