      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, affecting 20% of all babies
      and children around the world. Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is clinical and depends on the
      existence of at least two out of the four following criteria: itching, a chronic disease
      course with exacerbations and remission ,rash with characteristic distribution and shape ,
      atopia of the patient or family by history.

      Initial treatment is based on keeping skin moist and avoiding a flare-provoking stimuli and
      allergens. The research product A-1 COOL is a skin cream approved by the Israeli Ministry of
      Health for cooling down of skin irritation. A-1 COOL is rich in herbal medicine ingredients
      and does not contain steroids.A-1 COOL can be beneficial in Atopic Dermatitis patients due to
      its following action mechanisms: sealing of the inflamed skin and retention of water,
      prevention of the itching cycle by keeping the skin moist, disinfection of the skin by the
      herbal ingredients.
