    <textblock>
      Weight loss commonly occurs in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
      negatively influencing their quality of life, treatment response and survival. Loss of muscle
      protein is generally a central component of weight loss in COPD patients. Attempts to reverse
      muscle loss in COPD by supplying large amounts of protein or calories to these patients have
      been unsuccessful. Gains in muscle mass are difficult to achieve in COPD unless specific
      metabolic abnormalities are targeted. The investigators recently observed that alterations in
      protein metabolism are present in normal weight COPD patients. Elevated levels of protein
      synthesis and breakdown rates were found in this COPD group indicating that alterations are
      already present before muscle wasting occurs. Furthermore, reduced plasma essential amino
      acid (EAA) levels were observed in COPD patients. These reduced EAA plasma levels were
      significantly related with the presence of muscle wasting in COPD. Until now, limited
      research has been done examining protein metabolism and the response to feeding in patients
      with COPD. Previous studies support the concept of essential amino acids (EAA) as an anabolic
      stimulus in the young and elderly and in insulin resistant states. Until yet no information
      is present on the anabolic effects of EAA in elderly COPD patients.

      It is therefore our hypothesis that a high-leucine essential amino acids mixture specifically
      designed to stimulate protein anabolism will target the metabolic alterations of COPD
      patients. In the present study, the acute effects of an EAA nutritional supplement on whole
      body, muscle and liver protein metabolism will be examined in COPD patients and compared to a
      supplement consisting of a balanced mixture of total amino acids. The principal endpoints
      will be the extent of stimulation of whole body protein synthesis as this is the principal
      mechanism by which either amino acid or protein intake causes muscle anabolism, and the
      reduction in endogenous protein breakdown. Both endpoints will be assessed by isotope
      methodology which is thought to be the reference method.

      In this study the investigators will test the following hypothesis: A high-leucine essential
      amino acid mixture (dose of 7.0 g EAA + 15 g carbohydrates) will stimulate protein anabolism
      to a greater extent than a standard balanced mixture of total (essential and non-essential)
      amino acids (dose of 6.7 g total AA + 15 g carbohydrates) in COPD patients. The principal
      endpoints will be the extent of stimulation of protein synthesis rate and the reduction in
      endogenous protein breakdown. The current project will provide information that will enable
      us to better understand the underlying metabolic mechanisms that regulate protein metabolism
      in patients with COPD.
