    <textblock>
      The major goal of this 4-site, double blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial is to
      assess the efficacy of medication (Citalopram) alone or with psychotherapy (Complicated Grief
      Therapy) to treat the symptoms of complicated grief.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Complicated grief (CG) is a debilitating condition that is estimated to affect millions of
      people in the United States alone. We conducted the first randomized controlled study to
      address this condition (MH60783) and confirmed efficacy of a targeted psychotherapy,
      complicated grief treatment (CGT). Participants in our prior study continued stable
      antidepressant medication while receiving CGT or Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT).
      Individuals taking antidepressants had better outcome in both treatments, though CGT was
      superior to IPT when administered with (60% responders v. 40%) or without (42% v.19%)
      antidepressants. Studies of antidepressant medication alone have shown mixed results with
      SSRIs appearing to be promising. However, there has been no randomized controlled study of
      SSRIs for CG. Determining the efficacy of SSRI treatment for CG, when administered with and
      without CGT, is of great public health importance.

      We assembled 4 groups of investigators with strong track records in bereavement research and
      extensive experience with intervention studies and multicenter projects, to conduct a study
      of citalopram (CIT) efficacy. We plan to enroll participants with a primary diagnosis of
      Complicated Grief and randomly assign them (n=480; 50 at Columbia) to receive treatment with
      CIT, Placebo (PBO), CIT + CGT or PBO + CGT over a period of approximately 16 weeks. We want
      to determine whether citalopram shows a better response than placebo, when administered
      either with or without CGT. We will also address the question of whether CIT performs as well
      when administered alone as it does when administered with CGT.

    <time_frame>Weeks 12 and 20</time_frame>
    <description>Brief rating scale frequently used in clinical trials. For this study, version modified for complicated grief was be used. Response is defined as a score of 1(very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the scale. The rating was done by an Independent Evaluator.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The 19-item self-report instrument assesses symptoms of complicated grief. Responses on individual items are added up to a total score, which can range from 0 to 76 with higher scores indicating more intense symptoms. This scale has been utilized previously in treatment studies of CG. Additional times points include weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 40. For the pre-specified analyses we compared change in the ICG total score from baseline (calculated as baseline score minus week 12 score) for CIT vs PLA at week 12 (aim 1), based on the intention-to-treat principle including all randomized participants.</description>

    <description>The WSAS is a modification of a scale introduced by Hafner and Marks (1976), consisting of 0-8 point ratings of the extent to which symptoms interfere with five areas of daily functioning: work, home management, private leisure, social leisure, and family relationships. It is a well-validated, widely used self-report measure. Additional time points include weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 40. A total score calculated as a sum of all items (possible range 0-40) was used in the analyses with higher scores indicating more impairment. For the pre-specified analyses we compared change in the WSAS total score from baseline (calculated as baseline score minus week 12 score) for CIT vs PLA at week 12 (aim 1), based on the intention-to-treat principle including all randomized participants.</description>

        <description>The 19-item self-report instrument assesses symptoms of complicated grief. Responses on individual items are added up to a total score, which can range from 0 to 76 with higher scores indicating more intense symptoms. This scale has been utilized previously in treatment studies of CG. Additional times points include weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 40.

        <description>The WSAS is a modification of a scale introduced by Hafner and Marks (1976), consisting of 0-8 point ratings of the extent to which symptoms interfere with five areas of daily functioning: work, home management, private leisure, social leisure, and family relationships. It is a well-validated, widely used self-report measure. Additional time points include weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 40. A total score calculated as a sum of all items (possible range 0-40) was used in the analyses with higher scores indicating more impairment. For the pre-specified analyses we compared change in the WSAS total score from baseline (calculated as baseline score minus week 12 score) for CIT vs PLA at week 12 (aim 1), based on the intention-to-treat principle including all randomized participants.</description>
