  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to determine if treatment with Gabapentin taken
      systemically (oral tablets) in patients who have photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) surgical
      treatments reduces post surgical neuropathic pain and discomfort. The investigators main
      Hypothesis is that gabapentin given prior to and after refractive surgery prevents central
      sensitization and local allodynia.
