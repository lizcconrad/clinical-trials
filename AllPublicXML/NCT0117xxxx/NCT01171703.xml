  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to find out the appropriate way to treat DM patients with
      critical limb ischemia. This trial includes two parts. Part I focuses on the treatment of
      femoral arterial lesion and part II focuses on the treatment of below-knee arterial lesion.

      The trial includes two parts and here is part I. This part is a multi-center, prospective,
      randomized, controlled study to compare the therapeutic effect of stent and bypass to chronic
      long occlusion of the superficial femoral artery in DM patients. Totally 70 patients will be
      entered into the study. The lesion of the femoral artery should be TASC B、C or D and the
      patients should suffered ischemic symptom with Rutherford 3-6.The lesion does not extend
      beyond the aortoiliac artery or blow-knee popliteal artery, with at least 1 vessel
      infra-popliteal runoff to the foot.
