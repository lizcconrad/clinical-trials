  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an interactive education program for
      prenatal testing is effective in improving pregnant women's understanding of and expectations
      towards prenatal screening and diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women face a variety of medical decisions during pregnancy and childbirth. While there are
      extensive educational resources for pregnant women, modern medicine presents decisions that
      many women are poorly equipped to make. Issues such as prenatal screening and mode of birth
      after a cesarean delivery require a significant degree of patient education to enable a truly
      informed medical decision. Studies have shown that women have a poor understanding of
      screening for birth defects and mode of birth after a cesarean delivery. Women with a low
      level of education or poor health literacy are significantly more likely to demonstrate
      inadequate understanding of prenatal screening. ArchieMD, Inc. has developed a comprehensive
      interactive medical simulation environment which has the potential to visually convey complex
      information to patients to improve understanding of medical procedures and educate patients
      on the consequences of their behavior. We hypothesize that such an interactive medical
      simulation patient education program can improve patient understanding allowing pregnant
      women to make informed decisions. In Phase I, we will prototype an interactive patient
      education program for prenatal screening and amniocentesis.
