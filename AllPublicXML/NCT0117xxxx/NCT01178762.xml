  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the major causes of sexually transmitted disease and also the
      leading infectious cause of blindness in the world.Treatment of C. trachomatis eye infection
      has involved for a long time. The efficacy of single dose azithromycin has already been
      demonstrated as effective in the treatment of both trachoma and adult inclusion
      conjunctivitis.However, in our clinical experience, some patients of chlamydial
      conjunctivitis may require augmented single dose azithromycin treatments before C.
      trachomatis is eradicated. In this way, we would like to known the efficacy of single dose
      and augmented single dose azithromycin in the treatment of chlamydial conjunctivitis.

      Medical records of patients with clinically suspected chlamydial conjunctivitis between
      January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2006 at one cornea specialist's (Y.C.H) out-patient clinic
      were retrospectively reviewed. At this clinic, patients of both sexes with acute, chronic or
      recurrent follicular conjunctivitis with the symptoms and signs of chlamydial conjunctivitis
      suspected were tested for Chlamydia direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests and arranged for
      next time out-patient clinic follow up 1-2 weeks later. The patients who attended the follow
      up visit with positive DFA results were treated with oral azithromycin. These patients
      received a single dose oral azithromycin (400mg~1000mg, according to their age and body
      weight) once a week for consecutive two weeks. Repeated DFA examinations were performed 4 to
      6 weeks later. If the DFA examinations still showed positive results, augmented single dose
      oral azithromycin once a week for one week was given again till the DFA showed negative
      results. The occurrence and frequency of adverse events recorded in the medical charts were
      reviewed as well.

    <description>We performed direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests for Chlamydia by swabbing across the lower and upper tarsal conjunctiva four times after topical application of 0.5% proparacaine. All of the DFA tests were examined by the same experienced microbiologist who was masked to the identities and clinical conditions of the patients. Each DFA slide was read under a fluorescent microscope and was observed for discrete fluorescent chlamydial elementary bodies (EBs).The DFA test was considered positive if above 10 EBs were counted per high-power field.</description>
