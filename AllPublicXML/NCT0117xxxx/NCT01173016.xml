  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center pilot study in which Laronidase will be given weekly for two years in
      patients with Hurler syndrome, also known as mucopolysaccharide IH (MPS I, Hurler syndrome),
      that have previously been treated with an allogeneic transplant.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of giving weekly
      Laronidase for 2 years in patients with Hurler syndrome after allogeneic transplantation.
      Specifically, i) the ability to enroll patients, ii) continued compliance throughout the
      study with drug administration and testing, as well as iii) the relevance of various endpoint
      determinations will be assessed. The findings of the pilot study will be used to assess
      whether a subsequent larger study will be conducted.

      Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives of this study will focus on the toxicity
      associated with weekly Laronidase in this patient population, and the evaluation of a variety
      of testing and efficacy parameters that would be utilized to measure outcomes and determine
      benefit in patients treated on a subsequent larger study.

      Eligible patients will receive Laronidase as an infusion over several hours once a week at a
      local site. The dosing of enzyme will be the standard doses recommended by Genzyme.
