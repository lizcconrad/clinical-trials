      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of delivering
      HDMTX in an outpatient setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High Dose Methotrexate (HDMTX) is an integral part of osteosarcoma therapy whose main
      toxicities include myelosuppression, mucositis, nephrotoxicity, and hepatitis. In order to
      deliver HDMTX therapy safely, patients require urinary alkalinization, hydration, monitoring
      of renal function, therapeutic drug monitoring, and leucovorin rescue. Due to the required
      supportive care needs, HDMTX has historically been given as an inpatient. In some centers
      however, HDMTX is being given safely as an outpatient in order to reduce health care costs,
      improve patient quality of life and to deliver timely therapy with limited inpatient
      chemotherapy beds available.

    <description>Methotrexate will be given by IV at a dose of 12 gram/m2/dose.
The patient will receive 4-6 hours of hydration with alkalinization, and then HD MTX will be infused over 4 hours. Following this, the patient will be discharged home to receive continuous intravenous hydration through a portable pump. The patient will return to hospital daily for a comprehensive clinical assessment, IV hydration and antiemetics, MTX level and creatinine monitoring until MTX is cleared (3-4 days).</description>
