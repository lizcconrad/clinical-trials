  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain bone marrow and peripheral blood samples, along with
      clinical data from patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM), Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM),
      Smoldering MM, and other lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas (LPL) including but not limited to MGUS
      and IgG or IgA LPL. These samples will become part of a tissue bank and will be used in
      ongoing studies to find out more about the causes and biology of MM, WM and LPL; to identify
      what factors result in normal cells becoming cancer; to determine how to improve treatment
      options; to study how the immune system identifies abnormal cells; and to evaluate the immune
      function in these diseases. The investigators will also study the tumor cells at the level of
      the participant's genes to develop treatment strategies as well as to better understand how
      biologic differences affect patient outcomes.

      -  Participants will be asked to complete a medical survey which includes demographics,
           diagnosis, and treatment history, medical history, lab results and symptoms experienced.

        -  Participants will then receive instructions for the tissue banking procedure, which
           involves donating bone marrow and blood samples. These will be collected only at times
           when necessary clinical bone marrow samples are obtained and will not require an extra
           visit to the doctor.

        -  The investigators are also requesting permission to collect medical information from the
           participant's record and link this information to the specimens so that we may better
           understand the participant's response to treatment. For samples obtained prior to
           beginning therapy, this information might allow us to develop new ways of predicting
           response to therapy. The investigators are also requesting permission to store samples
           of blood and bone marrow to establish a tissue bank for future research to these
           diseases. These samples will be de-identified; any of the participant's personal health
           information identifiers will be removed.

        -  The tumor sample may be obtained at diagnosis, during treatment and/or as the time of
           relapse. The timing of sample collection will coincide with other bone marrow tests
           required to assess the response to therapy or any other clinical purpose.

        Participant's will be identified through several mechanisms:

          1. Primary recruitment will occur via Internet advertising through patient websites
             including but not limited to the International Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
             Foundation (IWMF), the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and the Multiple Myeloma Research
             Foundation (MMRF) websites.

          2. Investigators who identify patients at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) who do not
             wish to continue their treatment plan at DFCI can approach these patients to
             participate in this study
