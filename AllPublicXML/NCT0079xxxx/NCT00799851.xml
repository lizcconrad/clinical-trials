    <description>VBL was performed with a multiband ligation device (Euroligator System®). The first band was placed at or close to the gastroesophageal junction, with subsequent bands being placed proximally in a slightly spiral pattern. All visible varices within the distal esophagus were treated, with a maximum of 10 bands being placed in each session. There was a 3-week interval between each treatment session. When VBL was technically impossible due to scarring, sclerotherapy with ethanolamine oleate was performed on thin vessels.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>cyanoacrylate injection</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>CI group received intravariceal injections of 0.5 ml of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Histoacryl®) diluted in 0.5 ml of Lipiodol (Lipiodol®). Before injection of the Histoacryl-Lipiodol mixture, the catheter was filled up with 1 ml of Lipiodol. After puncturing the EV, the mixture was injected inside it and followed by injection of 1 ml of distilled water. Finally the catheter was retracted. To minimize the risk of embolism, a maximum of two medium or large vessels, in opposite walls, were treated in each session and not more than 0.5 ml of Histoacryl® was injected into each vessel.
A second injection was performed in any EV that maintained blood flow (medium or large size, blue, depressive at palpation with the catheter), in a bi-weekly interval basis. A chest x-ray was performed to evaluate the location of the Histoacryl-Lipiodol solution. Small vessels were treated with ethanolamine oleate sclerotherapy.</description>
