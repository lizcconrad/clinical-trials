  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this proposed research study is to evaluate the safety of
      intravitreal ranibizumab in combination with intravitreal dexamethasone in comparison to
      intravitreal ranibizumab alone in the treatment of wet ARMD. The addition of the broad
      spectrum anti-inflammatory activity of dexamethasone may augment the anti-VEGF activity of
      ranibizumab by amelioration of inflammation existing in the microenvironment of the choroidal
      neovascularization. While the anti-VEGF agents have proven to be very efficacious in the
      treatment of exudative ARMD, their narrow target and window of activity may limit their
      overall durability of action.

      A prospective, single masked comparative trial using either combination therapy (group 1):
      same day combination therapy with 0.05cc intravitreal dexamethasone injection (10mg/ml vial)
      and a single 0.5 mg intravitreal ranibizumab injection for four consecutive months will be
      compared to monotherapy (group 2): one intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg ranibizumab also
      given for four consecutive months. These treatments will then be followed by PRN treatment
      based on clinical exam, angiographic studies, and OCT evidence of residual subretinal fluid,
      CME, subretinal hemorrhage, or pigment epithelial detachment. Fluorescein angiography and
      fundus photography will be performed at baseline and at the 1, 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up
      visits. Only OCT testing will be performed at all follow-up visits. Both groups will be
      re-evaluated for safety at 12 and 24 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        â€¢ Best Corrected Visual Acuity at 4 meters using ETDRS Charts between 20/32 and 20/400
        (Snellen Equivalent) in the study eye with evidence of neovascular ARMD.

        (Only one eye will be eligible for study. If both eyes are eligible, the one with the
        better visual acuity will be selected for treatment unless, based on medical reasons, the
        investigator deems the other eye to be more appropriate for treatment and study.)

          -  All lesion subtypes will be enrolled with the following criteria Predominantly and
             minimally classic: Angiographic lesion greater than 50% of the total lesion area
             Occult: Lesions must show recent activity progression with respect to vision,
