  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplant is a recognized therapeutic strategy in refractory heart failure. Its
      success is however hampered by severe cancer occurrence and recurrence. The new m-tor
      inhibiting drugs Sirolimus and Everolimus have shown potential for reducing the incidence of
      cancer in animal models. They are potent immunosuppressant, antiproliferative and
      antiangiogenic drugs. This open labelled randomized multicenter study aims at evaluating the
      beneficial antineoplastic effect of Everolimus in 159 heart transplant patients suffering of
      recurrent skin cancer. Primary objective is to demonstrate a reduction in the number of new
      skin cancers. Secondary end point will be time of recurrence, incidence of non skin cancer,
      graft function following switch (including death), renal function evolution following
      calcineurin inhibitors reduction or withdrawal, Everolimus tolerance profile, schemes of
      calcineurin inhibitors reduction management in centers.
