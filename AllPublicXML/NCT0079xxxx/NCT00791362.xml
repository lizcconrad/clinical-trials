      Objective: This study aims to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of a national
      accreditation and improvement programme for general practice, focusing on patients with
      established cardiovascular diseases.

      Design: Cluster randomised trial with a block design. All practices start with the
      accreditation procedure.Intervention group practices are requested to focus their improvement
      plans in the first year on cardiovascular disease. Control group practices are requested to
      focus their improvement plans in the first year on other domains. Measurements at baseline
      are based on the standard audit in the accreditation procedure. Follow-up measurements are
      done 12 months after approval of improvement plans.

      Participants: Primary care physicians in The Netherlands.

      Interventions to be implemented: improvement plans concerning cardiovascular risk management,
      as described by recently updated national multidisciplinary evidence-based NHG / CBO
      guidelines, considering patients with established cardiovascular diseases.

      Implementation strategy: The national programme for accreditation and improvement of general
      practice. This procedure consists of a package of activities, including audit, feedback,
      improvement plans, and follow-up.

      Outcome measures: Primary outcomes are percentages of patients with CVD who have acceptable
      systolic blood pressure and cholesterol levels (quantified according to the indicators in the
      accreditation)and who use aspirin or alternatives. Secondary measures include clinical and
      organisational indicators of quality of cardiovascular care, such as percentages of patients
      with cardiovascular disease whose risk factors were assessed and who received specific
      medication.

      Economic evaluation: Incremental cost effectiveness ratio's are determined of the
      implementation strategy compared to no implementation. The analysis will take a societal
      perspective and a time horizon of the observed period as well as a hypothetical 10 years
      period (using modelling). Uncertainty related to the estimations is examined with sensitivity
      analyses and bootstrapping. The long term economic evaluation is based on Markov modelling.

    <description>The national programme for accreditation and improvement of general practice. This procedure consists of a package of activities, including audit, feedback, improvement plans, and follow-up. It is partly based on new theories on quality improvement, including the use of market forces and pressure for accountability. For the purpose of the study, the intervention group will be requested to focus their improvement plans in the first year on cardiovascular diseases. The control group is requested to focus their improvement plans in the first year on other domains and to provide cardiovascular care as usual.</description>
