    <textblock>
      This will be a phase 2a single-center, randomized, blinded, vehicle-controlled exploratory
      study to assess the activity and safety of CRx-197 in subjects with plaque psoriasis.
      Approximately 20 male or female subjects with chronic plaque type psoriasis, 18 to 70 years
      of age, will be included in this study.

      All subjects with stable psoriatic plaques will receive all of the following treatments each
      in a separate test field, once each day for four weeks under occlusion:

        -  CRx-197 high dose topical cream (0.1% nortriptyline HCl +0.3% loratadine)

        -  CRx-197 low dose topical cream (0.1% nortriptyline HCl + 0.1% loratadine)

        -  0.1% nortriptyline HCl topical cream

        -  0.005% calcipotriol topical cream

        -  Vehicle of CRx-197 topical cream (placebo)
