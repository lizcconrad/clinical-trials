    <measure>Myocardial infarction (MI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>MI was defined as elevated cardiac enzymes (troponin or MB fraction of creatine kinase, CK-MB) more than the upper limit of the normal value with ischemic symptoms or electrocardiography findings indicative of ischemia that was not related to the index procedure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Target vessel revascularization (TVR)</measure>

    <description>TVR was repeat revascularization of the target vessel by PCI or bypass graft surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Target lesion revascularization (TLR)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>TLR was defined as repeat PCI of the lesion within 5 mm of stent deployment or bypass graft surgery of the target vessel.</description>

    <description>Main vessel stenting was performed.
Side branch ballooning and kissing ballooning were done if Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow &lt;3 in the side branch after main vessel stenting in non-left main bifurcation (non-LM) subgroup, and diameter stenosis (DS) &gt;75% in LM subgroup.
Side branch stenting was performed if TIMI flow &lt;3 in the Side branch after ballooning in non-LM subgroup, and DS &gt;50% or dissection in the Side branch after ballooning in LM subgroup.</description>
