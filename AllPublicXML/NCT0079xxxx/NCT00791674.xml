      Lay title: A study of breathing pauses during sleep in patients on long term opiates.

      Sleep apnoea is a term which refers to frequent breathing pauses during sleep. Breathing can
      stop at night due to the upper airway collapsing (Obstructive sleep apnoea)or reduced signals
      from the brain driving breathing (central sleep apnoea). Clinical observation has noticed
      that patients on opiates have an increase in sleep apnoea.

      Hypothesis: This study looks at the relationship of opiates (when used for patients chronic
      pain) and the occurrence of sleep apnoea. It is expected that there will be an increase in
      sleep apnoea (particularly of the central variant) particularly in patients on long term
      opiates.

      The purpose for this study is to test the hypothesis that sleep disordered breathing is more
      prevalent amongst a group of patients on high dose opiates for chronic pain.

      Aims

        1. To define the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in a group of patients on oral
           morphine for chronic pain.

        2. To determine the prevalence of respiratory failure in this cohort of patients. Patients
           on long term opiates (&gt;6 months) from an outpatient pain clinic population on long
           acting morphine formulations &gt; 40 mg/day, Oxycontin 30 mg/day, and Methadone &gt; 20 mg/day
           were prospectively recruited. Home polysomnograms were done on them. During their
           clinical review they have spirometry, arterial blood gases, psychomotor vigilance tests
           done on them.
