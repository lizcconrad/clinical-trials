  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study addresses a problem that face surgeons who perform key-hole surgery to resect the
      submandibular salivary gland. The problem is the narrow space available around that gland.
      This does not allow for a safe operation. The study aims to evaluate a new, two step
      resection technique, that should overcome this difficulty.

      The study included twelve adult patients suffering from chronic submandibular sialadenitis
      and indicated for sialadenectomy. The following exclusion criteria were adopted: Previous
      history of surgery or irradiation to the neck; History of abscess formation in the region;
      Patients having large, hard or fixed submandibular gland and where there was suspicion of
      malignancy. Laboratory work-up and ultrasound of the neck were obtained.All patients had
      video assisted submandibular sialadenectomy, using a &quot;two step resection&quot; technique as
      follows:Step 1: A 15 to 20 mm skin incision was performedThe edges of the wound are protected
      using a rubber cuff. The dissection is done using the harmonic scalpel in one hand and the
      suction spatula in the other hand. The anterior part of the gland is then dissected off the
      mylohyoid muscle. The plane of the dissected anterior pole of the gland is used as a guide.
      This plane is followed all around the gland until the whole superficial part of the gland is
      dissected free. Step 2: The retractors are adjusted to elevate the roof of the cavity created
      by removing the superficial part pf the gland. The scope is inserted into the wound to view
      the deeper part of the operative field. All nearby important structures are now identified
      and protected. The deep part of the gland is dissected and removed

    <description>Step 1: A 15 to 20 mm skin incision is performed. The anterior part of the gland is then dissected off the mylohyoid muscle. The superficial part of the gland is dissected free. Now, the free superficial part of the gland is resected .Step 2: The scope is inserted into the wound to view the deeper part of the gland. The latter is dissected and removed after identifying the tendon of the digastric muscle, the hypoglossal nerve, the lingual nerve and the submandibular duct. The lingual nerve is released from its attachment to the gland. The submandibular duct is ligated using 3/0 vicryl. The deep part of the gland is extracted through the wound. Hemostasis is secured.</description>
