    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that selective vitamin D receptor
      activation reduces left ventricular hypertrophy and ameliorates inflammation and
      atherosclerosis in stage 3 -5 chronic kidney disease.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with
      chronic kidney disease. According to a previous study, only 15.6% of the patients beginning
      dialysis therapy had a normal echocardiogram, with left ventricular hypertrophy, left
      ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction occurring in 40.7%, 28% and 15.6% of
      patients, respectively. In addition, these patients are at an accelerated risk of developing
      atherosclerosis. The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative guideline recently raised
      concerns of a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in chronic kidney disease patients not
      yet requiring dialysis treatment. In addition, very recent data suggested that vitamin D
      deficiency is an important predictor of mortality in end-stage renal disease patients.
      Furthermore, hemodialysis patients treated with paricalcitol, a selective vitamin D receptor
      activator, showed a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular death than those not receiving
      vitamin D therapy. A number of studies also showed positive benefit of vitamin D receptor
      activator treatment on regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in dialysis patients.
      However, there is so far no data in patients with stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease where
      a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and cardiac hypertrophy has been reported.
