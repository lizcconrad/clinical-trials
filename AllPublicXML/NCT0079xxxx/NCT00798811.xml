      Although significant progress has been made in the treatment of brain tumors, the prognosis
      remains dismal in patients with relapsed tumor. The outlook for infants and young children is
      also poor, primarily because of the limited use of radiotherapy, although a recent report
      suggested that vigorous combination chemotherapy alone improved the survival of young
      children without macroscopic metastases at diagnosis. The prognosis is also not satisfactory
      when a large residual tumor remains after surgery or when leptomeningeal seeding is present
      at diagnosis. Given the above situation, we plan to explore the possible efficacy of
      high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue in patients with high-risk embryonal
      tumors, relapsed brain tumors and in infants and young children with brain tumors.High-dose
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue has improved the survival of children with
      high-risk solid tumors. this treatment strategy is based on the hypothesis that a dose
      escalation might improve the survival of children with high-risk solid tumors.Many
      investigators demonstrated that further dose escalation using sequential high-dose
      chemotherapy and autologous stem cell rescue might result in additional improvements in the
      survival of patients with high-risk tumors. As embryonal brain tumors are a chemosensitive
      tumors, a strategy using high-dose chemotherapy might be effective in the treatment of
      high-risk embryonal brain tumors and relapsed brain tumors. In addition, it might defer or
      eliminate irradiation in infants and young children with brain tumors
