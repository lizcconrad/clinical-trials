      This study will test whether darapladib can safely lower the chances of having a
      cardiovascular event (such as a heart attack or stroke) in people with coronary heart
      disease.

      Subjects who qualify for the study will be randomized 1:1 to either darapladib or placebo
      administered in addition to standard therapy. Following the baseline visit, subjects will be
      expected to return for clinic visits at 1 month, 3 months, and every 6 months until the end
      of the study. Average time in the study for an individual subject is expected to be about 3
      years.

    <measure>Number of Participants With First Occurrence of Any Component of the Composite of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (Cardiovascular [CV] Death, Non-fatal Myocardial Infarction [MI] or Non-fatal Stroke) During the Time Period for Follow-up of CV Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the End-of-Treatment visit or the last date on which endpoints were able to be assessed (up to 4.25 years/average of 3.51 years)</time_frame>
    <description>CV death=death due to a CV cause, which included but was not limited to deaths resulting from stroke, arrhythmia, sudden death (witnessed/unwitnessed), MI, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, peripheral arterial disease, or complications of a CV procedure. Deaths not clearly attributable to non-CV causes are considered to be CV deaths. Acute MI=evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia. Prior MI diagnosed post-randomization (e.g., silent MI)=the development of new pathological Q waves with/without symptoms OR imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in the absence of a non-ischemic cause (pre-event imaging data required for verification of new abnormality), OR pathological findings of a healed/healing MI. Stroke=presence of a new focal neurologic deficit thought to be of vascular origin, with signs/symptoms lasting &gt;24 hours or results in death (in &lt;24 hours).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With First Occurrence of Any Event in the Composite of Major Coronary Events (Coronary Heart Disease [CHD] Death, Non-fatal MI, or Urgent Coronary Revascularization [CR] for MI) During the Time Period for Follow-up (FU) of CV Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the End-of-Treatment visit or the last date on which endpoints were able to be assessed (up to 4.25 years/average of 3.51 years)</time_frame>
    <description>CHD death=occurrence of a fatal MI, death caused by documented cardiac arrest, death resulting from heart failure in a participant with known CHD, death from other forms of acute/chronic CHD, unwitnessed death of unknown origin, or sudden death. Acute MI=evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischemia. Prior MI diagnosed post-randomization (e.g.,silent MI)=the development of new pathological Q waves with/without symptoms OR imaging evidence of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract, in the absence of a non-ischemic cause (pre-event imaging data required for verification of new abnormality), OR pathological findings of a healed/healing MI. Urgent CR for MI=ischemic discomfort at rest that prompted CR (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI: any attempt at CR even if not successful] or coronary artery bypass graft) during the same hospitalization or resulted in hospital transfer for the purpose of CR.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With First Occurrence of Any Event in the Composite of Total Coronary Events (CHD Death, Non-fatal MI, Hospitalization for Unstable Angina, or Any Coronary Revascularization Procedure) During Time Period for FU of CV Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until the End-of-Treatment visit or the last date on which endpoints were able to be assessed (up to 4.25 years/average of 3.51 years)</time_frame>
    <description>CHD death, acute MI, and prior MI are defined in the previous secondary endpoint (major coronary events). Hospitalization for unstable angina=one of the following, but not fulfilling the criteria for MI: ischemic discomfort at rest associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) changes leading to hospitalization; ischemic discomfort at rest regardless of ECG changes leading to hospitalization and revascularization during the same admission; ischemic discomfort at rest in hospital associated with ECG changes; ischemic discomfort at rest in hospital without ECG changes resulting in revascularization during the same admission. NOTE: The event was not considered to be unstable angina if, after invasive/non-invasive testing or other diagnostic testing, the discomfort is found not to be caused by myocardial ischemia.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study consisted of a Screening Phase of up to 8 weeks duration, a Treatment Phase, an End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit, and a Follow-up visit scheduled for 35 +/- 7 days after last study drug intake. The median treatment duration was anticipated to be 2.75 years.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During the Screening Phase of the study, participants presenting with chronic Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) were randomized within 8 weeks. In addition to chronic CHD, participants were required to have at least one additional predictor of cardiovascular risk specified in the protocol.</pre_assignment_details>
