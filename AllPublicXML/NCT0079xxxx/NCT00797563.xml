  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of the meter system in the hands of
      subjects and healthcare professionals (HCPs). It also evaluated the product user guides in
      the hands of untrained subjects.

      The study evaluated the performance of the blood glucose meter system (BGMS) compared to a
      laboratory glucose method. Subjects and healthcare professionals tested subject capillary
      blood and healthcare professionals tested subject venous blood. Two meter configurations were
      evaluated. The study evaluated the acceptability of product labeling in enabling subjects to
      perform blood glucose testing with the new meter system and for using meter features.
      Subjects and healthcare professionals provided feedback about the BGMS and its features.

    <time_frame>One hour</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with diabetes and healthcare professionals (HCPs) used a new blood glucose monitoring system (BGMS) with subject capillary blood. HCPs used the new bgms with subject venous blood. All results were compared to a lab glucose method. The BGMS has programmed algorithms to provide results equivalent to either serum/plasma or whole blood glucose methods. Number of results were obtained by combining results from three lots of Contour Blood Glucose strips.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Rated as &lt;=3 (Labeling Comprehension)</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour</time_frame>
    <description>Study staff rated participants on their success at performing BG testing and Autolog feature after reading product labeling. The rating scale was:
Successful
Successful after being referred to user instructions
Successful with verbal assistance or review of part of user instructions (Similar to review of a specific function during a Customer Service call.)
Unsuccessful (Incorrectly performed part of the testing regimen or required intervention by study staff.)</description>
