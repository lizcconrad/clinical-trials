    <textblock>
      In this study, we want to compare two different kinds of artificial ventilation to see if one
      encourages faster weaning from breathing support and if one provides better sleep quality.
      These artificial ventilation types are:

        1. Pressure support ventilation; the standard ventilation that we use for the patients in
           the Respiratory Acute Care Unit. Pressure support ventilation ventilators use constant
           air pressure to assist patients with their breathing.

        2. Proportional assist ventilation; a newer way of helping people with their breathing. The
           air pressure provided by proportional assist ventilation ventilators varies with the
           size of the breath that a person takes.

    The patient population in RACU has changed significantly, we can not find potential subjects to
    recruit. The enrollment rate has reached zero.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Tracheotomized or endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated patients
             transferred or scheduled to be transferred to the RACU.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are weaned from ventilatory support within the first 72 hours of transfer
             to the RACU. Even though these patients had been randomized, they will be excluded.
             They will be considered in the intention to treat analysis but the final outcome
             analysis will be performed after their exclusion.

          -  High spinal cord injury

          -  Immunosuppressed patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy (&lt; 2 months
             after chemotherapy or radiation therapy).

          -  Neuromuscular/ neurological disease of a progressive nature resulting in chronic
             ventilator dependence.

          -  High risk of mortality within 3 months (severe neurological damage and cancer patients
             in terminal stages of the disease).

          -  Patients unable to trigger the ventilator for any reason.

          -  Any patient who is not considered a candidate for weaning from ventilatory support

          -  Patients consented for another interventional study.

          -  Patients requiring more than 30 days to wean once randomized will be excluded. They
             will be considered in the intention to treat analysis but the final outcome analysis
             will be performed after their exclusion.
