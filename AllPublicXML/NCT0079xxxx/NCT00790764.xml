  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present investigation will be a Phase II, single center, placebo-controlled, randomized,
      dose escalation, infusion modality (intracoronary vs transendocardial injection using the
      Cordis Biosense NOGASTAR TM Mapping Catheter with the Biosense MYOSTAR TM left ventricular
      injection catheter) transplantation of an autologous (your own stem cells) combination of
      bone marrow-derived stem cells into myocardium for the treatment of severe coronary ischemia.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the infusion of a combination of stem
      cells obtained from the bone marrow of the same patient will contribute to the formation of
      new blood vessels in patients with symptomatic severe coronary ischemia(CI).

      In this trial we will determine whether the combination stem cell treatment is safe, feasible
      and results in the development of mature stable and/or collateral vessels and improvement of
      cardiac function.

      Coronary Ischemia (CI) is intractable angina due to severe coronary artery disease which can
      seriously decrease blood flow to the heart.

      CI needs a comprehensive treatment since the condition will not improve on its own. The
      overall goal of the treatment is to increase blood flow to the heart and improve symptoms of
      angina.

      The study hypothesis is based on the concept that the process of formation of new blood
      vessels is complex and requires the participation of several types of stem cells and growth
      factors. The lack of any of these components will produce vessels which are immature and
      unable to provide appropriate blood supply to the heart.

      Patients eligible to participate in this study are those suffering from severe blockages of
      the vessels of the heart and are not candidates for percutaneous revascularization or
      surgical procedures.

      Enrolled individuals (60) will be divided in 2 Treatment groups for the infusion of the cell
      /placebo product:

        1. Treatment Group A (30 individuals, including patients and placebo controls) will receive
           the product by intracoronary infusion,

        2. Treatment Group B (30 individuals, including patients and placebo controls) will receive
           the product by transendocardial injections.

           In turn, each Treatment Group will consist of 2 subgroups of individuals that will
           receive the infusion of one of the two doses established of the cell product:

        3. In treatment SubGroup 1, 10 individuals will receive the &quot;low dose&quot; of the cell product
           and 5 individuals will receive the placebo product.

        4. In treatment SubGroup 2, 10 individuals will receive the &quot;high dose&quot; of the cell product
           and 5 individuals will receive the placebo product
