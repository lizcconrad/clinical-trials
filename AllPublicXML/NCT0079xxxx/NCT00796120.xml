  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of trabectedin compared to
      standard doxorubicin in participants with advanced translocation-related sarcomas (cancer of
      connective tissue cells) (TRS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), multicenter (when more than one
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), Phase 3 trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of trabectedin as compared to standard doxorubicin in participants
      with advanced TRS. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either of the 2
      treatment groups, that is, trabectedin or doxorubicin plus ifosfamide group. Participants in
      trabectedin group will receive trabectedin 1.5 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) given as a
      24-hour continuous intravenous infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way
      of a needle) every 3 weeks and in doxorubicin plus ifosfamide group participants will receive
      doxorubicin 60 or 75 mg/m^2 intravenously every 3 weeks followed by ifosfamide 6 to 9 gram
      (g)/m^2 every 3 weeks. Participants in either treatment arm will continue receiving therapy
      in the absence of progressive disease (PD) or intolerable side effects, until the
      participants' consent is withdrawn or the eligibility criteria for continuing treatment are
      no longer fulfilled, or when a concurrent condition precludes continuation of treatment.
      Efficacy will be assessed primarily by evaluating progression-free survival (PFS).
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the trial.

    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks from randomization during the first 9 months and thereafter, every 9 weeks up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS was assessed as median number of days from the date of randomization until the first documented sign of disease progression (increase in disease; radiographic, clinical, or both) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-month Progression - Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants survived for 6 months from the start of study treatment without progression of disease. Progression of the disease was associated with increasing symptoms, including pain from new or progressing lesions. Delay in disease progression generally represents a clinical benefit to the participant.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 weeks during first 9 months of the study and thereafter every 9 weeks up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: Partial Response (PR)=at least 30% reduction in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of all target lesions in reference to the baseline sum LD, Complete Response (CR) =Disappearance of all non-target lesions. Percentage of participants with objective tumor response was determined by the number of participants with PR or CR divided by the total number of response-evaluable participants.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to End of Study (an average of 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of death. For participants who were alive at the time of analysis, overall survival was censored at the last contact date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 months</time_frame>
    <description>The DOR is defined as the time from date of first documentation of response (CR or PR, whichever comes first) to the date of documented PD or death. PR=at least 30% reduction in the sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of all target lesions in reference to the baseline sum LD, CR =Disappearance of all non-target lesions.</description>
