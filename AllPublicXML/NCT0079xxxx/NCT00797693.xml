      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral versus vaginal misoprostol is
      effective in termination of first trimester missed abortion and to compare between two
      different routes.

      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of oral versus vaginal misoprostol prior to surgical
      termination of first trimester missed abortion as cervical priming agent , the difference of
      cervical dilatation immediately prior to operation , the duration of operation and side
      effects between two treatment groups.

      Design: This study was conducted as randomised study.

      Setting: Maternity Teaching Hospital in Hawler/ Kurdistan/ Iraq.

      Population: Over a period of six months from the first of January to the thirtieth of June,
      2008, one hundred women were included in this study. They were cases of first trimester
      abortion (6-12 weeks).

      Method: Patients were randomly selected for the type of treatment they received. The first
      group (oral) were assigned to receive 400 micrograms of misoprostol orally as preoperative
      cervical priming agent, where as the second group (vaginal) were allocated to have treatment
      either with vaginal misoprostol to receive 400 micrograms vaginally.

      Main outcome measure: Oral versus vaginal misoprostol as cervical ripening agent prior to
      termination of first trimester missed abortion.

      Keywords: First trimester, missed abortion, misoprostol, cervical ripening, oral, vaginal.
