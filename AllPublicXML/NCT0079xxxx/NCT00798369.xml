  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 8-week study is designed to determine the target dose of canakinumab (ACZ885) for the
      management of acute flare in gout patients who are contraindicated to Non-Steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and/or colchicine. The efficacy of ACZ885 will be compared to the
      corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide.

    <measure>The Dose of Canakinumab for Treatment of Acute Flares in Gout Patients That Leads to the Same Efficacy as Triamcinolone Acetonide With Respect to Pain Intensity on a 0-100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 24,48 and 72 hours post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mean target dose at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Four models: Emax, Logistic, Linear in log-dose, Linear were selected to describe the potential dose-response curve and hence estimate the target dose of canakinumab using baseline Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Body Mass Index (BMI) as covariates. Target dose was defined as the dose for which the efficacy is equivalent to the efficacy of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg and was identified by assessing the dose response relationship with regards to the pain intensity in the target joint measured on a 0- 100 mm VAS (0= no pain and 100= unbearable pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Change in Pain Intensity in the Target Joint Following Canakinumab Administration Compared to Triamcinolone Acetonide</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,at 72 hrs post-dose and 7 days post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The change in pain intensity from baseline to 72 hours and 7 days post dose as measured on a 0-100 mm Visual Analog Scale(VAS): 0= no pain and 100= severe pain. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group, VAS at baseline and Body mass Index (BMI) at baseline as covariates. Change from baseline = (post-baseline measurement - baseline).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Excellent or Good Response With Regards to the Patient's Global Assessment of Response to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>at 72 hours post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants scored their global assessment of response to treatment using a 5-point Likert scale: Excellent, Good, Acceptable, Slight and Poor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Time to 50% Reduction of Baseline Pain Intensity in the Target Joint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, within 7 days after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The median time in days to at least 50% reduction in Pain intensity from baseline as measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for each treatment group. Participants scored their pain intensity in the target joint on a 0-100 mm VAS, ranging from no pain (0) to unbearable pain (100).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>High Sensitivity C-reactive Protein (hsCRP) at 72 Hours, 7days, 4 Weeks and 8 Weeks Post Dose for Each Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>at 72 hours and 7 days, 4 and 8 weeks post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was determined in serum at all visits (Visits 1-5) in order to identify the presence of inflammation, to determine its severity, and to monitor response to treatment.
ANCOVA with treatment group, protein level at baseline and BMI at baseline as covariates.</description>

    <measure>Serum Amyloid Protein (SAA) Levels at 72 Hours, 7days, 4 Weeks and 8 Weeks Post Dose for Each Treatment Group</measure>

    <description>Serum amyloid A (SAA) were determined in serum at all visits (Visits 1-5) in order to identify the presence of inflammation, to determine its severity, and to monitor response to treatment.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of Rescue Medication Taken for Each Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who had difficulty in tolerating their pain after the 6-hour post-dose pain assessments and during the first 7 study days were allowed to take a maximum of 30 mg prednisolone (or equivalent dose of prednisone [30 mg]) orally once a day for a maximum of 5 days. In addition, participants could use 500 mg acetaminophen (paracetamol) and/or 30 mg codeine as needed during the first 7 study days. A maximum of 1 g/dose or 3 g/day of acetaminophen and 30 mg/dose or 180 mg/day of codeine was allowed during the first 7 days of the study.</description>

        <description>Mean target dose at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Four models: Emax, Logistic, Linear in log-dose, Linear were selected to describe the potential dose-response curve and hence estimate the target dose of canakinumab using baseline Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Body Mass Index (BMI) as covariates. Target dose was defined as the dose for which the efficacy is equivalent to the efficacy of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg and was identified by assessing the dose response relationship with regards to the pain intensity in the target joint measured on a 0- 100 mm VAS (0= no pain and 100= unbearable pain).</description>
