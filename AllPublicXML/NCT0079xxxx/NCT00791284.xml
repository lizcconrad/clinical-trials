    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is 1) to investigate the single-dose pharmacokinetics of immediate
      release (IR) paliperidone, after oral administration, in patients having moderate hepatic
      impairment compared to patients having normal hepatic function, 2) to document the plasma
      protein binding and disposition of the enantiomers of paliperidone, and 3) to evaluate the
      tolerability and safety profile of IR paliperidone in both patient populations.

      This is a single-dose, parallel-group, open-label, single-center, Phase 1 study of immediate
      release (IR) paliperidone in patients having either normal or moderately-impaired hepatic
      function. The groups, which will consist of 10 patients each, will be demographically matched
      with respect to age, weight, sex, and ethnicity. The study will consist of a screening period
      of up to 3 weeks and an open-label, single-dose treatment period (Days 1 through 5). On Day
      1, a single dose of 1 mg Intermediate Release (IR) paliperidone oral solution will be
      administered after a fast of at least 10 hours; patients will continue to fast for 4 hours
      following study drug administration. The 96-hour follow-up will consist of serial sample
      collections of blood and urine for pharmacokinetic analysis and safety and tolerability
      assessments. Patients will remain confined to the study site through the 72-hour
      pharmacokinetics sampling and will consume standard institutional meals while in the study
      site. Patients will be released after the 72-hour sampling, then will return to the study
      site on Day 5 before the 96-hour pharmacokinetics sampling; end-of-study procedures will be
      performed immediately thereafter. Currently, pharmacokinetic data are available after oral IR
      and Extended Release (ER) formulations of paliperidone were administered to healthy patients
      and to patients with schizophrenia who had normal hepatic function. No pharmacokinetic
      information on paliperidone in patients with hepatic impairment has been obtained. The target
      population for paliperidone comprises schizophrenic patients. Because some patients in the
      target population might be hepatically impaired, pharmacokinetic information in this
      population is helpful. This single-dose pharmacokinetic study will collect information in
      patients with normal hepatic function and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment to
      provide clinical dosing information/recommendations for patients with hepatic impairment.
      Safety and tolerability will be monitored. A single dose of 1 mg intermediate release (IR)
      paliperidone oral solution

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with normal hepatic function:Normotensive at screening, with supine (5
             minutes) blood pressure between the range of 95 to 160 mmHg systolic, inclusive, and
             55 to 95 mmHg diastolic, inclusive, demographically comparable to the hepatic
             impairment group with respect to age, weight, sex, and ethnicity and healthy on the
             basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history, ECG, and laboratory results
             of blood biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed within 3 weeks before
             study drug administration. If the results of the biochemistry or hematology tests or
             the urinalysis are not within the laboratory's reference ranges, the patient can be
             included only if the investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically
             significant

          -  Patients with moderate hepatic impairment: Blood pressure controlled and stable on
             antihypertensive agents, stable hepatic disease with laboratory and clinical findings
             that support the diagnosis of hepatic impairment, otherwise healthy on the basis of a
             prestudy physical examination, medical history, ECG, and laboratory results of blood
             biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed within 3 weeks before study drug
             administration. Patients with controlled hypertension and those problems directly
             associated with the primary diagnosis of hepatic impairment may be included. Patients
             with stable, mild, chronic concurrent diseases, such as degenerative joint disease,
             Type II diabetes, or thyroid conditions requiring thyroid replacement therapy or
             surgery, may be included. If the results of the biochemistry or hematology tests or
             the urinalysis are not within the laboratory's references ranges, the patient can be
             included only if the investigator judges that the deviations are not clinically
             significant. Laboratory results related to the patient's underlying condition may be
             outside of the normal ranges. (Serum bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time will be
             assessed individually)

          -  Total score of Child-Pugh's classification will be between 7 and 9, inclusive

          -  Concomitant medications to treat underlying disease states or medical conditions
             related to hepatic insufficiency are allowed. Patients have to be on a stable dose of
             medication and/or treatment regimen 2 months before the study, as well as during the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with normal hepatic function:Has any significant history or presence of
             hepatic disease or has positive serology result for hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg) or anti-hepatitis C virus (as determined by a multi-antigen enzyme
             immunoassay)

          -  At screening, sustained drops in systolic (&gt;20 mmHg) or diastolic (&gt;10 mmHg) blood
             pressure after standing for at least 2 minutes which are not associated with an
             increase in pulse rate of &gt;15 beats per minute

          -  Is taking, or has taken, any prescribed or over-the-counter drug (including vitamins
             and herbal supplements) within 2 weeks before study drug administration (with the
             exception of paracetamol, hormonal contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy)

          -  Patients with moderate hepatic impairment: Has any clinically significant laboratory
             abnormality except those parameters influenced by hepatic impairment, has a score of 3
             or 4 for hepatic encephalopathy as determined by the result of the Number Connection
             Test, has severe ascites and/or pleural effusion, has serology result positive for
             HBsAg, has acute exacerbation of liver disease, as indicated by worsening clinical
             signs of hepatic impairment, or by an increase of more than 50% in total bilirubin or
             prothrombin time in the preceding 3 months (as far as information is available).
