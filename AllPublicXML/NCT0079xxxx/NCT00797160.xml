      The aim of the study is to compare the intubation conditions among propofol and remifentanil
      versus midazolam and remifentanil in premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.
      At the same time, to show the group of drugs that could let the neonates with no residual
      sedation after the use of surfactant (the possibility of the premature neonates to be readily
      extubated after the use of surfactant).

      It has been demonstrated that remifentanil, due to it its very short context-sensitive, has
      an interesting potential for use in premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.
      Indeed, remifentanil allowed an adequate level of sedation and analgesia as well as rapid
      recovery after discontinuation. The aim of the present study was to compares the intubation
      conditions among propofol and remifentanil versus midazolam and remifentanil in premature
      neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.
