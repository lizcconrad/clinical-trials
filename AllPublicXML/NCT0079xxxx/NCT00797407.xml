      The purpose of this study is to determine of creatine will prevent or treat the muscle
      toxicity side effect of statin drug therapy, whose symptoms are aching, cramping, and
      weakness. This is tested in patients who have had this side effect from 3 different statin
      drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle toxicity is the most common limiting side effect of statin therapy. Biochemical
      studies have suggested the presence of intramuscular creatine deficiency in patients with
      muscle toxicity. This is a test of oral creatine supplementation in statin intolerant
      subjects as a method of preventing the onset of this side effect as well as resolving these
      symptoms when present during statin therapy.
