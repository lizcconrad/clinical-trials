  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic Syndrome is a highly prevalent condition that is comprised of several major
      clustering factors that increase the risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Diffuse
      Optical Spectroscopy is a non-invasively measure can show changes in the microvasculature of
      human. Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy measures the optical absorption and scattering properties
      of near-infrared light in tissues such as muscle in order to quantify the absolute
      concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, water, and lipids. It provides
      quantitative and functional information on the microvasculature related to tissue perfusion,
      metabolic changes, and indicators of tissue damage.

      The researchers can use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to monitor changes in the
      microvasculature of patients with Metabolic Syndrome and diabetic mellitus, and patients with
      Diabetic Peripheral and Autonomic Neuropathy, versus non-diseased and predisposed subjects by
      evaluating the changes in oxygen metabolism. The Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy measure the
      changes in the concentration and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in the microvasculature
      under stress, for example, during exercise and in response to changes in breathing habits.
      The sensitivity of Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to tissue hemodynamics provides an impressive
      arena of useful clinical applications..
