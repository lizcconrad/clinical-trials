  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a difference in the ocular signs and
      symptoms of subjects' eyes using Xalatan® 0.005% versus Travatan Z® 0.004% based on the
      outcome of subject assessment and clinical assessment in patients with Ocular Hypertension or
      Glaucoma with mild to moderate dry eye at baseline in accordance with the Oxford Grading
      Scale.

          -  Patients using systemic non-glaucoma medications known to lower IOP may be included,
             if on stable dose &gt;30 days prior to screening visit and agree to maintain the regimen
             throughout the course of the study.

          -  Patients using non-prescription eye drops or prescription topical eye drops for dry
             eye may be included, if on stable dose 30 days prior to screening visit and agree to

          -  Generally good and stable overall health

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterilized or defined
             as one-year post-menopausal) are excluded from participation in the study if they meet
             any one of the following conditions:They are currently pregnant,They have a positive
             result on the urine pregnancy test at the Screening Visit,They intend to become
             pregnant during the study period,They are breast-feeding,or They are not using highly

             investigator if they become pregnant during the study. Should this occur, the
             Investigator shall immediately contact the Sponsor. For non-sexually active females,
             abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of birth control; however, if the
             patient becomes sexually active during the study, she must agree to use adequate birth
             control methods as defined above for the remainder of the study.
