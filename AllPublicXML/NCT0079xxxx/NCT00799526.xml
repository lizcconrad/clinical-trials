      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of human conjunctival
      epithelial autologous cultivated ex vivo for reconstruction of the ocular surface in patients
      with symblepharon.

      10 patients will be included from 16 to 90 years with presence of symblepharon, what have
      been already subjected to proceedings of reconstruction of the ocular surface without success
      and to present conjunctival healthy. In the place of biopsy and after the surgery of the
      patient one will be applied ointment with antibiotic and corticoid to minimize the
      inflammatory effects. The fragments will be transported even it laboratory of Molecular
      Biology of the advanced Centre of Ocular Surface where it will be prosecuted by means of
      technique sterile under laminating flow. The conjunctival epithelias cells will be put on the
      amniotic membrane compartments of the plate of culture where the appropriate ways will be
      added. After 2 weeks the membranes colonized with epithelium conjunctival they will be
      subjected to the coloration and the cloth will be used for the surgery of reconstruction of
      the ocular surface. It will be carried out first us an evaluation ophthalmologic complete
      weekly, 2 months and then fortnightly up to the sixth month post-operative.
