      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the drug temsirolimus given with radiation therapy
      for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temsirolimus has demonstrated anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic activity in multiple
      epithelial cancers, is well-tolerated, has non-overlapping toxicities with radiation, and has
      been shown to potentiate the effects of radiation in vitro. Locally advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer is cured in a minority of patients with concurrent chemoradiation but newer
      agents are needed. In this study temsirolimus will be studied in combination with radiation
      in a phase I setting to establish safety.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC.

          -  Patients must have an indication for thoracic radiation.

          -  Because all patients will be receiving radiation therapy to a thoracic mass, they must
             have radiographically measurable disease to participate.

          -  Patients may not be candidates for definitive chemoradiation with curative intent.

          -  Prior treatment of lung cancer (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery) are
             allowed if completed at least 4 weeks prior and if all treatment related toxicities
             are resolved.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 12 weeks.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin &lt; 1.5

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above
                  institutional normal

          -  The effects of temsirolimus on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and
             men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
             control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior treatment with temsirolimus.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases. Known brain metastases are allowed if
             asymptomatic and previously treated.

          -  Patients may not be receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs; e.g.,
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) nor any other CYP3A4 inducer such as rifampin
             or St. John's wort, as these may decrease temsirolimus levels. A partial list of
             agents which interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) is found in Appendix B. Use of
             agents that potently inhibit CYP3A (and hence may raise temsirolimus levels), such as
             ketoconazole, is discouraged, but not specifically prohibited. Temsirolimus can
             inhibit CYP2D6, and may decrease metabolism (and increase drug levels) of drugs that
             are substrates for CYP2D6, such as codeine. The appropriateness of use of such agents
             is left to physician discretion. A list of drugs that may have potential interactions
             with CYP2D6 is found in Appendix B. If there is any doubt about eligibility based on
             concomitant medication, the Principal Investigator should be contacted. All
             concomitant medications must be recorded.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to macrolide antibiotics (such as
             erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin).

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Known HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. In addition, these patients
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive
             therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients having received prior thoracic radiation therapy directed to the tumor volume
             to be treated with radiotherapy on this protocol.
