  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 250,000 people worldwide are currently being treated with an insulin pump. This
      number is growing dramatically as these devices become smaller and more user-friendly.
      Insulin pumps allow for tight metabolic control and lifestyle flexibility while minimizing
      the number of hypoglycemic events.

      The NiliMedix ADI Insulin Pump is an ambulatory, battery operated, rate programmable micro-
      infusion pump, designed for continuous delivery of insulin. A custom reservoir is driven by
      the pressure of insulin within it to deliver preset basal profiles and patient programmed
      bolus of insulin through custom infusion sets, into subcutaneous tissue.

      This type of device requires extensive user interaction and education in order to ensure its
      safety. This study was designed to test the independent home-use of the NiliMedix ADI Insulin
      Pump, and to evaluate user's satisfaction.
