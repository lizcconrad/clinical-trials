      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administration of a dendritic cell
      vaccine is a safe and effective treatment for HIV-1 patients. This will be a phase I,
      single-center, study in HIV infected patients. The primary objective is to evaluate safety of
      the vaccination schedule (from apheresis procedure to week 24) at week 24 and safety of the
      Analytical Treatment Interruption (ATI; from week 24 to week 48) at week 48 in HIV-1 infected
      patients who have been receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 months with HIV-1 RNA
      ≤50 copies/mL and CD4+ T cell counts &gt;500/mm3 at entry in the trial and who received, in
      addition to anti-retroviral therapy for 24 weeks, vaccination with ex vivo generated
      interferon-alpha dendritic cells loaded with HIV-1 lipopeptides and activated with
      lipopolysaccharide (BIIR/ANRS-HIVax-001, the DC vaccine product).

    <description>Biological/Vaccine: Experimental: Dendritic Cell Vaccine Patients will receive 4 doses of the vaccine at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12. The vaccine will be injected subcutaneously, in 3 separate injection sites in the upper and lower extremities.
At week 24, patients will have HAART treatment interrupted. The HAART treatment will be resumed at week 48 or earlier at any time point if one of the following occur:
two consecutive measurements of CD4+ T cell count below 350x10e6 cells/L and/or 25% of total lymphocytes within at least a 2 weeks
an opportunistic infection
a CDC class C-defining event (defined in appendix 2)
a serious non-AIDS defining event.
Patients will have follow-up visits on weeks: 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ≥ 18 years old

          2. written informed consent

          3. HIV1 infection documented by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by Western Blot
             at anytime prior to study entry

          4. on treatment with a combination of antiviral drugs (HAART) for at least 12 months, and
             stable on treatment for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. HAART is defined as an
             antiretroviral regimen consisting of at least three registered antiretroviral drugs
             (other than 3 Nucs only and low dose ritonavir used for boosting other protease
             inhibitors does not count as one of these three antiretroviral agents)

          5. CD4+ T cell counts &gt; 500 cells/mm3 on at least two consecutive measurements (including
             the screening value) within the previous 6 months prior to enrollment (occasional CD4
             cell counts ranging between 450-500 cells/mm3 is permitted)

          6. nadir CD4+ T cell counts &gt; 300 cells/mm3 prior HAART

          7. plasma HIV-RNA ≤ 50 copies/mL on at least two consecutive measurements (including the
             screening value) within the previous 3 months prior to enrollment (occasional so
             called 'blips' up to 200 copies/mL are permitted)

          6. corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents &lt;12 weeks before beginning the trial

          7. active asthma and/or on treatment for asthma,

          8. any history of malignancy (except basal carcinoma of the skin) including any
             hematologic malignancy or AIDS defining malignancy, such as lymphoproliferative
             disorder or Kaposi's sarcoma. Patients with Kaposi's sarcoma limited to the skin that
             disappeared while on HAART therapy, and without requiring any other systemic therapy,
             1 year prior to study entry will be eligible to participate

          9. angina pectoris or with congestive heart failure, with auto-immune disease, or
             evolutive pulmonary disease, or organ failure

         10. active infections including viral hepatitis
