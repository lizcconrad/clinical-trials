  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to determine whether an intravenous dose of dimenhydrinate
      (also known as Gravol), given before the induction of spinal anesthesia, will decrease the
      incidence of intraoperative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing Cesarean delivery.

      This medication is commonly given during and after the surgery if required, but it is not
      known whether a preventative dose will decrease the overall incidence of these side effects.

    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting remain one of the most common complications of Cesarean delivery. The
      results of this study will show whether or not we can improve our present anesthesia regimen,
      and improve the satisfaction of patients undergoing Cesarean deliveries, by reducing the
      incidence of nausea and vomiting. Our current practice is not to use any medication for
      preventing nausea and vomiting unless required. However, nausea and vomiting come quite fast
      and unexpectedly during the operation, and most of the time the medication we give does not
      work fast enough. We are planning to study the anti-nausea medication dimenhydrinate
      (commonly known as Gravol), which has been safely and widely used during pregnancy, labour
      and Cesarean deliveries, hoping that its use will decrease the incidence of this unpleasant
      occurrence.
