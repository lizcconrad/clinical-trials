  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is prevalent in the United States, with approximately 230,110 new cases and
      29,900 deaths in 2004. Approximately 30% of new cases will be clinical stage T3 when they are
      diagnosed. This is a stage in which there is high probability that the cancer has spread
      beyond the prostate gland itself, making it much more difficult to treat. In these cases,
      when surgery is done by itself and the prostate is removed, it is still very likely that some
      cancer that has spread beyond the prostate remains and will get worse. Radiation applied to
      the prostate also does not work well on tumors that have spread beyond the prostate. Even
      surgery and radiation combined have not eliminated the problems caused by prostate cancer
      that has spread into the tissue outside the prostate itself.

      New treatments are needed to deal with prostate cancer at this more serious stage. Study
      doctors believe that it might be possible to shrink the prostate cancer using a new drug
      called SUO11248 or Sunitinib. After the patients take the drug, study doctors believe the
      cancer will shrink back to within the prostate, and they can then surgically remove the
      prostate and all the cancer. Patients on this study also will be given increasing doses of
      Sunitinib to find out how much of the drug can be given safely.
