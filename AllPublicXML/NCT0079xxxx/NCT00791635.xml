  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn if certain characteristics of gynecological cancer can
      help researchers predict how well a patient recovers from pelvic exenteration surgery.
      Researchers will compare the types of surgery completed and procedures used to find out which
      are most effective and safe. Researchers will also study how the surgery affected your
      quality of life.

      Prospective Study Procedures:

      Study Procedures:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a series of
      questionnaires at specific times. The questionnaires ask questions about how you feel, what
      you are able to do, depression, coping, social support, sexual function, and your body image.
      There are 11 questionnaires in total, but not all will be filled out on each day.

      You will complete questionnaires at the following times:

        -  You will complete 7 questionnaires before surgery. They will take about 40 minutes to
           complete.

        -  You will complete 4 questionnaires about 4-6 weeks after surgery. They will take about
           25 minutes to complete.

        -  You will complete 8 questionnaires about 6 months after surgery. They will take about 45
           minutes to complete.

        -  You will complete 8 questionnaires at 1, 2, 5 and 10 years after surgery. They will take
           about 50 minutes to complete each time.

        -  You will complete 2 questionnaires at 3 and 4 years after surgery. They will take about
           10 minutes to complete each time.

        -  If you have cervical cancer, you will be asked to complete 1 additional questionnaire
           during each of these visits.

      If you are being followed at MD Anderson, you can fill out the questionnaires at your
      follow-up visits. If you do not have time to fill out the questionnaires during your visits
      or you are being followed at another hospital you may return the questionnaire by mail in a
      pre-stamped envelope we will send to you with the questionnaires. These questionnaires may
      also be answered over the phone.

      If you complete the surgery, information on complications and/or problems that you may
      experience in the first 60 days after surgery, and how you are doing after you have your
      standard follow up visits every 3 months for the first 2 years and then every 6 months for
      the next 3 years will be collected from your medical records.

      Length of Study:

      If you are unable to have surgery, you will be taken off study. If you are able to complete
      the surgery, you will remain on study for up to 10 years after surgery.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 200 patients will take part in this study. Up to 199 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Retrospective Study Procedures:

      Study Procedures:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a series of
      questionnaires. There are 11 questionnaires in total, the type and number of questionnaires
      depend on how long after surgery you enroll in this study and if you have cervical or other
      gynecological cancer. The questionnaires ask questions about how you feel, what you are able
      to do, depression, coping, social support, sexual function, and your body image.

      If you are being followed at MD Anderson, you can fill out the questionnaires at your
      follow-up visits. If you do not have time to fill out the questionnaires during your visits
      or you are being followed at another hospital you may return the questionnaire by mail in a
      pre-stamped envelope we will send to you with the questionnaires. These questionnaires may
      also be answered over the phone.

      Information on complications and/or problems that you may experience in the first 60 days
      after surgery, how you are doing after you have your standard follow up visits every 3 months
      for the first 2 years and then every 6 months for the next 3 years will be collected from
      your medical records.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain on study for up to 10 years after your surgery.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 200 patients will take part in this study. Up to 199 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
