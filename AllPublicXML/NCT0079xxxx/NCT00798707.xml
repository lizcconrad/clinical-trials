    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the antidepressant efficacy and safety of two
      doses of DVS SR (25 and 50 mg/day) in the treatment of adults with Major Depressive Disorder.
      The study will also assess changes in sexual function and general and functional quality of
      life outcomes.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAM-D17 Total Score at the Final On-therapy (FOT)Evaluation (Week 8 or ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (or ET)</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D17: a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Items are scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), with 0=none/absent and 4=most severe, for a maximum total score of 50.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Categorical Scores on CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) at FOT Evaluation (Week 8 or ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 (or ET)</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I: 7-point clinician rated scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Improvement is defined as a score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), or 3 (minimally improved) on the scale. Higher score = more affected.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean CGI-S Score at FOT Evaluation (Week 8 or ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (or ET)</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S: 7-point clinician rated scale to assess severity of participant's current illness state; range: 1 (normal - not ill at all) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). Higher score = more affected.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in MADRS Total Score at FOT Evaluation (Week 8 or ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (or ET)</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS measures the overall severity of depressive symptoms. The MADRS has a 10-item checklist. Items are rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAM-D6 Total Score at FOT Evaluation (Week 8 or ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 (or ET)</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D6: a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 6 items characteristically associated with major depression and is a subset of HAM-D17. HAM-D6 score ranges from 0-22. The scale uses HAM-D17 items: 1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and 13. Item 13 is scored 0-2 and all others are scored 0-4.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Response on the HAM-D17 at FOT Evaluation (Week 8 or ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 (or ET)</time_frame>
    <description>A HAM-D17 responder was defined as a participant with a 50% or greater decrease from baseline in HAM-D17 score. HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Individual items are scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), with 0=none/absent and 4=most severe, for a maximum total score of 50.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants in Remission Based on the HAM-D17 at FOT Evaluation (Week 8 or ET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 (or ET)</time_frame>
    <description>Remission was defined as a HAM-D17 score of less than or equal to 7. HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Individual items are scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), with 0=none/absent and 4=most severe, for a maximum total score of 50.</description>

        <description>Relationship of demographic variables (age, gender, food, race, creatinine, aspartate aminotransaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin and concomitant medications) were examined by fitting measured DVS plasma concentrations to a 1 compartment model with first order absorption. Demographic variables were examined for clearance (CL/F), volume of distribution (V/F), Steady Area under Curve (AUC) using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Final parameter estimates for demographic factors effecting CL/F, V/F and AUC were determined.</description>

          <description>Relationship of demographic variables (age, gender, food, race, creatinine, aspartate aminotransaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin and concomitant medications) were examined by fitting measured DVS plasma concentrations to a 1 compartment model with first order absorption. Demographic variables were examined for clearance (CL/F), volume of distribution (V/F), Steady Area under Curve (AUC) using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Final parameter estimates for demographic factors effecting CL/F, V/F and AUC were determined.</description>
          <population>PK population; data was insufficient examine the effect of demographic variables on the PK of desvenlafaxine. Parameter values were calculated for variables altering CL/F, AUC and V/F. Population parameters from nonlinear mixed effects modeling were not summarized as descriptive statistics.</population>
