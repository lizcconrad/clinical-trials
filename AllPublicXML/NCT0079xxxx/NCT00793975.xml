      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of the anti-VEGFR-2 monoclonal antibody IMC-1121B administered weekly in patients with
      advanced solid tumors who have not responded to standard therapy or for whom no standard
      therapy is available.

    <description>All patients will receive intravenous infusions of IMC-1121B with the dose depending on which cohort they are enrolled into. A minimum of three patients will be enrolled in each cohort.
A completed patient will be either a patient who completes the 4-week treatment cycle and 2-week observation period (for a total of 6 weeks), or a patient who discontinues therapy for an IMC-1121B-related toxicity. Toxicity data for each cohort will be reviewed prior to dose escalation.
When all patients complete a cohort, dose escalation to the next cohort will occur.</description>
