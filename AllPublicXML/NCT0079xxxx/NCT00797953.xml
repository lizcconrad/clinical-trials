      The purpose of this study is to determine the anti-angina effect and dose response of T89, a
      2-herb botanical drug product, in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris in the United
      States.

      T89 is a modernized and industrialized version of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine. T89
      was approved for marketing as a drug, for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris due
      to coronary heart disease, by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China in 1993.
      There were more than 2 billion doses have been prescribed or used, in about 10,000,000
      subjects, in short or long-term administration worldwide.

      The product is also marketed, as a drug, in Russia, South Korea, Mongolia, Singapore,
      Vietnam, and South Africa. The current study is to determine the anti-angina effect and dose
      response of T89 in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris in the United States.

      T89 consists of Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, RSM) and Sanqi (Radix Notoginseng, RN)
      as active constitutes, and using Borneol as transporting enhancer.
