  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study assessing electrophysiologic testing of the retina with
      Electoretinogram (ERG) /Electrooculogram (EOG) tests in patients with exudative age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD). The standard FDA-approved treatment for wet AMD is ranibizumab
      (Lucentis). This study focuses on the ERG and EOG tests to evaluate retinal responses to
      ranibizumab treatment in AMD.
