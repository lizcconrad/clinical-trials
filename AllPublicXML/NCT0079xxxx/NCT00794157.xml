  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to provide pivotal confirmation of efficacy and safety data for 2
      doses of indacaterol (150 and 300 µg once daily [od]) in patients with moderate to severe
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Data from this study will be used for the
      registration of indacaterol in Japan.

    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose at the end of treatment. The analysis included baseline FEV1, FEV1 pre-dose and 30 minutes post-dose of salbutamol during screening, and FEV1 pre-dose and 60 minutes post-dose of ipratropium during screening as covariates.</description>
