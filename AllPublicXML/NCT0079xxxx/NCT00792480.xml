  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an organized, consistent program of dietary and
      lifestyle counseling will prevent excessive gestational weight gain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive gestational weight gain is common with about one third of women gaining more weight
      in pregnancy than is recommended. Unfortunately, the prevalence of excessive gestational
      weight gain is increasing. Gestational weight gain greater than that recommended by the
      Institute of Medicine (IOM) is associated with increased risk of gestational complications
      (hypertension, diabetes, and preeclampsia), infant macrosomia, and complications in delivery
      including increased risk of cesarean delivery. Currently, there is no evidence-based prenatal
      counseling protocol available to prevent excessive gestational weight gain. We hypothesize
      that consistent counseling on appropriate pregnancy diet, weight gain, and the potential
      complications of excessive gestational weight gain will result in fewer women gaining above
      the IOM recommendations.

    <description>The routine care group took part in an initial physical exam and history, routine labs, and routine visits per American College of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (ACOG) standards. The only counseling on diet and exercise during pregnancy was that included in our standard prenatal booklet &quot;What to do When You're Having a Baby&quot; by Gloria Mayer (Institute for Health Advancement, 2003, La Habra, CA). At each routine obstetric appointment, the participant's weight was measured recorded in the medical chart. The healthcare provider did not counsel the participant regarding any changes in diet or lifestyle.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will undergo a complete history and physical with attention to prepregnancy weight, current weight, height, and BMI. At the initial visit, they will meet with a registered dietician to receive a standardized counseling session, including information on pregnancy-specific dietary and lifestyle choices. The patient will be instructed to engage in moderate intensity exercise at least 3 times per week and preferably 5 times per week. They will also receive information on the appropriate weight gain during pregnancy using the IOM guidelines. Each subject will meet with the dietician only at the time of enrollment.
At each routine obstetric appointment, the participant's weight will be measured and charted on an IOM Gestational Weight Gain Grid in front of the participant. The healthcare provider will inform the participant if her weight gain was at the appropriate level and counsel her accordingly regarding increasing or decreasing her intake and exercise.</description>
