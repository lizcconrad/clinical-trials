  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Health Behaviors in School-age Children (HBSC) study is a consortium of investigators
      from 40 predominantly European and North American countries who conduct a common survey of
      early adolescent health behaviors every 4 years. The survey gathers information about
      nutrition, dieting practices, physical activity, injuries, violence, relationships with
      family and friends, perceptions of school as a supportive environment, alcohol and tobacco
      use and drug use among adolescents, and about the communities in which students live. The
      U.S. sponsors of the survey are the National Institutes of Health and the Health Resources
      and Services Administration. This is the fourth survey done in the United States.

      The objectives of the international HBSC study are:

        -  To assess the prevalence of early adolescent health behaviors

        -  To identify psychosocial factors associated with adolescent behaviors

        -  To provide an opportunity for analyses of cross-national comparisons

        -  To provide an opportunity for analyses of trends in the U.S. and cross-nationally

      In addition to the above, the survey includes additional questions designed to provide
      information about areas of specific national interest, including the following:

        -  To assess the association of school, family, peers, and other environmental factors on
           health behavior and health status

        -  To assess the prevalence and identify factors associated with obesity, diet and physical
           activity

        -  To assess the prevalence and identify factors associated with bullying and risk
           behaviors.

      This is the fourth U.S. administration of the HBSC survey, previously administered in
      1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006.

      About 16,000 students in grades 5 thorough 10 at randomly selected public and private schools
      across the United States complete a 30- 40-minute survey. The questionnaires are anonymous;
      students are instructed not to put their name on the survey. When they finish the survey,
      they place it in an envelope and seal it. The envelopes are then put in a box. Reports do not
      include the names of participating counties, cities, school districts, schools, or students.

      The information collected from U.S. school children is compared with similar information
      collected from school children in 40 other countries. The survey is used to help set national
      priorities for school and youth programs, as well as to monitor the progress of these
      programs.

      The Health Behaviors in School-age Children (HBSC) survey is the only international survey of
      its type that includes a national survey of adolescent health behavior in the U.S. The U.S.
      HBSC complements the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the Monitoring the Future surveys
      of older adolescents. The aims of the survey are to assess the prevalence of health behaviors
      and identify contextual factors associated with them in a national probability sample of 6th
      to 10th grade students, allowing for trend analyses and cross-national comparisons among the
      40 countries involved in the quadrennial international HBSC surveys. This would be the fourth
      U.S. administration of the HBSC survey, previously administered in 1997/1998, 2001/2002, and
      2005/2006. Because core survey items have remained consistent both nationally and
      internationally since 2001, the 2009/2010 survey would provide essential data for examining
      national and international trends.
