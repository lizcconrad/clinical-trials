  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves use of a device called an endomicroscope to obtain high resolution images
      of microscopic structures during robot-assisted prostate cancer surgery. This feasibility
      study is largely descriptive, and will use endomicroscopy to document the cellular and
      architectural appearance of tissue during minimally invasive prostate surgery for later
      comparison with features seen upon conventional histopathological examination of biopsies or
      resection specimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate surgery requires meticulous dissection around nerves and associated structures such
      as the bladder, seminal vesicles and vas deferens. Nerve damage during prostatectomy can
      result in undesirable outcomes such as impotence and urinary incontinence. Robot assisted
      minimally invasive prostatectomy offers enhanced visualisation of the surgical field.
      Superior clinical outcomes in terms of length of hospital stay, blood loss, and oncologic
      margins compared with open surgery are reported. Confocal endomicroscopy provides high
      resolution subsurface cellular imaging in real time and is already in clinical use in
      gastroenterology and under investigation in other surgical applications. A potential role
      exists for confocal endomicroscopy to enhance microscopic nerve identification
      intra-operatively and guide surgical decision making during robot-assisted prostatectomy.
