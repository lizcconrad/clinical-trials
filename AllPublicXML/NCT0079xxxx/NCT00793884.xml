  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latinos represent the largest minority group in the United States with a population of 35
      million or 12.5%. National surveys indicate that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 1.9
      times higher in Latinos than non-whites, and that approximately 24% percent of Latinos over
      the age of 45 years have diabetes. In Georgia, Latinos make up approximately 6.5% of the
      population. During 1990 and 2000, the prevalence of diabetes in Fulton and Dekalb counties,
      two of the most populated areas in Georgia and the Atlanta metropolitan area increased by
      30%. Language and cultural barriers represent the two most important obstacles in educating
      and improving the care of Latino patients with diabetes. Less than 5% of physicians, 2% of
      nurses, and 2.5% of dentists in the US speak Spanish.

      The Emory Latino Diabetes education program has been in existence since December 2005. Our
      program aims to deliver diabetes education in Spanish to the underserved Latino community in
      Metro Atlanta. Program participants attend an initial 2.5hr diabetes education class in
      Spanish. The class curriculum follows the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE)
      seven self-care behaviors: healthy eating, being active, monitoring, medication use,
      problem-solving and healthy coping. Participants are invited to return to a follow-up session
      within 6 months. Follow-sessions are held in the late afternoon. These sessions are
      discussion-based and include an activity such as salsa lessons and cooking demonstrations.

      We would like to obtain IRB approval to analyze and publish that data we collect during our
      educational sessions. We would like to collect retrospective data from past participants in
      the program (for which we request a waiver of informed consent and HIPAA authorization), and
      we would like to consent current and future participants to use their data.

      Participants complete a questionnaire which assesses behaviors and social and demographic
      characteristics of the Latino community we serve. In order to track patients outcomes, at the
      beginning of each class we also measure A1C, blood pressure, weight, BMI and waist
      circumference.

      Diabetes education classes and follow-up sessions are offered at Grady Memorial Hospital
      (Diabetes Clinic, International Medical Center), Grady North Dekalb Clinic (Chamblee), and
      North Fulton Regional Hospital.
