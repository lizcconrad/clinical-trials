    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine the incidence of osteoporosis in the
      investigators' population of HIV-infected patients and to assess the efficacy and security of
      zoledronic acid, whose efficacy in post-menopausal women with high fracture risk treatment
      and in Paget's disease treatment has already been demonstrated.

    <textblock>
      The lower bone mineral density that has been described in patients with HIV-infection has not
      meant an increase of long term complications. Nevertheless, it could involve an increase if
      the associated co-morbidity in the future, taking in care that in general population
      osteoporosis increases 4 times the pathologic fracture risk. That is why it is necessary to
      know the real prevalence of osteoporosis in this population of patients so the real
      dimensions of the problems can be defined.

      This project wills to determine the incidence of osteoporosis in our population of
      HIV-infected patients and to assess the efficacy and security of zoledronic acid. If the
      annual use of endovenous zoledronic acid obtains equivalent results to those obtained with
      oral and weekly alendronate in other studies with the same population, its use would be
      justified because of its posology benefits. The annual administration can improve compliance
      in patients who are receiving a big quantity of drugs, as HIV-infected patients do, and who
      probably have to be treated for life. Moreover, its elimination is renal so there is absence
      of interactions with antiretroviral drugs what makes of zoledronic acid a very promising
      alternative. Finally, there is no risk of digestive intolerance because of its parenteral
      administration and it has a better posology than oral bisphosphonates.
