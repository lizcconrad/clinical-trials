  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if the study medication, CONCERTA (methylphenidate
      HCl), is safe and effective in improving academic performance and behavior in children with
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) when compared to placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) is safe and effective in improving
      academic performance and behavior in children with ADHD when compared to placebo as
      demonstrated using specified study measures. This is a double-blind (neither participant nor
      investigator knows the name of the assigned study drug), randomized (study drug assigned by
      chance), placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluating the academic, behavioral and
      cognitive effects of CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) on older children with ADHD This means
      that all eligible children will receive treatment with methylphenidate HCl throughout the
      study (the titration and assessment periods) and inactive pill (placebo) on 1 of the 2
      laboratory classroom days. On the other laboratory classroom day they will receive their
      regular dose of CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl). The primary efficacy variable in this study
      is the Permanent Product Math Test (PERMP) attempted score. Secondary Measures include: SKAMP
      (Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham), tests of inattention, reading fluency and
      comprehension, and memory. Assessments will be completed during each of the laboratory
      assessment days (12.5 hours). Participants will be assessed for adverse events throughout the
      study. Patients will initiate treatment with oral CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) 18 mg at
      baseline and continue morning dosing with increases every 3 to 7 days until an optimal dose
      is achieved, up to the maximum of 54 mg/day. Eligible patients will remain in the study for a
      maximum of 8 weeks.

    <measure>Hour 4 Permanent Product Math Test Attempted Score (PERMP-Attempted)</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 4 of the Double-Blind Assessment Period Lab School Day</time_frame>
    <description>PERMP (range: 0, 400) is a measure of academic productivity. These seatwork math tasks provide an objective measure of attention and accuracy in calculations. The level of difficulty is established on a screening math pretest. The subsequent laboratory school day assessments employed a series of 10-minute math tests (5 pages of 80 math problem each for a total of 400 problems available). Children were graded on the number of attempted problems. A higher number of problems attempted was indicative of greater attention to detail (higher score is preferable.)</description>

    <measure>Hour 4 Swanson, Kotkin, Alger, M-Flynn and Pelham Scale for Deportment (SKAMP-Deportment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 4 of the Lab School Day During the Double-Blind Assessment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The SKAMP scale measures the manifestations of ADHD using an independent observer (teacher) rating of children impairment in classroom behavior. The SKAMP-Deportment (SKAMP-D) (range: 0,36) is a sum of ratings on 6 deportment items (interacting with other children, interacting with adults, remaining quiet, staying seated, complying with the teacher's directions, and following the classroom rules). Each item was rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal, 6=maximum impairment), with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Hour 4 of the Lab School Day During the Double-Blind Assessment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The SKAMP scale measures the manifestations of ADHD using an independent observer (teacher) rating of child impairment in classroom behavior. A composite score (range: 0, 78) for the SKAMP variable (13 items total) was obtained by summing the SKAMP-D and SKAMP-A subscale scores. A lower score was preferable, as a higher score represented greater behavioral impairment.</description>

        <title>Hour 4 Permanent Product Math Test Attempted Score (PERMP-Attempted)</title>
        <description>PERMP (range: 0, 400) is a measure of academic productivity. These seatwork math tasks provide an objective measure of attention and accuracy in calculations. The level of difficulty is established on a screening math pretest. The subsequent laboratory school day assessments employed a series of 10-minute math tests (5 pages of 80 math problem each for a total of 400 problems available). Children were graded on the number of attempted problems. A higher number of problems attempted was indicative of greater attention to detail (higher score is preferable.)</description>

        <title>Hour 4 Permanent Product Math Test Correct Score (PERMP-Correct)</title>
        <description>PERMP (range: 0, 400) is a measure of academic productivity. These seatwork math tasks provide an objective measure of attention and accuracy in calculations. The level of difficulty is established on a screening math pretest. The subsequent laboratory school day assessments employed a series of 10-minute math tests (5 pages of 80 math problem each for a total of 400 problems available). Children were graded on the number of correct problems. A higher number of problems correct, of those attempted, was indicative of greater accuracy.</description>

        <description>The SKAMP scale measures the manifestations of ADHD using an independent observer (teacher) rating of children impairment in classroom behavior. The SKAMP-Deportment (SKAMP-D) (range: 0,36) is a sum of ratings on 6 deportment items (interacting with other children, interacting with adults, remaining quiet, staying seated, complying with the teacher’s directions, and following the classroom rules). Each item was rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal, 6=maximum impairment), with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Hour 5.5 Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) ADHD Score</title>
        <description>The TOVA is a computerized, visual continuous performance test which provides measures of attention. The stimulus, presented for 100 milliseconds (ms) at the rate of 30 per minute, is a computer-presented square containing a square hole near the top (target) or bottom (non-target) edge. The first half of the TOVA requires that the child sustain attention while the second half requires inhibition of response to a non-target (observed range: -15.2, 5.2). An ADHD score of less than -1.80 is suggestive of ADHD.</description>

        <title>Hour 5.5 Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning (WRAML-2) Finger Windows Forwards</title>
        <description>WRAML-2 (range: 0, 28) is designed to evaluate a child’s ability to learn and to memorize information, consists of 9 subtests from which 4 summary indexes can be calculated: verbal memory index, visual memory index, learning index, and general memory index. During this test the investigator pointed to a longer and longer series of windows on a card at the rate of 1 location per second, and then the child was asked to reproduce the sequence exactly. One point was given for each correctly recalled sequence, and the test was discontinued after 3 consecutive errors.</description>

        <description>The TOVA is a computerized, visual continuous performance test which provides measures of attention. The stimulus, presented for 100 milliseconds (ms) at the rate of 30 per minute, is a computer-presented square containing a square hole near the top (target) or bottom (non-target) edge. The first half of the TOVA requires that the child sustain attention while the second half requires inhibition of response to a non-target. Responses to non-targets. Higher score is preferable (observed range: -82.4, 128.9).</description>

        <description>Each child individually was given a sequence of numbers with the sequence becoming progressively longer. The child was then asked to repeat the digits in the same sequence, either forwards or backwards. Each sequence length was attempted twice. The test was complete after failure on both trials of any sequence length. One point was awarded if the participant passed only 1 trial of a sequence length. Zero points were given if the participant failed both trials. The maximum raw scores were 16 forwards and 14 backwards.

        <description>The THS-R is a standardized, untimed assessment designed to evaluate neurosensory integration manifested in manuscript and cursive writing. The test includes the 10 subtests: writing from memory the upper- and lower-case letters of the alphabet in order, writing from dictation the upper and lower-case letters of the alphabet out of order, single digit-numbers out of order, selected words, and copying selected letters, words, and sentences. Each subtest was scored from zero (poorly formed letters) to 3 (perfectly formed letters). A higher score was preferable (observed range: 0, 118).</description>

        <description>Each child individually was given a sequence of numbers with the sequence becoming progressively longer. The child was then asked to repeat the digits in the same sequence, either forwards or backwards. Each sequence length was attempted twice. The test was complete after failure on both trials of any sequence length. One point was awarded if the participant passed only 1 trial of a sequence length. Zero points were given if the participant failed both trials. The maximum raw scores were 16 forwards and 14 backwards.

        <description>This task, presented once during a laboratory school day, was designed to index “attention to detail” by determining how many grammatical mistakes each child could identify and circle in a brief paragraph. The errors were not difficult to identify and were designed to show attention to task, not comprehension. A higher number of errors identified, of those possible, was indicative of better attention - identification of grammatical errors (range: 0, 1 represents correct responses divided by the number of possible responses).</description>

          <title>Hour 3.0 Grammar Task</title>
          <description>This task, presented once during a laboratory school day, was designed to index “attention to detail” by determining how many grammatical mistakes each child could identify and circle in a brief paragraph. The errors were not difficult to identify and were designed to show attention to task, not comprehension. A higher number of errors identified, of those possible, was indicative of better attention - identification of grammatical errors (range: 0, 1 represents correct responses divided by the number of possible responses).</description>
