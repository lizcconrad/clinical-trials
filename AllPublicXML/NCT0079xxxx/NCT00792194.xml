  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis has improved dramatically the last few
      years. Respiratory complications remain the main contributory factor to the morbidity and
      mortality associated with the disease. Exercise tolerance is reduced as the disease
      progresses, and peak aerobic capacity seems to be linked with survival. Regular physical
      activity has positive benefits, including a better body image, an improvement of pulmonary
      function, of exercise capacity and a possible improvement of quality of life.But because of
      the considerable variability of the subjects, exercise programs should be tailored to
      individual needs, and easy included in their cumbersome treatment routines and professional
      activities. In the cystic fibrosis center of Strasbourg we are able to propose to the
      patients a one-year physical exercise program, partly supervised with coaches, at home.
      Electronically braked cycle ergometer and heart rate monitoring system are at patients
      disposal, for one year, at home. Thus, patients can choose, during the day, the best moment
      to work out .Subjects will be randomised in two groups:1. a control group, where subjects are
      asked to continue their normal daily activities and physiotherapy regime.2. a training group,
      where subjects are asked to exercise three times a week. For the training group, three times
      a week, patients will train for 30 minutes. Heart rate will be continuously monitored and
      send to the medical staff every week-end . A correction of exercise intensity, if needed, is
      weekly proposed to maintain a maximal training efficiency, and coaches can help them, if
      necessary. For the two groups, quality of life will be measured with a disease-specific
      questionnaire (CFQ14+) (Henry, 1998, Quittner, 2000), and a generic questionnaire (SF 36)
      (Gee, 2002) before the program, and after 6 and 12 months. After a one year training program,
      and compared to the control group, we should expected an improvement in aerobic capacity and
      peak oxygen consumption, both associated with improved prognosis in cystic fibrosis. We also
      expected to observe an improvement in quality of life measurement, shorter hospital stays and
      fewer exacerbations. With this kind of program, we also would like to improve the degree of
      adherence in daily life exercise.

      We hope that regular contact with the coaches or the medical staff will provide
      self-confidence. Thus, patients will probably be more able to choose a physical activity
      which will be enjoyable, shared with others (family, friends), and give real benefits in term
      of health status.
