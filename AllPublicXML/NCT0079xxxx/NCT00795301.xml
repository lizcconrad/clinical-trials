      Primary Objectives To estimate the pathological complete response rate following neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine and oxaliplatin, with or without cetuximab based on
      the KRAS mutation status in rectal cancer.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To evaluate the incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities with each of the two neoadjuvant
           regimens and during the 30-day post-operative period.

        2. To estimate the clinical tumour response rate and sphincter preservation rate with each
           of the two neoadjuvant regimens.

        3. To correlate EGRF gene amplification with pathological response rate in those treated
           with cetuximab.

        4. To estimate the pattern of failure.

        5. To establish an annotated tissue library with samples being obtained prior to therapy
           and following therapy (at the time of surgery).

      Aims: The primary aim of this study is to estimate the pathological complete response rate
      following neoadjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX), with
      or without cetuximab based on the KRAS mutation status in rectal cancer.

      Hypothesis: Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against the EGF receptor, is active in
      metastatic colorectal cancer and a radio-sensitizer. In colorectal cancer, the presence of
      KRAS mutation has been associated with the absence of response to cetuximab. We hypothesise
      that the addition of cetuximab to CAPOX concurrent with neoadjuvant radiotherapy only
      benefited patients whose tumours do not have the KRAS mutation and therefore, personalizing
      cetuximab therapy based on tumour KRAS mutation status may yield a higher pathological
      response.

      Methods: This study employed a standard 2-stage Phase II design to evaluate the efficacy and
      tolerability of two neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimens. The assignment of the neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy will be determined by the KRAS mutation status of the tumor. Subjects with KRAS
      mutation will receive CAPOX. Subjects with no KRAS mutation will be randomized to receive
      CAPOX +/- cetuximab.Definitive surgery is scheduled for 6-8 weeks after the completion of
      chemoradiotherapy. Surgical management will be a sphincter preservation approach whenever
      possible, using the total mesorectal excision technique.After the operation, pathologic
      evaluation of the surgical specimen will be performed.

      Significance:In this proof-of-concept study, we aim to demonstrate that using an enriched
      patient cohort to test our hypothesis that the addition of cetuximab will yield a higher
      pathological response rate in KRAS mutation-negative rectal cancer. This approach can
      potentially identify a subset of patients that may benefit from cetuximab and spare those who
      may not benefit from unnecessary treatment toxicities and costs. Our study will help to
      prioritise novel targeted agents for a smaller, faster, and less expensive confirmatory phase
      III trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed T3/4 and/or node
             positive adenocarcinoma of the rectum with the inferior border within 12 cm from the
             anal verge without evidence of distant metastases, as evaluated by computed
             tomography, ultrasonography, MRI or clinically.

          2. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

             leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL platelets &gt;100,000/mcL
             total bilirubin within normal institutional limits AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) greater than
             2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional
             limits

          3. Age &gt;21 years

          4. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          5. Patients must be 18 years old or greater.

          6. The tumor must be considered by the surgeon to be amenable to curative resection.

          7. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          8. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have had prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Patients with stage I or IV cancer of the rectum.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to cetuximab, oxaliplatin or capecitabine.

          5. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          6. Inability to take oral medications.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because agents use in the study may cause
             fetal harm.

          8. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with docetaxel. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.

          9. History of other malignancies within 5 years, except non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix or ductal carcinoma of the breast. Previous invasive cancer
             permitted if disease-free at least 5 years.
