    <textblock>
      The mortality rate of treated patients with end stage renal disease(ESRD)is 22 deaths
      patient-years at risk in 2006. Incident patients with ESRD are most vulnerable within the
      first 90 days of dialysis, with an annualized mortality rate of 50 deaths/100 patient years.
      The vast majority of these deaths are due to cardiovascular causes. As cardiac rehabilitation
      programs have shown a 20% reduction in one year overall mortality rate post myocardial
      infarction the investigator proposes that a similar type of rehabilitation program will also
      have a benificial effect on morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney
      disease(CKD)and ESRD.The overall goal of this project is to study whether a renal
      rehabilitation program based on guided exercise implemented in patients with stage III and
      stage IV CKD can influence the mortality rate of these patients prior to and during the first
      90 days of dialysis

      Hypothesis:The application of a guided exercise program (renal rehabilitation) instituted in
      patients with stage III or Stage IV CKD will decrease the mortality rate prior to the
      initiation of renal replacement therapy.

      Hypothesis:The application of renal rehabilitation during the late stages of CKD will
      decrease the mortality risk during the first 90 days of renal rehabilitation therapy.

      Hypothesis:A guided exercise program will have an immediate and prolonged effect on activity
      levels, mental health and adaption to chronic illness in patients with advanced CKD.

    <description>Subjects will undergo renal rehabilitation in the form of guided exercises 2 times per week for 3 months. Subjects will be encouraged to walk for 1 hour on their own a third day of the week.Subjects will receive recommendations for cardiovascular, weight training and stretching exercises.
Cardiovascular and strength capabilities of all subjects will be evaluated at the initial session in order to prescribe the appropriate exercise regimen. An exercise physiologist will conduct these evaluations using the Perceived Level of Exertion Subjects will also receive education and practice in mindful meditation and a heart healthy diet.
Subjects will be encouraged to continue exercises, meditation, and healthy eating habits after the 3-month in-center program. Subjects will receive follow-up phone calls at 3-month intervals to encourage ongoing exercise, meditation, and healthy diet.</description>
