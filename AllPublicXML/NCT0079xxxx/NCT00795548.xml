      This open label phase-II trial evaluates hematological response of an additional treatment
      with 5-Azacitidine to common DLI in patients with MDS or AML relapsing after allogeneic stem
      cell transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a major problem in patients with poor
      prognosis AML or MDS. Donor lymphocyte infusions alone re-induce remission in a minority of
      these patients, which may be the result of poor differentiation of the leukemic cells. The
      study drug 5-Aza is effective in AML and MDS.In addition to direct cytotoxicity, it alters
      gene expression and induces differentiation of leukemic blast cells. Furthermore,
      DNA-demethylating treatment results in an induction of transcription and cell surface
      expression of formerly unexpressed KIRs (killer Ig-like receptors) in NK cells, which are
      involved in the specific recognition of leukemic target cells and who are able to generate a
      specific graft-versus leukemia effect. The increased expression of MHC class I and II
      molecules on the surface of the recipient's leukemic cells and the de novo expression of
      formerly silenced KIR genes in donor NK cells due to treatment with 5-Aza may result in an
      increased susceptibility of myeloid leukemic cells to the allogeneic graft versus leukemia
      effect. Therefore, the graft-versus leukemia effect by donor lymphocyte infusions and NK
      cells from the original donor may be supported by additional therapy with 5-Azacitidine.

    <description>5-Aza will be administered at doses of 100mg/m2 via subcutaneous injection over a period of 5 days. The total amount per treatment cycle, consisting of 5 days, is 500mg/m². Each treatment cycle is repeated every 28 days, with a treatment pause of 23 days between each 5-Aza cycle, to a total of 6 (optional 8 cycles) cycles.
DLI will be transfused on day +34 with a total count of CD3+ cells of DLI 1-5x10E6CD3+/kg bodyweight. In absence of GvHD DLI transfusion is repeated on day +90 with DLI 1-5x10E7CD3+/kg bodyweight and on day +142 with DLI 1-5x10E8CD3+/kg bodyweight. Additional DLI may be given.</description>
