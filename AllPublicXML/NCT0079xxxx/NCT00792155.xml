  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is the most common inherited kidney
      disease, affecting more than 400,000 people in the U.S. and 5 million people worldwide. PKD
      is the 4th most common cause of kidney failure requiring dialysis and/or transplantation.
      Over half of all PKD patients develop kidney failure by age 60 years, although age of onset
      of kidney disease varies widely, even among members of the same family.

      Despite the fact this is a relatively common problem, relatively few patients have been
      studied for a sufficient period of time to fully understand how patients are affected over
      the course of their lifetime. The reason for creating this repository is to collect
      information about PKD so that the investigators may fully understand its complications,
      including high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke. This information may also aid in the
      development of improved treatment strategies.

      Visit #1:

      - An initial detailed history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation

      The following imaging procedures will be performed within three months of the first study
      visit:

      - Renal and hepatic magnetic resonance imaging

      Additional assessment and testing:

        -  Genetic assessment: An extensive family history of PKD will be obtained from the
           patient.

        -  Genotyping of specific PKD1 and PKD2 mutations

      Follow-up Study Visits:

      - Patients will return to the outpatient facility for detailed follow-up examinations every
      other year after Visit 1.

        All patients enrolled in this study will have the diagnosis of autosomal dominant kidney
        disease. The diagnostic criteria for at-risk individuals (i.e., with a first degree family
        member with ADPKD) includes the presence of at least two(unilateral or bilateral) renal
        cysts, and two cysts in each kidney are considered sufficient for diagnosis in aged 15 to
        29 years and in 30 to 59 years, respectively. In families of unknown genotype, the presence
        of three or more (unilateral or bilateral) renal cysts is sufficient for establishing the
        diagnosis in individuals aged 15 to 39 years, two or more cysts in each kidney is
        sufficient for individuals aged 40-59 years and four or more cysts in each kidney is
        required in individuals â‰¥60 years of age.
