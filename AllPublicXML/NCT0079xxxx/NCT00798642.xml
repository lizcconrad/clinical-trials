      The UCRPT is a randomized controlled trial to determine if a type of hypnotherapy will
      maintain remission in patients affected by Ulcerative Colitis.

      The purpose of the study is to determine whether hypnotherapy can serve as an effective
      therapy for patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), a chronic, relapsing and remitting
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

      The goal of this study is to determine if mind-body therapy is an effective complementary
      therapy for IBD, meaning a therapy to be used in conjunction with your standard treatment
      provided by your gastroenterologist. Standard treatment for UC often includes a combination
      approach and may include medications such as mesalamine, corticosteroids or immunomodulators.
      Mind-body therapy or hypnosis has been used to reduce stress and subsequent disease activity
      in patients with gastrointestinal diseases including IBD and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. It has
      also been shown to improve immune function and reduce inflammation in other health conditions
      such as cancer and arthritis.

      In this study, patients with inactive UC will be randomized to one of three groups. Two
      groups will undergo one of two mind-body therapies, which may include relaxation techniques
      or other techniques aimed at identifying the impact of UC on your psyche along with standard
      care for their UC. The other group will undergo 8 weeks of standard care without mind-body
      therapy. Clinical assessment measures will be repeated at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 52
      weeks.
