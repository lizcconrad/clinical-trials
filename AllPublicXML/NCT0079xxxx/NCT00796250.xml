    <description>Patients in this group were treated with azathioprine (AZA), infliximab, and placebo prednisolone. Infliximab was to be administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg at Visit 2 (Week 0), and at Weeks 2, 6, and 14 (total of four infusions). Infliximab infusions were administered by the investigators in the hospital during the patient's visit, usually in the morning.</description>
