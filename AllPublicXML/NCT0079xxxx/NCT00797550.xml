      The hypothesis is that Aastrom TRC autologous bone marrow tissue &quot;grafts&quot; can be safely used
      to promote bone healing as part of a single level posterolateral spine fusion surgical
      procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults, 18-75 years of age

          -  Identified as eligible for elective surgery for single (1) level, posterolateral
             spinal fusion between L1 and S1 in which the spine stabilization is accomplished by
             pedicle screws and rod.

          -  Male patients and female patients (not pregnant or lactating). Patients should use an
             appropriate form of contraception while participating in the study.

          -  Patients able to give informed consent.

          -  Normal organ and marrow function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with hypophosphatasia, primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by
             chronic renal insufficiency or osteomalacia.

          -  Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures.

          -  Patients with a prior spinal fusion at the level to be treated.

          -  Concomitant use of BMP, or devices containing BMP, or electronic growth stimulators.

          -  Any active infection of any clinical significance will be excluded from the study.

          -  Positive for HIV, HTLV and/or syphilis.

          -  Active Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infection at the time of enrollment.

          -  Known allergies to protein products (horse or bovine serum, or porcine trypsin) used
             in the ex-vivo cell production process.

          -  Patients who require systemic corticosteroid therapy after surgery.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation; positive of hCG.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 40 Kg/m2 or greater.

          -  Patients unable to tolerate general anesthesia defined as an ASA criteria of &gt;2.

          -  Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1C &gt;7%).

          -  Rationale for Exclusion of Certain Study Candidates

               1. Patients with other diseases are excluded to avoid confounding factors that might
                  impact evaluation of safety and efficacy of TRC cell therapy in posterolateral
                  spine fusion.

               2. More extensive surgery requiring more than one (1) level fusion is
                  contraindicated in this study, to avoid confounding factors that might impact
                  evaluation of safety and efficacy of TRC cell therapy.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the patient is unsuitable to cellular therapy or
             unable to continue with this study.

          -  Patients that drink more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day or have a history of illicit
             drug use at the time of enrollment shall not be enrolled in the study.

          -  Patient known to be non-euthyroid at baseline.

          -  Patients undergoing active cancer therapy.

          -  Bisphosphonate Therapy

               1. Patients that have undergone bisphosphonate therapy within the last 10 years.

               2. Initiation of bisphosphonate therapy in patients during this study is prohibited.

          -  Patients with a known diagnosis of osteoporosis with recorded BMD less than -2.5.
