    <measure>LS Mean Sleep Efficiency (SE) During Periods 1 and 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Night 1 and end of Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>SE was defined as total sleep time (TST) in minutes divided by time in bed (measured from lights off to lights on; fixed at 8 hours on each Polysomnography [PSG] night) in minutes, multiplied by 100, where TST is defined as the total time (minutes) in Stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and Rapid Eye Movement (REM). SE= (total sleep time/time in bed) x 100</description>

    <measure>LS Mean Wake After Persistent Sleep Onset (WASO) During Periods 1 and 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Night 1 and end of Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>WASO was defined as the duration of wakefulness measured in minutes (any epoch of Stage 0) from persistent sleep onset (first epoch of the first twenty consecutive epochs of non-wake) to lights on.</description>
