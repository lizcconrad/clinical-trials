  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this surveillance is to collect information about 1) adverse drug reaction
      not expected from the LPD (unknown adverse drug reaction), 2) the incidence of adverse drug
      reactions in this surveillance, and 3)factors considered to affect the safety and/or efficacy
      of this drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients whom an investigator prescribes the first Genotropin® should be registered
      consecutively until the number of subjects reaches target number in order to extract patients
      enrolled into the investigation at random.

    <description>Adverse events mean all unfavorable events that occur in participants after administration of somatropin, irrespective of causal relationship to somatropin (including clinically problematic abnormal changes in laboratory test values). Treatment related adverse events were evaluated in company with the causal relationship to somatropin.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Growth Rate Standard Deviation (SD) Score for Calendar Age.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Growth rate SD score = (Growth rate - Average growth rate for calendar age of gender) / SD score for growth rate for each calendar age of gender). An SD score indicates how far a participant's score deviates from the mean of the reference population; an SD score higher than the mean gives a positive SD score whereas an SD score lower than the mean gives a negative SD score. In addition, when the bone age was described, it was to be read as the calendar age for men who were 11 years or older and women who were 9 years or older, as necessary.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Height SD Score for Calendar Age.</measure>

        <description>Growth rate SD score = (Growth rate - Average growth rate for calendar age of gender) / SD score for growth rate for each calendar age of gender). An SD score indicates how far a participant's score deviates from the mean of the reference population; an SD score higher than the mean gives a positive SD score whereas an SD score lower than the mean gives a negative SD score. In addition, when the bone age was described, it was to be read as the calendar age for men who were 11 years or older and women who were 9 years or older, as necessary.</description>
