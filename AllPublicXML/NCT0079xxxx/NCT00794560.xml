  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is very little data available on compliance with self-injected low molecular weight
      heparins (LMWH), but what there is, definitely shows that compliance represents a significant
      problem. We therefore aim to a) record drug use problems of patients including compliance, b)
      develop a &quot;SOP&quot; for first instruction by a pharmacist and for subsequent pharmaceutical care
      and c) to compare intensive pharmaceutical care (intervention) vs. standard care (control)
      provided in the pharmacy to patients with a prescription for a LMWH as an outpatient
      treatment.

      Hypothesis:

      Intensive pharmaceutical care in ambulatory patients who self-inject low molecular weight
      heparins results in improved compliance, more safety and satisfaction as well as in fewer
      complications.

      Patient recruitment in community pharmacies enables the testing of the feasibility of the
      interventions under daily-practice conditions and facilitates the recruitment of a larger
      number of patients.

      Data collection:

        -  telephone interviews with structured questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of
           the therapy

        -  monitored self-injection in the study center or at patient's home (direct observation
           technique [DOT])

        -  compliance measurement: answers from patient interviews, comparing number of used
           syringes vs. number of prescribed syringes (analogue &quot;pill count&quot;), measuring residual
           volume in recycled syringes

        -  recording of the fine motor skills by the adapted &quot;Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and
           Hand&quot; questionnaire (DASH questionnaire)
