    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to determine pharmacodynamic effects of a vaginal ring
      delivering either 1,500 or 2,500 μg of CDB-2914 per day during 6 months of treatment on:

        1. follicular function and inhibition of ovulation

        2. the endometrium

        3. bleeding patterns; and also to assess safety including effects on the endometrium
