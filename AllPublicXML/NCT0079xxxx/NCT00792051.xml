  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While immunisation of school-age children against influenza is not recommended in Hong Kong,
      past experience in Japan and elsewhere suggests that immunisation of children may protect the
      wider community through its indirect transmission-limiting impact as well as the direct
      immunologic protection afforded vaccinated children themselves. We aim to assess whether
      vaccinating children against influenza protects vaccinees as well as their household contacts
      from infection.

    <textblock>
      Design and subjects: A double-blind randomised controlled trial of 800 subjects aged 6-17
      drawn from the general population and their 2000 household contacts. The subjects will be
      randomised in a 3:2 ratio to the intervention and placebo groups, respectively. Serum samples
      will be collected from subjects pre- and 1 month post-vaccination, and after the influenza
      season. Serum samples will be collected from household contacts at baseline and at the end of
      the influenza season. During the follow-up period, subjects and household members will keep
      symptom diaries and those reporting influenza-like-illness will be offered free doctor
      consultations or home visits where we will arrange for collection of nose and throat swabs.

      Study instruments: An antibody titre of ≥40 in the post-vaccine serum will be used to define
      seroprotection to those particular strains, while a four-fold or higher increase in antibody
      titres between baseline and end-of-season follow-up of the household contacts will define
      influenza infection during the season. Subjects and household contacts will be asked to keep
      symptom diaries, and during episodes of ILI we will collect nose and throat swabs for
      laboratory confirmation of influenza infection; the primary serology results will then be
      compared with clinical and laboratory-confirmed influenza episodes.

      Interventions: 1 (intervention) inactivated influenza vaccine (Vaxigrip, Sanofi Pasteur); 2
      (placebo) saline injection.

      Main outcome measures: The proportions of subjects and household contacts with
      serology-confirmed influenza infection during follow-up among the 2 intervention arms.

      Analysis: Intention to treat, adjusting for within-household correlation in influenza attack
      rates.
