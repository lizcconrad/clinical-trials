  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is the major cause of blindness in working age Americans, and screening
      for it is cost-effective. There are a quarter of a million people in Southeast Michigan with
      diabetes and pre-diabetes.

      Only half of patients with diabetes are screened regularly for diabetic retinopathy, and this
      proportion has been difficult to increase despite various interventions. Previous research
      focused on HMO patient groups because preventative care was thought to decrease plan costs.
      In addition, it was administratively feasible to track patient-doctor interactions.

      This project builds on published research and institutional experience to determine an
      effective method for increasing the screening rate, in a mobile, non-HMO population. It uses
      administrative methods and information technology infrastructures, such as large scale
      electronic medical records and patient demographic databases, to identify existing patients
      requiring examinations.

      Patients were telephoned by a trained service representative who offered and scheduled firm
      examination appointment times.

      Hypothesis: Annual screening rates for diabetic retinopathy can be substantially improved in
      non-HMO patient groups by directly contacting patients and scheduling firm appointment times.
