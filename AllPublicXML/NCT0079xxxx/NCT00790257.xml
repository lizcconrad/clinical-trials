      In view to avoid immunosuppression, the investigators are submitting a Phase 1 clinical trial
      protocol testing the safety and the efficacy of encapsulated human islets in a &quot;Monolayer
      Cellular Device&quot; for allogeneic islets transplantation in Type 1 diabetic patients performed
      at the University clinical hospital Saint-Luc, Brussels. Encapsulated human islets will be
      transplanted in the subcutaneous tissue as &quot;safety procedure&quot; for patients.

      This protocol (single center trial) is designed as a limited series of islets transplants for
      15 Type 1 diabetic adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for chronic immunosuppressive therapy is paralleled by the occurrence of undesirable
      side effects in islets transplantation as well as whole pancreas transplantation. Several
      complications are associated with the administration of standard immunosuppressive agents
      (based on use of Sirolimus and Tacrolimus for example) used for human islets
      allotransplantation.

      The herein presented protocol is a Phase 1 pilot study. This will be a single center clinical
      study. Study will be divided in 2 Phases.

        -  Phase 1A: T1DM patients, already transplanted with an organ (kidney, heart, liver or
           totally unfunctioning primary whole vascularized pancreas) and under immunosuppression,
           will receive the &quot;Monolayer Cellular Device&quot; in subcutaneous tissue in view to assess
           the capacity of encapsulated human islets to secrete insulin without immunological
           reaction.

        -  Phase 1B: T1DM patients will receive the &quot;Monolayer Cellular Device&quot; in subcutaneous
           tissue without immunosuppression in view to assess the biocompatibility of the device.

      This protocol is designed as a limited series of islets transplants for 15 Type 1 diabetic
      adult subjects. In both Pase 1A/1B: Vascularized pancreas transplantation cannot be proposed,
      for these patients, following vascular disease, the older age, psychological reasons. Phase
      1A consists in the transplantation of encapsulated human islets in Type 1 diabetic patients
      already transplanted with primary vascularized organ and under immunosuppression therapy.

      Phase 1B consists in the transplantation of encapsulated human islets in Type 1 diabetic
      patients who cannot be eligible for whole vascularized pancreas transplantation.

    <description>The product consists of isolated allogeneic human islets of Langerhans formulated in a serum-free transplant media. The islets will be encapsulated in an alginate-based &quot;Monolayer Cellular Device&quot;.
One device will be transplanted subcutaneously and corresponds to a patch of 1-3cm². One Device per patient. No Retransplantation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Phase 1A:

               1. Male or female patients, of 30 to 80 years of age, C-peptide-negative;

               2. Patient must have signed the Patient Informed Consent Form;

               3. Type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients insulin-dependent;

               4. T1DM patients already transplanted with a kidney graft and already on
                  immunosuppressive therapy;

               5. T1DM patients already transplanted with a vascularized pancreas, already on
                  immunosuppressive therapy, but with TOTAL dysfunction of the graft;

               6. T1DM patients already transplanted with a liver graft and already on
