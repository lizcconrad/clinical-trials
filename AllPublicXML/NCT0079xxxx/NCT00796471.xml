    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 2 extended-release (ER)
      formulations of 2 mg-eq paliperidone in comparison to the 2 mg immediate-release (IR)
      paliperidone oral solution and to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of
      these ER formulations. Additional objectives are to compare the pharmacodynamic effects
      (postural changes in blood pressure and heart rate), safety, and tolerability are to be
      evaluated in addition to exploring the relationship between CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5genotype and
      paliperidone exposure.

      This study is designed as a single-center, open-label, randomized, 5 treatment-period,
      crossover study in healthy adults. The study consists of a screening phase and a treatment
      phase during which each volunteer will receive 5 treatments of study drug in a random order
      and separated by a washout period of at least 7 to 14 days. Treatments consist of a single
      oral dose of: A) paliperidone ER pellet formulation, (2 mg-eq) as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg,
      fasted; B) the same formulation as A but with food; C) paliperidone-coated ER OROS
      formulation (2 mg eq) as 2 tablets of 2 mg, fasted; D) the same formulation as C but with
      food; E) IR paliperidone oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1 mg/mL solution, fasted.
      Alternative paliperidone ER formulations are being developed with the aim to increase the
      bioavailability without compromising the favorable effect on the orthostatic hypotension as
      seen with ER OROS paliperidone. Therefore, in this study, the pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic properties, as well as the effect of food, of 2 alternative paliperidone ER
      formulations using different mechanisms to achieve extended release of the drug will be
      investigated: a multiparticulate ER capsule formulation, containing coated pellets comprised
      of 3 coating layers, with both immediate and extended drug-release properties (pellet
      formulation; drug ratio extended- versus immediate-release layer: 9:1), and an OROS trilayer
      longitudinally compressed tablet formulation (Push-Pull delivery system) (overcoated-OROS
      formulation). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Single doses of
      paliperidone ER pellet formulation, (2 mg-eq) as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg, fasted; paliperidone ER
      pellet formulation, (2 mg-eq) as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg with food (high-fat breakfast);
      paliperidone-coated OROS ER formulation (2 mg-eq) as 2 tablets of 2 mg, fasted;
      paliperidone-coated OROS ER formulation (2 mg-eq) as 2 tablets of 2 mg with food (high-fat
      breakfast); IR paliperidone oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1 mg/mL solution, fasted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acceptable weight as defined by body mass index (weight [kg]/height (m)²) range of
             18.0 to 28.0 kg/m², inclusive

          -  Normotensive with supine (5 minutes) blood pressure between the range of 100 to 140
             mmHg systolic, inclusive, and 60 to 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive

          -  Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history,
             electrocardiogram, and the laboratory results of blood biochemistry, hematology and
             urinalysis performed within 21 days before the first dose. If the results of the
             biochemistry, hematology or urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's
             reference ranges the volunteer can be included only if the investigator judges that
             the deviations are not clinically significant. For liver function tests (alanine
             transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and bilirubin), the values must be contained
             within 2 times the upper limits of the normal laboratory reference ranges and for

             patch, male partner sterilization and at the discretion of the investigator, total
             abstinence) before entry and throughout the study, as well as have a negative serum
