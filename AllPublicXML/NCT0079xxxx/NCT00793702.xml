    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety of three dose levels (0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 µg) of
      the rdESAT-6 + rCFP-10 skin test reagent when injected into healthy adults. The secondary
      objective is to assess the risk of sensitisation of 0.01 and 0.1 µg rdESAT-6 + rCFP-10 when
      injected twice with time intervals of 6 or 12 weeks to healthy adults.
