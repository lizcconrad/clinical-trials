      The purpose of this study was to assure that consumers could successfully use the new version
      of A1CNow+ Test Kit along with revised instructional materials. The primary objective was to
      establish accuracy and secondary objectives were to establish precision, comprehension of
      instructional materials, and user feedback about the overall testing experience.

    <measure>Number of A1C Results Either Equal To Or Within +/- 13.5% of the Laboratory Method (ACCURACY)</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure reports the number of A1c test results for which the percent difference (absolute value) between results from the subject meter and the laboratory method was less than or equal to 13.5%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Within Subject Coefficient of Variation CV (PRECISION)</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour</time_frame>
    <description>The average Coefficient of Variation (CV) was computed by calculating the square of the CV for each pair of A1c self-test results, averaging this square value over the number of subjects included in the analysis, and then taking the square root.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Who Experienced First Time Failures (FTF) During Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour</time_frame>
    <description>For the comprehension analysis, subjects were divided into 2 groups. One group (n=56 subjects) was given both written (Quick Reference Guide) and DVD instruction material. The other group (n=54 subjects) was given only written instruction material. First time failure (FTF) was defined as:
The subject could not use the product without HCP assistance.
The subject could not complete the test. User error rendered one or more parts unusable.
The subject completed the test after one or more mistakes; the result was an error code instead of a numerical value.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects Who Experienced First Time Failures (FTF) During Testing</title>
        <description>For the comprehension analysis, subjects were divided into 2 groups. One group (n=56 subjects) was given both written (Quick Reference Guide) and DVD instruction material. The other group (n=54 subjects) was given only written instruction material. First time failure (FTF) was defined as:
The subject could not use the product without HCP assistance.
The subject could not complete the test. User error rendered one or more parts unusable.
The subject completed the test after one or more mistakes; the result was an error code instead of a numerical value.</description>
