      In order to gain a greater understanding of the full experience of children with
      life-threatening illness, this study will provide video cameras to ten to fifteen 10-18 years
      olds in active treatment for cancer, and instruct them to make video illness narratives over
      the course of 1-3 months. The narratives will be studied as an intervention; each of the
      participants will be administered a measure of physical symptoms (the Memorial Symptom
      Assessment scale 10-18) and a measure of self-esteem (the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale). The
      video narratives will also be analyzed for content by theme in order to understand the
      participants' experiences in their own words. Our hypothesis is that these narratives will
      provide insight into the lives of children with cancer, increase their self-esteem, and
      decrease symptom distress, and improve communication between patients and their doctors.
