      This study aims to examine whether providing tube feeding with a formula enriched with
      omega-3 fats is better than traditional standard tube feeding in terms of preserving
      nutritional status, improving immune function and reducing medical complications following
      major upper Gut cancer surgery.

      Title A double blinded randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of an enteral
      nutritional supplement enriched with Eicosapentaenoic acid on long term nutritional status
      post operatively specifically the maintenance of lean body mass, and its potential impact on
      quality of life as well as examining the stress response and immune function and in patients
      undergoing surgical treatment of esophageal cancer.

      Investigational medicinal Product(s):

      Prosure (Abbott Laboratories)

      Comparator:

      Ensure Plus (Abbott Laboratories)

      Study Objectives To examine whether prolonged supplementation with a nutritional supplement
      enriched with Eicosapentaenoic acid is superior to standard nutritional products in terms of
      promoting anabolism and improving quality of life in patients undergoing surgical treatment
      of esophageal cancer.

      Study Design - Prospective randomized controlled trial.

      Primary Endpoints:

        -  Quality of life Scores using EORTC Questionnaires

        -  Nutritional status on day 21 post oesophagectomy and/or total gastrectomy(specifically
           lean body mass) and at out patient follow up

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  Effects on the immuno-inflammatory response to surgery

        -  Post operative Clinical outcome including SIRS, sepsis and organ failure
