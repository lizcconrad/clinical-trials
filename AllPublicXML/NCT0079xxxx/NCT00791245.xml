  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post market study is to evaluate surgical implantation technique and the
      quality of repair of the cartilage defect with particulated juvenile cartilage in the human
      knee joint.

      The intent of this post market study is to assess the clinical outcomes of DeNovo NT, a
      particulated juvenile cartilage tissue for the treatment of one or two contained lesion(s)
      equal to an ICRS Grade 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d of the femoral condyle or trochlear groove and OCD
      lesions (Grade 4a) with healed bone base, which is non sclerotic and no loss of bone greater
      thank 6mm measured from the surrounding subchondral plate.
