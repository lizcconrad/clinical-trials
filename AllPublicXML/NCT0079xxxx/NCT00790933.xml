  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter, open-label study is to collect data on the occurrence of
      important clinical safety events resulting from chronic vedolizumab (MLN0002) administration.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to
      treat people who have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. This study will determine the
      safety profile of long-term vedolizumab treatment.

      The study enrolled 2243 patients. Participants who received either placebo or vedolizumab 300
      mg IV infusion every 4 or 8 weeks in previous vedolizumab studies received:

      • Vedolizumab 300 mg

      All participants received vedolizumab intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for up to 46 months.

      This multicenter trial is being conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study was up to March 2016 until vedolizumab was available in the country in which the
      participant resided, or until participant withdrawal, whichever came first. Participants made
      multiple visits to the clinic up to 16 weeks after receiving their last dose of vedolizumab
      and were being followed up for 2-years during which a safety questionnaire was administered
      by telephone for follow-up assessments.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</description>

    <description>The IBDQ is an instrument used to assess quality of life in adult participants with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It includes 32 questions on 4 domains of Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQOL): Bowel Systems (10 items), Emotional Function (12 items), Social Function (5 items), and Systemic Function (5 items). Participants are asked to recall symptoms and quality of life from the last 2 weeks and rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale (1=worst to 7=best). A total IBDQ score is calculated by summing the scores from each domain; the total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224, with lower scores reflecting worse HRQOL.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol 5D health states (EQ-5D) questionnaire is an instrument used to measure general HRQOL in participants with IBD. It considers five attributes of quality of life evaluation, i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three possible levels, i.e 1 = none, 2 = moderate or 3 = extreme. A composite EQ-5D score can be calculated from the individual scores to assess overall HRQOL. A decrease of ≥0.3 points in the composite EQ-5D score represents improvement in quality of life of participants.

Each dimension has three possible levels, i.e 1 = none, 2 = moderate or 3 = extreme. The EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score is a self-assigned rating of overall health using a 20-cm visual, vertical scale, with a score of 0 as the worst and 100 as the best possible health. An increase of ≥7 points in the EQ-5D VAS score represents a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life for participants.

    <description>EuroQol 5D health states (EQ-5D) questionnaire is an instrument used to measure general HRQOL in participants with IBD. It considers five attributes of quality of life evaluation, i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three possible levels, i.e 1 = none, 2 = moderate or 3 = extreme. The EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score is a self-assigned rating of overall health using a 20-cm visual, vertical scale, with a score of 0 as the worst and 100 as the best possible health. An increase of ≥7 points in the EQ-5D VAS score represents a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life for participants. The change between the EQ-5D total score at Week 52 relative to baseline.</description>

It considers five attributes of quality of life evaluation, i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three possible levels, i.e 1 = none, 2 = moderate or 3 = extreme. A composite EQ-5D score can be calculated from the individual scores to assess overall HRQOL. A decrease of ≥0.3 points in the composite EQ-5D score represents improvement in quality of life of participants. The change between the EQ-5D total score at Week 76 relative to baseline.</description>
