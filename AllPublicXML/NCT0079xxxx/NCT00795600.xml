  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this clinical trial is to compare the change in
      trunk fat mass, assessed by Double Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) after 26 weeks of
      treatment with insulin detemir or insulin NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) (both combined
      with insulin aspart at the main meals) in overweight and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.
