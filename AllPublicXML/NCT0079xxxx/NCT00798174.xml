  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When implantable cardiac defibrillators are implanted (ICDs), the defibrillation threshold
      (DFT), of the amount of energy required to effectively terminate life-threatening arrhythmias
      is determined. The device is then programmed to discharge a larger amount of energy in order
      to provide a safety margin. In some patients, the DFT is so high, that an adequate safety
      margin is not programmable. Placement of a defibrillation lead in the azygos vein has been
      found to be helpful in these patients. This goal of this trial is to attempt to quantify the
      reduction in the DFT that results from the

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing placement of an ICD for the primary or secondary prevention of sudden
      cardiac death will be asked to participate. Patients will undergo implantation of a standard
      right ventricular ICD lead at the time of ICD implantation. In addition, patient will receive
      another high voltage ICD lead placed in the azygos vein as has been previously described in
      the literature (1). After sedating the patient, the DFT will be determined using a binary
      search algorithm. This consists of testing the device at a given output for the first shock
      after inducing VF. Should the shock fail, external defibrillation will be attempted, as is
      the standard method for performing DFT testing. As per the standard method of DFT testing, VF
      will be induced a second time, with the shock strength dependent on the success of the first
      shock. If the first shock was unsuccessful, the second will be at a higher output. If the
      first shock was successful, the second will be at a lower output. A third shock will then be
      delivered, based on the success or failure of the preceding shock to define the DFT. Of note,
      as the device can be programmed to give multiple shocks for one episode, VF will not
      necessarily need to be induced each time. For example, VF could be induced, and the device
      programmed to give a 20J shock followed by a 23J shock if not successful, thus limiting the
      number of VF inductions required. DFT testing will be done using both the standard
      configuration of high voltage leads as well as using the azygos lead. We hypothesize that
      using the azygos lead will result in a lower DFT.
