  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being undertaken to compare the clinical outcomes of patients that have
      unilateral posterolateral lumbar interbody fusion using a traditional open approach versus
      the MiLIF procedure based on the MiCOR Precision Bone Allograft, specialized Atavi
      instrumentation, and minimally invasive visualization capabilities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized cohort design clinical study to evaluate
      the clinical outcomes of patients that have a minimally invasive lumbar interbody fusion
      (MiLIF) through the Atavi system compared to traditional unilateral open lumbar interbody
      fusion through a midline incision. the study will involve up to approximately 12
      investigational sites and enroll up to 126 patients.

The Atavi System includes instruments used to access the spine by dilation of the overlying tissues, as well as a retracting device that is used to maintain the access. Once the retractor is in place, the visualization components of the system may be used.</description>

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients with chronic low back and/or leg pain who are candiates for elective lumbar
        interbody fusion through a postierior unilateral approach, that present to either group of
        surgeons, will be screened for inclusion in the study. If the patient meets all of the
        eligibility criteria, they wil be enrolled into the study and have either the MiLIF or open
        procedure depending on the surgoen they present to (i.e., what group their surgeon agreed
        to participate in).
