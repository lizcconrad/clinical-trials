    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prevent asthma and allergies in childhood by supplementation with
      fish oil (n-3 fatty acids) to the mother during pregnancy. Paticipants are mother and
      children participating in the ABC-(Asthma Begins in Childhood)cohort. Mothers are recruited
      during pregnancy and receive supplement with n-3 fatty acids or olive oil (placebo) from week
      24 of gestation to 1 week after delivery. The child is followed with acute and planned visit
      at the research unit and diagnosis of disease is done in the research unit according to
      predefined algorithms.
