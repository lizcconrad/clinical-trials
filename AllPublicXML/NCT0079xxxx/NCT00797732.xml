  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for advanced HNC is concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT),
      which has led to increased survival rates, but with significant acute and long-term
      toxicities. Dysphagia, or difficulty with swallowing, is a common and expected side effect
      during and following CRT. Dysphagia occurs in up to 50% of patients and significantly impairs
      the quality of life (QOL) of patients during delivery of and recovery from CRT. Clinical
      trials evaluating promising and innovative adjunctive approaches that could increase the rate
      and magnitude of recovery from dysphagia in HNC patients are needed. Acupuncture is a
      traditional Chinese medical technique that has been found to reduce symptoms and side effects
      associated with primary cancer therapy. This study evaluated the feasibility of conducting a
      randomized sham-controlled trial and collected preliminary data on safety and efficacy of
      acupuncture.

      AIMS:

      Aim 1. To assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining HNC patients with dysphagia into
      a randomized sham-controlled trial of acupuncture.

      Aim 2. To collect preliminary data on the efficacy of acupuncture in changing scores of HRQOL
      in post CRT head and neck cancer patients.

      Aim 3. (Exploratory) In a subset of HNC subjects treated with both active and sham
      acupuncture, to collect objective measures on swallowing functions using Videofluoroscopic
      swallowing study (VFSS); salivary flow production; and plasma Transforming Growth Factor
      (TGF)-β1, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin 13
      levels.

    <measure>MDADI Change From Baseline to 12 Months Post Chemoradiation Therapy (CRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at baseline and 6 months post acupuncture which parallels 12 months post-CRT</time_frame>
    <description>The M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) is a validated, self-administered questionnaire established as the best measure of dysphagia-related quality of life in HNC patients. (Carlsson S, et al Dysphagia 2012; 27: 361-369). MDADI has two summary scores: 1) global (1 item) and 2) composite (19 items). Each item is scored on a 5 point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, no opinion, agree, strongly agree). The composite MDADI score is a weighted average of the physical, emotional, and functional subscale questions. Scores are normalized to range from 20 (extremely low functioning) to 100 (high functioning). A minimal clinically important within group difference was a 10% change from baseline.</description>

    <description>The active intervention used a three-phase step-up protocol to gradually increase the body areas treated and needling intensity. Acupuncture needles (0.20x25mm) were inserted with a depth of 5-10 mm into predefined points based on a systematic literature review following the STRICTA guideline. Needles were stimulated to obtain the de qi sensation. An electroacupuncture (EA) device was connected at two acupoints. All needles remained in place for 30 minutes. The active acupuncture was administered once every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, starting 2 weeks into CRT and ending at 20 weeks after CRT. [Refs: Lu W, Wayne PM et al.

    <description>The sham intervention was designed to be maximally inert and minimally invasive, while simulating most aspects of the active protocol. Sham needles (0.12x30mm) were inserted at 14 locations paralleling the same body regions needled in the active group; however, all sham point locations were off the pathways of traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture meridians and points. An identical but deactivated EA device was used following sham protocols previously used. The sham acupuncture was administered once every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, starting 2 weeks into CRT and ending at 20 weeks after CRT. [Refs: Lu W, Wayne PM et al.

        <title>MDADI Change From Baseline to 12 Months Post Chemoradiation Therapy (CRT)</title>
        <description>The M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) is a validated, self-administered questionnaire established as the best measure of dysphagia-related quality of life in HNC patients. (Carlsson S, et al Dysphagia 2012; 27: 361-369). MDADI has two summary scores: 1) global (1 item) and 2) composite (19 items). Each item is scored on a 5 point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, no opinion, agree, strongly agree). The composite MDADI score is a weighted average of the physical, emotional, and functional subscale questions. Scores are normalized to range from 20 (extremely low functioning) to 100 (high functioning). A minimal clinically important within group difference was a 10% change from baseline.</description>

          <title>MDADI Scores</title>
          <description>The M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) is a validated, self-administered questionnaire established as the best measure of dysphagia-related quality of life in HNC patients. (Carlsson S, et al Dysphagia 2012; 27: 361-369). MDADI has two summary scores: 1) global (1 item) and 2) composite (19 items). Each item is scored on a 5 point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, no opinion, agree, strongly agree). The composite MDADI score is a weighted average of the physical, emotional, and functional subscale questions. Scores are normalized to range from 20 (extremely low functioning) to 100 (high functioning). A minimal clinically important within group difference was a 10% change from baseline.</description>
          <population>The analysis population is comprised of all randomized participants. At each timepoint, a subset of participants were evaluable for quality of life assessment.</population>
