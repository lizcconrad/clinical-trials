      Colonoscopy is the accepted gold standard for screening of colorectal cancer. However, small
      and flat neoplastic lesions might be overlooked with standard video endoscopes. The new
      available EPKi system (Pentax, Japan) enables with HD+ imaging resolution above HDTV
      standard. Aim of the study was to test the efficacy of HD+ colonoscopy alone and in
      conjunction with I-Scan (newly developed post processing digital filter)in comparison to
      standard videoendoscopy
