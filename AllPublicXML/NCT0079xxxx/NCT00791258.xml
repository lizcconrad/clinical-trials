  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial 12 week portion of this 20 week study will examine the ability of a combination
      of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine to lower the blood pressure of patients with high
      blood pressure who have not had sufficient blood pressure reduction using one
      anti-hypertension drug (monotherapy). The final 8 weeks of this 20 week study will examine
      the ability of a combination of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide to
      lower blood pressure in the same patient population. All three medications being tested have
      been approved by the FDA for the treatment of high blood pressure, but only amlodipine and
      olmesartan are currently approved for use in combination form.
