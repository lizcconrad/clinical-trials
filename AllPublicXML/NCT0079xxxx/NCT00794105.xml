      Observation of fluid behavior over a perforated eardrum.

      A comparison of the behavior of the gas in normal vs. different kinds of otitis media ears.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluid present in middle ears is observed during the regular treatment of patients.

      The observation in made during the treatment and not as an additional activity. The fluid is
      either a steroids solution or sterile normal saline or ear's mucus discharge, all in
      perforated eardrums, either as a part of their intra-tympanic treatment for sudden hearing
      loss, or traumatic perforation [considered as the normal ears] compared to otitis media ears.

      The observation is made on bubble formation over the perforation. The time length of the
      inspection is about 1 minute, under the microscope, during the treatment.
