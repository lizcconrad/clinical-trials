      This is an observational study to confirm the presence of recurrent or persistent endogenous
      Cushing's syndrome in patients who have had primary surgical and/or radiation therapy for
      Cushing's disease and continue to manifest symptoms and signs of hypercortisolemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are at least 18 years of age.

          -  Have a presumptive diagnosis of Cushing's disease (Cushing's syndrome due to an ACTH
             secreting pituitary tumor).

          -  Have previously had pituitary surgery and/or pituitary radiation with the intent of
             curing or treating Cushing's disease.

          -  Have clinical symptoms and signs of hypercortisolism.

          -  Are able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Are expected to complete the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are surgical candidates for pituitary surgery or have had pituitary surgery within 8
             weeks before screening.

          -  Have taken any medication that may interfere with protocol testing procedures within
             30 days of initial screening (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarabazepine,
             primidone, rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, ethosuximide, pioglitazone, efavirenz,
             neviparine, modafinil, St. Johns wort, glucorticoids, estrogen containing oral
             contraceptives).

             days of screening.

          -  Have a non-endogenous source of hypercortisolemia such as factitious hypercortisolemia
             (exogenous source of glucocorticoid, iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome), factitious or
             therapeutic use of ACTH.

          -  Have Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. Subjects with suspected Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome such
             as those with severe obesity, major depression or a history of alcoholism.

          -  Uncontrolled, clinically significant hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
