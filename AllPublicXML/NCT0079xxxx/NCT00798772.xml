    <textblock>
      Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes decline in immunity or the ability
      to fight infection and progresses to acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS). Anti-HIV drug
      treatment has improved the prognosis of persons with HIV infection, but is expensive and
      potentially toxic. Low micronutrient levels occur in the blood even in early stages of HIV
      infection and increase risk of a poorer prognosis, but the role of micronutrient and
      antioxidant supplements in medical management of HIV/AIDS is not well defined. The proposed
      clinical trial aims to assess if supplementation of untreated HIV-infected adults with a
      micronutrient and antioxidant preparation can delay decline in immunity or disease
      progression or start of anti-HIV drug treatment compared with supplementation with standard
      multivitamins. If the findings are positive, the study has implications for health and health
      care savings.

      Background: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved the prognosis of persons with human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but is expensive and potentially toxic. Micronutrient
      deficiencies occur even in early stages of HIV infection and increase risk of morbidity,
      disease progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and mortality, but the role
      of micronutrient antioxidant supplements in medical management of HIV/AIDS is not clear.

      Objective: To determine if supplementation of untreated asymptomatic HIV-infected persons
      with a broad-spectrum micronutrient and antioxidant preparation will reduce the rate of
      decline of CD4 T lymphocyte count, or delay emergence of documented CDC-defined AIDS-defining
      illness, or start of ART compared to 100% recommended daily allowance (RDA) multivitamins and
      minerals, and is safe.

      Study design: A prospective, randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trial of
      supplementation of 218 untreated asymptomatic HIV-infected adults with a micronutrient and
      antioxidant preparation or identical appearing RDA multivitamins and minerals for two years,
      with quarterly follow up in clinic for assessment of time from baseline to CD4 count &lt;350
      mm3, or emergence of documented CDC-defined AIDS-defining illness, or start of ART.

      Participants and sample size: 218 participants from clinics in Ontario and other
      participating centres of the CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network (CTN).

      Study duration: approximately five years, allowing for approximately three years for
      participant accrual and two years follow-up.

      Eligibility criteria: The main eligibility criteria are:

      • Asymptomatic HIV-infected adults at least 18 years of age

      • CD4+ cells ≥375 and ≤750 cells/mm3

      • No previous ART (excluding less than seven days and perinatal transmission prophylaxis)
      Study intervention: Oral supplementation with a broad spectrum micronutrient and antioxidant
      preparation (n=109) or identical appearing RDA multivitamins and minerals (n=109).

      Primary outcome: Time from baseline to CD4+ cell count &lt;350 cells/mm3 (confirmed by two
      measures at least one week apart), or emergence of documented CDC-defined AIDS-defining
      illness, or start of ART

      Secondary outcomes:

      • Non-AIDS related adverse events

      • Tolerance of and adherence to study medication

      • Time from baseline to CD4+ cell count &lt;350 cells/mm3 (confirmed by two measures at least
      one week apart)

      • Time from baseline to emergence of documented CDC-defined AIDS-defining illness

      • Time from baseline to start of ART

      • Serial quarterly lymphocyte measures: absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+
      cell counts, CD4%, CD8%, CD4:CD8

      • Serial quarterly HIV RNA plasma viral load

      • Serum chemistries: Glucose, BUN, creatinine, total protein, C-reactive protein, albumin,
      alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin

      • Serum micronutrient levels: Carotene (quarterly) and vitamin B12 (quarterly), folate (six
      monthly) and vitamin D (25-OHD, six monthly)

      • Quality of Life measures: MOS HIV, EuroQol, and Health Utilities Index (HUI) Statistical
      analysis: Analysis of the primary outcome by intention-to-treat will compare time from
      baseline to primary outcome. Interim analyses are planned once 100 participants are followed
      for one year.
