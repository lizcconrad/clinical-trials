  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research focuses on men who have sex with men (MSM) who are at higher risk of anal
      cancer. The survey will evaluate their beliefs about anal and oral cancer, their knowledge
      about role of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in these cancers, and their knowledge of
      HPV vaccination and anal Pap smears. Approximately 12% of subjects will be HIV-positive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little research has examined men's understanding of what causes anal and oral cancers and
      whether HPV vaccination can play a potential protective role. This research focuses on men
      who have sex with men (MSM) who are at notably elevated risk of anal cancer, and seeks to
      characterize their beliefs about anal and oral cancer, knowledge about the etiological role
      of HPV infection in these cancers, as well as their knowledge of HPV vaccination and anal Pap
      smears. We will also study heterosexual men.
