    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility, cost and effectiveness of
      interventions designed to integrate buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence into HIV
      primary care in ten HIV care centers in the U.S.

      In the site led by Dr. Altice, we compare two models of providing HIV care and buprenorphine
      treatment. Assignments are based on participants' city of residence. In the onsite
      (integrated care) model, participants receive buprenorphine, substance abuse counseling and
      HIV care at one location: the Waterbury Hospital Infectious Disease Clinic. In the off-site
      model (non-integrated care) buprenorphine induction, substance abuse counseling, and HIV care
      will be provided at separate locations: the Community Health Care Van (CHCV), the Yale AIDS
      Program, and patients' own HIV providers, respectively. Data is collected from interviews
      with participants, reviews of medical records, and surveys and interviews with clinicians.
