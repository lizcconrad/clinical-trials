  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A majority of patients with bladder cancer have disease confined to the inner lining of the
      bladder. Patients with high risk features (high grade tumors, tumors invading into a deeper
      superficial layer) are routinely treated with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) instilled in
      their bladder after the tumor has been removed. While up to 55% of patients respond to BCG,
      failure to respond may suggest a more aggressive tumor that requires more definitive therapy
      with complete bladder removal. BCG is believed to work by stimulating the body's own immune
      system to attack tumor cells. It may also work by blocking the machinery that tumors use to
      grow blood vessels which fuel tumor growth. A newer oral drug, sunitinib has shown to help
      patients with metastatic bladder cancer by blocking new blood vessel growth (VEGF
      inhibition). The investigators are studying the use of BCG followed by sunitinib in patients
      with high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer to evaluate the complete response (no
      visible evidence of tumor in the bladder) at 3 months and 6 months. The investigators will
      also evaluate whether there is recurrent tumor at three years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite a complete response of 45-55% in patients with non-muscle invasive urothelial
      carcinoma involving the lower urinary tract at 3 months, many patients suffer from multiple
      recurrences and progression in up to 1/3 of patients. While radical cystectomy is an
      effective local therapy for patients with high risk non-invasive disease, roughly 15% of
      patients will still develop progression. More importantly, the morbidity of radical
      cystectomy as described above represents a barrier to treatment in some individuals. Thus,
      there is a real need to identify newer therapies that reduce morbidity and improve outcomes
      in patients with non-invasive urothelial cancer. While multiple drug regimens have been the
      standard for many forms of cancer including invasive bladder cancer, few reports exist on
      multidrug regimens for non-invasive bladder cancer.

      The fundamentally agreed upon mechanism of action of BCG intravesical therapy for superficial
      bladder cancer is the generation of a non-specific immune response with the expression of
      cytokines by inflammatory cells resulting in tumor death. Cytokines produced by BCG therapy
      such as IFNÎ± may block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which is expressed in
      superficial and invasive bladder cancer and may provide a mechanism for disease progression.

      Sunitinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks VEGF. Recent reports demonstrate
      clinical response in patients with metastatic bladder cancer treated with sunitinib after
      recurrence following standard chemotherapeutic regimens. The addition of sunitinib following
      BCG in order to consolidate VEGF inhibition may result in superior 3 month complete response
      rates. We know that patients who have a complete response to BCG at 3 months have improved
      disease.

    <description>Patients are treated with a 6-week induction course of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) followed by a 2 week rest period and 4 week course of oral Sunitinib.
Patients will receive intravesical BCG (81 mg Theracys BCG in 50 ml normal saline) once weekly for 6 weeks within 6 weeks of bladder biopsy confirming high risk non-muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma. Two weeks after completion of BCG, patients will receive Sunitinib (50 mg daily) continuously for 28 days followed by a two week rest period. Patients will be reassessed with transurethral resection and urine cytology. Those with residual/recurrent disease will receive a second course identical to the initial protocol. Those with a complete response following initial or second treatment will be placed on maintenance BCG (3 week course every 6 months for 2 years). Those failing (progression, intolerance) initial/secondary treatments will be offered alternative therapy.</description>

             medical therapy).

          -  Patient may not have unresolved bacterial infection.

          -  Patients with hypothyroidism that can not be adequately controlled with medication
             will be excluded. All patients will be monitored at trial initiation with a TSH.

             non-treatment trials, e.g. QOL, are allowed.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female subjects must be surgically sterile or be
             postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of
             therapy.

          -  All female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test
             (serum or urine) prior to enrollment.

          -  Male subjects must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception

          -  The definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the
             principal investigator or a designated associate.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study results, and in
             the judgment of the investigator would make the subject inappropriate for entry into
             this study.
