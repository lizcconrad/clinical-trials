      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if the study medication Methylphenidate
      (Ritalin) will improve subject's blood-sugar control by improving their motivation more than
      placebo. The secondary objectives of the study are to determine if daily functioning and
      quality of life improves with methylphenidate treatment.

      A total of 50 subjects will be enrolled in this study. This study is being conducted at two
      sites, UNMC and the Omaha VA Medical Center.

      The subject will be asked to take the study drug in the form of a capsule to be taken twice
      daily. Whether the subject receives methylphenidate or placebo (a pill that has a similar
      appearance to the study drug, but has no medicine) will be determined by random chance. The
      probability that the subject will receive methylphenidate is 1 in every 2 subjects or 50% of
      the time. Subjects receiving methylphenidate will be starting at 5 milligrams (mg) twice
      daily. Dosage will then be increased to 10mg twice daily at 2 weeks.

      After the initial visits, the subjects will be asked to come for follow-up every month for
      the next 4 visits (sixteen weeks total). During each visit subjects will again be asked
      questions to assess their motivation, memory, functional status and quality of life. Blood
      will be drawn and an electrocardiogram (ecg/ekg) will be taken to assess the patient's safety
      twice during the study.

      Partial Compensation may be available for participation.

    <measure>Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) will be used as marker for glycemic control. It is accepted as the best marker for glycemic control in the previous 120 days. Changes in HbA1c are clinically meaningful.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apathy Evaluation Scale-Clinician (AES-C): The clinician-rated version will be used for this project. This 18 item scale with scores ranging from 18 to 72, assesses apathy in behavioral, cognitive and emotional domains over the previous four weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI): This is an observational scale of global evaluation, which assesses the change in degree of illness in relation to the original assessment.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL): It is a survey assessing eight domains of higher functions necessary to live independently. It is rated from 0-23 based on the independent living of the patient.</measure>
