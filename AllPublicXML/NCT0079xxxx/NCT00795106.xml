  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neck pain is a common condition that can negatively impact quality of life. Substance
      P is one of the chemicals in the body that can transmit pain signals from overloaded neck
      muscles to the brain. Topical capsaicin blocks the action of Substance P by releasing, and
      subsequently depleting the body's store of Substance P in the nerves. Topical capsaicin has
      been reported to be an effective therapy for a number of persistent pain conditions including
      diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and
      post-mastectomy pain. This study will evaluate the efficacy of topical capsaicin to reduce
      pain and improve health-related quality of life in adults with chronic muscular neck pain.

      The study will employ a double blinded randomized controlled cross-over trial design. A total
      of 60 patients aged 18-65 with at least 3 months of myofascial neck pain will be recruited to
      participate in the study. The participants will be randomized into two groups. Each group
      will undergo two 4-week treatment arms separated by a 4-week wash-out period. Participants
      will apply a topical gel patch 12 hours each day overlying painful areas in the neck and
      shoulder girdle for each 4-week period. The topical gel patch used in each arm of the study
      will be identical except the placebo will not contain the active ingredient, 0.1% capsaicin.
      Both topical gel patches will be supplied by Caleb Pharmaceuticals. Each participant will
      complete 3 surveys at baseline and after each 4-week treatment arm: 1) McGill Pain Scale, 2)
      visual analog scale, and 3) Short Form 36 (general quality of life data). Paired T-tests will
      be used to evaluate for statistically significant changes between treatment with the control
      gel versus the active ingredient gel containing the capsaicin.
