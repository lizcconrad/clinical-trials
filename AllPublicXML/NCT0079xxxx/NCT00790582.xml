    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II screening study of lithium carbonate in ALS. The purpose of this study is
      to find out if lithium carbonate is safe to be used in people with ALS and if it can slow the
      progression of the disease. Since there is no placebo in this study, all patients will be
      taking lithium carbonate.

      This is a Phase II Screening study. There is no placebo (inactive or 'fake' drug) in this
      study, meaning that all participants will be taking lithium carbonate. The purpose of this
      study is to find out if lithium carbonate is safe to be used in people with ALS and if it can
      slow the progression of the disease.

      A recent article was published in a highly regarded medical journal that showed a positive
      effect of lithium carbonate on an ALS type mouse. The researchers then studied a very small
      number of people with ALS, giving 16 people lithium carbonate with riluzole and giving 28
      people only riluzole. The people who took lithium remained stronger for a considerably longer
      period of time. However, the study was very small and we cannot really tell if lithium works
      unless a larger study is performed. It is not well understood why lithium carbonate might be
      helpful but it is believed that it may play a role in protecting the motor nerves from the
      damage of ALS.

      If you choose to participate, you will need to go to your study clinic for research study
      visits 7 times in one year and you will have 4 telephone interviews during that time. These
      visits and phone calls could take up to 17 hours in total.

      Caution: Lithium is an FDA approved drug used for some psychiatric disorders. It is not FDA
      approved for ALS. Lithium has many potentially serious side effects and must only be taken
      under close supervision of your physician.
