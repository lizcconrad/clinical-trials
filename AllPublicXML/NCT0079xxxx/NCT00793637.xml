  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many cases, the existing locking bolts and screws in intramedullary nails do not provide
      sufficient stability. Due to the play between screw and nail, the reduction can be lost and
      the instability can result in malunions, nonunions, or pseudoarthrosis. Consequently,
      secondary angular fracture dislocation (defined as a difference of the angle of 10° or more
      from the post-operative to the follow-up x-rays) can be observed in approximately 30% of
      patients after conventional intramedullary nailing of proximal third tibial fractures and in
      approximately 0-2% in patients with distal third tibial fractures. Therefore, an Angular
      Stable Locking System for Intramedullary Nails (ASLS) was developed to reduce the risk of
      secondary loss of reduction by providing axial and angular stability. ASLS provides angular
      stable fixation between nails and screws with resorbable sleeves used as dowels in the nail
      locking holes.

      The present study evaluates the handling of ASLS and the surgeon's compliance as well as any
      complications occurring during the baseline and the follow-up period in patients with
      proximal and distal tibial, femoral and humeral fractures treated with intramedullary nails.
      Furthermore, the relationship of any occurred complications to ASLS will be assessed.
