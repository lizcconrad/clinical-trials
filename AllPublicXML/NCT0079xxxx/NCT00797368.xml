  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent study has demonstrated that a physical therapist directed exercise program did not
      result in greater reductions in disability and pain when compared to a home exercise program.
      However, no manual therapy procedures were incorporated into the physical therapy treatment
      program despite recent evidence suggesting that thrust and non-thrust manual therapy
      techniques may be beneficial in reducing disability, pain and improving gait. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a physical therapy management
      approach consisting of manual therapy and exercise to a home program of exercise only. The
      investigators hypothesize that the group receiving manual therapy and exercise will have
      better outcomes.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A combination of physical examination and self-report measures will be used to assess
             the patient's potential eligibility according to each inclusion/exclusion criterion.

          -  The following inclusion criteria will be used to determine eligibility for this study:

               -  Primary complaint of ankle pain, status post inversion ankle sprain.

               -  The investigators decided to include patients with both acute and chronic ankle
                  sprains since our previous work has shown that patients from both stage have
                  exhibited positive benefits with manual therapy.66

               -  Age between 16-60 years old

               -  NPRS score &gt; 3 points (average score) over past 24 hrs.

               -  Does not meet criteria for needing radiographs per the Ottawa Ankle Rules

          -  The following exclusion criteria will be used to determine ineligibility for this
             study:

               -  Red flags noted in the patient's Medical Screening Questionnaire (i.e. tumor,
                  fracture, RA, osteoporosis, prolonged history of steroid use, severe vascular
                  disease, etc.)

               -  Prior surgery to the distal tibia, fibula, ankle joint, or rearfoot region
                  (proximal to the base of the metatarsals).

               -  Grade III ankle sprain (as defined by the West Point Ankle Sprain Grading System
                  and/or tenderness along the anterior medial malleolus as described by,51
                  fracture, or other absolute contraindications to manual therapy.

               -  Insufficient English language skills to complete all questionnaires

               -  Inability to comply with treatment and follow-up schedule
