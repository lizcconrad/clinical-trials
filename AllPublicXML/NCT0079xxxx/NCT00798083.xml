      To investigate if topical amitriptyline 2%, ketamine 1%, and lidocaine 5% in pluronic
      lecitine organogel (AKL in PLO gel) can improve management of neuropathic pain from radiation
      skin reactions adjunctively or better than standard treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Topical amitriptyline and ketamine and topical lidocaine alone have been shown to
           improve management of neuropathic pain in nonmalignant subjects. Anecdotal experience
           has shown improvement in use of all three topical drugs combined in radiation skin
           reactions. There currently is no research evidence for the use of all three compounded
           interventions. This study aims to target subjects with pain from radiation therapy who
           are not receiving adequate relief with standard interventions and may be eligible to
           receive this alternate intervention.

        2. Hypothesis:Topical AKL in PLO gel can effectively and safely reduce neuropathic pain
           experienced by patients with radiotherapy induced skin reactions.

        3. Justification: Standard treatment of painful radiation skin reactions such as moist
           desquamation consists of saline soaks, silver sulfadiazine and oral analgesics. However,
           sometimes the pain exceeds this standard intervention, patients are sulfa allergic or
           patients are intolerant to oral analgesics such as opioids. AKL in PLO gel is targeted
           for neuropathic pain and may be used alternatively to standard interventions. The
           participation rate will help to further estimate the feasibility of a larger sample size
           study to look at efficacy.
