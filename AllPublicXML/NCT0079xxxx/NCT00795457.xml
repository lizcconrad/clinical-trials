  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot vaccine study in adults with either WHO grade II astrocytoma,
      oligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma. The purpose of this study is test the safety and
      efficacy of an experimental tumor vaccine made from peptides and Montanide ISA-51 in
      combination with the study drug Poly-ICLC.

      Poly-ICLC, manufactured by Oncovir, Inc., has already been received and generally well
      tolerated by subjects in earlier studies and has been shown to decrease the size of brain
      tumors in some cases.

      The immunological and safety data will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical
      efficacy is warranted in each of two patient cohorts.

      All patients on the study will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, so that the actual
      2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates can be determined in
      an exploratory manner.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have documented pathological diagnosis of a WHO grade II astrocytoma
             or oligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma (see also the 4th bullet for
             oligodendroglioma).

          -  HLA-A2 positive based on flow cytometry.

          -  There will be 2 cohorts of patients based on whether patients have received prior RT.
             Cohort 1: patients must have undergone surgery or biopsy alone ≤16 weeks prior to
             study entry (no postoperative radiation or chemotherapy). Cohort 2: Patients received
             surgery or biopsy and radiation therapy (RT) (including fractionated external beam
             radiation therapy and/or stereotactic radiosurgery), which was completed ≥6 months
             prior to enrollment, and have a baseline MRI scan (within 4 weeks of the first
             vaccine) that shows stable disease or regression.

          -  For oligodendroglioma, at least one of the following three conditions has to be met:
             1) age ≥ 40 with any extent resection; 2) age 18-39 with incomplete resection (post-op
             MRI showing &gt; 1cm residual disease, based on the maximum dimension of residual T2 or
             FLAIR abnormality from the edge of the surgical cavity either laterally,
             antero-posteriorly, or supero-inferiorly) or 3) age 18-39 with neurosurgeon-defined
             GTR but the tumor size is ≥ 4 cm (the maximum preoperative tumor diameter, based on
             the axial and/or coronal T2 or FLAIR MR images). Participants must be ≥ 18 years old
             because the safety of each therapeutic component has not been established in children.

          -  All participants must sign an informed consent document indicating that they are aware
             of the investigational nature of this study.

          -  Participants must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60 (Appendix I).

          -  Documented negative serum beta HCG for female participants of child-bearing age. Males
             and females must agree, in the consent form, to use effective birth control methods
             during the course of vaccination. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the
             peptide based vaccine and poly-ICLC, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated in this study.

          -  Participants must be free of systemic infection

          -  Participants with adequate organ function as measured by white blood count ≥ 2500/mm3;
             lymphocytes ≥ 800/mm3; platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL, AST, ALT, GGT,
             LDH, alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit, and total bilirubin greater
             than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL, and serum creatinine within 1.5 X upper limit of normal
             limit. Coagulation tests PT and PTT have to be within normal limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of cranial or spinal leptomeningeal metastatic disease.

          -  Prior chemotherapy or anti-glioma therapy of any type other than radiation therapy
             (see 3.1.3)

          -  Concurrent treatment or medications including:

               -  Radiation therapy

               -  Chemotherapy

               -  Interferon

               -  Allergy desensitization injections

               -  Growth factors

               -  Interleukins

               -  Any investigational therapeutic medication

          -  Participants must not have had prior autoimmune disorders requiring cytotoxic or
             immunosuppressive therapy, or autoimmune disorders with visceral involvement.
             Participants with an active autoimmune disorder requiring these therapies are also
             excluded. Mild arthritis requiring NSAID medications will not be exclusionary.

          -  Use of immunosuppressives within 4 weeks prior to study entry or anticipated use of
             immunosuppressive agents. Dexamethasone, or other corticosteroid medications, if used
             perioperative period and/or during radiotherapy, must be tapered and discontinued at
             least 4 weeks before administration of the first vaccine. Topical corticosteroids and
             Inhaled steroids are acceptable.

          -  Participants who have another cancer diagnosis, except that the following diagnoses
             will be allowed:

               -  squamous cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis

               -  basal cell cancer of the skin without known metastasis

               -  carcinoma in situ of the breast (DCIS or LCIS)

               -  carcinoma in situ of the cervix

               -  any cancer without distant metastasis that has been treated successfully, without
                  evidence of recurrence or metastasis for over 5 years

          -  Participants with known addiction to alcohol or any drugs.

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are not expected to respond to this therapy,
             HIV positive patients are excluded from the study.
