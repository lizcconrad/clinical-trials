      The aim of the study is to evaluate urine NT-proBNP levels and new Echocardiographic Findings
      in VLBW infants. The investigators hypothesize that high urine NT-proBNP concentrations are
      associated with a hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus. The investigators also
      hypothesized that new echocardiographic parameters such as isovolumic relaxation time
      (IVRT)is useful for the prediction of ductus intervention.

      Urine samples were collected within 24 to 48 hours of age, on day 7, on day 14 and on day 28
      of life. The samples were spun and the platelet-free urine was stored at -80Â°C until
      NT-proBNP analysis. The NT-proBNP assay was performed with an automated immunoassay (Roche
      Diagnostics). Color Doppler and tissue Doppler echocardiography was determined at the same
      time as the urine collection. New echo parameters such as IVRT, tissue velocity, strain and
      strain rate were measured and compared with the standard parameters for significant ductus
      arteriosus. Furthermore we compared the tissue Doppler measurements with clinical findings.
