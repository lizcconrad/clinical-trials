  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether influenza can be reliably transmitted
      from children to susceptible contacts in a health care setting. The goal is to develop a
      transmission that can then be used to assess interventions to prevent transmission

      Research objectives:

      To develop a model to investigate the frequency of influenza transmission from an infected
      child to a susceptible health care worker

      Research Hypotheses:

      Influenza viruses can be transmitted from infected children to exposed health care workers

      CHildren with influenza infection presenting to ED will be identified by RAT. Healthy
      healthcare worker subjects will expose themselves and perform specific activities with the
      child.

      subjects will be followed by diary card, clinical symptom scores and virology swabs to assess
      frequency of transmission
