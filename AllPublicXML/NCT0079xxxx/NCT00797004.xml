      The purpose of this research is to improve understanding of the molecular and functional
      properties of the human olfactory system.

      The specific aims are:

        -  to determine the location of AC3 and Golf proteins in the human olfactory epithelium
           from freshly harvested nasal/sinus tissue of surgical patients

        -  to perform objective functional studies on fresh human nasal/sinus tissue using an
           electro-olfactogram (EOG) whic measures the electrical activity of olfactory sensory
           neurons in fresh biopsied tissue in response to odor or pheromone stimulation. An
           organotypic culture system for human tissue has been established to optimize the
           electrical signal acquisition.

        -  to correlate the AC3 and Golf expression profiles with pre-operative testing of human
           olfactory function

        -  to correlate the EOG findings with pre-operative testing of human olfactory function.

        -  to systematically evaluate the role of individual intranasal agents on olfaction to
           further optimize the electrical signal acquisition from olfactory tissue.

      This is a prospective cohort study. Subjects will be recruited from the group of patients at
      the University of Washington Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Clinic who will undergo
      endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis and other disorders of the nasal cavity and
      sinuses.

      Subjects will sign consent and complete a subjective smell test (UPSIT--University of
      Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test), and the SNOT-20 (Sinonasal Outcome Test-20)

      During their surgery, subjects will have two to four pieces of normally discarded tissue
      preserved for the study. Subjects will also have two to four pieces of healthy tissue removed
      (total size approximately that of a pencil eraser tip)depending on the type of surgery
      involved. The following procedures will be performed on these tissues:

        -  immunocytochemistry utilizing antibodies to AC3 and Golf to determine the patterns and
           levels of expression of these proteins

        -  two odorants, isoamyl acetate and citralva, to elicit odorant-induced activity from the
           human olfactory sensory neurons. The tissue will also be subjected to two putative human
           pheromones: 4,16-androstadiene-3-ol and 1,3,5(10),16-estrateraen-3-ol.

        -  application of six commonly used intranasal agents: 0.9% saline, 1:1000,000 epinephrine,
           0.05% oxymetazoline, 1% lidocaine, Zicam (0.12% zinc gluconate) and Nasocort AQ
           (triamcinolone acetate).
