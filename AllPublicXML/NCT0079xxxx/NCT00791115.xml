      The purpose of this study is to compare the location of the cancer found in the prostate
      gland after it is removed to the location that was predicted on the MRI scan during biopsy.
      In this way, we can better determine if the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was accurate,
      and if the MRI could be safely used to guide other types of treatments such as brachytherapy.
      We also plan to carefully measure how frequently surgery is able to completely remove the
      cancer, as well as the side effects and effectiveness of surgery after radiotherapy. The
      study will be coordinated and closely integrated with a separate concurrent study of
      MRI-guided prostate biopsy, which will be performed prior to accrual to this trial (UHN
      05-0641-C).

    <textblock>
      Two hundred and nineteen thousand new cases of prostate cancer have been projected in the
      Unites States for 2007, with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) constituting the mainstay of
      local therapy for an increasing proportion of newly diagnosed patients. Despite improvements
      in the delivery and reduction in associated toxicity of external beam radiotherapy, local
      persistence or recurrence of disease remains prevalent in 25-51% of patients. Local disease
      after EBRT is a risk factor for subsequent metastatic progression and prostate
      cancer-specific mortality, and is a cause of morbidity including hematuria, obstructive
      uropathy, and chronic pain. Given its prevalence, and the lack of satisfactory local salvage
      treatments, fear of prostate cancer recurrence has been shown to impose a substantial burden
      of suffering in patients.

      Stereotactic needle placement under MRI-guidance enables two critical steps in tumor-targeted
      brachytherapy: 1) directly guiding brachytherapy catheters to sites of tumor recurrence, and
      2) permitting treatment planning and delivery to be based on 3D MRI images. MRI-based HDR
      brachytherapy will precisely identify the location of brachytherapy catheters relative to the
      target volumes and adjacent normal structures at risk of radiation injury, obviating the need
      for invasive saturation (24-100) mapping biopsies.

      This study will build the evidence supporting the concept of tumor-targeted salvage HDR
      brachytherapy, by providing further histopathological validation of the method.
