      An open, prospective,single-site, non-randomized study of the efficacy and safety of T.R.U.E.
      TEST Panel 1.1, 2.1 and 3.1 allergens in children and adolescents. After consent and
      enrollment, the timeline is as follows:A. T.R.U.E. TEST panels 1.1, 2.1 ,3.1 will be applied
      to the skin on the subject's back. All patch test panels will remain at the back until
      removed at the #2 Clinic Visit that occurs 2 days later. B. Skin reactions to all patch test
      panel allergens will be evaluated and scored shortly after panel removal.C. Skin reactions
      will be evaluated and scored again at either 3 or 4 days after #1 Clinic Visit. An additional
      follow-up visit (#3B Clinic Visit) may occur days after day 0 if needed to verify skin
      reactions.D. Skin reactions will be evaluated and scored again at the #4 Clinic Visit, which
      will occur 7 days +/- 2 days after #1 Clinic Visit (day 0). E. A follow up visit will take
      place approximately 3 weeks (21 + 2 days) after #1 Clinic Visit (day 0) to record any late or
      persistent reactions, and any adverse events. Investigators may elect to perform this
      evaluation via telephone if no reactions are present.

          -  Informed consent must be signed and understood by subject. If underage, informed
             consent must be signed and understood by parent or legal guardian, consistent with all
             institutional, local and national regulations.

             days.

          -  Subjects currently receiving (or received during the previous 3 weeks) other
             investigational drugs, treatments or devices, or participating in another clinical
             study.

          -  Treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light (including tanning) during the previous 3 weeks.

          -  Acute dermatitis outbreak or dermatitis on or near the test area on the back.

          -  Subjects unable to comply with activity restrictions (e.g., protecting test panels
             from excess moisture due to showering or vigorous activity).

          -  Subjects unable or unwilling to comply with multiple return visits.

          -  Female subjects 15 years of age (or with onset of menarche) and older unable to
