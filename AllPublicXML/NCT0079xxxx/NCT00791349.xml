      The purpose of this study is to assess the cardiovascular safety of paliperidone in patients
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, with particular attention to the length of
      the QT/QTc interval, to measure and review other electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, such as
      QRS and PR intervals, to explore the relationship between the pharmacokinetics of
      paliperidone and ECG parameters of interest, and to explore the safety and tolerability of
      paliperidone

      This is a multicenter, placebo- and positive-controlled, randomized study consisting of 3
      periods: a screening period of up to 14 days (including a 5-day washout period), a
      double-blind period of 10 days (including the treatment phase [Days 1 to 8] and the
      posttreatment phase [Days 9 and 10]), and an end-of-study evaluation. Eligible patients will
      be randomly assigned to treatment with either paliperidone or moxifloxacin. Patients randomly
      assigned to receive paliperidone will receive placebo on Day 1, paliperidone 4 mg on Day 2,
      paliperidone 6 mg on Day 3, and paliperidone 8 mg on Days 4 through 8. Patients assigned to
      receive moxifloxacin will receive placebo on Days 1 through 7 and moxifloxacin 400 mg on Day
      8. The moxifloxacin treatment group will provide a concurrent active control to confirm that
      the study is adequate to detect a drug effect (i.e., assay sensitivity) on QTc interval.
      Baseline ECGs will be recorded on the last day of the washout period (Day 1). Serial time
      matched 12 lead ECG triplicate readings will be recorded on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (predose), 8,
      9, and 10. This study is being conducted to thoroughly assess potential QT/QTc interval
      changes following administration of paliperidone. The results from this safety study, along
      with the ECG results from all paliperidone clinical studies, will be used in the evaluation
      of the cardiovascular safety of paliperidone. Paliperidone IR orally once daily: 4 mg on Day
      2, 6 mg on Day 3, and 8 mg on Days 4 through 8; Active control: a single oral dose of
      moxifloxacin 400 mg on Day 8

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as defined
             by DSM-IV criteria, with no exacerbation of psychosis for at least 3 months prior to
             screening

          -  Patients must have a normal 12-lead ECG at screening and on Day -1, including: Normal
             sinus rhythm (heart rate between 50 and 100 beats per minute)

          -  QTcB interval &lt; = 430 msec for men, &lt; = 450 msec for women

          -  QRS interval &lt;110 msec, PR interval &lt; 200 msec

          -  Patients must weigh &gt; = 50 kg ( &gt; = 110 lb), with a body mass index &gt; = 18 and &lt; = 35
             kg/m2

          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal (for at least 1 year), surgically sterile, or
             practicing an effective non-hormonal method of birth control (e.g., intrauterine
             device, double-barrier method, male partner sterilization, abstinence) before entry
             and throughout the study

          -  must have a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test at
