    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multiple-dose, randomized, two-period crossover bioequivalence study
      in approximately 110 surgically or naturally postmenopausal women on stable hormone therapy
      (i.e., estrogen for surgically postmenopausal women or a continuous regimen of estrogen plus
      progestin for naturally postmenopausal women) restricted to approved oral or transdermal
      regimens only, or not on concomitant hormone therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  be a surgically postmenopausal female between 20 and 70 years of age who had a
             hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 months prior to screening, or be a
             healthy naturally postmenopausal female between 50 and 70 years of age who had
             experienced amenorrhea for at least 12 months prior to screening;

          -  be in good general health based on medical history, physical examination, and
             laboratory evaluation;

          -  have had a mammogram, with no clinically significant abnormalities, within the
             preceding 12 months in subjects &gt; 40 years of age;

          -  be on a stable dose of approved hormone therapy restricted to oral or transdermal
             regimens (vaginal products are not acceptable) for a period of at least 12 weeks prior
             to screening:

               -  estrogen only for surgically postmenopausal women, or

               -  estrogen only for naturally postmenopausal women who have been hysterectomized,
                  or

               -  a continuous regimen of estrogen plus progestin for naturally postmenopausal
                  women who have not been hysterectomized

        or not be on any hormone therapy (having stopped hormone therapy at least 12 weeks prior to
        screening;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have any uncontrolled acute diseases or had a major surgical operation requiring
             hospitalization within 1 month of screening;

          -  have uncontrolled or chronic diseases, such as hypertension (with diastolic blood
             pressure &gt; 95 mm Hg on medication), systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid
             arthritis;

          -  have a history of myocardial infarction, bypass surgery, stroke, pulmonary embolism,
             or deep vein thrombosis;

          -  have a history of cancer within the last 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma with
             a documented 6 month remission), abnormal vaginal bleeding, or tuberculosis;

          -  have uncontrolled diabetes mellitus with HbA1C &gt; 7.5% (Note: only subjects who have
             diabetes mellitus or a fasting serum glucose level at the screening visit above the
             laboratory's upper limit of normal for the reference range will have HbA1C tested
             prior to randomization.);

          -  have any abnormal clinical laboratory values at screening assessed as clinically
             significant by the Investigator;

          -  have a serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value outside the normal laboratory
             range, confirmed by free T4 levels outside the normal laboratory range;

          -  have current severe dermatological problems (e.g., severe or cystic acne), including
             concomitant skin disease or a history of drug-induced contact dermatitis;

          -  have participated in a cumulative irritation test within the past 12 weeks, or have a
             known or suspected hypersensitivity or allergy to any transdermal systems including
             components of the patches used in this study;

          -  currently use or have a history of any androgen treatment within 6 months prior to
             screening, or use dehydroepiandrosterone 25 mg per day, or St. John's Wort within 4
             weeks prior to baseline. Due to the large number of herbal remedies available, all
             other herbal supplements will be reviewed by the Sponsor during screening;
