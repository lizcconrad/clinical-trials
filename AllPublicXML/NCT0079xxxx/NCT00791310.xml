  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to estimate a procedure where the biological samples
      routinely obtained at the site of suspected infection could be guided by the early
      realization of a TEP with FDG coupled to scanner X, in patients hospitalized in ICU for
      severe sepsis of unspecified etiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis constitutes the leading cause of mortality in ICU, in particular because a
      microbial documentation is lacking in about half of the cases.

      Tomography by emission of positons, which uses the property of activated macrophages and
      leucocytes to collect 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose may prove useful to identify the site(s) of
      infection and then guide sampling.

      Thirty patients will be included over 12 months.

      Within 24 hours after admission, patients presented with a severe sepsis of still unknown
      etiology will benefit from the realization of a morphoTEP, including an examination MtOe with
      the FDG, associated with a conventional scanner X.

      Suspected infected sites will then be the subject of sampling when possible. These samples
      will be send for microbial culture, histology and TREM-1 expression (membrane-bound and
      soluble form) when appropriate.

      The main judgement criteria will be the percentage of the MtOe exams proved to be useful for
      diagnosis and/or associated with therapeutic modifications.

      This pilot study will make it possible to evaluate the interest of the early realization of a
      TEP/scanner X examination among severe sepsis patients of unknown origin.
