    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the effect (good and bad) of a dendritic cell/tumor fusion
      vaccine in combination with the laboratory made agents GM-CSF and imiquimod on the
      participants immune system. Another purpose of this study is to determine the type and
      severity of any side effects associated with this new study vaccine. We will also be
      evaluating what effect the vaccine has on the participants cancer. Dendritic cell vaccines
      have already been tested in clinical trials involving participants with many different types
      of cancer. Dendritic cells are powerful immune-stimulating cells that are normally found in
      small amounts in the body and are responsible for immune responses against &quot;foreign&quot;
      substances that enter the body.

      -  Patients must have undergone therapeutic debulking surgery for independent clinical
           indications and have tissue frozen and stored under sterile conditions as part of
           protocol 07-319 (Study of Primary Tumor Harvest for the Purpose of Possible Use in a
           Future Clinical Trial in Patients with Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal
           Cancer)

        -  Participants will be assigned to one of two study groups. Both groups will undergo a
           procedure known as leukapheresis by which the white blood cells are removed from the
           participants blood in order to obtain the dendritic cells. Prior to this procedure
           participants may receive 4 injections of GM-CSF, which helps increase the white blood
           cell count.

        -  If enough cells are obtained during the leukapheresis, tumor cells and dendritic cells
           will then be fused (mixed) together in the laboratory and divided into the appropriate
           doses for administration.

        -  Participants assigned to Group 1 will undergo subcutaneous vaccination with the
           dendritic cell tumor fusion vaccine. On the day of the vaccine and three days
           afterwards, they will receive GM-CSF injections at the site of the vaccination.
           Participants will receive a dose of the vaccine every 3 weeks for a total of 3
           vaccinations.

        -  Participants assigned to Group 2 will undergo subcutaneous vaccination with the
           dendritic cell tumor fusion vaccine. On the day of the vaccine and three days
           afterwards, they will receive GM-CSF injection at the site of the vaccination.
           Additionally, imiquimod cream will be applied to the skin at the injection sight 2 hours
           before the vaccine administration. Participants will continue to apply imiquimod cream
           at the site of vaccination for 3 days following the injection. Participants will receive
           a dose of the vaccine every 3 weeks for a total of 3 vaccinations.
