  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the investigators research is to see if variants in a particular gene (named
      CYP2B6) affect how the body metabolizes (breaks down) certain medications, including the drug
      bupropion. Bupropion is widely used in the treatment of depression and for helping people
      quit smoking. Genes are portions of DNA that code for particular proteins in the body. The
      investigators are studying the gene that codes for a protein called CYP2B6. Differences in
      the structure of the gene are called variants and may mean that a person metabolizes a drug
      faster or slower than a person with a different variant.

      Bupropion is widely used in the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation. It's most
      abundant metabolite, hydroxybupropion, may be responsible for most of the therapeutic effect
      of bupropion under conditions of long term dosing. Because the primary enzyme involved in
      metabolism of bupropion to hydroxybupropion is the liver enzyme CYP2B6, we propose to study
      the effect of different CYP2B6 genotypes on the metabolism of bupropion. These data will
      guide the use of genotypes as a surrogate for measuring drug blood levels in studying genetic
      determinants of outcomes for bupropion treatment.

      A minimum of Forty-four subjects with 4 different CYP2B6 genotypes will participate in a
      7-day study in which they take bupropion as outpatients for 6 days (to achieve steady state
      drug levels) and then come to the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) Clinical Research
      Center for a 1-day admission during which multiple blood and urine samples will be collected
      for pharmacokinetic analysis.
