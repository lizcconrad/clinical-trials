      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect and the side effect profile of
      irinotecan and panitumumab administered every 3 weeks as 3rd line treatment for patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer without KRAS mutations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent types of cancer in Denmark with approximately
      3,400 diagnosed patients per year. The prognosis for these patients is still very poor and
      more than half of them will develop metastatic disease and thus be candidates for
      chemotherapy.

      In Denmark 5-FU and Oxaliplatin or Irinotecan has been used for several years either as
      combination or mono therapy. In recent years biological antibodies targeted against EGFR have
      been added to this treatment. A newly developed antibody is Panitumumab, which enables
      treatment every 3 weeks instead of weekly administration.

      The effect of EGFR activation is mediated through intracellular pathways involving the KRAS
      protein. It has been proven that a mutation of KRAS causes the KRAS protein to be constantly
      activated, and patients with these mutations do not benefit from antibodies against EGFR.
      Approximately 40% of the patients present these mutations.
