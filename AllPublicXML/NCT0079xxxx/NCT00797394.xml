  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of 2007RD01, a natural extract,
      and saw palmetto lipidic extract, is more effective at treating lower urinary tract symptoms
      associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia than saw palmetto lipidic extract alone.
