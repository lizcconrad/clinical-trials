  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissue transfer flaps are a method of moving tissue from a donor location to a recipient
      location. In the case of a free tissue transfer flaps, the blood vessels to the transferred
      tissues are detached and then re-attached to different arteries and veins at the recipient
      site. The process of reconstructive surgery using tissue transfer flaps is not without
      complications. These complications may include acute arterial or venous occlusion, as well as
      the development of late complications such as fat necrosis and flap atrophy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researchers developed a safe, non-contact, intra-operative and post-operative device
      called Modulated Imaging, can detect changes in a flap's optical properties and can correlate
      with arterial or venous occlusion or with the development of fat necrosis or flap atrophy.
