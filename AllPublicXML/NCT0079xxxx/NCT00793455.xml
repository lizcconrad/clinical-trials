  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patient outreach is effective at increasing
      compliance with preventive screenings ordered by their physician. We hypothesize that
      educational outreach may increase completion rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We designed an intervention to focus on patients who have received and accepted a referral
      for colonoscopy, yet have exhibited some barriers to screening as demonstrated by a lack of
      screening completion. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a
      multicomponent intervention (patient reminder, print and multimedia materials) on colorectal
      screening completion among this target population.

    <time_frame>3 months post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>We reviewed electronic health records of participants 3 months post randomization to ascertain outcome. We looked for one or both of the following (1) note in free text MD note documenting receipt of one form of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening during study period (2)lab results from fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy.
Participants were categorized as completing CRC screening if there was a lab result or physician note located in chart during study period. If no note or lab result was found in chart, then the participant was categorized as not completing CRC screening.</description>
