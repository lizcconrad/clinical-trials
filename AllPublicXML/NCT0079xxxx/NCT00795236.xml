  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about abnormal body rhythms in blind boys and
      girls that keep them from falling asleep at bed-time or cause them difficulty staying alert
      during the day. The investigators hope to learn if there are any differences between the body
      rhythms of girls and boys. The investigators also want to investigate whether age or puberty
      have an effect on body rhythms.

      Subjects will be asked to collect saliva samples in their home hourly throughout the daytime,
      approximately every 2 weeks. Subjects may be monitored for up to a year, after which they
      will be discontinued from the study. If subjects are found to be naturally entrained to the
      24-hour day, they will be monitored longitudinally for changes. Subjects will be discontinued
      after their monitoring period is over or after an entrained status has been confirmed. While
      no specific time commitment is required, we hope most subjects will participant for 4 months
      - 2 years.
