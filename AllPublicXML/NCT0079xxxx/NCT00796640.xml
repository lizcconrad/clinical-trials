  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bioavailability of 2 extended release
      paliperidone pellet formulations under fasting and fed conditions with a 2 mg paliperidone
      oral solution under fasting conditions. Additional objectives are to compare the
      pharmacodynamic effects (postural changes in blood pressure and heart rate), to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of each treatment, and to explore the relationship between CYP2D6
      genotype and paliperidone exposure.

      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, 5-way crossover Phase 1 study in non-smoking
      healthy men and women, aged between 18 and 55 years. The study consists of a screening
      period; a 5-way crossover, open-label treatment phase with 14 days washout between
      treatments; and end-of-study evaluations upon completion or at early withdrawal. Eligible
      volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 5 treatment sequences. Each volunteer will
      receive the following treatments in random order: (A) paliperidone ER pellet formulation-1,
      as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg, under fasting conditions; (B) paliperidone ER pellet formulation-1,
      as capsule of 2.5 mg with food (high-fat breakfast); (C) paliperidone ER pellet formulation-2
      as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg, under fasting conditions; (D) paliperidone ER pellet formulation-2 as
      1 capsule of 2.5 mg with food (high-fat breakfast); (E) immediate release (IR) paliperidone
      oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1-mg/mL solution, under fasting conditions. Alternative
      paliperidone ER formulations are being developed with the aim to increase bioavailability and
      reduce variability, without compromising the favorable effect on orthostatic hypotension as
      seen with ER OROS paliperidone. Therefore, in this study, the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamic properties, as well as the effect of food, of 2 alternative paliperidone ER
      pellet formulations will be investigated. Safety and tolerability will be monitored
      throughout the study.. Single doses of paliperidone ER pellet formulation-1, as 1 capsule of
      2.5 mg, fasted; paliperidone ER pellet formulation-1, as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg with food
      (high-fat breakfast); paliperidone ER pellet formulation-2 as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg, fasted;
      paliperidone ER pellet formulation-2 as 1 capsule of 2.5 mg with food (high-fat breakfast);
      IR paliperidone oral solution, 2 mg (2 mL) of a 1-mg/mL solution, fasted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (weight [kg]/height (m)²) range of 18.0 to 28.0 kg/m², inclusive

          -  Normotensive with supine (5 minutes) blood pressure between 100 and 140 mmHg systolic,
             inclusive, and diastolic between 60 and 90 mmHg, inclusive

          -  Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history,
             electrocardiogram, and the laboratory results of blood biochemistry, hematology and
             urinalysis performed within 21 days before the first dose. If the results of the
             biochemistry, hematology or urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's
             reference ranges the volunteer can be included only if the investigator judges that
             the deviations are not clinically significant. For liver function tests (alanine
             transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and bilirubin), the values must be contained
             within 2 times the upper limits of the normal laboratory reference ranges and for
             renal function tests, the values must be within the normal laboratory reference ranges

             effective method of birth control (e.g., prescription oral contraceptives,
             contraceptive injections, intrauterine device, double-barrier method, contraceptive
             patch, male partner sterilization and at the discretion of the investigator, total
             abstinence) before entry and throughout the study, as well as have a negative serum
             pregnancy test at screening. To ensure continued eligibility, women must have a

          -  Relevant history of any cardiovascular, respiratory, neuropsychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal (including surgeries, and malabsorption problems), endocrine, or
             immunologic diseases

          -  A decrease of greater than or equal to 20 mmHg systolic blood pressure 3 minutes after
             standing, or with symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness or fainting upon standing at

          -  Positive result for any of the serology tests (hepatitis B, C and HIV)

          -  Have less than 1 bowel movement on average each day
