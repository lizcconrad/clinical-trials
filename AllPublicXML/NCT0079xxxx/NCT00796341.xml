  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implantation of the human embryo is the limiting factor in the success of
      invitro-fertilization and embryo transfer(IVF-ET).We wanted to find out whether creating a
      local injury to the endometrium in the non-transfer cycle would improve the IVF-ET outcome in
      the subsequent cycle.We believe that the injury created causes release of substances which
      help in implantation.

      Study Design and Subjects: This is a randomized control study designed to evaluate the effect
      of local injury to the endometrium in non-transfer cycle in patients with previous failed
      IVF.

      Patients will be randomly allotted to control and intervention group The patients in the
      intervention group Pipelle endometrial sampling 7-10th day and 24-26th day in the cycle prior
      to IVF transfer cycle.

      Outcome Measures: Clinical pregnancy rate,implantation rate and ongoing pregnancy rate.

      SAMPLE SIZE: 100 PATIENTS (50 in each group).
