    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to detect new ischemic lesions after carotid artery stenting
      (with the Cristallo Ideale stent), in patients with high grade carotid artery stenosis, by
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), using the endovascular proximal flow
      blockage (Mo.Ma device) for cerebral protection.

    <description>Single arm Study in which 120 patients fulfilling eligibility criteria will be screened and undergo carotid stenting with the Cristallo ideale™ carotid stent after placement of the Mo.Ma device as cerebral protection system. The technique of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) will be used to identify new ischemic lesions.</description>

    <description>The MO.MA is a cerebral protection catheter based on the proximal flow blockage concept which is achieved by endovascular clamping of Common Carotid Artery (CCA) and External Carotid Artery (ECA). The MO.MA proximal flow blockage cerebral protection device is indicated to be used in patients eligible for carotid angioplasty and/or the carotid bifurcation and is aimed to prevent brain embolism during the stenting procedure.
For the purpose of this study the Cristallo Ideale™ Carotid Stent System (Invatec S.R.L. Roncadelle, Italy) will be exclusively used. Cristallo Ideale™ consists of a carotid dedicated self-expanding stent pre-mounted on a rapid exchange delivery catheter. The stent platform is made of a Nitinol alloy and characterized by a hybrid design with closed cell in the central zone and open cell in both end zones (proximal and distal).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. ≥ 18 years old;

          2. Eligibility for carotid artery revascularization;

          3. A significant stenosis in symptomatic patients with ≥ 50% Diameter Stenosis (%DS) or
             asymptomatic ≥ 80 %DS as defined by angiography.

             Symptomatic is defined as a carotid artery stenosis associated with ipsilateral TIA,
             amaurosis fugax, ischemic stroke or retinal infarction within 6 months prior to
             enrollment.

          4. Suitable clinical conditions to perform DW-MRI.

          5. Written informed consent as approved by the Ethics Committee of the respective
             clinical site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female with childbearing potential without a negative pregnancy test.

          2. Life-expectancy less than 6 months.

          3. Underlying disease of the carotid artery other than atherosclerosis (e.g. vasculitis,
             traumatic dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia).

          4. Prior stenting in the target vessel;

          5. Patients with chronic or re-current atrial fibrillation.

          6. Patient has had a Myocardial Infarction within 72 hours prior to the procedure.

          7. Patient experienced a stroke within 4 weeks prior to the procedure.

          8. History of severe disabling stroke according to the modified Rankin scale &gt; 4.

          9. Severe renal failure (serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL).

         10. Severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease, which might impede a safe introduction
             of a 9F-sheath for the use of a Mo.Ma-device.

         11. Any known allergies and / or intolerances to the following: ASA, Clopidogrel, Statins,
             Heparin, Nitinol, contrast agents (that cannot be adequately pre-medicated).

         12. Patient currently participating in an investigational drug or device study which has
             not reached the primary endpoint yet or which clinically interferes with the DESERVE
             study endpoints.

         13. Any planned major surgery within 30 days after the study procedure.

         14. In the investigators opinion patient has a severe co-morbid condition(s) that could
             limit the ability to participate in the study.

             Angiographic exclusion criteria:

         15. Totally occluded internal carotid artery considered as the target vessel.

         16. Multiple internal carotid artery stenoses or lesion longer than 4 cm (whichever
             occurs) that cannot be covered by one (1) stent.

         17. Severe ostial stenosis of the common carotid artery.

         18. The presence of ipsilateral intracranial stenosis that requires treatment.

         19. Contralateral occlusion of the internal carotid arteries associated with a poor
             collateral flow through the circle of Willis.

         20. An aortic arch anatomical complexity that may preclude the safe placement of the Mo.Ma
             device including particularly, the impossibility to navigate a stiff guide wire into
             the external carotid artery.
