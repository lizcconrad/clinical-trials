  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional modes of ventilation have failed to improve patient survival. Subsequent
      observations that elevated airway pressures observed in traditional forms of ventilation
      resulted in barotrauma and extension of ALI lead to the evolution of low volume cycled
      ventilation as a potentially better ventilatory modality for ARDS. Recent multicenter trials
      by the NIH-ARDS network have confirmed that low volume ventilation increases the number of
      ventilatory free days and improves overall patient survival. While reducing mean airway
      pressure has reduced barotrauma and improved patient survival, it has impaired attempts to
      improve alveolar recruitment. Alveolar recruitment is important as it improves V/Q mismatch,
      allows reduction in FIO2 earlier, and decreases the risk of oxygen toxicity. Airway pressure
      release ventilation (APRV) is a novel ventilatory modality that utilizes controlled positive
      airway pressure to maximize alveolar recruitment while minimizing barotrauma. In APRV, tidal
      ventilation occurs between the increase in lung volumes established by the application of
      CPAP and the relaxation of lung tissue following pressure release. Preliminary studies have
      suggested that APRV recruits collapsed alveoli and improves oxygenation through a restoration
      of pulmonary mechanics, but there are no studies indicating the potential overall benefit of
      APRV in recovery form ALI/ADRS.
