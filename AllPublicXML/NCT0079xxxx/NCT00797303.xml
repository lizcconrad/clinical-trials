    <textblock>
      Eight patients with corneal neovascularization were treated with subconjunctival injection of
      1.25 mg bevacizumab and had a follow-up of at least 2 months. All patients had persistent
      corneal neovascularization for at least 6 months unresponsive to other treatments. Patients
      were monitored by ophthalmic exam and anterior segment photography.
