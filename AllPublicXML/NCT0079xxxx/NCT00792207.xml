      Hypothesis: Overweight subjects using a Virtual Coach will demonstrate improved adherence to
      an exercise regime.

      This study is designed to examine the effect of a computer program called a &quot;Virtual Coach&quot;
      and find out if it helps people become more active. This program acts as a kind of a personal
      trainer and will give you feedback. All participants in the study will receive an activity
      monitor to wear during the study and a website to use to track activity. Half of the
      participants will also receive the virtual coach software. This software will have to be
      downloaded onto your computer, and we will ask that you check in with the coach using the
      software three times a week for 12 weeks. The group you will be placed in will be selected by
      chance.
