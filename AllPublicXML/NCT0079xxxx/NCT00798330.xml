      Patients who are preparing to receive chemotherapy are asked to have their teeth cleaned
      before starting treatment as standard of care. This research study is being done to see if
      having dental cleaning increases the chances of bacteria from the mouth getting into the
      blood stream. It is also being done to see if these bacteria can cause blood stream
      infections in people who have a Central Venous Catheter (CVC),often called a &quot;port&quot; or a
      &quot;PICC&quot;, placed for giving chemotherapy. It is a well-established fact that we introduce
      bacteria from the mouth into the bloodstream with activities of daily life including chewing,
      flossing and brushing teeth. This introduction of bacteria into the blood stream may cause
      bacteria to stick to the central venous catheter and serve as a source of infection when the
      immune system is weakened by cancer. The purpose of this research study is to see if we can
      find bacteria from mouth in blood that is drawn through the CVC, during, and after a dental
      cleaning procedure. This way, we will be able to assess whether or not this is a potential
      health risk to cancer patients.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Patients willing and able to provide written informed consent for the study.

          -  Patients diagnosed with cancer and being treated at the University of Connecticut
             Health Center.

          -  Patients scheduled to receive or who have received a central venous catheter

          -  Patients who have at least one tooth.

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Patients under the age of 18

          -  Patients who have received any antibacterial in the time period starting 48 hours
             before the dental cleaning. This includes systemic antibacterials and topical
             antibacterials in the oral cavity or at/through the CVC site. (Topical antibacterials
             at other sites are allowed; antifungal and antiviral agents in any form are allowed).

          -  Patients who plan to use antibacterials within the 24 hours after the procedure (until
             the final blood sample is obtained).

          -  Patients with a documented blood stream infection within 1 month prior to proposed
             dental cleaning.

          -  Patients with a clinically significant coagulation disorder or patients on warfarin.

          -  Patients who require antibiotic prophylaxis as per American College of
             Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2007 guidelines, namely;

          -  patients who have had a cardiac transplantation,

          -  incomplete cardiac valve repair,

          -  complete cardiac valve repair in last 6 months,

          -  prior history of infective endocarditis ,

          -  patients with a prosthetic cardiac valve.

          -  Patients with any other condition which might preclude participation in the opinion of
             the patient's physician(s) or the study PI's.
