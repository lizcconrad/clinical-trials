      The purposes of this study are to characterize the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone after
      single- and multiple-dose administration of paliperidone ER in children and adolescent
      patients (&gt;= 10 to &lt;= 17 years of age) with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or
      schizophreniform disorder and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of paliperidone ER in
      this patient population.

      The current study is designed as a multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose study in children
      and adolescent patients &gt;= 10 to &lt;= 17 years of age with schizophrenia, schizoaffective
      disorder, or schizophreniform disorder. The study includes 3 dosage groups (0.086, 0.129, and
      0.171 mg/kg/day paliperidone ER), which will be studied in a sequential ascending design, so
      that the safety of the drug can be properly evaluated with a lower dosage before proceeding
      to the next higher dosage. The 3 dosages are approximately 6, 9, and 12 mg/day in adults.
      Within each dosage group, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 pharmacokinetic
      sampling schedules in a 1:1 ratio. For each dosage group, the study consists of a screening
      phase (for a maximum of 21 days); a 2-day, single-dose pharmacokinetic and tolerability
      evaluation phase; a 7-day multiple-dose phase, with evaluation of pharmacokinetics and
      tolerability; and an end-of-study visit. Following the completion of all patients in a given
      dosage group, the sponsor will evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment, in
      order to determine whether to proceed to the next higher or lower dosage level. The first
      group will start at 0.086 mg/kg/day. The hypothesis is that paliperidone ER will be well
      tolerated in children and adolescent patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
      or schizophreniform disorder, and will display the expected pharmacokinetic characteristics
      in this population. Paliperidone ER 0.086, 0.129, and 0.171 mg/kg/day, oral administration,
      single dose on Day 1 of study followed by once daily dosing on Days 3 to 9.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients' height and weight must be within the 5th to 95th Physical Growth National
             Center for Health Statistics percentiles for age and sex

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of schizophrenia of any subtype (295.10

          -  295.20

          -  295.30

          -  295.60

          -  295.90), schizoaffective disorder (295.70), or schizophreniform disorder (295.40),
             according to the DSM-IV-TR

          -  Patients must be healthy (other than the DSM-IV-TR classification), on the basis of
             the screening medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, and clinical
             laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis). Patients with
             laboratory results outside the normal reference range can be included only if the
             investigator, upon consultation with the sponsor, judges the deviations as not
             clinically significant

          -  QT values must be within normal limits and patients must have a CGI-S score of less
             than or equal to 3

          -  Female patients must be premenarchal, surgically sterile, abstinent, or, if sexually
             active, be practicing an effective method of birth control (e.g., prescription oral
             contraceptives, contraceptive injections, intrauterine device, double-barrier method,
             contraceptive patch, male partner sterilization) for at least 1 month before study
             entry and throughout the study, have a negative serum beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin pregnancy test at screening, and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1

             investigational site at each visit

          -  Patients must agree to be hospitalized at any time during the study, and their
