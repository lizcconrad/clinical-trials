  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common health condition in the United States resulting in
      more than 200,000 surgical procedures annually. The field of rhinology has had two major
      advances which the investigators believe make more accurate prediction of postoperative
      outcome possible thereby offering the potential of reducing the frequency of unsuccessful
      surgical procedures. The first advance is the development of validated disease-specific
      quality of life instruments for measuring outcome of CRS management. The major medical
      societies now recognize disease-specific quality of life as the gold standard for assessing
      outcomes in this disease and for the purposes of this study, the investigators define
      surgical outcome as change in disease-specific quality of life (QOL). The second advance is
      the better understanding of the pathological process resulting in CRS. The previous construct
      defined this disease as anatomic obstruction of the sinuses and their secretions. This was
      thought to be best measured by CT scan which has been the main method of attempting to select
      the best candidates for surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that utilizing this new conceptual framework, the investigators
      can better predict surgical outcomes. The investigators will examine several preoperative
      factors and their relationship to surgical outcome. The factors to be examined include
      measures of the pathophysiological components of inflammation and anatomic obstruction as
      well as preoperative extent of disease as measured by preoperative disease-specific quality
      of life. The investigators hypothesize that these factors provide complimentary information
      that may be variably expressed in individual CRS patients. Therefore, the investigators
      hypothesize that a novel integration of multiple preoperative factors will form a useful
      predictive model of surgical outcome. Finally this prospective study provides the opportunity
      to add to the field by identifying potentially novel risk factors and comorbidities as well
      as study secondary outcomes of sinus surgery including olfactory function and general health
      related quality of life in a systematic manner.

      A cohort of 500+ patients with CRS undergoing sinus surgery at three centers will be
      prospectively enrolled. Patient demographics, comorbidity data, objective testing, and QOL
      evaluation will occur preoperatively and outcomes (QOL and olfactory testing) will be
      measured 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively. Determinants of change in QOL will be analyzed
      by univariate and multivariate methods including construction of a multivariate predictive
      model.

      This proposal focuses on patients undergoing surgical intervention for the management of CRS.
      The findings can potentially be applied to the 200,000 patients annually undergoing sinus
      surgery and in working toward the long-term goal of developing a comprehensive system for
      measuring extent of disease so that disease severity and treatment response can be rigorously
      quantified in the 30 million patients with CRS.
