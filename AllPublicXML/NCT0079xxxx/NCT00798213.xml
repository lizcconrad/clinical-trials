    <textblock>
      Participants with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) will be randomized to SCH 727965 or
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin. All participants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will receive
      SCH 727965. Part 1 of the study will determine the activity of SCH 727965 treatment in
      participants with AML and participants with ALL. Part 2 of the study will determine the
      activity of SCH 727965 treatment in participants with AML who experienced disease progression
      after standard treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin during Part 1.
