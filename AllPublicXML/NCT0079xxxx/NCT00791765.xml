    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) measures the extent of psoriasis involvement and the severity of erythema, infiltration, and desquamation of the scalp. Involvement and severity of psoriasis for the PSSI is scored by physicians using a scale from 0 to 72, where 0 = no psoriasis, and higher scores indicating more severe disease. The PSSI calculation does not include the face or neck area.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With PSSI 75% Response at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants achieving at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) at Week 12. The Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) measures the extent of psoriasis involvement and the severity of erythema, infiltration, and desquamation of the scalp. Involvement and severity of psoriasis for the PSSI is scored by physicians using a scale from 0 to 72, where 0 = no psoriasis, and higher scores indicating more severe disease. The PSSI calculation does not include the face or neck area. PSSI 75 indicates at least a 75% improvement in the PSSI score from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in PSSI at Week 24 in Participants Switching From Placebo to Etanercept at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from baseline in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) in participants switching from placebo to etanercept at Week 12 (Group B) at Week 24. The PSSI measures the extent of psoriasis involvement and the severity of erythema, infiltration, and desquamation of the scalp. Involvement and severity of psoriasis for the PSSI is scored by physicians using a scale from 0 to 72, where 0 = no psoriasis, and higher scores indicate more severe disease. The PSSI calculation does not include the face or neck area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction With Treatment at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This response scale was adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study: Patient Satisfaction Survey. To assess satisfaction with treatment, the participant was asked to check a box (from &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; to &quot;very satisfied&quot;) to indicate his or her level of satisfaction with the medication's control of psoriasis.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index at Week 12</title>
        <description>The Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) measures the extent of psoriasis involvement and the severity of erythema, infiltration, and desquamation of the scalp. Involvement and severity of psoriasis for the PSSI is scored by physicians using a scale from 0 to 72, where 0 = no psoriasis, and higher scores indicating more severe disease. The PSSI calculation does not include the face or neck area.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in PSSI at Week 24 in Participants Switching From Placebo to Etanercept at Week 12</title>
        <description>Percent change from baseline in Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) in participants switching from placebo to etanercept at Week 12 (Group B) at Week 24. The PSSI measures the extent of psoriasis involvement and the severity of erythema, infiltration, and desquamation of the scalp. Involvement and severity of psoriasis for the PSSI is scored by physicians using a scale from 0 to 72, where 0 = no psoriasis, and higher scores indicate more severe disease. The PSSI calculation does not include the face or neck area.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results aftercompletion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
