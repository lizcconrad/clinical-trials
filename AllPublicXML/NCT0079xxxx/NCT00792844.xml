      Main research Question: The investigators would like to find out if both the Bio-K
      (lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) drink and capsule are equally effective
      in the prevention of diarrhea associated with antibiotic use.

      Why is this research project important? About 25% of patients who use antibiotics may develop
      diarrhea as a side effect. Symptoms are mild and consist of watery diarrhea and abdominal
      pain. Some patients may develop a more severe form of diarrhea, called clostridium
      difficile-associated diarrhea. Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea may lead to more
      serious consequences like inflammation of the large bowel and in some cases, death. There are
      some studies that suggest Bio-K drink, a probiotic preparation containing lactobacillus
      acidophilus and lactobacillus casei, decreases the risk of diarrhea from antibiotic use. As a
      result, St. Joseph's Healthcare has recently to use Bio-K routinely to try to reduce risk of
      patients developing diarrhea. No other Hamilton hospitals use Bio-K routinely as there is not
      strong evidence about the effectiveness of Bio-K for the prevention of diarrhea. This study
      will provide more information about Bio-K's effectiveness in the prevention of diarrhea
      associated with antibiotic use as both a capsule and a drink.
