  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SCH 900518 is a potent oral inhibitor of HCV NS3 protease which disrupts hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) polyprotein processing. SCH 900518, when added to the current standard of care (SOC),
      peginterferon-alfa plus ribavirin, would likely increase the proportion of patients achieving
      undetectable HCV-RNA levels and sustained virologic response (SVR). In this study, SCH 900518
      would be used in combination with low doses of ritonavir to enhance the levels of SCH 900518
      within the body and reduce the number of daily SCH 900518 tablets required. The purpose of
      this study is to identify the optimal dose and schedule (once or twice a day) of SCH 900518
      plus ritonavir in previously untreated patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C when
      given in combination with SOC. The study compares SOC to 6 experimental arms. In the
      experimental arms, SOC plus SCH 900518 doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg once daily or 100 mg
      twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg once or twice daily will be explored. The benefits of a 4
      week lead-in with PegIntron and ribavirin prior to the addition of SCH 900518 will also be
      explored.

Subjects with &gt;= 1 log decrease from baseline in HCV-RNA levels after 12 weeks, but still above the lower limit of quantitation, have the option of crossing over to PegIntron, ribavirin plus SCH 900518 400 mg and ritonavir 100 mg daily for 12 weeks. This is followed by standard of care, PegIntron and ribavirin, for a total treatment duration of up to 48 weeks.</description>
