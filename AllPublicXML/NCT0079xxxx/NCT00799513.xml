  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II multi-institutional trial will explore the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide
      monotherapy given as maintenance therapy following salvage chemo-immunotherapy in patients
      with relapsed or refractory chemosensitive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients older than 65 years or younger but not eligible to high-dose chemotherapy and
      autologous stem cell transplantation with biopsy-proven diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      relapsed to previous combination chemotherapy regimen ± rituximab, who achieved at least a
      partial response to second-line chemotherapy (ICE or DHAP/DHAOx or MINE regimen) + rituximab
      will receive single-agent lenalidomide 25 mg once daily for 21 days out of 28, as maintenance
      treatment until progression of disease. Dose reductions of study drug will be made in case of
      adverse events when reported as correlated and when clinically appropriate.

      One-year progression free survival will be the primary endpoint and overall survival,
      response rate and toxicity will be the secondary endpoints. With the null hypothesis (P0) of
      1-year PFS of 30%, this study will consider a satisfactory efficacy of lenalidomide worth of
      further investigation a P1 corresponding to a 1-yr PFS of 50% (that is an absolute increase
      of 20% in terms of 1-yr progression-free survival). Considering a standard type I error (α)
      of 0,05 and a power of 80% (Type 2 error of 20%) 47 patients will be necessary for the trial.
