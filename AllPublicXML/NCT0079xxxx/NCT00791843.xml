      PP1- The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving more of the hormone produced by
      everyone called growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) can improve heart function in
      individuals with congestive heart failure. You must be 50 years old or older, have a
      diagnosis of congestive heart failure, and have a high likelihood of having lower than normal
      growth hormone effect. GHRH is approved by the US FDA for treatment in children with growth
      hormone deficiency because GHRH stimulates Growth Hormone (GH). Its use for treatment of
      congestive heart failure in adults is investigational.

      Growth hormone releasing hormone is a hormone produced in the brain. We will be using
      synthetic hormone made in the laboratory. It is identical to the hormone in the brain.

      Many older people, due to aging have low levels of growth hormone. The aim of this study is
      to find out whether restoring growth hormone levels to the levels found in younger
      individuals and then maintaining those levels for 12 weeks will help strengthen heard muscles
      in older persons with congestive heart failure.

      PP1- The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Growth Hormone Releasing
      Hormone (GHRH) on cardiac structure and function in subjects aged 50 years and older with a
      diagnosis of congestive heart failure in a single blinded (to the subject) randomized
      treatment/placebo study design. They will receive 12 weeks of drug or placebo, 6 weeks of
      washout, and 12 weeks of placebo or drug- whichever they didn't receive in the first 12
      weeks. The hypotheses are: 1)normal aging is associated with evidence of declining
      somatotrophic activity exemplified by IGF-1 levels; 2) GHRH can raise levels of Growth
      hormone and IGF-1 in elderly individuals in a dose dependent fashion with minimal deleterious
      side effects; 3) GHRH will produce measurable increments in myocardial performance and
      structure and demonstrated growth of peripheral musculature; 4) the combination of these
      benefits will result in better quality of life due to the improvement of overall cardiac
      function.
