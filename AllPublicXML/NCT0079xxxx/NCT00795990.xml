      This is a retrospective chart review to look at the timing of using indomethacin and
      ibuprofen for PDA closure for infants admitted into the NICU of the University of Utah
      Hospital from 1/2007-8/2008. The purpose is to compare the outcomes of medical intervention
      in preterm infants if intervention occurs day of life 4 or less, or day of life 5 or greater,
      with the birthdate being counted as day of life 1.

      This is a retrospective chart review to look at the timing of using indomethacin and
      ibuprofen for PDA closure for infants admitted into the NICU of the University of Utah
      Hospital from 1/2007-8/2008. The purpose is to compare the outcomes of medical intervention
      in preterm infants if intervention occurs day of life 4 or less, or day of life 5 or greater,
      with the birthdate being counted as day of life 1. All infants born less than 1200 gms will
      be evaluated for whether or not an echocardiogram was done. If an echocardiogram was done
      that showed a PDA, data will be collected as to what medical interventions were done, at what
      age, and what were the results of the medical intervention. Infants will be stratified into
      birthweights &lt;800 gm and 800-1200 gm.

    <description>The primary objective is to compare early (day of life 4 or less) versus late (day of life 5) medical treatment of PDA. Data will be collected via a retrospective chart review. Information will be collected on both the use of indomethacin and ibuprofen. Both medications are used as standard of care in the NICU for closure of PDAs.</description>
