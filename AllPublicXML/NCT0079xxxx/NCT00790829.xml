      effect on decreasing pain after surgery is the main purpose of the study.

    <textblock>
      Study patients include nonsmokers aged 18-75 undergoing open abdominal wall surgery under
      general anesthesia. If the patient smokes, receives a regional anesthetic such as an
      epidural, or is pregnant, then he/she is excluded from the study. There are two randomized
      study groups. Group B receives a seven-milligram transdermal patch and Group A receives a
      placebo patch. Generic seven-milligram nicotine patches or identical placebo patches made
      from band-aids are glued to a 3x4 inch adhesive pad and placed on the individuals' right
      upper arm 1 hour before surgery. All patients are given a standardized anesthetic consisting
      of a narcotic infusion, propofol, a neuromuscular blocking agent, anesthetic gas agent,
      antinauseant medication and a nonsteroidal.

      Patients receive postoperative analgesia for twenty four hours after surgery with a narcotic
      or an additional nonsteroidal medication. All patients receive intravenous controlled patient
      controlled analgesia (IVPCA) with morphine sulfate one milligram per ten minutes, forty
      milligram four hour limit. Patients also receive toradol fifteen milligrams for breakthrough
      pain. The patch is removed from participants twenty four hours post IVPCA initiation. The
      following items are assessed every four hours for twenty four hours after post anesthesia
      care unit discharge: a verbal rating of pain, total IVPCA morphine use, nausea occurrence,
      vomiting occurrence, and sedation score by the nurse.
