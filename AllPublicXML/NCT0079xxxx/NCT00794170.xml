  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study participants who receive the I-SIGHT intervention will have higher rates of glaucoma
      treatment compliance (e.g., medication-taking and refill compliance, return for clinical
      follow-up) and more positive eye health outcomes at 12-month follow-up than participants who
      receive the control group intervention.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is telephone-based and individually-tailored to participants' compliance
      knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; psychosocial predictors of compliance; health literacy;
      race and culture; and prescribed medication regimen. The intervention calls utilize
      interactive voice recognition technology to facilitate interest, participation, and
      interaction with call recipients. We evaluated the intervention in a randomized controlled
      trial with telephone interviews administered to all participants at baseline, 6, 9, and
      12-months

    <description>The adherence measure, developed and pilot tested by the I-SIGHT study team, assessed compliance adherence with medication taking, refills, and appointment-keeping by self-report and chart review. Subjects were considered nonadherent with medication-taking if they reported missing doses of any glaucoma medication within one month of the interview. Levels of medication-taking nonadherence were also examined by missed doses within 7 days, 2 weeks, or 1 mo of the interview. Nonadherence with refills was defined as running out of any glaucoma medication and missing a dose within a specified time frame (i.e. 1 year prior to the baseline interview; 6 months prior to 6-month interview; and 3 months prior to the 9 and 12 month interview). Appointment-keeping nonadherence was indicated by self-report of missing a glaucoma treatment appointment and not rescheduling during the specified time frame. Self-report of nonadherence in any of these three areas classified the subject as nonadherent.</description>
