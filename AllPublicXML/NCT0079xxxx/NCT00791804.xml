      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of self-titration to effective analgesia with inhaled
      AeroLEF in patients with moderate/severe acute pain in the post-surgical setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After elective ACL knee surgery, consented patients will receive a single dose of AeroLEF for
      moderate/severe acute pain. Patients stop dosing if they achieve analgesia, complete the
      maximum available dose, or experience dose-limiting side effects.

          4. Scheduled for elective ACL arthroscopic knee repair surgery, and meet the criteria of
             the American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] Physical Status Criteria of Class I or

          7. Clinically significant ongoing medical conditions.

          8. Currently receiving treatment for chronic pain.

          9. Current therapy with narcotic or CNS-depressant medications.
