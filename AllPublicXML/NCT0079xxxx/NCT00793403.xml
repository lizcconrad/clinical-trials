  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of composite indices, including the CLARA (CLinical ARthritis
      Activity) index, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in routine clinical practice in Italy
      in order to evaluate clinical remission and low disease activity. Data will be collected only
      from patients providing informed consent. In this study we aimed to assess the psychometric
      properties of a new composite instrument termed CLinical ARthritis Activity (PRO-CLARA) that
      uses only three PRO measures from among the 7 ACR Core Data Set. We hypothesized that this
      index would facilitate rapid and easy RA activity assessment in daily routine.

      All patients who respond to inclusion/exclusion criteria at baseline will be considered
      valuable for the analysis.

JSN and subluxation/luxation scored on 0-4 point scale; 0=normal joint to 4= a bony ankylosis/a complete luxation of joint. Total JSN and subluxation/luxation score for hands:0-120, for feet:0-48. Total SvH score = 0-448; higher score=more erosion and JSN.</description>

        <description>RADAI:self-assessed measure of disease activity in RA. Consists of 5 items: global disease activity(GDA) in past 6 months; current disease activity(CDA) as measured by SJC and TJC; current arthritis pain; current duration of morning stiffness; current TJC. GDA,CDA and pain were scored on an 11-point numerical rating scale,0=no disease activity/pain to 10=extreme disease activity/pain. Current morning stiffness and TJC were transformed to a 0-10 point scale,higher scores=more disease activity. RADAI total score=sum of individual items divided by 5;range 0-10, higher score=more disease activity.</description>

        <description>HAQ: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>
