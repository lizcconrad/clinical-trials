      RATIONALE: Bortezomib and thalidomide may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking
      blood flow to the cancer. Bortezomib may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving bortezomib together with thalidomide and
      dexamethasone may kill any cancer cells that remain after high-dose melphalan and stem cell
      transplant in patients with multiple myeloma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving bortezomib together with
      thalidomide and dexamethasone after melphalan and stem cell transplant and to see how well it
      works in treating patients with stage I-III multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the feasibility and toxicities of maintenance therapy with sequential
           bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone after high-dose melphalan and autologous
           peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma.

        -  To assess whether administration of sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and
           dexamethasone can improve progression-free survival of these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To assess whether administration of sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and
           dexamethasone can increase complete remission rate and duration of response in these
           patients.

        -  To assess the impact of maintenance therapy with sequential bortezomib, thalidomide, and
           dexamethasone after transplantation on overall survival of these patients.

        -  To evaluate the influence of cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g., chromosome 13 deletion, 14
           q32 abnormality, t [4;14], chromosome 1 q21 amplification, and chromosome 17 deletion)
           on outcome by performing conventional cytogenetic study and fluorescence in situ
           hybridization (FISH) studies on baseline and post-transplant bone marrow specimens.

      OUTLINE:

        -  High-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT):
           Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -2 and -1 and undergo
           autologous PBSCT on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously
           beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Beginning 4-8 weeks after transplantation, patients receive
           bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral
           dexamethasone on days 1-4; treatment with dexamethasone repeats every month for 12
           months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 weeks
           after completion of bortezomib, patients receive oral thalidomide once daily until
           disease progression.

      Patients complete the FACT-GOG neurotoxicity questionnaire periodically. Bone marrow samples
      are collected at baseline and post-transplant for cytogenetic analysis by FISH.

    <description>Patients receive high-dose melphalan IV over 30 minutes on days -2 and -1 and undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim IV or SC beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. Beginning 4 to 8 weeks after transplantation, patients receive maintenance therapy comprising bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone on days 1 to 4. Treatment with dexamethasone repeats every month for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
