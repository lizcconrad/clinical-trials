  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection in patients in the intensive care unit
      (ICU) that increases length of stay but not mortality. It is not known whether antibiotic
      treatment will alter outcomes. Our previous studies have documented wide practice variations
      exist amongst doctors, including prescribing antibiotics to asymptomatic patients. Therefore,
      the merits of various ways to manage the infection require further studies to minimize the
      potential for over-prescribing of antibiotics, a practice that can increase the development
      of resistant bacteria.

      The objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a larger
      definitive study that will determine the effect of catheter change and/or systemic
      antibiotics as compared to no interventions on outcomes and resource utilization in ICU
      patients with UTI. Patients will be randomized to receive no treatment, antibiotics alone,
      urine catheter change alone, and both catheter change and antibiotics. Their clinical
      outcomes will be assessed.

      Results from the pilot trial will provide information about whether it is feasible to conduct
      the larger definitive trial. Results of the definitive study will provide guidance to
      clinicians on how to manage a frequent clinical problem and optimize antibiotic usage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult ICU patient (≥ 18 years old)

          2. Admitted to the ICU for ≥ 96 hours

          3. Indwelling urinary catheter in place for ≥ 48hours that was inserted during this
             hospital admission

          4. Urine culture positive (≥ 105 CFU/mL) for 1 or 2 organism (s) (e.g. bacteria or
             fungus)

          5. Have received antimicrobial therapy that would cover the isolated organism(s) in the
             index urine culture for &lt; 24 hours (i.e. therapy that does NOT cover the isolated
             organism(s) in the index urine culture of any duration or antimicrobial that covers
             the index urine organism for &lt; 24 hours are permitted)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Suspected or confirmed pyelonephritis, renal abscess, or concurrent bacteremia with
             the same organism(s) as those isolated in the index urine culture

          2. Anuria (&lt; 50 mL/day)

          5. Patient has an alternative infection and requires an antimicrobial that has a spectrum
             of activity which include all the organism(s) isolated from the index urine culture
