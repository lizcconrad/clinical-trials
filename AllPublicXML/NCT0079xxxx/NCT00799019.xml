  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, immunogenicity surveillance registry employs a prospective, cohort design
      for patients who are using erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA)according to normal
      practice consistent with the medical indications. Subjects will be observed for the
      development of immunogenicity and PRCA for up to 3 years. Information on exposure to ESA
      products, ESA product handling and storage, and most recent hemoglobin level will be
      collected quarterly in the case report form. For cases of suspected PRCA, that sera specimen
      will be tested for EPO antibodies at Division of Nephrology, Chulalongkorn University
      Laboratory.

      An Advisory Board (ADB) will periodically review blinded case data for subjects with
      unexplained loss of efficacy (LOE), identify cases of EPO antibody-mediated PRCA and will be
      responsible for data summary and make recommendations related to the incidence rate of PRCA
      associated with S.C. ESA use. The registry will provide no inducement to change therapy and
      will be non-interventional. The primary objective for this study is to estimate the incidence
      of anti-human Erythropoiesis and anti-EPO PRCA, develop in such patients. The diagnosis of
      PRCA by bone marrow biopsy must be prerequisite before the antibody assay. The secondary
      objective is to evaluate the efficacy of ESA for treatment of erythropoiesis deficiency
      anemia. Registry subjects will be adult men and women who are receiving or about to receive
      (within 1 month) a marketed ESA product by the s.c. route of administration at the time of
      enrollment. The marketed ESAs include innovative ESA and biosimilar ESA. Potential subjects
      will only be enrolled if they have been receiving an Erythropoiesis product for less than 1
      year. Cases of EPO antibody-mediated PRCA will be determined by the clinical presence of
      essential criteria of unexplained LOE, administration of ESA product, bone marrow biopsy
      diagnosis of PRCA, and presence of EPO antibody. The sera of patients who meet all criteria
      will be assayed for neutralization.

    <textblock>
      Incidence rates of EPO antibody-mediated PRCA will be estimated as the total number of cases
      of anti-Erythropoiesis and anti-EPO antibodies mediated PRCA attributed to a specific product
      presentation divided by the person-year (PY) of s.c. exposure. Incidence rates will be
      adjusted for duration of exposure by stratification. Sensitivity analyses with varying
      assumptions on the latency from exposure with Erythropoiesis product to onset of PRCA will be
      employed in general and will be evaluated specifically if subjects switch therapy, have mixed
      exposure to multiple ESA products by the s.c. route of administration, or discontinue therapy
      and remain under observation. Confidence intervals for rate estimates will be calculated
      using the Poisson distribution for rare events.
