  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has numerous health benefits. Nevertheless, when exercise duration is ~45 min or
      longer and intensity moderate to intense, it may induce different troubles, for example:
      hypoglycemia, peripheral and central fatigue, muscle damages, osteoarticular injuries,
      inflammation, cardiovascular dysfunctions. Nutritional loading during exercise may prevent
      and and/or reduce some of these troubles.

      In regard of recent data, we proposed a novel energy drink (NUTRAPERF®) to limit deleterious
      effects of long time exercise in neutral environment (outside temperature between 4 and 25°C)
      and to improve performance. If performance may be increased by this energy drink during long
      time exercise, we proposed that it consumption may also improve performance in short and
      sub-maximal exercise.

      So, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the consumption of this novel
      energy drink on performance during long and short time exercise. Moreover, we studied the
      effects of this consumption on different metabolic parameters (heart rate, oxygen
      consumption, respiratory quotient, ventilation, glycemia, lactatemia), on central and
      peripheral fatigue and on cognitive parameters.

             repeated problems or patellar ligament) that could hamper measures of force maximum
             extension and flexion on these joints or illnesses that prevent the exercise of
             pedalling or running on treadmill (tendonitis, periostitis) will be excluded.

          -  Any subject who at the same time participates at another medical experiment.
