Each item was scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (no sleep at all) to 5 (a lot of sleep). Each subscale was calculated as the mean of the individual items comprising the subscale. A total ASQ score was calculated as the mean of the subscale scores; higher scores represented better sleep.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life Scale - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) at 5 Weeks: United States Population Based Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQoL Questionnaire - 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) was a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allowed participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score between 1 and 3 was generated for each domain. For each participant, the outcome rating on the 5 domains was mapped to a single index through an algorithm. The index ranged between 0 and 1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the participant.</description>

        <description>This scale measured 24-hour APS scores. Data were recorded daily (preferably at bedtime) on an 11-point Likert scale, an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Least Squares (LS) Means were adjusted for baseline, investigator, treatment, visit, a treatment-by-visit interaction, and a baseline-by-visit interaction.</description>

        <population>The analysis population was a modified intent-to-treat (ITT) population defined as participants who received either LY545694 or placebo treatment with both baseline and at least 1 postbaseline measure.

        <description>ASQ consisted of 21 items (including a single item to assess overall sleep quality) and 3 subscales: Sleep Onset and Maintenance (items 1-3, 5-6, 9, 11); Sleep Experience (items 4, 7, 8, 10, 12); and Awakening Experience (items 13-20). Each item was scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (no sleep at all) to 5 (a lot of sleep). Each subscale was calculated as the mean of the individual items comprising the subscale. A total ASQ score was calculated as the mean of the subscale scores; higher scores represented better sleep.</description>

After 1 week of dosing, participants were escalated to LY545694 49 mg BID po at Visit 4. At Visit 5, participants were titrated to the final dose of LY545694 105 mg BID po. Participants who were intolerant of this dose were titrated back down to LY545694 49 mg BID po for the remainder of study treatment.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Assessment of Sleep Questionnaire (ASQ) Total Score at 5 Weeks</title>
          <description>ASQ consisted of 21 items (including a single item to assess overall sleep quality) and 3 subscales: Sleep Onset and Maintenance (items 1-3, 5-6, 9, 11); Sleep Experience (items 4, 7, 8, 10, 12); and Awakening Experience (items 13-20). Each item was scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (no sleep at all) to 5 (a lot of sleep). Each subscale was calculated as the mean of the individual items comprising the subscale. A total ASQ score was calculated as the mean of the subscale scores; higher scores represented better sleep.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life Scale - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) at 5 Weeks: United States Population Based Index Score</title>
        <description>The EuroQoL Questionnaire - 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) was a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allowed participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score between 1 and 3 was generated for each domain. For each participant, the outcome rating on the 5 domains was mapped to a single index through an algorithm. The index ranged between 0 and 1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the participant.</description>
