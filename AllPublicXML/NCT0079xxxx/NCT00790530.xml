      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of automated telephone outreach
      with speech recognition to improve diabetes care.

    <textblock>
      Randomly allocate a total of 1200 health plan members with diabetes to automated telephone
      outreach with speech recognition (ATO-SR; N = 600) or usual care (N = 600). The intervention
      is a series of three calls, using automated calls, originating from the health plan, using
      interactive speech recognition technology, spaced approximately 4-6 weeks apart, to encourage
      participants to fulfill the recommended testing (dilated eye examinations, glycated
      hemoglobin, LDL-cholesterol, microalbumin) that had not been performed received in the
      preceding year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Diabetes, defined as either 1) filled a prescription for insulin or an oral
             hypoglycemic agent; or, 2) had two outpatient or one inpatient or two outpatients
             encounter claims with an ICD9-CM or CPT code indicating diabetes.

          -  Gap in a key diabetes management metric as evidenced by no claim for a dilated eye
             examination in the prior 15 months and no claim for one or more of the following
             tests: glycated hemoglobin, LDL-cholesterol, or microalbumin. (Individuals with
             evidence of having received ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers were
             considered to have had a microalbumin test.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No primary care clinician in the data base

          -  Those who had previously asked the health plan to exclude them from research or
             quality improvement

          -  Women whose claim records contained diagnoses suggesting gestational diabetes
