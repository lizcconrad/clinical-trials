  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AML patients with de-novo or secondary disease with age greater than 18 years not eligible
      for stem cell transplantation for medical contraindications, lack of donor or lack of stem
      cells,are eligible. Leukemias other than AML and M3 FAB subtype will be excluded from the
      study. Immunosuppressive chemotherapy prior to NK cell infusion will include: fludarabine and
      cyclophosphamide 4g/m2 (Flu/Cy). The therapy will be administered over 6 days on inpatient
      basis. Haploidentical NK cells will be selected from a steady-state large volume
      leukapheresis product from a suitable KIR ligand incompatible donor. Donor-recipients pairs
      will be selected on the basis of known KIR ligands. In particular, haploidentical donors will
      be included if present at least one allele mismatch at a class I locus among the following
      ones: HLA-C alleles with Asn77-Lys80, HLA-C alleles with Ser77-Asn80, HLA-Bw4 alleles.
      Immunomagnetic enrichment of NK cells will follow two subsequent steps: 1) depletion of CD3+
      T cells followed by 2) positive selection of CD56+ NK cells. Contaminating CD3+ T cells will
      be carefully evaluated.

      When previously cryproserved NK cells are still available, further re-infusions may be
      performed, according to PI's evaluation. The number of remaining NK cells must be sufficient
      for the reinfusion of at least the minimum dose of cells (106/kg). At least two months should
      elapse between two consecutive infusion procedures.
