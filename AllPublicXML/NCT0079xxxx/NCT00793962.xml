  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and toxicities of hypofractionation
      radiotherapy with conventional fractionation radiotherapy in breast cancer patients treated
      with mastectomy.It is hypothesized that the efficacy and toxicities are similar between the
      two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible breast cancer patients with mastectomy and axillary dissection are randomized into 2
      groups:conventional fractionation radiotherapy of 50 Gy in 25 fractions within 5 weeks to
      ipsilateral chest wall and supraclavicular nodal region,and hypofractionation radiotherapy of
      43.5Gy in 15 fractions within 3 weeks to the same region.

      During and after radiotherapy, the patients are followed and the efficacy and toxicities of
      radiotherapy are evaluated.
