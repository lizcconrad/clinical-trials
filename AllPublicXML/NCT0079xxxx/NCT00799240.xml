  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the rate of chemotherapy: pemetrexed and cisplatin compared with the
      combination of pemetrexed/cisplatin with MK-0646. The other purposes are to determine how
      long we can control the cancer growth and toxicity and safety of the combination. Laboratory
      research with the tumor tissue and blood obtained will be done to assess IGF-1R expression
      and related markers and correlate with response and survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin-like Growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that regulates
      cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis.(4) Increased IGF1 signaling results in upregulation
      of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis through RAF and PI3K pathways.(5) Several types
      of cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer, express IGF-1R and its ligand. The
      sequestration of IGF by IGF binding protein was associated with improved survival in patients
      with resected stage I lung cancer.(6) High expression of IGF-1R is associated with poor
      survival in surgically resected stage I lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma subtype.
      Patients with adenocarcinoma and never smoker had higher expression of IGF-1R vs. squamous
      cell carcinoma and smokers.(7). Low IGF-1R expression was associated with significant
      improvement in survival in the adenocarcinoma lung cancer but there was a lack of correlation
      between expression of IGF1R and survival in patients with squamous cell histology.

      Monoclonal antibodies target the extracellular domain of IGF-IR and small molecules inhibit
      IGF-1R kinase. This is a potential new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  histologically or cytologically proven newly diagnosed Stage IlIB or Stage IV advanced
             primary non-small cell bronchogenic lung cancer (non-squamous cell to include
             bronchoalveolar, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, or unspecified).
