      The primary purpose of this observational study is to describe and define the current daily
      practice of management of anti-TNF-agents in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients. Data will be
      collected only from subjects providing informed consent.

          <description>ESR is a laboratory test that provides a non-specific measure of inflammation. The test assesses the rate at which red blood cells fall in a test tube. Normal range is 0-30 mm/hr. A higher rate is consistent with inflammation.</description>

        <description>HAQ is a measure of functional limitations. Participants were rated on 4 point scale with scores: 0=no difficulty (normal), 1=some difficulty (adequate), 2=much difficulty (limited), 3=unable to do based on degree of difficulty experienced with 20 tasks grouped into 8 areas of dressing, rising, hygiene, reach, walking, eating, grip and activities. The higher score reported by the participant for any component question of the 8 categories determines the score for that categories. Total score is divided for 8. Average score range: 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do).</description>
