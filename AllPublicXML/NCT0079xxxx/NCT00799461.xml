      RATIONALE: A personalized Internet-based program may help improve fatigue, depression, and
      quality of life in long-term survivors of stem cell transplant. It is not yet known whether
      an Internet-based program is more effective with or without telephone-based problem-solving
      training.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well an Internet-based program works
      with or without telephone-based problem-solving training in helping long-term survivors of
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant cope with late complications

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of a randomized controlled trial to improve long term
      fatigue/physical dysfunction, depression/distress and health surveillance behaviors in adult
      3 to 25-year hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors using an internet only or
      internet and phone-based problem-solving and activation training compared with survivors
      randomized to a delayed internet access control.

      II. To determine the reach, utilization, and implementation costs of a web-based,
      individually tailored intervention, disseminated through widely used patient information
      websites, targeting a national cohort of adult 2-25 year HSCT survivors. (Phase III/IV) III.
      To determine, in a randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of a nationally disseminated,
      internet-based, individually tailored intervention to improve long-term fatigue, distress and
      health promotion behaviors in HSCT survivors, compared with survivors randomized to a delayed
      internet access control. (Phase III/IV)

      OUTLINE: Patients with elevated fatigue, depression, and/or distress at baseline are
      randomized to 1 of 3 arms (ARMS I, II, or III). Patients without elevated fatigue, depression
      or distress at baseline are randomized to 1 of 2 arms (ARMS II or III).

      ARM I (FULL WEBSITE ACCESS WITH PROBLEM-SOLVING TRAINING [PST]; FIRST STUDY ONLY; CLOSED TO
      ACCRUAL): Patients receive full access to INSPIRE website for 6 months, which offers an
      individually tailored greeting home page with links to information on each of the target
      areas identified as being elevated on baseline assessment and how to manage the
      complications; a bulletin board with input from other survivors that is solicited, edited,
      and posted weekly; resource pages; and an opportunity to send secure messages with questions
      or comments. Patients also undergo 4-8 phone-based PST sessions with a behavioral health
      specialist.

      ARM II (FULL WEBSITE ACCESS WITHOUT PST): Patients receive full access to INSPIRE website for
      6 months as in ARM I.

      ARM III (DELAYED WEBSITE ACCESS): Patients do not have access to INSPIRE website for 6
      months. After 6 months, patients receive full access to INSPIRE website for 3 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient between 3-25 years since last transplant

          -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient &gt; = 2 years since last transplant
             (second, phase III/IV study only)

          -  Any type of transplant (autologous, allogeneic, myeloablative, non-myeloablative,
             marrow or peripheral blood stem cells)

          -  Able to communicate in English as indicated by ability to communicate adequately with
             study staff to participate in the clinical phone calls and to complete
             patient-reported outcomes (PRO) assessments in English

          -  Has internet and email access (indicated by logon to site for consent and assessment)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Does not complete the baseline assessment through the HADS (Hospital Anxiety and
             Depression Scale)

          -  Does not complete required assessments in the background and medical history forms
             required to determine whether meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, stratification,
             sample description, or primary outcomes (includes age, gender, ethnicity, race,
             transplant site, and medical information about transplant if not FHCRC or SCCA
             patient, education, work, height and weight, current medications

          -  Survivors who score 3.0 or above on the SCL depression measure (indicating severe
             depression) or who report moderate to severe suicidal ideation will be ineligible for
             randomization; these survivors will, however, have full access to the website if they
             have completed the required baseline assessment; they will be asked to also complete
             follow-up assessments

          -  Survivors who report to us that they have been in active treatment for relapse of
             their original disease, or for a second cancer, in the past 2 years will be ineligible
             for randomization, unless the second cancer was treated only with surgical removal
             (e.g., basal, squamous or localized melanoma skin cancer, or breast ductal carcinoma
             in situ [DCIS])

          -  These survivors will, however, have full access to the website if they have completed
             the required baseline assessment; they will be asked to also complete follow-up
             assessments
