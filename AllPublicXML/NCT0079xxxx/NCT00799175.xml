      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if intra- and postoperative administration of
      ropivacaine, ketorolac and epinephrine into the operating field would affect morphine
      consumption. Secondary end-points are hospital stay, pain intensity and side effects. In an
      attempt to assess the safety of this technique, knee function and patient satisfaction scores
      are assessed up to 3 months after surgery.

      Postoperative pain is often severe following knee arthroplasty. Recently, a local
      infiltration analgesia (LIA) technique was developed by Drs Kerr and Kohan in Sydney,
      Australia. With this LIA-technique, a long-acting local anesthetic (ropivacaine), a
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ketorolac), and epinephrine are infiltrated
      intraoperatively and via an intraarticular catheter postoperatively. We ahve completed a
      study on unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and the present study is investigating total knee
      arthroplasties.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate if intra- and postoperative administration of
      ropivacaine, ketorolac and epinephrine into the operating field would affect morphine

      attempt to assess the safety of this technique, knee function and patient satisfaction scores
      are assessed up to 3 months after surgery.

    <description>In Group A, 400 mg ropivicaine, 30 mg ketorolac and 0.5 mg epinephrine (total volume 166 ml) are infiltrated by the surgeon into the soft tissues peri-articularly during the operation in the following way: Before inserting the components, 20-30 ml are injected into the posterior capsule and before closure of the wound the rest is injected into the capsule incision, the synovium, the ligament and the subcutaneous tissue. After 21 postoperative hours in Group A, 200 mg ropivicaine, 30 mg ketorolac and 0.1 mg epinephrine, total volume 22 ml, are injected intraarticularly via the catheter.</description>
