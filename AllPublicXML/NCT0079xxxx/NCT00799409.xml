  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if the study medication, CONCERTA (methylphenidate
      HCl), is safe and effective in improving academic performance and behavior in children with
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), when compared to placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) is safe and effective in improving
      academic performance and behavior in children with ADHD, when compared to placebo as
      demonstrated using specified study measures. This is a double-blind (neither participant nor
      investigator knows the name of the assigned study drug), randomized (study drug assigned by
      chance), placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluating the academic, behavioral, and
      cognitive effects of CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) on older children with ADHD. This means
      that all eligible children will receive treatment with methylphenidate HCl throughout the
      study (the titration and assessment periods) and inactive pill (placebo) on one of the two
      laboratory classroom days. On the other laboratory classroom day they will receive their
      regular dose of methylphenidate HCl. The primary efficacy variable in this study is the
      Permanent Product Math Test (PERMP) attempted score. Secondary Measures include: SKAMP
      (Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham), tests of inattention, reading fluency and
      comprehension, and memory. Assessments will be completed during each of the laboratory
      assessment days (12.5 hours). Participants will be assessed for adverse events throughout the
      study. Patients will initiate treatment with oral CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) 18 mg at
      baseline and continue morning dosing with increases every 3 to 7 days until an optimal dose
      is achieved, up to the maximum of 54 mg/day. Eligible patients will remain in the study for a
      maximum of 8 weeks.

    <measure>Hour 4 Permanent Product Math Test Attempted Score (PERMP-Attempted)</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 4 of the of the Lab School Day during Double-Blind Assessment Period</time_frame>
    <description>PERMP (range: 0, 400) is a measure of academic productivity in children up to 14 years of age. These seatwork math tasks provide an objective measure of attention and accuracy in calculations. The level of difficulty is established on a screening math pretest. The subsequent laboratory school day assessments employed a series of 10-minute math tests (5 pages of 80 math problem each for a total of 400 problems available). Children were graded on the number of attempted problems. A higher number of problems attempted was indicative of greater attention to detail (higher score is preferable)</description>

    <measure>Hour 4 Swanson, Kotkin, Alger, M-Flynn and Pelham Scale for Deportment (SKAMP-Deportment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 4 of the Lab School Day During the Double-Blind Assessment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The SKAMP scale measures the manifestations of ADHD using an independent observer (teacher) rating of the child's impairment in classroom behavior. The SKAMP-Deportment (SKAMP-D) (range: 0, 36) is a sum of ratings on 6 deportment items (interacting with other children, interacting with adults, remaining quiet, staying seated, complying with the teacher's directions, and following the classroom rules). Each item was rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal, 6=maximum impairment), with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Hour 4 of the Lab School Day During the Double-Blind Assessment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The SKAMP scale measures the manifestations of ADHD using an independent observer (teacher) rating of the child's impairment in classroom behavior. The SKAMP-Attention (SKAMP-A) (range: 0, 42) is a sum of the ratings on 7 attention items (getting started, sticking with tasks, attending to an activity, making activity transitions, completing assigned tasks, performing work accurately, and being neat and careful while writing or drawing). Each item was rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal, 6=maximum impairment), with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Hour 4 Swanson, Kotkin, Alger, M-Flynn and Pelham Scale for Composite (SKAMP-Composite)</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 4 of the Lab School Day During the Double-Blind Assessment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The SKAMP scale measures the manifestations of ADHD using an independent observer (teacher) rating of the child's impairment in classroom behavior. A composite score (range: 0, 78) for the SKAMP variable (13 items total) was obtained by summing the SKAMP-D and SKAMP-A subscale scores. A lower score was preferable, as a higher score represented greater behavioral impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Hour 3.5 of the Lab School Day During the Double-Blind Assessment Period</time_frame>
    <description>The DIBELS (range: 0, 376), used to assess reading fluency, consists of standardized, individually administered measures of early literacy development. These short (1 minute) fluency measures were developed based upon essential early literacy domains to assess development of phonological awareness, alphabetic understanding, and automaticity and fluency. Only the paragraph fluency component of an age/grade-appropriate DIBELS was used. A higher score indicated better performance, as it represented that the subject orally read a greater number of words correctly within the time allowed.</description>

        <title>Hour 4 Permanent Product Math Test Attempted Score (PERMP-Attempted)</title>
        <description>PERMP (range: 0, 400) is a measure of academic productivity in children up to 14 years of age. These seatwork math tasks provide an objective measure of attention and accuracy in calculations. The level of difficulty is established on a screening math pretest. The subsequent laboratory school day assessments employed a series of 10-minute math tests (5 pages of 80 math problem each for a total of 400 problems available). Children were graded on the number of attempted problems. A higher number of problems attempted was indicative of greater attention to detail (higher score is preferable)</description>

        <description>The SKAMP scale measures the manifestations of ADHD using an independent observer (teacher) rating of the child's impairment in classroom behavior. The SKAMP-Deportment (SKAMP-D) (range: 0, 36) is a sum of ratings on 6 deportment items (interacting with other children, interacting with adults, remaining quiet, staying seated, complying with the teacher’s directions, and following the classroom rules). Each item was rated on a 7-point impairment scale (0=normal, 6=maximum impairment), with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

        <description>The TOVA (range: unbounded) is a computerized, visual continuous performance test providing a measure of attention. The stimulus, presented for 100 milliseconds (ms) at the rate of 30 per minute, is a computer-presented square containing a square hole near the top (target) or bottom (non-target) edge. Higher scores indicate better performance, lower scores indicate worse performance. Clinical interpretation: an ADHD scores of -1.80 or lower (&lt;= -1.80) are considered not within normal limits scores above -1.80 (&gt; -1.80) are considered inconclusive (meaning, neither like-ADHD nor like-normal).</description>

        <title>Hour 5.5 Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) Reaction Time Standard Score</title>
        <description>The TOVA (range: unbounded) is a computerized, visual continuous performance test providing a measure of attention. The stimulus, presented for 100 milliseconds (ms) at the rate of 30 per minute, is a computer-presented square containing a square hole near the top (target) or bottom (non-target) edge. Higher scores indicated better performance, lower scores indicate worse performance. Clinical interpretation: scores below 80 are considered abnormal, 80-85 are considered borderline, and scores above 85 are considered within normal limits.</description>

During this test the investigator pointed to a longer and longer series of windows on a card at the rate of 1 location per second, and then the child was asked to reproduce the sequence exactly in reverse order. One point was given for each correctly recalled sequence, and the test was discontinued after 3 consecutive errors.</description>

        <description>Each child individually was given a sequence of numbers with the sequence becoming progressively longer. The child was then asked to repeat the digits in the same sequence, either forwards or backwards. Each sequence length was attempted twice. The test was complete after failure on both trials of any sequence length. One point was awarded if the participant passed only 1 trial of a sequence length. Zero points were given if the participant failed both trials. The maximum raw scores were 16 forwards and 14 backwards. A higher score was indicative of better recall and attention (range: 0, 14).</description>

Only the paragraph fluency component of an age/grade-appropriate DIBELS was used. A higher score indicated better performance, as it represented that the subject orally read a greater number of words correctly within the time allowed.</description>

        <title>Hour 5.5 Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - 3rd ed. (WISC-III-PI) Digit Span Forwards</title>
        <description>Each child individually was given a sequence of numbers with the sequence becoming progressively longer. The child was then asked to repeat the digits in the same sequence, either forwards or backwards. Each sequence length was attempted twice. The test was complete after failure on both trials of any sequence length. One point was awarded if the participant passed only 1 trial of a sequence length. Zero points were given if the participant failed both trials. The maximum raw scores were 16 forwards and 14 backwards. A higher score was indicative of better recall and attention (range: 0, 16).</description>

        <title>Hour 5.5 Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) Omissions Standard Score</title>
        <description>The TOVA (range: unbounded) is a computerized, visual continuous performance test providing a measure of attention. The stimulus, presented for 100 milliseconds (ms) at the rate of 30 per minute, is a computer-presented square containing a square hole near the top (target) or bottom (non-target) edge. Higher scores indicated better performance, lower scores indicate worse performance. Clinical interpretation: scores below 80 are considered abnormal, 80-85 are considered borderline, and scores above 85 are considered within normal limits.</description>

The errors were not difficult to identify and were designed to show attention to task, not comprehension. A higher number of errors identified, of those possible, was indicative of better attention - identification of grammatical errors(range: 0, 1 represents correct responses divided by the number of possible responses).</description>
