      Evaluate the impact of systematic nursing orientations in the reduction of predicted
      cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary artery disease during four nursing visits for a
      1-year period and compare to a group of patients submitted to conventional treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assess 184 (two groups) patients during four nursing visits for a 1-year period and compare
      to a group of patients submitted to conventional treatment. We will evaluate the impact of
      systematic nursing orientations in the reduction of predicted cardiovascular risk in patients
      with coronary artery disease.
