  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trachoma, an ocular infection caused by C. trachomatis, is the second leading infectious
      cause of blindness worldwide. Years of repeated infection with C. trachomatis cause the
      eyelid to scar and contract and ultimately to rotate inward such that the eyelashes rub
      against the eyeball and abrade the cornea (trichiasis). The World Health Organization (WHO)
      has endorsed a multi-faceted strategy to combat trachoma, which includes the use of
      antibiotic treatment to reduce the community pool of infection with C. trachomatis. The
      objective of this study is to conduct a randomized, community-based trial in three countries
      (Niger, Tanzania and The Gambia), representing different baseline endemicities, of
      alternative coverages and frequencies of administration of mass antibiotic treatment as well
      as to determine the cost-effectiveness of these different strategies from a program
      perspective.

    <textblock>
      A randomized, 2x2 factorial designed trial will be implemented in each of the three
      countries. Communities will be randomized to two different coverage targets (80%-89% versus
      ≥90%) for three years of mass treatment.

      In The Gambia and Tanzania, communities will be further randomized to yearly mass treatment
      versus mass treatment at baseline followed by yearly mass treatment only if trachoma
      prevalence in sentinel children is greater than 5%. The communities will continue to be
      followed and treatment will resume if trachoma prevalence is found to be 20% or greater at
      the 12 or 18 month surveys.

      In Niger, communities will be randomized to the different coverage levels for annual mass
      azithromycin distribution and further randomized to biannual treatment at the two coverage
      targets for children ages twelve or younger.

      Cross-sectional rates of trachoma and infection will be determined by examining sentinel
      children, age five years or younger, randomly selected from each community based on a
      community census. The census will be updated each year, and villages will be monitored at
      baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months for infection and clinical disease.

      The three-year study is in accord with the WHO guidelines which recommend three years of
      annual mass treatment followed by a re-survey to determine need for further treatment. The
      investigators will evaluate the efficacy of guiding further mass treatment according to a
      laboratory test for Chlamydia or WHO guidelines. Where investigators estimate communities
      have infection rates less than 5% in sentinel children, or trachomatous inflammation (TF) (
      rates less than 5%, the community will be &quot;graduated&quot; from further mass treatment and
      followed for up to three years to look for evidence of re-emergent infection and disease. If
      rates of infection are found to be 20% or more return at the 12 or 18 month survey, mass
      treatment will be re-initiated.

    <intervention_model_description>The study was a factorial study model to begin with in all 3 countries (Niger,Tanzania and Gambia) but because we never stopped treatment in Tanzania and Niger site.Hence the study design was collapsed to a simple design in Tanzania and Niger.The study model was kept as a factorial design for the Gambia site.

    <description>Mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin or topical tetracycline is recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) for 3 years in districts where the prevalence of trachoma is&gt;=10 % in children aged 1-9 years.
The prevalence of trachoma (TF) was measured using the Simplified WHO Grading System. Both eyelids were everted and tarsal conjunctiva graded for signs of clinical trachoma. Ocular photographs of right eye were taken on random samples of sentinel children to determine the drift in grading over time. To detect CT infection, an ocular swab of the right eye using a Dacron swab was collected from the sentinel kids. The swab was stored dry, and frozen until shipped and processed in the laboratory. Air control swabs were also taken to test for field and laboratory contamination.</description>

    <description>100 random sentinel children aged 0- 5 years per community were to be examined for prevalence of trachoma &amp; CT infection in Tanzania &amp; Gambia.
50-100 random sentinel children aged 0-5 years per community were to be examined in Niger per community for prevalence of TF and CT infection.
Outcomes are reported at the community level because raw data could not be accessed.
There is no way to determine how many participants were examined in each arm.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for communities:

          -  Communities are located in the target districts and accessible by vehicle

          -  The community leaders consent to have the community enrolled

          -  Rapid assessment and/or available data suggest trachoma rates are higher than 20% in
             the community.

          -  The community size is &lt;5,000 persons or &gt;250 persons.

        If a community meets the inclusion criteria and community leaders consent to have the
        community enrolled, then sentinel children will be selected based on the following
        criteria:

          -  The child is age 5 years or younger

          -  The child must be a resident in an eligible, sample community (defined as either
             living in the community since birth, or moved in with parents or guardians).

          -  The child must not have an ocular condition that would preclude grading trachoma or
             taking an ocular specimen.

          -  The child must be willing to have a swab taken as part of being a sentinel child (this
             is critical for The Gambia and Tanzania, as each swab result counts towards meeting
             the stopping rule)

          -  The child must have an identifiable guardian capable of providing consent to
             participate.

        <title>Community Prevalence of Trachoma and Ocular C. Trachomatis (CT) Infection at Baseline</title>
        <description>Mass drug administration (MDA) with azithromycin or topical tetracycline is recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) for 3 years in districts where the prevalence of trachoma is&gt;=10 % in children aged 1-9 years.
The prevalence of trachoma (TF) was measured using the Simplified WHO Grading System. Both eyelids were everted and tarsal conjunctiva graded for signs of clinical trachoma. Ocular photographs of right eye were taken on random samples of sentinel children to determine the drift in grading over time. To detect CT infection, an ocular swab of the right eye using a Dacron swab was collected from the sentinel kids. The swab was stored dry, and frozen until shipped and processed in the laboratory. Air control swabs were also taken to test for field and laboratory contamination.</description>
