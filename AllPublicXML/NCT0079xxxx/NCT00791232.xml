    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is a noninferiority comparison of the orthostatic tolerability of a
      dose of 12 mg extended-release (ER) OROS paliperidone with the current recommended initial
      titration dose (2 mg) of immediate-release (IR) risperidone in patients with schizophrenia.
      Other study objectives are 1) to compare the tolerability and safety of a clinically
      equivalent fixed dose of ER OROS paliperidone with the currently recommended dose of
      risperidone, 2) to compare the early tolerability of the 2 treatments with placebo, 3) to
      compare tolerability of the 2 treatments, using a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
      (pop PK/PD) model, to 4) assess the relationship between genetic variability in drug
      metabolizing enzymes and interindividual variability in plasma exposure to paliperidone or
      risperidone within each treatment group.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel group, Phase 1.
      The study in patients with schizophrenia consists of a 1 week, open-label, placebo washout
      period (Days -7 to -1) and a 6 day double-blind treatment period during which patients will
      receive 1 of 3 treatments: placebo on Day 1 and ER OROS paliperidone (12 mg) on Days 2 to 6,
      ER OROS paliperidone (12 mg) on Days 1 to 6, or IR risperidone 2 mg on Day 1 and 4 mg on Days
      2 to 6. Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study.. ER OROS paliperidone
      (12 mg, oral) on Days 2 to 6, ER OROS paliperidone (12 mg, oral) on Days 1 to 6, or IR
      risperidone (oral) 2 mg on Day 1 and 4 mg on Days 2 to 6

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willingness to spend 2 weeks as an in-patient during the washout and treatment period

          -  Currently treated with oral risperidone antipsychotic monotherapy for at least 1 month
             prior to screening

          -  DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (Patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia
             [paranoid type (295.30), disorganized type (295.10), catatonic type (295.20),
             undifferentiated type (295.90), or residual type (295.60)] as defined by DSM-IV
             criteria

          -  Absence of acute exacerbation for a minimum of 6 months prior to screening

          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or
             practicing an effective method of birth control (e.g., prescription oral
             contraceptives, contraceptive injections, intrauterine device, double-barrier method,
             contraceptive patch, male partner sterilization) before screening and throughout the
             study, and have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening and baseline

             history, electrocardiogram, and the results of blood biochemistry and hematology tests
             and a urinalysis performed within 30 days of the start of the treatment period. If the
             results of the biochemistry or hematology tests or the urinalysis testing are not
             within the laboratory's reference ranges, the patient may be included only on
