  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the use of G-CSF in peripheral vascular disease. The
      investigators hypothesize that mobilization of angiogenic cells into the blood by granulocyte
      colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may stimulate the formation of new blood vessels and result
      in a sustained improvement in blood flow in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One fourth of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) of the lower extremities have
      severe symptomatic disease and 1-2% have critical limb ischemia (CLI). In patients with CLI,
      the risk of limb amputation at 1 year is 50%. In addition, patients with CLI often have rest
      pain, non-healing ulcers and severe limitations of ambulation. Revascularization procedures,
      including bypass surgery, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and angioplasty with
      stenting, are currently the only treatment options. However, many patients are not eligible
      for a revascularization procedure due to small vessel disease or coexisting medical problems.
      Moreover, restenosis rates are high.

      There is currently no effective non-invasive treatment for critical limb ischemia. We
      hypothesize that mobilization of angiogenic cells into the blood by granulocyte colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) may stimulate angiogenesis in areas of ischemia and result in a
      sustained improvement in blood flow in patients with severe PAD.

    <measure>Toe pressure index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Toe brachial index (TBI) and is a calculation based on the systolic blood pressures of the arm and the systolic blood pressures of the toes. The examination is performed with a photoplethysmograph (PPG) infrared light sensor and a very small blood pressure cuff placed around the toe.
The arm and big toe systolic blood pressure measurements are recorded. Then the big toe systolic pressures are divided by the highest arm pressure to establish an TBI measurement for each leg. A TBI of .75 or greater is consider normal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ankle-brachial index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Ankle Brachial Index (ABI or ABPI) is the ratio of the blood pressure in the lower legs to the blood pressure in the arms. Compared to the arm, lower blood pressure in the leg is an indication of blocked arteries (peripheral vascular disease or PVD). The ABI is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure at the ankle by the systolic blood pressures in the arm.
A normal resting ankle-brachial index is 1 or 1.1.
A resting ankle-brachial index of less than 1 is abnormal. If the ABI is:
Less than 0.95, significant narrowing of one or more blood vessels in the legs is indicated.
Less than 0.8, pain in the foot, leg, or buttock may occur during exercise (intermittent claudication).
Less than 0.4, symptoms may occur when at rest.
0.25 or below, severe limb-threatening peripheral artery disease is probably present.</description>

    <measure>Ulcer healing as measured by surface area and depth</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Skin ulcerations should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeat measurements. A maximum of 3 ulcers on each lower extremity will be followed.
An average of the longest diameter for all ulcerations will be calculated and reported as the baseline average longest diameter. The baseline average will be used as reference by which to characterize the ulcerations.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in rest pain as measured by the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>-25 questions including questions in activity, symptom, pain, emotional, and social domains.
Each question has seven choices ranging from &quot;All&quot; to &quot;None&quot;
Each domain is scored 1-7=the total of domain item scores divided by the number of questions in the domain.
The total score is is also scored 1-7=the total of all the item scores divided by 25.</description>
