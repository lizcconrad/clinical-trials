    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of desloratadine treatment on quality
      of life, daytime functioning, quality of sleep, symptoms, and disease severity in patients
      who had hives for 6 weeks or longer. Patients took desloratadine for 1 month. Once a week,
      patients filled out a questionnaire to tell how their hives affected their lives. This
      questionnaire is called the Dermatology Life Quality Index or DLQI. They also filled out a
      diary every day to tell how much itching they had, how many hives they had, and how their
      hives had affected their sleep or daily activities. The patients and doctors rated the
      patients' overall condition and how much relief patients got from treatment.

             examination; i.e., they must be free of any clinically significant disease (other than
             chronic urticaria [CU]) that would interfere with study evaluations.

          -  Subjects must understand and be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and
             agree to complete the questionnaires and to record accurately and consistently in a
             daily diary symptom severity scores, medication times, concomitant medications, and
             adverse events.

          -  Subjects must have a history of CU defined as at least 6 weeks of pruritus and hives
             with hives lasting less than 24 hours and occurring at least 2 days per week.

             the week prior to the consent visit/visit 1.

             Visit 2 (Baseline).

          -  Subjects must have a total pruritus score of &gt;=11 for the sum of morning (AM) and
             evening (PM) (reflective) diary scores for the 3 days prior to Visit 2 (Baseline) plus
             the morning score on the day of Visit 2
