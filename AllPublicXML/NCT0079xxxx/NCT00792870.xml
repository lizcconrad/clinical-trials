  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major health problem that has reached epidemic levels. Efforts are needed to
      develop cost-effective public health approaches for weight loss and maintenance. One such
      approach is to develop team-based programs that may motivate people to lose weight and/or
      increase their physical activity. One such program is entitled Shape-up Rhode Island (SURI).
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the overall effectiveness of SURI and to test if a
      behavioral intervention can enhance the effectiveness of the original program. The current
      trial is investigating whether adding a behavioral intervention delivered online would
      enhance the outcomes of SURI participants.

      Background: Given the epidemic of obesity, approaches to weight loss that can be applied on a
      community, state, or national level are needed. This project is an ongoing evaluation of
      Shape Up Rhode Island (SURI) program, a state-wide Internet based program involving
      team-based competition to increase physical activity and achieve weight loss.

      Aim: To enhance the effectiveness of SURI utilizing a minimal contact intervention delivered
      online.

      Design: SURI 2008 participants were invited to join a research study focusing on weight loss.
      Interested participants were randomized to two groups including a SURI Enhanced (behavioral
      intervention presented in 12 weekly online presentations) or a SURI Standard group (group
      given a list of previously existing online resources to aid with weight loss).
