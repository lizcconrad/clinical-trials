  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative psychological care is increasingly recognized as an essential part in the
      surgical environment. Previous studies have developed a strategy to evaluate the
      psychological influence after operations and found that postoperative psychological states
      significantly associated with the outcomes of patients. However, preoperative evaluation of
      patients the physicians do thus far is mainly the physical status assessment following the
      scale of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Whether a full-scale evaluation of
      preoperative psychological status to surgical patients could be a predictor to postoperative
      outcomes or not is not still completely understood. The investigators hypothesized that the
      preoperative psychological assessment would be an important predictor to outcomes.
