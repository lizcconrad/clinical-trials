    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a study of
      out-of-pocket costs and the long-term financial impact of allogeneic stem cell transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the indicated treatment for many
      life-threatening illnesses affecting both adults and children. Transplant recovery and late
      effects require long-term medical care. At the same time that the family faces a medical
      crisis, a resulting financial crisis may also be pending, but is often pushed to the
      background due to the necessity of first preserving life. A large proportion of patients
      undergoing HSCT incur significant financial burden from out-of-pocket costs and a decrease in
      household income. Predetermined variables, both medical and demographic, gathered at the
      pre-transplant clinical consultation have the potential to predict the patients at greatest
      financial risk. This study will describe both the out-of-pocket costs and the income changes
      that may result from HSCT to help patients and their caregivers have a clearer picture of
      these costs and develop a financial plan. Health care providers can utilize this information
      to better inform patients and connect them to resources.

          3. Allogeneic HSCT using any donor cell source (related, unrelated, or cord blood)

          4. Any age at HSCT

          5. Diagnosis of primary disease for which HSCT is being performed must have been made
             within two years prior to transplantation

          6. Adult recipients, parents/guardians of pediatric recipients, and primary caregivers
             should be able to read, write, and understand the English language

          7. Signed informed consent from adult patient, caregiver and/or parent/guardian for study
             participation
