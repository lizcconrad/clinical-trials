      This study is a prospective, open-label, non-interventional study. The objective of the study
      is to investigate the impact of fentanyl matrix on improvement of pain and functioning after
      8-week treatment of fentanyl matrix in the patients who complained of spinal disorder-related
      chronic pain in clinical practice according to the investigator's discretion. The primary
      endpoint is a percent of pain intensity difference between baseline and week 8 of the study.
      Each patients will evaluate their pain intensity every 28 days during the 8 weeks. The
      secondary objectives are to observe the change in the following variables after
      administrating fentanyl matrix; K-ODI (Korean version - Oswestry Disability Index) score,
      sleep disturbance, disturbance of activities of daily living and disturbance of social
      activities. In addition, Investigator and patient global assessment, patient preference,
      CGI-I (Clinical Global Impression - Improvement) and Adverse Events will be investigated.
