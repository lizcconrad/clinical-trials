      The present clinical trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of a sequential
      preoperative therapy with Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide in combination with
      Paclitaxel/Trastuzumab, followed by postoperative Trastuzumab in patients with HER-2
      overexpression primary breast cancer.
