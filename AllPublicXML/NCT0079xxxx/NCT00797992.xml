      To evaluate the clinical results of anti-VEGF intra-vitreal injections (IVT) in CNV secondary
      to pathologic myopia (PM-CNV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nineteen consecutive patients (19 eyes) with subfoveal PM-CNV, 18 of whom had been
      unsuccessfully treated with Visudyne PDT, were treated with IVT of 1.25 mg bevacizumab or
      0.5mg ranibizumab. ETDRS best corrected visual acuity, macular thickness on OCT scans, and
      angiographic features were recorded and evaluated. The aspect of OCT scans passing across the
      PM-CNV was also analyzed. IVTs were repeated only in case of persistent angiographic leakage
      and if OCT scans showed retinal thickening or edema and serous retinal detachment. The
      follow-up period was at least 6 months.
