        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Outpatient seeking therapy for correction of hill and valley acne scarring.

          -  Ability and willingness to understand and comply with requirements of the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has active acne or chronic skin disease, inflammation or related
             conditions, such as infection, psoriasis and herpes zoster

          -  History of presence of keloid formation or hypertrophic scars

          -  History of procedures that precipitate an active dermal inflammatory or hyperplastic
             response (i.e., epilation or radiofrequency laser and chemical peeling procedures)
             within one month of study entry

          -  History of use of facial tissue augmenting therapy or aesthetic facial surgical
             therapy within six months prior to study entry

          -  Concomitant anticoagulant therapy, antiplatelet therapy or has any bleeding disorders

          -  History of unanticipated adverse reactions when treated with hyaluronic acid based
             products

          -  Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes the patient unable to
             complete the study per protocol (e.g., patients not likely to avoid other facial
             cosmetic treatments; patients not likely to stay in the study for its duration because
             of other commitments, concomitant conditions, or past history; patients anticipated to
             be unreliable, or patients who have a concomitant condition that may develop symptoms
             that might confuse or confound study treatments or assessments)

          -  History of or current cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions in the area to be treated

          -  Use of any investigational drugs or any other medical devices within 30 days of
             enrolment

          -  Use of any prohibited medication within a proscribed time period before entry

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Recent use of Accutane (patient should not be on Accutane for the last 6 months)

          -  History of allergic/anaphylactic reactions, including hypersensitivity to local
             anaesthetics (lidocaine)

          -  Recent history of trauma in the face (less that 1 year)

          -  Previous of Dermalive or Dermadeep
