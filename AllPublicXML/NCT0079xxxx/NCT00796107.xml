  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and efficacy of R1507 in combination with letrozole in
      patients with advanced breast cancer. In the first part of the study a cohort of patients
      with advanced breast cancer will receive letrozole 2.5mg po daily in combination with R1507
      16mg/kg every 3 weeks. A second cohort of patients who have either progressed or plateaued on
      letrozole treatment will receive 3-weekly cycles of combination treatment with letrozole and
      R1507. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.
