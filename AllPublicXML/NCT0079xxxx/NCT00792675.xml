      The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of exercise on the number of swollen and
      tender joints associated with rheumatoid arthritis. It was hypothesized that persons would
      have less inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis after a 12 week exercise program
      of treadmill walking and weighlifting. Immune parameters were measured to determine potential
      mechanisms responsible for changes in inflammation with exercise.

    <description>Exercise was performed 3 times per week. It consisted of 30 minutes of treadmill exercise at approximately 85% of heartrate max and 2 sets of 6 resistance weight lifting exercises resulting in volitional fatigue at 12 to 15 repetitions.</description>
