      The purpose of this study is to compare two different in vitro fertilization (IVF)
      treatments: conventional IVF protocol and minimal stimulation IVF protocol, in terms of
      success rates, stress of treatment, drug-related side effects, multiple pregnancies and cost
      of treatment.

      A random population of 564 sub-fertile women or couples with a female between ages of 18 and
      38 years and a desire to undergo their first IVF cycle will be included in this outpatient
      clinical trial. The participation in this study will be approximately six months with a total
      of 20 to 25 visits. After successful completion of the pre-screening tests participants are
      randomized into one of the two arms of the study: Arm A - mini IVF protocol, and Arm B -
      conventional IVF protocol.

    <description>The Mini IVF method entails pre-treatment with oral contraceptive pills. Ovarian stimulation is achieved using an oral anti-estrogen in conjunction with injections of gonadotropin (225IU-600IU per cycle), with initial dose of 75IU-150IU per injection. Ovulation is induced by a GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonist nasal spray/hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) injection. Retrieved oocytes following in vitro fertilization (IVF/ICSI) are cultured to the blastocyst stage. Blastocyst stage embryos are vitrified using the CryoTop method. No fresh embryo transfer is conducted. Subsequently, SET of a thawed blastocyst is performed in a natural cycle/HRT that does not involve ovarian stimulation. SETs are conducted until pregnancy is achieved or all vitrified blastocysts have been used.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The standard IVF method entails pre-treatment with a GnRH analog injections in the midluteal phase. Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is achieved with injections of gonadotropin (150IU-300IU/day). Ovulation is induced by hCG injection and retrieved oocytes following in vitro fertilization (IVF/ICSI) are cultured to the blastocyst stage. If this occurs on day 5, then fresh SET/DET (single embryo transfer/double embryo transfer) is performed. Remaining blastocysts are cryopreserved and transferred in subsequent natural cycles/HRT (hormone replacement therapy) that does not involve ovarian stimulation.</description>
