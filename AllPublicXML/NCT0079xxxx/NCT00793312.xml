      The primary objective is to document the acute and mid-term safety and overall clinical
      performance of the Endeavor(TM) Zotarolimus Eluting Coronary stent system in a &quot;real world&quot;
      Chinese patient population requiring stent implantation.

      To assess the event rate in patient subgroups with specific clinical indications and/or
      vessel or lesion characteristics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of the Endeavor(TM) Zotarolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System has
      been assessed in a series of studies, e.g. ENDEAVOR I and ENDEAVOR II. The stent is composed
      of a cobalt alloy and is coated with a proprietary drug compound zotarolimus that is designed
      to reduce restenosis.

      This registry with the Endeavor(TM) Zotarolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System is being
      initiated 1) to expand the clinical knowledge base by including 'real world'patients in China
      and 2) to assess the event rate in Chinese patients known to have a higher risk of major
      adverse cardiac events, for example patients with diabetes mellitus, small vessels and long
      lesions.

      In total the plan is to enroll about 2200 patients from 37 sites.

      Follow-up will be one year for the main patients with cohort to collect acute and mid-term
      follow-up data, but will be extended to two years for certain patient subgroups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is &gt; 18 years of age (or minimum age as required by local regulations).

          -  The patient has consented to participate by signing the &quot;Patient Informed Consent
             Form&quot; and/or has authorized the collection and release of his medical information by
             signing the &quot;Patient Data Release Consent Form&quot;.

          -  Patient is suitable for implantation of one or more Endeavor™ Zotaroliums Eluting
             Coronary Stent System in one or more native artery target lesions.

          -  Patient indication, lesion length and vessel diameter of the target lesion(s) are
             according to the Indications for Use' as mentioned in the 'Instructions for Use' that
             comes with every Endeavor™ Zotarolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System.

          -  The patient is willing and able to cooperate with registry procedures and required
             follow up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with known pregnancy or who are lactating.

          -  Patients with hypersensitivity or allergies to aspirin, heparin, clopidogrel,
             ticlopidine, drugs such as zotaroliums, rapamycin, tacrolimus, sirolimus or similar
             drugs, or any other analogue or derivative, cobalt, chromium, nickel, molybdenum or
             contrast media.

          -  Patients in whom anti-platelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is contraindicated.

             angioplasty balloon.

          -  Current medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.

          -  The subject is participating in another device or drug study. Subject must have
             completed the follow-up phase of any previous study at least 30 days prior to
             enrollment in this trial. The subject may only be enrolled in this Registry once.

          -  Patients with medical conditions that preclude the follow-up as defined in the
             protocol or that otherwise limits participation in this registry.
