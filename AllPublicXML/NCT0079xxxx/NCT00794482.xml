  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, multi-national, open study to assess the pharmacokinetics of NRL972
      in patients with hepatic cirrhosis CTP-classes A, B, and C (histologically confirmed by liver
      biopsy). The pharmacokinetics of NRL972 will be referenced to a Clinical Staging Matrix
      obtained during a clinical work-up of patients with hepatic cirrhosis. Patients to be studied
      will have histologically established hepatic cirrhosis or confirmed hepatic cirrhosis by an
      objective imaging study without confounding end-stage co-morbidity. Within 14 days of
      confirming eligibility, the investigations will be conducted over 2-5 days with the test
      procedures (clinical laboratory tests, ultrasound (US)-investigations, gastroscopy, NRL972-
      and MEGX'-test). Up to one week after the NRL972-test, a follow-up telephone call will be
      made.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting the following conditions will be eligible for enrolment:

          -  Patient has given his or her written informed consent to the study participation,
             prior to study specific procedures

          -  Male and female (non-child-bearing potential = post-menopausal or medically adequate
             contraception)

          -  Ethnicity: any

          -  Age: 18 to 80 years of age

          -  Patients with histologically established diagnosis of hepatic cirrhosis and available
             histological material for review by the central histopathologist or a CTP score
             greater than or equal to 10 points plus an objective imaging study (CT or NMR scan)
             within 3 months of the screening visit with a confirmation of hepatic cirrhosis (scans
             are collected and reviewed), but excluding patients with the diagnosis of primary
             biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and cystic fibrosis-associated liver
             disease

          -  Present CTP-class A, B or C

          -  Medically fit to undergo the protocol-defined procedures without undue risk and
             discomfort

          -  Predicted life-expectancy greater than or equal to 6 months by clinical judgement

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects of any of the following categories will be excluded from enrolment:

          -  Previous participation in this trial (except for scheduled re-testing in relation to
             technical difficulties with initial test)

          -  Participant in any other trial during the last 90 days

          -  Donation of blood during the last 60 days or a history of blood loss exceeding 300 mL
             within the last 3 months

          -  Any donation of germ cells, blood, organs, or bone marrow during the course of the
             study
