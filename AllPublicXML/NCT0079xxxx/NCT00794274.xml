      cutaneous sarcoidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label, phase II trial of CC-10004 for chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis. It
      will include two centers (University of Cincinnati and Medical University of South Carolina).
      The study will evaluate patients with chronic disease who are on a stable treatment regimen
      and have no significant change in their Sarcoidosis Skin Activity and Severity Index score
      (SASI) at two visits at least one month apart.

    <description>Drug: CC-100004
After the screening period, subjects will receive CC-10004 20mg by mouth BID for 84 days. The 84-day duration of treatment is expected to provide adequate time to assess the short-term efficacy and safety of CC-10004 in a population of subjects with chronic cutaneous sarcoidosis</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form

          -  Must be male or female and aged ≥ 18 years at time of consent

          -  Must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements

          -  Patients with sarcoidosis as defined by the ATS/ERS/WASOG statement on sarcoidosis as
             defined by the clinical presentation consistent with sarcoidosis, biopsy finding
             granulomas, and no alternative for the cause of the granulomas, such as tuberculosis

          -  Patients must have chronic cutaneous skin lesions while taking chronic therapy
             (corticosteroids, methotrexate (max 10mg/week), azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine,
             cyclophosphamide, minocycline, doxycycline and chloroquine), in which the dose has not
             been altered in the three months prior to starting the study.

          -  Must have two visits within the previous 1-6 months (at least one month apart) with
             stable skin lesions, such as a SASI score was within one point for each of the
             features of the lesion.

          -  Must meet the following laboratory criteria:

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

               -  Hematocrit ≥ 27%

             [T-SPOT®.TB, QuantiFERON Gold®].

          -  Clinically significant abnormality on the chest x-ray (CXR) at screening not due to
             sarcoidosis

          -  Use of any investigational medication within 28 days.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening

             test result indicating active infection at screening

          -  History of malignancy within previous 5 years (except for treated basal-cell skin
             carcinoma(s) and/or fewer than 3 treated squamous-cell skin carcinomas)
