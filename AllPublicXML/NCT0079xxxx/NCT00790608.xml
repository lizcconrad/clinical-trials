             clinically infected

          -  Must have an ulcer size not to extend beyond the inner borders of the dressing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a ulcer that is being treated with a topical antimicrobial agent or has been
             treated with a topical antimicrobial agent during 3 days prior to enrolment

          -  Has been using systemic antibiotics during 7 days prior to enrolment into this study

          -  Has an ulcer which is identified as malignant in origin (e.g. Marjolin's ulcer)

          -  Has an ulcer size beyond the inner borders of the dressing

          -  Is septic or has other signs of an invasive infection

          -  Has used any investigational drug within 30 days preceding study participation.

          -  Suffers from a condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise
             his or her safety.

          -  Suffers from a condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise
