    <textblock>
      Antibiotic therapy has been shown to be beneficial in patients with severe acute exacerbation
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although recent guidelines support the use
      of new antibiotics there is no evidence that newer antibiotics are any better than older
      agents. The choice of antibiotic to be used in this situation is challenging to the clinician
      who must choose between traditional antibiotics (cyclins, aminop√©nicillins, cotrimoxazole...)
      and new antimicrobial agents. Indeed, available comparative studies did not show an obvious
      superiority of new antibiotics compared to their predecessors . Taking into account bacterial
      agents associated to COPD exacerbations, one must choose an antibiotic which has the best
      activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella
      catarrhalis. News quinolones are represented as an interesting alternative to standard
      antibiotics because of their large spectrum of action and of their pharmacokinetic advantages
      allowing high tissue penetration in the pulmonary parenchyma and tracheobronchial tree. Data
      on their use among patients having moderate exacerbation of COPD are encouraging but their
      effectiveness in more severe presentations is not established. The objective of this
      randomized controlled and double blind study is to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerance
      of ciprofloxacin compared to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole in patients admitted to ICU for
      severe exacerbation of COPD requiring mechanical ventilation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients having a COPD (according to the definition of the American Thoracic
             Society) and having an acute exacerbation leading to an acute respiratory failure
             requiring the admission to ICU and mechanical ventilation.

          -  The acute exacerbation of COPD is defined by increase in the frequency of cough, the
             volume and the purulence of expectoration and increase of baseline dyspnea. To be
             included, patients must have respiratory rate &gt;30 cycles/min and one of the following
             blood gas criteria (with blood gases performed right before the initiation of
             mechanical ventilation): PaC02 &gt; 6kPa and arterial pH &lt;7.30.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pneumonia documented with chest radiography

          -  Antibiotic treatment in the ten previous days of ICU admission

          -  Former inclusion in the study

          -  History of allergy to the quinolones and/or to trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Severe chronic disease: heart, liver, kidney.

          -  Known immunodeficiency (malignant hemopathy, AIDS...)

          -  Digestive disease which could affect the absorption of the drugs

          -  Concomitant infection which requires systemic antibiotic treatment
