    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Response at Test of Cure (TOC) Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>7 to 14 days after end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response (CR) was based primarily on global assessment of clinical presentation of participant made by investigator at evaluation time point. At TOC (7 to 14 days after end of treatment [EOT]) CR was evaluated as &quot;cure&quot;=resolution of clinical signs and symptoms related to the acute infection, or clinical improvement in which no additional antibiotics were deemed necessary when compared to baseline; &quot;failure&quot;=persistence or progression of baseline signs and symptoms of pneumonia (for example: body temperature, white blood cell [WBC] count, respiratory rate, auscultatory findings, cough, sputum production), development of new pulmonary or extrapulmonary clinical findings consistent with active infection and those participants that were not assessed for clinical response due to early discontinuation; &quot;indeterminate&quot;=extenuating circumstances precluded classification to 1 of the above.</description>

    <description>CR was based primarily on global assessment of clinical presentation of participant made by investigator at evaluation time point. At EOT (Day 7 to 10) and follow-up (15 to 28 days after EOT), CR was evaluated as &quot;cure&quot;=resolution of clinical signs and symptoms related to the acute infection, or clinical improvement in which no additional antibiotics were deemed necessary when compared to baseline; &quot;failure&quot;=persistence or progression of baseline signs and symptoms of pneumonia, development of new pulmonary or extrapulmonary clinical findings consistent with active infection and those participants that were not assessed for clinical response due to early discontinuation; with additional CR evaluated as &quot;improvement&quot;= of few not all signs and symptoms of pneumonia when compared to baseline and no additional antibacterial treatment required at EOT and &quot;indeterminate&quot;=extenuating circumstances precluded classification to 1 of the above at follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Microbiological Response at Test of Cure (TOC) Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>7 to 14 days after EOT</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological response assessed at participant level. Eradication=the absence of the original pathogens from the post-treatment TOC culture of specimen from the original site of infection. Presumed eradication=the complete resolution of signs and symptoms associated with cessation of culturable specimen (for example, sputum). Persistence=the presence of the original pathogen in the post-treatment TOC culture specimen from the original site of infection. Presumed persistence=in a participant who was judged to be a clinical failure and a culture of specimen was not possible or was not done, it was presumed that there was persistence of the pathogen. Not applicable microbiologic response included participants that did not have post-treatment microbiologic cultures due to early discontinuation. Data reported for eradication is combination of eradication and presumed eradication data and data reported for persistence is combination of persistence and presumed persistence data.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Symptom Questionnaire at Test of Cure (TOC) and Follow-up Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, TOC (7 to 14 days after end of treatment), Follow-up (15 to 28 days after EOT)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAP Symptom Questionnaire was a participant reported questionnaire administered by interview. It consisted of 12 items (coughing, chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating, chills, headache, nausea, muscle pain, lack of appetite, trouble concentrating, trouble sleeping, and fatigue). Depending on if the participant had or not had symptoms/problems, they were asked how much they had been bothered by the symptoms/problems over the previous 24 hours. CAP items were rated on the 6-point response scale (0 = participant did not have symptom/problem: 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = extremely; if the participant had the symptom/problem and were bothered). All 12 items score were summed and averaged to produce a CAP symptom score (range, 0 to 6). High values indicated poorer outcomes (higher symptom bothersomeness).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Symptom Questionnaire at Test of Cure (TOC) and Follow-up Visit</title>
        <description>The CAP Symptom Questionnaire was a participant reported questionnaire administered by interview. It consisted of 12 items (coughing, chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating, chills, headache, nausea, muscle pain, lack of appetite, trouble concentrating, trouble sleeping, and fatigue). Depending on if the participant had or not had symptoms/problems, they were asked how much they had been bothered by the symptoms/problems over the previous 24 hours. CAP items were rated on the 6-point response scale (0 = participant did not have symptom/problem: 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = extremely; if the participant had the symptom/problem and were bothered). All 12 items score were summed and averaged to produce a CAP symptom score (range, 0 to 6). High values indicated poorer outcomes (higher symptom bothersomeness).</description>

          <description>The CAP Symptom Questionnaire was a participant reported questionnaire administered by interview. It consisted of 12 items (coughing, chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating, chills, headache, nausea, muscle pain, lack of appetite, trouble concentrating, trouble sleeping, and fatigue). Depending on if the participant had or not had symptoms/problems, they were asked how much they had been bothered by the symptoms/problems over the previous 24 hours. CAP items were rated on the 6-point response scale (0 = participant did not have symptom/problem: 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = moderately, 4 = quite a bit, 5 = extremely; if the participant had the symptom/problem and were bothered). All 12 items score were summed and averaged to produce a CAP symptom score (range, 0 to 6). High values indicated poorer outcomes (higher symptom bothersomeness).</description>
