      The purpose of this study is to determine whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation
      influences muscle protein synthesis rates in young and older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loss of muscle mass is a normal consequence of aging. The decline in muscle mass is estimated
      to be 0.2-0.5% per year from 60 years old onwards in healthy subjects with the decline
      worsened by chronic illness, poor appetite and diet, and reduced physical activity in the
      elderly. Increased morbidity is demonstrable with as little as a 5% loss of muscle mass -
      therefore, treatments that can prevent or slow the progression of muscle loss with aging are
      much desired.

      A major cause for loss of muscle mass in advanced age appears to be an impaired ability to
      stimulate the synthesis of muscle protein in response to increased levels of amino acids (the
      building blocks of proteins) and insulin as occurs after eating because of low-grade
      inflammation and insulin resistance in muscle of old persons. We propose that long-chain
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oil) slow the loss of muscle mass because fish oil
      has anti-inflammatory properties and increases the sensitivity of muscle protein synthesis to
      insulin and amino acids. We will test this by studying the effect of fish oil supplementation
      on the muscle protein synthesis process in young and older adults.
