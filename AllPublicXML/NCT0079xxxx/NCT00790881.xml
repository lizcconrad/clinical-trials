    <textblock>
      Despite the clinical significance of potential interactions between antimalarials and
      antiretrovirals, no drug interaction studies have been published and there is an urgent need
      to address this gap in current knowledge.

      This study aims to assess the drug interaction between the antimalarial
      Artemether/Lumefantrine used for management of uncomplicated malaria and Nevirapine-based
      antiretroviral therapy.
