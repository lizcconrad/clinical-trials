    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the predictive value of NRL972 pharmacokinetics in the diagnosis of
      steatohepatitis using fatty liver disease as the comparator group. In addition, the
      sensitivity and specificity of NRL972 pharmacokinetics as a diagnostic tool will be compared
      to results from the standard laboratory tests, elastography, tests of metabolic markers and
      serum fibrosis markers frequently used in the evaluation of clinically predicted NAFLD
      patients. Patients will be included if they have clinical evidence of fatty liver disease and
      have been referred to the clinic for a diagnostic work-up, including a liver biopsy, blood
      tests and scans of the liver.

          -  Having received any investigational drug or treatment within 30 days prior to study
             entry or requiring a concurrent treatment with any other experimental drug or
             treatment
