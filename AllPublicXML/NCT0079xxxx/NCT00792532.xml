    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a new procedure for
      placing DBS electrodes, in which the entire surgery is performed within an MRI scanner
      (&quot;interventional MRI&quot;), with the patient fully asleep (under general anesthesia). The
      standard method for the placement of deep brain stimulators does not use MRI during the
      actual DBS placement. The standard method involves placement of a rigid frame on the
      patient's head, performance of a short MRI scan, transport to the operating room, placement
      of the DBS electrodes in the operating room, and return to the MRI suite for another MR to
      confirm correct electrode placement. In the standard method, the patient must be awake for
      2-4 hours in the operating room to have &quot;brain mapping&quot; performed, where the brain target is
      confirmed by passing &quot;microelectrodes&quot; (thin wires) into the brain to record its electrical
      activity. In the standard method, general anesthesia is not required. In this study, the
      surgery is guided entirely by MRI images performed multiple times as the DBS electrode is
      advanced. This eliminates the need for the patient to be awake, and eliminates the need for
      passing microelectrodes into the brain before placing the permanent DBS electrode.

    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a new but increasingly common surgical technique for the
      treatment of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. The current technical approach to DBS
      implantation involves frame-based stereotaxy. In this method, a stereotactic frame is rigidly
      fixed to the patient's skull, an MRI is obtained, an anatomic target is identified, and the
      coordinates of the target in stereotactic space are calculated. Instruments are mounted on
      the stereotactic frame that point to the calculated coordinate. However, due to the inherent
      inaccuracies in standard frame-based stereotaxy, a complex 6-hour procedure then ensues to
      &quot;map&quot; the brain target with microelectrodes, place the lead, and return to the MR unit to
      confirm proper placement.

      The goal of this project is to test the feasibility of performing DBS implantation entirely
      within the Phillips 1.5T and a Siemens 3T open magnet MRI machine. Prior to study initiation,
      instrumentation and MR protocols were tested using a phantom head. In the proposed project,
      subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus DBS implantations will be performed bilaterally in
      patients with Parkinson's disease or dystonia. Patients will be under general anesthesia.
      Targeting and lead verification are performed with imaging alone, without physiologic
      mapping. Data is to be gathered on the following: operative time, degree of benefit with
      bilateral implantation (changes in standard rating scales of motor disability), DBS voltage
      requirements, complications), and electrode location by MR. These measures will be compared
      with our historical controls, previously entered into our research database, in which
      electrodes were placed by the standard methods. We expect that the use of near real time MR
      will improve the speed and accuracy of DBS implantation, and eliminate the need for invasive
      physiological monitoring.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of idiopathic PD with clinically significant motor fluctuations despite
             maximized anti-Parkinsonian therapy. This will be based on medical history, neurologic
             examination (the presence of at least 2 of the following: resting tremor, rigidity, or
             bradykinesia), and response to anti-Parkinsonian therapy.

          2. Approximately 5 years' duration, relative to the date of surgery, since diagnosis of
             PD.

          3. Age &gt;20 inclusive, on date of surgery.

          4. The subject is ambulatory in their best on time (not wheelchair bound).

          5. The subject is medically able to undergo the surgery as determined by clinical and
             laboratory evaluations and any other evaluations that are part of the standard
             practice at the institution in which the subject is to undergo surgery (e.g., subjects
             will have normal coagulation tests and normal platelet levels).

          6. The subject is expected to be able to comply with and understand the required visit
             schedule and all required tests and procedures.

          7. Signed IRB-approved informed consent is obtained before any study-specific procedure,
             including assessments required during the eligibility evaluation period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. In the judgment of the investigator, a history of any clinically significant medical,
