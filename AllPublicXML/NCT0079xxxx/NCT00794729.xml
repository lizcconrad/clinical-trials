  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sub-study of a drug development study conducted by Pfizer, Inc. It will evaluate
      how well people who participate in research studies understand from the study consent form
      what the purpose of the study is, the risks and benefits of participating, the procedures
      they will undergo and their right to withdraw from the study before it ends. It will compare
      the understanding and satisfaction of those who are given a standard consent form with those
      who are given a simpler, concise consent form and examine how their understanding of the
      information is affected by the length, complexity, format, and reading level of the document.

      People 18 years of age and older who are participating in a Pfizer drug development study and
      who are able to read and write English may be eligible for this sub-study.

      Participants in Pfizer's drug development study who agree to participate in this sub-study
      are randomized to receive either the standard consent form or the concise consent form. The
      standard consent consists of a detailed, multiple page consent form. The concise form is
      simpler, written at a lower reading comprehension level. Both forms contain all of the
      required elements of informed consent according to federal regulations, and include
      information needed to make a decision about participating in the study. Each form also
      contains information regarding participation in this sub-study. The standard group signs the
      standard consent form; the concise group is given the standard consent after reviewing the
      concise form and is asked to review and sign it.

      After reviewing the consent form for the main study, participants complete a 20-minute
      questionnaire that includes questions that measure understanding of study information such as
      its purpose, risks and benefits, compensation schemes, and other information. Additional
      questions ask about how the participants made the decision to enroll in the study.

      This informed consent study is a sub-study of phase 1 drug development studies conducted by
      Pfizer International and is designed to evaluate research participant understanding and
      satisfaction after being randomized to receive written study information from either a
      standard consent form or a concise consent form.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All willing adults at least 18 years old who come to the Pfizer CRU to consider
        volunteering for a phase 1 study for which there is a consent sub-study and who are able to
        read and answer questions in English are eligible to participate in the sub-study. Only
        adults (over 18 years old) who can provide their own consent will be included. Because the
        consent forms for Pfizer studies are written in English, the sub-study will only include
        individuals who can read and answer questions in English.
