    <description>E6201 Part A (Dose Escalation): Intravenous (IV) infusion administered over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks (Days 1, 8, and 15). The first 3 to 6 subjects of the first cohort will receive 20 mg/m^2/week for a cycle of 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period. Subsequent dose escalations may increase at increments of 100% until two Grade 2 toxicities or 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) are observed in a dose group. Thereafter, doses will be increased in increments of 50% or less until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Part B (MTD Expansion): After the MTD is determined in Part A, 15 additional subjects will continue to receive cycles at the MTD.</description>

    <criteria>

          3. Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed metastatic melanoma which has progressed
             after treatment with approved therapies or for which there are no standard effective
             therapies available. CNS metastases from a primary melanoma are allowed.

          4. Subjects must have melanoma tumor status established by a BRAF-gene analysis report
             from a CLIA qualified laboratory.

          5. Subjects must have at least one tumor lesion accessible to biopsy in addition to one
             which is accurately and serially measurable according to RECIST 1.0 using either
             CT/MRI or photography (as appropriate), and which measures greater than 1.5 cm in the
             longest diameter for a non-lymph node and greater than 2.0 cm in the short axis
             diameter for a lymph node.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use medically acceptable
             methods of contraception, such as abstinence, double-barrier method (e.g., condom and
             spermicide; condom, diaphragm, and spermicide), intrauterine device (IUD), or have a
             vasectomised partner. Female subjects who use hormonal contraceptives must also use an
             additional approved method of contraception (as described previously). Contraceptive
             measures must start either prior to or at Screening and continue throughout the entire
             study period and for 2 months after the last dose drug is administered. Pregnant
             and/or lactating females are excluded.

          7. Male subjects must agree to use contraceptive methods such as abstinence, or
             double-barrier method (e.g., condom and spermicide; condom, diaphragm, and
             spermicide). Contraceptive measures must start either prior to or at Screening and
             continue throughout the entire study period and for 2 months after the last dose of
             study drug is administered.

          8. Adequate bone marrow function defined as:

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL; however, a hemoglobin value less
                  than 9.0 g/dL is acceptable if it is corrected to greater than or equal to 9.0
                  g/dL by growth factor or transfusion before the start of treatment

               -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L.

          9. Adequate renal function defined as:

                  than 50 mL/minute per the Cockcroft-Gault formula 10 Adequate liver function
                  defined as:

               -  Total Bilirubin within normal limits

               -  AP, ALT, and AST less than or equal to 5 x ULN in the case of liver metastases
                  and liver-specific AP less than or equal to 3 x ULN in the case of bone
                  metastases 11 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less

        12. Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible to participate in this
        study:

          1. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), clinical evidence of active viral hepatitis
             B or C, or severe/uncontrolled infections or intercurrent illness that is unrelated to

          2. Prior surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or investigational agents
             within 4 weeks prior to the first infusion and prior immunotherapy, hormonal, or

             toxicities related to prior treatments should have resolved.

             treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix).

             (ECG) obtained at Screening (Day -21 to 0) using the Fridericia method for QTc
             analysis.

          5. History or substance or alcohol abuse which, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             prohibit participation in the study.

          6. History of clinically significant cardiac impairment, congestive heart failure, New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac disease classification Class II, unstable
             angina, or myocardial infarction during the previous 6 months, or serious cardiac
             arrhythmia.

          7. Current significant co-morbid disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             exclude the subject from the study.
