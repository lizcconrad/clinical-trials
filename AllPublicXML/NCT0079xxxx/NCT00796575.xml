             -4, and within 24 hours before dosing.

          -  Male subjects must agree not to donate sperm during the study and for 3 months after
             their last scheduled visit. Males must also agree to use a use a condom with

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 19 to 30 kg/m inclusive and weight &lt;300 lbs.

          -  Good health as determined by the absence of clinically significant deviation from
             normal, based on medical history, physical examination, laboratory reports, and
             12-lead ECG, as deemed by the Investigator, prior to enrollment.

          -  Able to understand and willing to comply with all study requirements, and willing to
             follow the study medication regimen.

          -  Willing and able to give a written informed consent.

          -  Negative urine test for drugs of abuse and alcohol at screening and check-in.

          -  Negative result for HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C
             antibody at screening.

          -  Subjects must agree not to donate blood, plasma, platelets, or any other blood
             components during the study and for 4 weeks after the last dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  WOCBP is pregnant (as based on test results) or is breast feeding.

          -  Subject is not using adequate contraceptive precautions.

          -  Any history of drug abuse.

          -  History of alcohol addiction during the 2 years prior to Day 1.

          -  History of significant allergic response to any drug except penicillin, or known
             sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during dosing.

          -  History or current evidence, as determined by the Investigator, of psychiatric or
             emotional problems which would invalidate giving informed consent or limit the ability
             of the subject to comply with study requirements.

          -  History or current evidence of clinically significant cardiac, hepatic, renal,
             pulmonary, endocrine, neurologic, infectious, gastrointestinal (ie, any condition
             which may affect drug absorption), hematologic, or oncologic disease as determined by
             the Investigator after reviewing screening history, physical examination, laboratory
             test results, and 12-lead ECG.

          -  History or current alcoholic or non-alcoholic liver disease or liver steatosis.

             machine readings on the triplicate ECG (3 readings not more than 2 minutes apart)

          -  Familial relationship with any other study participant.

          -  Screening laboratory values outside the range of normal values deemed clinically
             significant by the Investigator. Serum lipid tests, triglycerides, cholesterol (LDL,
             HDL and total cholesterol), liver function tests (ALT, AST, GGT, total bilirubin, LDH
             and ALP) and PSA must not exceed the upper limit of normal without permission of the
             Sponsor. For males, testosterone, LH and FSH must be within normal limits.

             removed, metal slivers in eyes, shrapnel, hearing aid that cannot be removed,
             non-removable metal dental work or dentures, tattoos over 20 years old, IUD or penile
             implant. An X-ray may be required to assess eligibilty for the procedure.
