      Inflammatory or degenerative diseases of the brain and spinal cord, such as multiple
      sclerosis, may be related to problems with an individual s immune system. However, more
      information is needed on the ways in which the cells of the immune system interact with the
      central nervous system (CNS). This study will compare tests performed on both healthy
      volunteers and individuals who have signs or symptoms of immune-related damage to their CNS.

      This study will include two groups of subjects at least 12 years old. Subjects will either
      have symptoms of immune-related CNS damage, or will be healthy volunteers selected for
      comparison purposes.

      Study participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center on an outpatient basis for an initial
      evaluation visit. During the visit, patients will provide a comprehensive medical history and
      undergo a neurological examination, and will provide blood samples for research purposes. The
      healthy volunteers will be asked to schedule a return visit for a magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) procedure, and may be asked to undergo other tests requested by the study researchers
      on an as-needed basis. The group of patients with symptoms of immune-related CNS damage will
      be asked to undergo a series of tests, including the following:

        -  MRI procedures, with a minimum of three brain MRIs and one spinal cord MRI taken
           approximately 4 weeks apart

        -  A diagnostic lumbar puncture, performed on an outpatient basis

        -  Tests of brain and vision activity

        -  Additional blood and tissue samples

      All study participants will return for a followup visit 1 year after the initial evaluation
      visit. Patients with symptoms of immune-related CNS damage may be offered the opportunity to
      participate in additional followup tests with NIH researchers.

      Objective: The goal of this study is to define the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying
      the development of disability in immune-mediated disorders of the central nervous system
      (CNS) and to distinguish these from physiological (and often beneficial) responses of the
      human immune system to CNS injury. The long-term objective of the study is to acquire
      knowledge that would allow us to therapeutically inhibit the pathogenic mechanisms and
      enhance repair mechanisms in immune-mediated CNS diseases, thereby minimizing the extent of
      CNS tissue damage and promoting recovery.

      The protocol also serves as a screening tool for NDU clinical trials and enables development
      of clinically-useful tools such as diagnostic tests and new, sensitive scales of neurological
      disability, disease severity and CNS tissue destruction.

      Study Population: Patients with evidence, or suspicion of immune-mediated CNS injury will be
      enrolled. In addition, healthy volunteers will be included as controls for immunological and
      imaging and biomarkers and to obtain normative data for development of new clinical scales
      and smartphone apps.

      Design: We will collect, in a standardized manner, multimodal data (standardized
      clinical/functional, neuroimaging and molecular/immunological data) during the diagnostic
      work-up of patients with varied disorders of the CNS in which immunemediated

      processes are expected to play a pathophysiological role.

      For the patient cohort, a comprehensive initial evaluation will be performed to establish a
      definitive diagnosis or confirm diagnosis and subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS) as a
      pre-requisite for enrollment into NDU clinical trials, but also to collect consistent
      multimodal research data. Additional diagnostic tests, tailored to individual patients, may
      be performed if required for the diagnostic process. The protocol stipulates a mandatory
      follow-up visit for all adult patients inclusive of clinical, functional and MRI
      examinations. Depending on the specific diagnosis, treatment decisions and clinical/research
      needs, patients may be offered additional follow-up visits. The maximum frequency of the
      follow-up visits and research samples to be collected is specified to ensure patient safety
      is not compromised. Patients age 12-17 may also be included in the patient cohort to
      establish a definitive diagnosis, or to provide non-standard assays to help with diagnostic
      and therapeutic decisions as part of extraordinary clinical care.

      The volunteer cohort will provide sex and age-matched (to adult patients) normative values.

      Additionally, we will also enroll patients from whom only biological samples collected by
      outside clinicians will be processed. This will be done to provide non-standard assays to
      help with diagnostic and therapeutic decisions as a part of extraordinary clinical care.

      Outcome Measures: Clinical, MRI and immunological measures will be the outcome measures.
      However, no pre-defined research questions will be addressed other than to establish the
      diagnosis, determine the level of disease activity, and monitor the natural history.
