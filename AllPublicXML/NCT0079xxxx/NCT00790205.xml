  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial designed to assess the cardiovascular outcome of long-term treatment
      with sitagliptin used as part of usual care compared to usual care without sitagliptin in
      participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) having a history of cardiovascular (CV)
      disease and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.5% to 8.0%.

      Primary hypothesis A is that sitagliptin, when used as part of usual care, is non-inferior to
      usual care without sitagliptin with regard to the risk of developing a confirmed event in the
      primary CV composite endpoint of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) plus. If
      hypothesis A is satisfied: hypothesis B is that sitagliptin, when used as part of usual care,
      is superior to usual care without sitagliptin with regard to the risk of developing a
      confirmed event in the primary CV composite endpoint.
