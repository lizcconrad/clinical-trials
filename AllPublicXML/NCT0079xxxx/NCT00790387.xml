  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing coronary angioplasty are frequently treated with new drugs that stop
      blood platelets working and so improve the success of the procedure. Individual patients may
      vary in the dose of the drug required. New platelet tests have been developed which can be
      performed near the patient and possibly immediately tell the doctor the degree of platelet
      inhibition achieved so that the dose can be adjusted accordingly. This study aims to
      investigate if these platelet tests indicate if new anticoagulants are more effective at
      inhibiting platelet function than the traditional anticoagulants. The study will demonstrate
      if these newer drugs improve blood flow through the heart muscle and thereby provide better
      long term outcomes for patients undergoing percutaneous intervention.

      Objectives: The study assessed the benefit of high bolus dose tirofiban with enoxaparin
      compared to unfractionated heparin.

      Introduction: The benefit of the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIa inhibitors with low molecular
      weight heparins in high risk patients undergoing percutaneous intervention (PCI) over
      traditional unfractionated heparin (UFH) is debated. Methods; The study is a prospective
      single center open-label trial of patients with high-risk acute coronary syndrome treated
      with PCI who were randomised to anticoagulation with UFH or enoxaparin with 'high dose' (25
      mcg/kg bolus) tirofiban This study measured a panel of platelet activation markers,
      inflammatory biomarkers and thrombus generation between the two groups.
