  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs) are tumours associated with asbestos exposure
      involving the tissue lining surrounding the lung. Radiation therapy (RT) dramatically reduces
      the risk of tumour recurrence within the irradiated area (&gt;90%). But patients continue to
      succumb to MPMs due to the tumour spreading outside the chest cavity. This may be due to
      tumour cells inadvertently contaminating areas outside the chest cavity during surgery. The
      study will look at whether giving a short intense course of chest radiation just prior to
      surgery will sterilized these tumour cells and thus, avoid or reduce contamination of the
      areas outside the chest cavity. The investigators hypothesize that short neoadjuvant
      (pre-operative) hemithoracic RT, followed by immediate planned extrapleural pneumonectomy
      (EPP) (+/- adjuvant chemotherapy) will reduce the risk of intra-operative seeding and reduce
      the incidence of distant metastatic disease.

    <textblock>
      The study is a phase I/II prospective single cohort clinical feasibility study. 100 patients
      with early stage resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma will be enrolled into the study.
      Patients will have a baseline PET scan. Patients on the study will receive IMRT for
      approximately 1 week of 5 daily treatments. 1 week post-RT, they will proceed with an
      extrapleural pneumonectomy. If the mediastinal lymph nodes that are removed during surgery
      are positive for tumour cells, 3 cycles of chemotherapy, consisting of raltitrexed and
      cisplatin OR Pemetrexed and cisplatin, will be given 6-12 weeks post-surgery. Before and
      during treatment, side effects will be assessed. After treatment, follow up visits will be
      conducted every 1 to 2 months for the first year, and every 3 months for the second year. At
      each visit, a history and physical examination will be performed and ECOG performance status
      will be assessed. Routine tests will include CBC, liver profile, creatinine and chest x-ray.
      CT thorax and abdomen will be done at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Additional test may be
      done at the discretion of the oncologist if the patient becomes symptomatic. The study will
      evaluate the feasibility and safety of short pre-operative RT, and may help confirm the
      intraoperative seeding hypothesis. Preoperative RT may also reduce the risk of both local and
      distant spread and, ultimately, improve overall survival. By shortening overall treatment
      time, it may also improve patient compliance and convenience. We may be able to give
      chemotherapy only to patients that are at highest risk and avoid it in others.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

             (MPM). Sarcomatoid or biphasic histologies can be included but will be analyzed
             separately due to their poor prognosis

             may be included at the discretion of the surgeon if deemed resectable.
