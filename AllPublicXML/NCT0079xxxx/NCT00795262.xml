  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will evaluate the combination of quinapril and alpha lipoic acid in patients with diabetes
      mellitus and hypertension. We will determine whether the combination of quinapril and lipoic
      acid as compared to quinapril and placebo provides benefit on systemic blood pressure and
      proteinuria.

      The participant will be randomized to either quinapril 40 mg and alpha lipoic acid versus
      quinapril 40 mg and placebo for 8 weeks. There will be a wash out period of 4 weeks between
      the cross over. The participant will be assigned the cross over for 8 weeks on the opposite
      therapy.

        Patients who have a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus as defined by fasting blood glucose
        levels greater than ot equal to 126mg/dL and a systolic BP greater than 125 mm Hg at the
        time of screening will be included in the study. Patients may be on antihypertensive
        medication but not on ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy at the time of enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mmHg Creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl Glycosylated hemoglobin &gt; 7.5%

        investigational drug within the last 30 days Pregnant or nursing women Participants who
        experience any side effects to quinapril and/or alpha lipoic acid

        Women of childbearing potential Women of childbearing potential enrolled in the study
        should use one of the acceptable methods of birth control as listed below

          1. Abstinence, meaning a total lack of any sexual activity.

          2. Oral contraceptives (the &quot;pill&quot;),

          7. Male partner sterilization.

        Pregnancy Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported to the
        Principal Investigator and the study coordinator at the earliest. The pregnancy must be
        followed up to determine outcome and status of the mother and child. To ensure subject
        safety, any subject that becomes pregnant during the study will be discontinued from the
        trial.
