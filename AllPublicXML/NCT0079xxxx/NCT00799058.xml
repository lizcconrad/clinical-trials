    <textblock>
      IPM 020 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 expanded safety trial being
      conducted at 5 research centers in the United States among approximately 180 healthy,
      sexually active, HIV-negative women to assess the safety of Dapivirine Gel 4759, 0.05% 2.5g
      and Dapivirine Gel 4789, 0.05% 2.5g as compared to the HEC-based universal placebo.
