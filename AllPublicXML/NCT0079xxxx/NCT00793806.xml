  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The common causes of mortality are late stages of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular
      disease and infections, are associated with abnormalities of the immune system, an underlying
      state of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. These processes have not been carefully
      described in the chronic kidney disease population. The researcher can use Diffuse Optical
      Spectroscopy to determine the immune system in individuals with chronic kidney disease and
      describe the association with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in that population.

      The Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy can measure the absolute concentrations of reduced and
      oxygenated hemoglobins,cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, blood loss,blood hemoglobin
      concentration, water and lipid concentrations of the tissue.

      The researchers can use Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy to monitor volume changes during the
      hemodialysis treatment and to correlate the changes in volume and blood pressure with the
      measures of oxidative stress and inflammation used in this study. The researchers can use
      Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy data to compare to laboratory parameters routinely measured to
      clinical parameters such as cause of chronic kidney disease, blood pressure and
      dialysis-related parameters.
