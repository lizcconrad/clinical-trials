  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with a lifetime morbidity risk close to 1 %,
      involving both genetic and environmental risk factors. Prospective studies have shown that
      heavy use of cannabis in adolescence moderately increases the risk of developing
      schizophrenia. Many data have also suggested that the co-occurrence of cannabis abuse in
      patients with schizophrenia has a deleterious impact on the clinical outcome of
      schizophrenia. Cannabis abuse by schizophrenic patients is a significant public health
      problem for which there is no empirically validated treatment. We are presently studying the
      efficiency of motivational therapy on cannabis consumption in patients with schizophrenia.

      problem for which there is no empirically validated treatment. We are presently studying the
      efficiency of motivational therapy on cannabis consumption in patients with schizophrenia.

      330 patients with schizophrenia and cannabis abuse or dependence (according to DSM-IV
      criteria) are randomly assigned to 4 motivational interview during one month or usual
      intensive treatment. Treatment is conducted in outpatient which are evaluated at the
      inclusion and at 6 month with Time-Line Follow Bach for the consumption, PANSS score, number
      of relapse…). A outcome measure was urinalysis results providing an objective measure of
      cannabis use throughout the six month of the trial.
