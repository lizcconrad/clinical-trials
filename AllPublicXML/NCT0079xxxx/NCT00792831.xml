  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, un-controlled, phase II, pilot clinical trial testing ITF2357 in a
      population of CLL patients relapsed after or refractory to conventional chemotherapy or
      relapsed after autologus bone marrow transplantation.

      Patient will receive ITF 2357 orally at the dose of 100 mg x 2/die for three months with
      subsequent dose modifications if requested by the patient's conditions.

      Primary objective: To determine overall response-rate, complete response (CR) or partial
      response (PR) Secondary objectives: To assess the safety and tolerability of ITF2357; to
      assess total rate of responders (complete + partial responders); to determine the 6 months
      progression free survival; to determine the effects of the drug on haematological parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLL is the most frequent type of leukemia in the western world and affects mainly elderly
      individuals, although about one third of patients are less than 60 years of age at diagnosis.

      CLL is a heterogeneous disease characterised by a surprisingly diverse clinical course with
      patients that may have an overall survival time ranging from months to decades.

      CLL accounts for approximately 7000 new cases and 4500 deaths per year in the US.

      Chemotherapeutic treatment of CLL is largely ineffective and despite new emerging therapies,
      CLL still remains an incurable disease.

      ITF 2357 is a novel and proprietary molecule synthesized by Italfarmaco S.p.A. Research
      Laboratories, provided with an established and powerful HDAC-inhibitory activity (see below
      for further details). It is being developend for a range of possible clinical applications
      both in oncohaematological conditions and in chronic inflammatory diseases. The former
      application is consistent with the well known antitumor pharmacological properties of
      HDAC-inhibitors as a family (i.e. cell-cycle arrest, pro-apoptotic and cell-differentiating
      effects); the latter application (chronic inflammation) is based of the demonstrated
      anticytokine effect of ITF 2357.
