    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to track and document the clinical outcomes of patients
      with radicular pathology following posterior lateral fusion with the Dynesys Spinal System.
      Secondary purpose of this study is to assess outcomes with historical controls along a
      continuum of motion and anatomy sparing procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will help the patient to the extent that it will allow the comparison of this
      unique treatment to the corpus of literature on radicular pathology, thus focusing a specific
      treatment for a specific pathology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Spondylolisthesis of less than Grade II at the index level (degenerative with intact
             pars)

          -  Will receive a decompression for lumbar stenosis

          -  Symptoms of leg and/or back pain

          -  One pathological level

          -  Between the ages of 20 and 80 at the time of surgery

          -  Non-responsive to non-surgical treatment for at least six months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Osteolytic spondylolisthesis

          -  Planned complete facetectomy

          -  Two or more pathological levels (and as enumerated int he Dynesys Spinal system
             instructions for use)

          -  Use in the cervical spine

          -  Active systemic or local infection

          -  Extreme obesity as defined by a Body Mass Index (BMI)over 40. BMI calculated using
             Appendix A, adapted from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Clinical
             Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity
             in Adults.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Mental illness

          -  Severe osteoporosis or osteopenia. The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis
             as BMD&lt;-2.5t. Professional discretion should be used and if bone quality is in
             question a DEXA scan is recommended.

          -  Sensitivities/allergy to metals, polymers, polyethylene, polycarbonate urethane and
             polyethylene terephthalate

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Patient unwilling or unable to follow postoperative instructions

          -  Soft tissue deficit not allowing sound closure

          -  Any medical or physical condition that would preclude the potential benefit of spinal
             surgery

          -  Inadequate pedicles of the lumbar or sacral vertebrae; congenital abnormalities,
             tumors or other conditions that would prevent secure component fixation that has the
             potential to decrease the useful life of othe devices;

          -  Any medical or mental condition which would exclude the patient at high risk from
             surgery of the severity
