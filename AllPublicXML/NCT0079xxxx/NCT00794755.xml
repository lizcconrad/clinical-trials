  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of low dose Vitamin K1 (200
      micrograms per day) at improving anticoagulation control in unstable patients on warfarin.
      This study will also aim to look at effectiveness in the context of genes known to influence
      warfarin metabolism, variability in the consumption of Vitamin K rich foods, and patient
      knowledge about warfarin anticoagulation -- factors which have been associated with
      anticoagulation control and which can influence the effectiveness of this intervention in
      clinical practice.

      A double-blinded placebo controlled pilot RCT assessing the effectiveness of daily
      supplementation with low dose Vitamin K1 (200 micrograms per day) against placebo at
      improving anticoagulation control. Previous studies assessing the efficacy of this
      intervention have been small and further trials are required to evaluate the true
      effectiveness and safety profile. Furthermore the impact of genetic polymorphisms, known to
      impact warfarin metabolism, on the effectiveness/safety of this intervention will also be
      assessed in this study. Demographic and clinical variables as well as potential confounding
      variables such as variable dietary Vitamin K intake, concomitant interacting medications, and
      anticoagulation knowledge will be assessed in this study. Given that this is a pilot study we
      will be looking at recruitment numbers and necessary parameter estimates to determine the
      number of patients available at our institution for the study. Power analysis will be
      performed to evaluate the treatment effect size between the placebo and intervention groups.
