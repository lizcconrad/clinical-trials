  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a very common disease, affecting approximately 65 million people in the
      United States. As many as 30 % of people with hypertension, approximately 20 million
      individuals, remain undiagnosed. As many as one third of patients seen in ED were noted to
      have elevated BP readings in prior studies. Approximately 5% of emergency department (ED)
      patients have severely elevated blood pressure. Prior studies suggest that as many as two
      thirds of ED patients with elevated BP can benefit from further therapy or closer clinic
      follow-up. However primary care follow-up after ED discharge with an elevated BP is
      surprisingly low. The purpose of this study is to measure the follow-up rate after the ED
      visit in individuals identified with elevated blood pressure after a brief counseling
      regarding risks of elevated blood pressure.
