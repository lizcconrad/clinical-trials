    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and effectiveness of two medications for treating
      aggression in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD is characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Children with ADHD
      sometimes also have disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs), such as conduct disorder (CD),
      which is estimated to develop in 20% to 40% of children with ADHD, and oppositional defiant
      disorder (ODD), which is estimated to develop in 33% to 50% of children with ADHD. These two
      disorders place youth at risk of other psychiatric disorders, especially substance abuse
      disorders. Several medications have been tested to treat conduct disorders in aggressive
      children, and, among these, risperidone and methylphenidate hydrochloride (HCl) have
      relatively good records of safety and tolerability. Psychostimulants, such as methylphenidate
      HCl, can reduce the symptoms in some, but not all, children with DBDs. Combining
      methylphenidate HCl with risperidone may be one way to increase the effectiveness of drug
      treatments. This study will compare the effectiveness of methylphenidate HCl alone versus
      methylphenidate HCl combined with risperidone for treating aggressive behavior in children
      with ADHD. Participation in this study will last 1 year. The child participant and a parent
      will attend all study visits. Two initial visits will involve a battery of baseline tests,
      including a psychological clinical interview, physical examination, lab tests, and an
      electrocardiogram (ECG). The parents will undergo a parent education session and complete
      questionnaires about their child's behavior, emotions, and medication side effects. The child
      will have his or her vital signs measured and complete tests of verbal memory and attention
      and impulsiveness. After the second visit, the child participant will be randomly assigned to
      receive either methylphenidate HCl alone or methylphenidate HCl plus risperidone.

      For the next 3 weeks, all child participants will take methylphenidate HCl at a dose that
      will start low and gradually be increased until the most effective dose is determined. For
      the next 6 weeks, child participants will add either risperidone or a placebo to their
      regimen of methylphenidate HCl. This second medication will also be started at a low dose and
      raised to appropriate levels of tolerability. During the 9 weeks of medication adjustment,
      participants will attend weekly study visits to complete questionnaires and have their vital
      signs measured. Parents will attend education sessions at each of these visits. The child's
      teacher will also fill out weekly questionnaires on the child's behavior. Every 3 weeks,
      child participants will be tested on verbal memory, attention, and impulsiveness. After the
      9-week period, child participants will again undergo a physical exam, lab tests, and an ECG.

      At this point, if the child's behavior has improved, the child will continue the same
      treatment for the next 3 months. Monthly study visits will include parent education sessions
      and recording of parent and teacher evaluations of the child. All participants will attend a
      1-year follow-up visit that will include previous assessments.

    <measure>NCBRF-TIQ D-Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</time_frame>
    <description>Parent ratings of aggression and hostility on the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form-Typical IQ (NCBRF-TIQ) D-Total Score. The NCBRF provides 1 prosocial subscale (Positive/Social) and 6 problem behavior subscales (Conduct Problem, Oppositional Behavior, Hyperactive, Inattentive, Overly Sensitive, and Withdrawn/Dysphoric). The NCBRF has excellent internal consistency, distinguishes between controls and subjects with DBDs. Conduct Problem and Oppositional Behavior subscales map closely to DSM-IV-TR symptoms of CD and ODD; they were scored together to form a variable called the D-Total.
For the NCBRF D-Total, higher scores reflect worse behavior. Each subscale is scored by taking the rating (0 [did not occur or was not a problem] to 3 [occurred a lot or was a very severe problem]) for all component items. The D-Total score was computed by adding the 6 scores from the Oppositional subscale and the 10 items from the Conduct Problem subscale. Thus D-Total scores could range from 0-69.</description>

    <measure>Antisocial Behavior Scale - Reactive Aggression Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and Week 9</time_frame>
    <description>The Antisocial Behavior Scale (ABS) is a 28-item scale that contains 10 Proactive Aggression items and six Reactive Aggression items. Each item is rated on a 3-point scale, ranging from 1 (Never) to 3 (Very often). Thus, scores on the Reactive Aggression subscale can range from 6 through 18; with higher scores indicating more reactive aggression.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at endpoint visit</time_frame>
    <description>Using this clinician rating scale the patient's improvement is scored on a 7-point scale which ranges from &quot;very much improved&quot; (1), through &quot;no change&quot; (4), to &quot;very much worse&quot; (7). This scale was used at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp; 9. Only endpoint (week 9 or subject's last visit) Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement scores are reported below.</description>

        <title>NCBRF-TIQ D-Total Score</title>
        <description>Parent ratings of aggression and hostility on the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form-Typical IQ (NCBRF-TIQ) D-Total Score. The NCBRF provides 1 prosocial subscale (Positive/Social) and 6 problem behavior subscales (Conduct Problem, Oppositional Behavior, Hyperactive, Inattentive, Overly Sensitive, and Withdrawn/Dysphoric). The NCBRF has excellent internal consistency, distinguishes between controls and subjects with DBDs. Conduct Problem and Oppositional Behavior subscales map closely to DSM-IV-TR symptoms of CD and ODD; they were scored together to form a variable called the D-Total.
For the NCBRF D-Total, higher scores reflect worse behavior. Each subscale is scored by taking the rating (0 [did not occur or was not a problem] to 3 [occurred a lot or was a very severe problem]) for all component items. The D-Total score was computed by adding the 6 scores from the Oppositional subscale and the 10 items from the Conduct Problem subscale. Thus D-Total scores could range from 0-69.</description>

Each item is rated on a 3-point scale, ranging from 1 (Never) to 3 (Very often).

        <title>Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement</title>
        <description>Using this clinician rating scale the patient's improvement is scored on a 7-point scale which ranges from “very much improved” (1), through “no change” (4), to “very much worse” (7). This scale was used at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp; 9. Only endpoint (week 9 or subject's last visit) Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement scores are reported below.</description>
