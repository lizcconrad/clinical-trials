  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a CYP2D6 inhibitor, paroxetine, on
      the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of orally administered paliperidone ER and to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of both treatments in healthy men

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, single-center, single-dose, 2 treatment, 2 way crossover
      study. It consists of 3 phases: a screening phase beginning within 21 days before the first
      study drug administration; an open label treatment phase consisting of 2 treatment periods
      (Period 1 and Period 2), during which patients will receive 2 single doses of 3 mg
      paliperidone ER; and end of study evaluations upon completion of all the study procedures in
      Period 2 or at early withdrawal. All volunteers will receive each of the following 2
      treatments in random order: Treatment A: 1 tablet of 3 mg paliperidone ER in the fasted
      state; Treatment B: one 20 mg paroxetine tablet once a day from Day 1 to Day 13 and 1 tablet
      of 3 mg paliperidone ER on Day 10 in the fasted state. Successive paliperidone ER
      administrations will be separated by a washout period of at least 14 days and no more than 28
      days. Paroxetine is a potent and selective CYP2D6 inhibitor. Inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as
      paroxetine have been reported to increase the plasma concentrations of antipsychotics such as
      perphenazine, clozapine, and risperidone. Because paliperidone ER and paroxetine could
      potentially be used in combination in schizophrenic patients, the potential for a drug-drug
      interaction between paroxetine and paliperidone ER needs to be explored.The safety and
      tolerability of the 3 mg tablet of paliperidone ER administered with and without paroxetine
      to healthy men will be monitored.

      Two single oral doses of paliperidone ER 3-mg; 20-mg paroxetine orally once a day for 13 days

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (weight [kg]/height [m2]) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Extensive metabolizer of CYP2D6. Volunteers whose CYP2D6 genotype is unknown should
             have been phenotyped before the start of the study using dextromethorphan as a probe
             (i.e., have a dextromethorphan metabolic ratio &lt;0.02, as determined according to the
             standard procedures of the study center)

          -  Have a supine (after 5 minutes rest) blood pressure between 100 and 140 mmHg systolic,
             inclusive, and 50 and 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive

          -  Smokes no more than 10 cigarettes, or 2 cigars, or 2 pipes per day and has been
             following this pattern for at least 3 months before screening

          -  Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history, 12-lead ECG,
             and the laboratory results of serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed
             within 21 days before the first dose. If the results of the serum chemistry,
             hematology, or urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's reference ranges,
             the volunteer can be included only if the investigator judges that the deviations are
             not clinically significant. For renal function tests, the values must be within the
             normal laboratory reference ranges

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poor or intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D6, as determined by genotyping or
             phenotyping using dextromethorphan

          -  Known drug allergy to risperidone, paliperidone, paroxetine, or any of their
             excipients

          -  Known history of drug-induced dystonia

          -  Recent history of alcohol or substance abuse

          -  Relevant history or presence of any cardiovascular (including myocardial infarct or
             cardiac arrhythmia), respiratory, neurologic (including seizures), psychiatric, renal,
             hepatic, gastrointestinal (including surgeries, severe gastrointestinal narrowing, and
             malabsorption problems), endocrine, hematologic, or immunologic disease

          -  At screening, has signs of autonomic dysfunction as indicated by a sustained decrease
             of &gt;20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or a decrease of &gt;10 mmHg in diastolic blood
             pressure after standing for at least 2 minutes that is not associated with an increase
             of &gt;15 beats per minute (bpm) in heart rate

          -  Bradycardia (heart rate &lt;50 bpm) as determined by screening 12-lead ECG

          -  A positive test result (or history of) for any of the serology tests (hepatitis B and
             C, and human immunodeficiency virus) at screening
