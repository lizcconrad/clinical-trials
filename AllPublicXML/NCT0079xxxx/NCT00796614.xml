    <measure>Response to Treatment Defined as Patients Who Decrease Their Detrusor Leak Point Pressure (LPP) to &lt;40 cm H2O Based Upon Two Evaluations on the Same Day.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was response to treatment defined as patients who decreased their detrusor leak point pressure (LPP) based upon two evaluations on the same day to less than 40 cm H2O at Week 14 (end of treatment). Detrusor leak point pressure (LPP) recorded in cm H2O was obtained using a standard urodynamic technique, a cystometrogram. On treatment (OT): Consist of all on treatment data. Observations measured ≤3 days of stopping treatment was considered as on treatment. Missing data in these analyses was not replaced or imputed.</description>

    <measure>Response With Regard to Hydronephrosis Was Defined as Improvement or Stabilisation Based Upon the Renal Ultrasound Grading at Week 14 (End of Treatment) Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Hydronephrosis response was defined as stabilisation or improvement of hydronephrosis measured by renal ultrasound at the end of treatment when compared to baseline, based on ultrasound grading.
The lower or same grade at end of treatment compared to baseline is considered an improvement or stabilization</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response With Regard to Hydroureter Was Defined as Improvement or Stabilisation Based Upon the Renal Ultrasound at Week 14 (End of Treatment) Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Hydroureter response was defined as stabilisation or improvement based on change from baseline in the presence or absence of hydroureter at the end of treatment (Week 14).
Response defined as stabilization or improvement of hydroureter measured by renal ultrasound compared to baseline by treatment group (Patients are classified according to the treatment they were taking at Week 14 or end of treatment) at Week 14.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial included children from 2-16 years of age, with elevated detrusor leak point pressure associated with a known neurologic defect (e.g., spina bifida). The three age strata were 2-&lt;5 years, 5-&lt;10 years and 10-16 years of age. In this study, 231 subjects were enrolled, 162 subjects were randomised and 161 subjects were treated.</recruitment_details>

        <title>Response to Treatment Defined as Patients Who Decrease Their Detrusor Leak Point Pressure (LPP) to &lt;40 cm H2O Based Upon Two Evaluations on the Same Day.</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint was response to treatment defined as patients who decreased their detrusor leak point pressure (LPP) based upon two evaluations on the same day to less than 40 cm H2O at Week 14 (end of treatment). Detrusor leak point pressure (LPP) recorded in cm H2O was obtained using a standard urodynamic technique, a cystometrogram. On treatment (OT): Consist of all on treatment data. Observations measured ≤3 days of stopping treatment was considered as on treatment. Missing data in these analyses was not replaced or imputed.</description>
