    <textblock>
      The principal objective of the study is to investigate the effect of sorafenib on progression
      free survival (time until the cancer begins to grow again,) in patients with malignant
      mesothelioma who have had prior treatment with chemotherapy. Effectiveness of the drug will
      also be explored with PET scans before and during treatment.
