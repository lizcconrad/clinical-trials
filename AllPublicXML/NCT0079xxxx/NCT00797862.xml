    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety and efficacy of initial combination treatment with
      aliskiren + amlodipine to sequential add-on treatment strategies with aliskiren or amlodipine
      in patients with hypertension.

    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate if patients with hypertension treated early with a
      combination therapy would achieve better blood pressure (BP) control, than patients being
      treated with a classical sequential add-on therapy.

      The study compared the effects of the two treatment strategies: Treatment initiation on a
      single compound, either with aliskiren or amlodipine, and then continuation with the
      combination of both versus treatment initiation with the combination of aliskiren/amlodipine
      and then continuation with the combination. The study also evaluated if the overall mean
      sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP)-lowering effect during the study, as well as the
      change from baseline to study end in msSBP, are superior in the group having received
      combination therapy from the beginning.

      The study further evaluated the BP-lowering efficacy and tolerability of both treatment
      strategies.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic Blood Pressure was measured in a sitting position using a validated automated blood pressure monitor (the Omron device) according to Guidelines of the British Hypertension Society, at Baseline and over 8, 16 and 24 weeks of study treatment. The overall mean change in msSBP from baseline was estimated over three time points: Week 8, Week 16, and Week 24. Analysis used a repeated measures Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, visit, and region as factors, treatment by visit interaction and baseline msSBP as a covariate.</description>

        <description>Systolic Blood pressure was measured in a sitting position using a validated automated blood pressure monitor (the Omron device) according to Guidelines of the British Hypertension Society, at Baseline and 32 weeks of study treatment. Change at week 32 used a separate repeated measures ANCOVA model containing Week 8, 16, 24 &amp; 32 data.
