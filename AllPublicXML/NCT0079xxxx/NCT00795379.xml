  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effectiveness of Interoceptive Exposure (IE) as a treatment to reduce negative
      cognitions and arousal in a veteran sample during an anxiety-inducing situation (i.e., the
      Trier Social Stressor Task - an analogue to the anxiety of undergoing exposure-based
      treatment). After completing the initial screening, qualifying participants will complete a
      pre-intervention assessment at UMC (structured clinical interview, self-report measures, and
      a treatment-engagement analogue exercise). Half of the participants will be randomized into
      either supportive counseling or to the treatment protocol at GVSMVAMC consisting of four
      sessions of Interoceptive Exposure over a four week period targeting interoceptive stimuli.
      Veterans will be assessed a second time at UMC after treatment (5 to 6 weeks after the first
      assessment). Participants will include approximately 40 male OEF/OIF veterans with
      combat-related PTSD recruited from the Trauma Recovery Program (TRP) and Post-deployment
      Clinic at the G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VAMC (GVSMVAMC). Following the pre-intervention
      assessment, veterans will be randomized into one of two groups. Half of the veterans (n = 20)
      will receive received four weeks of supportive counseling while the other half will receive
      four weeks of Interoceptive Exposure (IE). The proposed study examines anxiety sensitivity
      (AS) as a possible barrier to treatment engagement in exposure therapy for PTSD. AS is a
      dispositional cognitive characteristic defined as the fear of sensations directly related to
      autonomic arousal that arises from the belief that these sensations have harmful
      consequences. Interoceptive Exposure (IE) is an intervention that: 1) helps individuals with
      high AS increase their tolerance to the somatic sensations of arousal; and 2) promotes an
      adaptive appraisal of fear-related sensations The current study will use a social stressor
      task to assess the affect of IE on AS and avoidance among veterans who have PTSD, thereby
      increasing the likelihood that a veteran will enter into, and remain in, treatment for PTSD.

    <description>Participants will complete an at home four-week, intervention targeting their negative cognitions triggered by physical sensations. The goal of IE is to purposefully induce bodily sensations related to autonomic arousal so that participants can learn that those sensations are not harmful. IE and Cognitive restructuring have been found to be superior to progressive muscle relaxation as a way to avoid aversive autonomic sensations.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Interested OEF/OIF veterans with a reported history of combat-related trauma, probable
             PTSD diagnosis (score above 44 on the PTSD Checklist), scores above 28 on the Anxiety
             Sensitivity Index (ASI), and who have been medically cleared will be invited to
             participate (study personnel will assist the participant in getting clearance from
             their primary care physician or TRP staff).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Veterans will be excluded if they are judged to have medical conditions that might
             limit cooperation or compromise the integrity of the self-report or
             psychophysiological data (e.g., uncontrolled blood pressure, severe asthma, dementia,
             psychotic disorder, acute mania, current substance abuse, or taking medications that
             would reduce physiological responding). Veterans who are currently receiving (or who
             are scheduled to begin) individual exposure-based treatment for PTSD will be excluded
             from the study. As this project is designed as a pilot study, no exclusions will be
             made based on previous treatment or previous treatment refusal; however, treatment
             history data will be collected.
