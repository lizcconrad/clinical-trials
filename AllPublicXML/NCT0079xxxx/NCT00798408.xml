  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to critically evaluate the effects of energy-yielding fluids and solids on acute
      appetite variables, daily food intake, and specific endocrine and metabolic response to food
      in the elderly. The results of these studies will provide further evidence to support that
      nutrition may provide safe and effective non-pharmacological therapies to counter the
      compromised regulation of energy balance experienced by many elderly people.
