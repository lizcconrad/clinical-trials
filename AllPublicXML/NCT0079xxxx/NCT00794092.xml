    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a progressive enlargement of the aorta, the largest blood
      vessel in the body. It is at risk of bursting when it is usually fatal. Currently the risk of
      the AAA bursting is estimated from its diameter. In this study, the investigators hope to
      develop a new type of aneurysm scan involving Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). It is hoped
      that this scan will be better at determining which AAAs are at risk of bursting and therefore
      require an operation to prevent this.

    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have a prevalence of ~5% and when ruptured carry a mortality
      rate of ~90%. The pathophysiology of AAA encompasses a range of poorly understood
      biomechanical and biological processes. Currently the diameter of the aneurysm is used as a
      surrogate for the risk of rupture and patients with an aneurysm diameter greater than 55 mm
      are considered for elective surgical repair. However, this reliance on a single surrogate
      measure is too simplistic and does not take into account other physical and biological
      aspects of the AAA. We propose to evaluate the role of inflammation, proteolysis and
      neovascularisation in patients with AAA disease. We will compare novel magnetic resonance
      imaging techniques with blood and tissue measures of inflammation (c-reactive protein,
      cytokines, macrophage and leucocyte density), proteolytic activity (matrix
      metalloproteinases, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) and neovascularisation (vessel
      density, endothelial progenitor cells). By comparing findings between patients with
      symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, this study will inform our understanding of the disease
      process as well as potentially identify risk markers of AAA instability that could be used to
      follow-up patients with asymptomatic disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AAA measuring &gt;40mm in AP diameter on ultrasound scanning

          -  Age &gt;40 years (patients younger than this with AAA may have a connective tissue
             disorder and a different aetiology to their disease)

          -  Considered to be suitable for standard infraâˆ’renal open surgical repair

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not deemed to be fit for open surgical repair

          -  Patients who are deemed to be suitable for a stent graft performed by the radiologists
             rather than the standard operation

          -  Contraindication to MRI scanning identified from MRI Safety Questionnaire (see
             attached)or claustrophobia

          -  Age &lt;40 years

          -  Patients requiring emergent repair such that there is insufficient time available to
             complete the protocol

          -  Patients refusing to give consent

          -  Patients unable to give consent

          -  Pregnant women (contrast is teratogenic in animals)

          -  Intercurrent illness (may confound the results)

          -  Patients with a systemic inflammatory disorder or underlying malignancy

          -  Patients who require an emergency operation such that there is insufficient time to
             complete the study protocol

          -  Renal dysfunction (Creat &gt;250 or eGFR&lt;25)

          -  Hepatic dysfunction (Child's grade B or C)
