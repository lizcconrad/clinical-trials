      The purpose of the current study is to assess the role of pyloric drainage procedure on
      altering the reflux effect on the quality of life in patients who underwent esophagectomy.
      Researchers hypothesize that the patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomies
      without pyloric drainage experience less reflux symptoms and therefore have a better quality
      of life.

    <textblock>
      Surgery is considered curative for patients with esophageal cancer. The minimally invasive
      approach was developed such that laparoscopy and thoracoscopy replace large abdominal and
      thoracic incisions. For both open and minimally invasive procedures, patients have many
      adjustments to overcome in order to regain quality of life that is within the norm. In a
      recent study on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) after curative surgical resection,
      symptoms of reflux was the only variable that worsened with statistical significance.

      The study plan is to retrospectively compare two groups of patients: those who underwent
      esophagectomy with pyloric drainage procedure and those who did not. The study will be done
      using all MD Anderson patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomies, in which
      pyloroplasty and pyloromyotomy are not standard procedures. Clinically relevant data and
      demographic information will be collected retrospectively for the two groups including age,
      gender, Body Mass Index, level of anastomosis, and time elapsed since surgery. All patients
      will be interviewed via telephone. At least two attempts will be made to contact each
      patient.

    <description>Comparison of reflux symptoms in patients who underwent open esophagectomies with pyloric drainage and those who received minimally invasive esophagectomies without pyloric drainage. The survey consisted of ten questions regarding symptoms associated with reflux using Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS). Responses to degree of reflux distress rated on a six-point scale for questions with &quot;0&quot; indicating no heartburn symptoms and &quot;5&quot; indicating most symptoms experienced.</description>
