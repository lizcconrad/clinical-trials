  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Testosterone Trials are a multi-center set of trials involving 12 clinical sites
      geographically distributed across the United States.

      The primary specific aims are to test the hypotheses that testosterone treatment of elderly
      men whose serum testosterone concentrations are unequivocally low - and who have symptoms and
      objectively measured abnormalities in at least one of five areas that could be due to low
      testosterone (physical or sexual function, vitality, cognition, and anemia) - will result in
      more favorable changes in those abnormalities than placebo treatment.

      Two additional trials have been incorporated into the T Trial. Only men enrolled in the T
      Trial are eligible to participate in these trials.

        -  The Cardiovascular Trial will examine if testosterone treatment results in more
           favorable changes in cardiovascular risk factors, compared to placebo.

        -  The Bone Trial will test the hypothesis that testosterone treatment will increase
           volumetric trabecular bone mineral density (vBMD) of the lumbar spine as measured by
           quantitative computed tomography (QCT), compared with placebo treatment.

      A Pharmacokinetic (PK) Study is also being conducted within the context of the interventional
      T Trial. It will examine the variability of the serum testosterone (T) concentration after
      application of testosterone gel or placebo, four months after the start of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As men get older, they experience many conditions, often together, that eventually result in
      the inability to perform many activities of daily living, an increased propensity to fall,
      and decreased independence. These conditions include mobility disability and low vitality.
      Elderly men also experience increased anemia, metabolic syndrome, decreased sexual function
      and memory impairment. These conditions likely have multiple causes, but one cause that could
      contribute to all of them is a low serum testosterone concentration. When young hypogonadal
      men are treated with testosterone, they experience improvements in sexual function, muscle
      mass and strength, bone mineral density, sense of well being, and anemia. However, the
      benefits of testosterone therapy in older men with age-related decline in testosterone
      concentration are not known and are the subject of this investigation.

      Participants will be treated with testosterone or placebo gel for 1 year. The dose will be
      adjusted in a blinded fashion to achieve a target T level range. Participants will be
      followed for one additional year following the treatment phase to assess adverse events.

        -  Men participating in the Cardiovascular Trial will be assessed for changes in
           atherosclerotic plaque burden from 0 to 12 months.

        -  Men participating in the Bone Trial will be assessed by QCT of the spine and hip, DXA of
           the spine and hip and clinical fractures at 0 and 12 months.

        -  Men participating in the PK Study will attend 3 additional study visits for blood draws
           at the time of the 4-month assessment.

The BVRT measures short term visual memory and visuo-constructional abilities and was administered and scored according to standard procedures. Each of 10 designs was presented one at a time for 10 seconds, and immediately after the design was withdrawn, the participant was instructed to draw it from memory on a blank sheet of paper. The score was the total number of figures with errors and ranged from 0 to 26. Scores were inverted to 0 to -26 so that higher scores would reflect better performance.
Change in BVRT scores from baseline are treated as continuous and compared between AAMI Androgel and placebo subjects using linear random effects models adjusting for balancing factors as described in the primary analysis.</description>

Change in performance on the Card Rotations Test will be analyzed using linear random effects models adjusting for baseline performance, balancing factors, education, and test version. The test consists of a series of 10 primary figures, each of which has 8 corresponding secondary figures. Subjects are asked to determine which of the secondary figures is the same as the corresponding primary figure, and the score is taken as the number of figures answered correctly minus the number of figures answered incorrectly.
The maximum score is 80 for subjects who answer all items correctly.</description>

Change in performance on the Trail Making Test was analyzed using linear random effects models adjusting for baseline performance, balancing factors, education, and test version.
Participants are required to connect a set of numbers (Part A) or alternating letters and numbers (Part B) in sequential order. The score for each part is the total time (in seconds) to complete both parts. The outcome analyzed will be the total time for Trails B minus the total time for Trails A to provide a measure of working memory, adjusted for attention and processing speed. Higher scores reflect lower executive function.</description>

        <description>Baseline score and change in score of the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised Logical Memory II (WMS-R LMII) test of Delayed Paragraph Recall, at baseline, Month 6 and Month 12.
The WMS-R LM II involves a delayed paragraph recall activity scored in two components, each ranging from 0-25. The final score is the sum of each component, therefore falling in the range 0-50. WMS-R LM II scores were treated as continuous with change compared between treatment arms using linear random effects models adjusting for several factors: site, indicator variables of participation in each primary efficacy trial, baseline testosterone concentration (&lt;200), age (≤ 75), use of anti-depressants, use of PDE-inhibitors, baseline WMSR, categorical education, and version of the WMSR.</description>

WMS-R LM II scores were treated as continuous with change compared between treatment arms using linear random effects models adjusting for several factors: site, indicator variables of participation in each primary efficacy trial, baseline testosterone concentration (&lt;200), age (≤ 75), use of anti-depressants, use of PDE-inhibitors, baseline WMSR, categorical education, and version of the WMSR.</description>

        <description>Baseline score and mean change in score in the Visual Memory Using the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT) from baseline, Month 6 and Month 12.
The BVRT measures short term visual memory and visuo-constructional abilities and was administered and scored according to standard procedures. Each of 10 designs was presented one at a time for 10 seconds, and immediately after the design was withdrawn, the participant was instructed to draw it from memory on a blank sheet of paper. The score was the total number of figures with errors and ranged from 0 to 26. Scores were inverted to 0 to -26 so that higher scores would reflect better performance.
Change in BVRT scores from baseline are treated as continuous and compared between AAMI Androgel and placebo subjects using linear random effects models adjusting for balancing factors as described in the primary analysis.</description>

        <description>Baseline score and change in score in Executive Function as Measured by Trail-Making Test (TMT) B - A, at baseline, Month 6 and Month 12.
Change in performance on the Trail Making Test was analyzed using linear random effects models adjusting for baseline performance, balancing factors, education, and test version.
Participants are required to connect a set of numbers (Part A) or alternating letters and numbers (Part B) in sequential order. The score for each part is the total time (in seconds) to complete both parts. The outcome analyzed will be the total time for Trails B minus the total time for Trails A to provide a measure of working memory, adjusted for attention and processing speed. Higher scores reflect lower executive function.</description>
