      This prospective, randomized controlled study will evaluate the effect of uric acid on the
      progression of IgA nephropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that hyperuricemia is a risk factor for progression of IgAN. This will
      be a prospective, randomized study. Eligible IgAN patients will be randomized into the
      treatment group and the control group. Patients in treatment group will receive allopurinol
      and usual therapy. Patients in control group will receive usual therapy with placebo. If with
      hypertension, add the CCB and the β-blocker. Fasting uric acid, serum creatinine, albumin,
      routine blood test, urine microscopy and dipstick, proteinuria of 24 hours and blood pressure
      will be measured every month. After followed-up for 6 months, the curative effect of
      Allopurinol on blood pressure, proteinuria and the progression of IgA nephropathy will be
      evaluated.

For those with Scr&lt;1.5mg/dl (133µmol/L) at the baseline, allopurinol was given 100mg three times daily, and changed to 100mg twice daily when serum uric acid deceased to the normal range. For patients with Scr&gt;=1.5mg/dl at baseline, allopurinol was initiated at 100mg twice daily and was decreased to 100mg daily when uric acid decreased into the normal range.</description>
