      This study will describe clinical outcome and safety data collected prospectively in subjects
      hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) presenting with an infection for which treatment
      with tigecycline, alone or in combination, is planned. Data will be collected only from
      subjects providing informed consent.

      Extension Rationale:

      In order to perform the necessary corrective actions required and to secure database
      consistency, we request an extension for posting of Basic Results due 26-May-2011 for
      protocol 3074A1-4448 (B1811030), NCT00799591. Our proposed submission date is 14-Sept-2011.

      Pfizer acquired Wyeth on October 16, 2009. With regard to this study, our reconciliation of
      data identified some discrepancies in data listed in the Project database (managed by the
      CRO) and the Safety Database (managed by Pfizer). We are taking corrective action which
      involves: sending queries to investigators, collecting corrective signed forms, and
      implementing changes within the database. We are requesting this extension to complete that
      work so that the data can be treated as final and the CSR can be completed.
