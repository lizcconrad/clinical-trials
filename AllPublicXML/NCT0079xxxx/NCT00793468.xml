      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of GSK598809 as compared to placebo in
      preventing recently-quit smokers from going back to smoking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of GSK598809 compared to
      placebo for the prevention of relapse to smoking in recently abstinent smokers. Subjects who
      meet eligibility criteria will enter a 4-week open label treatment period during which they
      will receive nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Subjects who have achieved at least one week
      of abstinence during the last week of an open label treatment period will be randomized to
      either GSK598809 or placebo in the double-blind treatment period and followed for another 12
      weeks.
