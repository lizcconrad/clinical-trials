      RATIONALE: Sometimes prostate cancer may not need treatment until it progresses. In this
      case, active surveillance may be sufficient. Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic
      resonance imaging, may be a less invasive method of finding prostate cancer that has
      progressed.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well magnetic resonance imaging works in
      detecting cancer progression in patients with early-stage prostate cancer who are undergoing
      active surveillance.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if MRI parameters (initial volume, number and location of image
           abnormalities, and MR spectroscopy) can improve the ability to stratify cancer
           progression risk in patients undergoing active surveillance for early-stage prostate
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine if changes in non-invasive MRI, validated by MRI-guided biopsies, can
           accurately detect progression of prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo prostate MRI scans and MRI-guided biopsies of suspicious lesions at
      baseline. Patients undergo conventional anatomic imaging followed by research biological
      imaging tests (e.g., magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging and/or dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI). MRI are repeated at 6 months, 1 year, and then annually until
      initiation of definitive therapy or for a total of 5 years.

      Tissue biopsy with MRI guidance is done at baseline and annually or as clinically indicated
      based on change in rectal exam, PSA, or maybe done based on change in MR imaging (i.e., new
      MR lesion or significant change [&gt; 25% increase] in the size of a MR lesion).

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for PSA tests.
