    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to evaluate the dose proportionality of 1.5- and 3 mg tablets
      of paliperidone ER, to document the pharmacokinetics of a 1.5 mg dose of paliperidone ER, and
      to assess the safety and tolerability of the 1.5- and 3 mg tablets in healthy men.

      This is a randomized, open label, single center, single dose, 2 treatment, 2 way crossover
      study. It consists of 3 phases: A screening phase beginning within 21 days before the first
      study drug administration; an open label treatment phase consisting of 2 treatment periods
      (Period 1 and Period 2) during which volunteers will receive a single oral 1.5 or 3 mg dose
      of study drug; and end of study evaluations upon completion of all the study procedures in
      Period 2. All volunteers will receive each of the following 2 treatments in random order:
      Treatment A: One tablet of 1.5 mg paliperidone ER to-be-marketed formulation in the fasted
      state; Treatment B: One tablet of 3 mg paliperidone ER Phase 3 formulation in the fasted
      state. Successive study drug administrations will be separated by a washout period of at
      least 9 days and no more than 21 days. A 1.5-mg dose of paliperidone ER was selected to be
      studied as the availability of a 1.5-mg tablet would make dose-adjustments across the
      existing range of doses of paliperidone ER easier in patients with reduced renal function or
      tolerability issues. Safety and tolerability of the 1.5- and 3 mg tablets of paliperidone ER
      in healthy men will be monitored throughout the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index ( weight [kg]/height [m2]) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Have a supine (after 5 minutes rest) blood pressure between 100 and 140 mmHg systolic,
             inclusive, and 50 and 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive

          -  Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history, 12-lead ECG,
             and the laboratory results of serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed
             within 21 days before the first dose. If the results of the serum chemistry,
             hematology, or urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's reference ranges,
             the volunteer can be included only if the investigator judges that the deviations are
             not clinically significant. For renal function tests, the values must be within the
             normal laboratory reference ranges

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known drug allergy to risperidone, paliperidone, or any of its excipients

          -  Known history of drug-induced dystonia

          -  Recent history of alcohol or substance abuse

          -  Relevant history or presence of any cardiovascular (including myocardial infarct or
             cardiac arrhythmia), respiratory, neurologic (including seizures), psychiatric, renal,
             hepatic, gastrointestinal (including surgeries, severe gastrointestinal narrowing, and
             malabsorption problems), endocrine, hematologic, or immunologic disease

          -  History of any cancer, with the exception of basal cell carcinoma

          -  At screening, has signs of autonomic dysfunction as indicated by a sustained decrease
             of &gt; 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure or a decrease of &gt;10 mmHg in diastolic blood
             pressure after standing for at least 2 minutes that is not associated with an increase
             of &gt;15 beats per minute (bpm) in heart rate

          -  Bradycardia (heart rate &lt;50 bpm) as determined by screening 12-lead ECG

          -  A positive test result (or history of) for any of the serology tests (hepatitis B and
             C, and human immunodeficiency virus) at screening

          -  History of smoking or use of nicotine-containing substances within the last 2 months,
             as determined by medical history and/or volunteer's verbal report. Volunteers must
             agree to refrain from use throughout the study

          -  Use of any prescription or nonprescription medication (including vitamins and herbal
             supplements) within 14 days before the first dose of study drug. Exception for
             acetaminophen (paracetamol) or ibuprofen, which is allowed up to 3 days before first
             dose of study drug
