    <textblock>
      To improve the management of symptoms, patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy will be
      monitored using an automated telephone system to record the severity of 15 prevalent symptoms
      for up to 8 consecutive weeks. Outcomes include; significant reduction in symptom severity
      and improvement in health states.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overview: Prevalent symptoms among patients undergoing chemotherapy include: pain, fatigue,
      dry mouth, constipation, anorexia, nausea, sleep disturbance, shortness of breath or
      difficulty breathing, as well as psychological symptoms such as depression and anxiety. A
      survey of 1000 patients with cancer indicated that close to a quarter reported 10-12
      symptoms. Given the impact of symptoms upon physical function, work, emotional distress, and
      hospitalizations, it is critical that strategies be developed and tested to improve symptom
      management.

      This trial of a behavioural intervention for symptom management is significant because: 1) it
      contrasts a proactive approach, individualized to patients' symptom management needs, with a
      more conventional model that places responsibility on the patient for symptom management; 2)
      it controls for the method of delivery and the use of printed material; 3) it targets
      prevalent symptoms known to affect cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy; 4) it examines
      the relative effects of each arm, in terms of symptom severity (primary outcome), impact on
      patients' physical and social roles, and emotional distress; and 5) it explores these
      outcomes in terms of their impact on the use of services and costs of care.

      Goal: The goal of this randomized trial is to determine if a nurse delivered Patient Assisted
      Management of Symptoms (PAMS) intervention individualized to patients' needs for symptom
      management, delivered by telephone, when compared to Telephone Information and Monitoring of
      Symptoms (TIMS) where symptoms are only monitored by telephone, with references to the
      symptom management toolkit will reduce symptom severity, improve physical function, and other
      outcomes.
