    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 3 mg
      extended release paliperidone (ER OROSÃ' paliperidone) in patients with varying degrees of
      renal impairment (mild, moderate, and severe), compared to patients with normal renal
      function. Secondary objectives include the assessing the disposition of the (+) and (-)
      enantiomers by means of an enantioselective liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assay, to
      determine plasma protein binding of the enantiomers in patients with impaired renal function,
      compared with patients with normal renal function, and to evaluate the tolerability and
      safety profile of ER OROS paliperidone in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment
      (mild, moderate, and severe) compared with patients with normal renal function.

      This is a single dose, parallel group, open-label, 2 center pharmacokinetic study, consisting
      of a pretreatment (screening) period of between 1 and 3 weeks, an open label treatment period
      (single dose of ER OROS paliperidone on Day 1 only, and with end of study procedures and
      discharge ending on Day 6). All patients will be screened between Day 21 and Day 1 for renal
      function. On Day 1, all patients will receive a single oral dose of 3 mg ER OROS paliperidone
      and undergo a 120 hour follow up with serial blood collections for pharmacokinetics, safety
      and tolerability assessments. Patients will be discharged after giving a pharmacokinetic
      blood sample and completing end of study assessments in the morning of Day 6. Group matching
      will be applied to the renal function groups to reduce bias and increase comparability of
      age, weight, gender, and ethnicity. This study is aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics and
      safety profile of ER OROS paliperidone in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment
      with that of normal patients. 3 mg oral ER OROS paliperidone

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients: A body mass index (weight [kg]/height (m)²) in the range of 18.0 to 32.0
             kg/m², inclusive

          -  Patients with normal renal function: Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical
             examination, medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood hematology
             and biochemistry tests, and urinalysis carried out within 3 weeks before study drug is
             administered. Normal renal function

          -  Age-related normotensive at screening, with supine (5 minutes) blood pressure in the
             range of 95 to 160 mmHg systolic, inclusive, and 55 to 95 mmHg diastolic, inclusive,
             at screening and before study drug administration

          -  Demographically comparable to the groups with renal impairment with respect to age
             (±10 years), weight (±20%), gender, and ethnicity

          -  Patients with impaired renal function: Has a CrCl of &lt;80 mL/min

          -  Severity of renal disease has to be stable: No significant change in renal function as
             evidenced by the serum creatinine value within ±20% from the last determination,
             obtained within at least 2 months before study entry
