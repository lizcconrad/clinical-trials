  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving treosulfan together with fludarabine phosphate
      and total-body irradiation (TBI) works in treating patients with hematological cancer who are
      undergoing umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). Giving chemotherapy, such as treosulfan
      and fludarabine phosphate, and TBI before a donor UCBT helps stop the growth of cancer cells
      and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the
      stem cells from a related or unrelated donor, that do not exactly match the patient's blood,
      are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red
      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor
      can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and
      mycophenolate mofetil after the transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Graft failure/rejection and secondary graft failure.

      II. Day -200 non-relapse mortality.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Platelet engraftment by six months.

      II. Grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at day 100 and one year.

      III. Chronic GVHD.

      IV. Clinically significant infections.

      V. Overall survival.

      VI. Relapse or disease progression.

      VII. Immune reconstitution (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center [FHCRC] only).

      VIII. Emergence of a dominant unit (FHCRC only).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (low risk for graft failure): Patients receive a conditioning regimen comprising
      fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once daily (QD) on days -6 to -2 and
      treosulfan IV over 120 minutes on days - 6 to -4. Patients undergo TBI on day -1. Patients
      then undergo donor UCBT on day 0. Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine
      IV or orally (PO) 2-3 times daily on days -3 to 100, followed by a taper in the absence of
      GVHD. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV 3 times daily on days 0 to 40, followed
      by a taper in the absence of GVHD.

      ARM II (high risk for graft failure): Patients receive a conditioning regimen, TBI, donor
      UCBT, GVHD prophylaxis, and mycophenolate mofetil as in Arm I.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and 1 and 2
      years.
