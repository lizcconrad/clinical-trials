  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the rate of pathologically complete
      remissions achieved using a preoperative dose-intensified 8 week therapy consisting of
      adriamycin and docetaxel with a preoperative sequential 24 week regimen consisting of
      adriamycin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, in patients with operable carcinoma of the
      breast. Secondary aims are to assess disease-free and overall survival, the rate of complete
      and partial responses by palpation and imaging methods, the rate of breast-conserving
      operations, and the toxicity of the two chemotherapy regimens.

      Women meeting the following criteria will be eligible for the study: those with operable
      breast cancer (T2-3 N0-2 M0), with the diagnosis histologically confirmed by biopsy, and
      measurable disease on mammography or sonography or breast MRI (the most appropriate method
      should be chosen by the investigator). After the patients have given written informed
      consent, they will be randomly assigned to the study treatments. Patients in group I will
      receive four cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin 50 mg/m2 (15 min
      i.v. infusion) and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (1 h i.v. infusion) repeated every 14 days, followed by
      surgery 9-10 weeks after the start of therapy. Patients in group II will receive four cycles
      of adriamycin 60 mg/m2 (15 min i.v.) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (1 h i.v.) every three
      weeks, followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m2 (1 h i.v.) every three weeks. Surgery
      will be performed during week 25 or 26. Patients in both groups will additionally receive
      oral doses of tamoxifen 20 mg once daily for 5 years, starting on the first day of
      chemotherapy. Surgery will consist of removal of the remaining tumor (breast-conserving
      resection or mastectomy) and axillary dissection (Sentinel node biopsy is allowed if the
      patient is involved in a randomized trial. Radiotherapy is applicated according to standard
      proceedings of participating center. A second randomization for additional versus no
      additional postoperative chemotherapy is recommended in ypN+ disease. Patients with disease
      progression during preoperative therapy, chemotherapy can be stopped and surgery can be
      performed immediately.
