      The purpose of the MOM: Managing Our Mood Program (part of Family Help) is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the Family Help distance intervention compared to usual or standard care
      typically provided to women with mild to moderate postpartum depression symptomology. This is
      a single-center trial based at the IWK Health Center. The primary outcome is change in
      postpartum depression diagnosis.

      The Family Help- MOM: Managing Our Mood Program is to deliver, primary care mental health
      services to mothers in the comfort and privacy of their own home. The purpose of this
      randomized control trial is to test the effectiveness of the Managing Our Mood (MOM)
      postpartum depression distance treatment program. This study is a single-centre trial based
      at the IWK Health Centre, similar to other Family Help Modules.

      The goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the MOM cognitive-behavioural
      intervention as an alternative treatment for women suffering from postpartum depression. The
      intervention is delivered at a distance, using educational materials (handbooks,
      video-tapes/DVDs, and telephone consultation with a trained paraprofessional coach. Family
      Help coaches deliver consistent care based on written protocols, with on-going evaluation by
      a professional team. MOM is not designed to replace specialist care of complex multi-problem
      mothers.

      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either active MOM treatment or to the Best
      Efforts control condition. Those participants assigned to Best Efforts receive printed
      information about postpartum depression that describes the illness, how it is caused and
      various treatment options; they are assigned a Coach who books their assessments and is
      available to answer any questions; they are encouraged to maintain contact and regular care
      with their family physician or public health nurse for both themselves and their baby. At the
      end of the 12-month follow-up (one year from randomization), these women will be offered the
      opportunity to take part in the MOM treatment if they are still depressed.
