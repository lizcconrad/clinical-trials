  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of the vaccine will proceed in two stages after the method of Simon (102). In the
      first stage, 15 patients will be accrued and treated. If two or fewer objective immunologic
      responses occur, the study will be terminated. If 3 or more responses are observed, the study
      will proceed to the second stage, accruing an additional 22 patients. If the second stage is
      complete and a total of 9 or more immunologic responses are observed among the 37 patients
      treated, the treatment response rate for the vaccine will be considered high enough to
      warrant further study. Conversely, if the evaluation of the vaccine concludes at the first
      stage, or if 8 or fewer total immunologic responses occur after completing the second stage,
      the vaccine will not be considered for further study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an uncontrolled, non-randomized trial to evaluate safety, immunogenicity and
      feasibility of a new vaccine, consisting of semi-allogeneic fibroblasts transfected with
      autologous tumor-derived DNA. Briefly, the plan is to use a two-stage trial design and to
      initially enroll 15 patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over a period of 2
      years. The patients will undergo surgery and a portion of the primary tumor specimen not
      necessary for the pathologic diagnosis will be obtained to serve as a source of tumor DNA.
      Each DNA-based vaccine will contain 1 x 10e7 DNA-transfected human allogeneic fibroblasts.
      The vaccine will be lethally irradiated before it is used for immunization. It will be
      administered intradermally in the Outpatient Clinic. Patients delayed-type hypersensitivity
      (DTH) responses will be tested but will not be an eligibility criterion. Immunologic response
      to the vaccine will be evaluated. If there is no evidence of toxicity, and &gt;3 of the 15
      initial patients show immunologic response, the second stage of the study will be opened for
      accrual of 22 patients. All patients will be monitored by IFN-g secretion in ELISPOT assays
      prior to and after vaccination for the frequency of T-cells responsive to autologous tumor
      (if available) and/or to the vaccine. The patients will also be evaluated before and after
      vaccination for the capability of their T cells to respond to activating signals delivered
      via the T cell receptor (TcR).

             the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment.

          -  Subject is not a candidate for complete resection of the carcinoma via pneumonectomy,
             lobectomy, bilobectomy, extended wedge resection or anatomic segmentectomy with or
             without sleeve resection as noted in the surgical plan..

             previous resection and registration.

          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous
             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the patient has
             been disease-free for at least 5 years prior to registration.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
