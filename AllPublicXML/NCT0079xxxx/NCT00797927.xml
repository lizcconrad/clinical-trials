      we aim to examine whether a representative atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine, has different
      effects from conventional antipsychotics on the magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) markers
      in schizophrenia patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impact of medications on MRS changes in brain of schizophrenia patients have rarely been
      studied through a well-controlled study. Most of the MRS studies in schizophrenia patients
      are cross-sectional and uncontrolled and devoid of any comparison between effects of
      different drugs. To date, only limited research has explored this issue and the results are
      conflicting. These conflicting results may be related to small sample size, different patient
      population and design in these studies. Thus, further studies are warranted. Besides, with
      the advent of new generation atypical antipsychotics, it will be important to know whether
      atypical antipsychotics exert different effects on neurons from conventional antipsychotics.
      If neuronal activity can be improved by atypical antipsychotics, the findings will have great
      clinical implications.

      Fifteen patients in the experimental group will receive MRS examinations (including bilateral
      frontal and temporal area) in two phases: baseline (when they are on a conventional
      antipsychotic) and 4 weeks after shifting from that conventional antipsychotic to quetiapine.
      Another 15 schizophrenia patients receiving conventional antipsychotics will serve as the
      control group. The control group will receive the MRS examinations twice (baseline and 4
      weeks later) without change of medications. In each phase, every patient will also receive
      the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) assessment. The changes of the MRS markers
      will be analyzed and compared, both within and between the 2 groups, and their correlations
      with the PANSS scores will be explored.
