      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified tumor cells may help the body build an immune
      response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients with metastatic melanoma.

  <detailed_description>

      In this phase I study, patients will receive intradermal injections of adenovirus-CCL-21
      transduced class I peptide-pulsed DC with total volumes for each intradermal injection of no
      more than 1 ml to be split into four injections of 0.25 ml each in four limbs in node
      draining areas (proximal arms and thighs), for a total DC dose of 2 X 10^6, 10^7 or 2 X 10^7
      cells to be administered intradermally. DC injections in one course of therapy will be given
      four times at intervals of weekly for two doses (days 1 and 8 +/- 72 hrs.), then every two
      weeks for two doses (at days 22 +/- 72 hrs. and 36 +/- 72 hours). Cells will be harvested for
      DC administration and a flow cytometry analysis as well as microbiologic analysis including
      bacterial/fungal cultures and gram stain will be performed prior to infusion. All injections
      will be based on number of DC, not number of total cells.

    <description>Assessment of immune responses to the cytokine-cocktail-matured class I peptide-pulsed adenoviral CCL-21 transduced DC cell vaccine. Immune reactivity will be monitored for the appearance of lymphoid-like structures at the vaccine site (as a result of CCL-21 production), in the blood for MART-1 /gp100 specific T cell frequency by tetramer based flow cytometry and ELISPOT analysis of fresh cells, and CTL cytolytic reactivity after in vitro sensitization prior to, four weeks after, and 8 weeks after immunization.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic melanoma with measurable disease after attempted curative surgical therapy
             and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen; adjuvant interferon or
             isolated limb perfusion is allowed.

          -  Tumor tissue must be available for immunohistochemical analysis, and specimens will
             stained for MART-1 by immunohistochemical staining and will also be stained for HMB-45
             by immunohistochemistry, and positivity for at least one will be an entry requirement.

          -  Patients must be HLA-A *0201 positive, by a DNA SSOP analysis.

          -  Serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dl or less, total bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dl or less, and
             ALT/AST of less than 3X institutional upper limit of normal.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Patients must be able to understand and sign an IRB approved informed consent form.

          -  Patients must have white blood count of 3000 or greater, platelets of 100,000 or
             greater, and hemoglobin of 9.0 gm/dl or more.

          -  Patients with unresectable stages III/IV uveal melanoma and metastatic mucosal
             melanoma will be eligible for this trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Undergoing or have undergone in the past month any other therapy for their melanoma,
             including radiation therapy, chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy

          -  Have major systemic infections, coagulation disorders, or other major medical
             illnesses of the cardiovascular or respiratory systems, or have had a documented MI in
             the last 6 months

          -  Require steroid therapy

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Known to be positive for hepatitis BsAg, Hepatitis C or HIV antibody

          -  Have a prior history of uveitis or autoimmune inflammatory eye disease

          -  Have had another malignancy other than cervical carcinoma-in-situ or basal cell
             /squamous cancer of the skin, unless they have undergone curative therapy more than 3
             years ago and are still free of detectable disease, since the effects of
             peptide-pulsed DC on other active cancers are unknown
