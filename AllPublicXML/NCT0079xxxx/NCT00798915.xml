  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An intestinal hormone called Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) is released
      into the blood immediately after ingestion of a meal and plays an important role in
      regulating blood sugar levels. However, GIP is not active in persons with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM) which is also known as adult onset or non-insulin-dependent diabetes. This
      study is being conducted to determine whether a hormone called xenin-25 can restore the
      activity of GIP in persons with T2DM.

    <textblock>
      Each eligible participant will be administered an oral glucose tolerance test so he/she can
      be assigned to the group with &quot;normal glucose tolerance&quot;, &quot;impaired glucose tolerance&quot;
      (between normal and diabetic), or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Each study subject will then be
      administered a graded glucose infusion (GGI) on 4 separate occasions. For the GGI, an
      intravenous glucose infusion will be started at a rate of 1 mg x kg-1 x min-1 for 40 min,
      followed by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 mg x kg-1 x min-1 (40 min for each step). A primed-continuous
      infusion of vehicle alone, GIP alone, xenin-25 alone, or the combination of GIP plus xenin-25
      (each peptide at a dose of 4 pmoles x kg-1 x min-1) will be initiated at the same time the
      glucose infusion is started. Blood samples will be collected before and during the GGI for
      the measurement of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GIP and xenin-25 levels.
