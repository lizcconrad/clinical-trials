  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies in the past have shown that yoga could relieve stress which is the most common
      trigger for recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation. Breathing exercises in yoga are found
      to influence the autonomic nervous system (particularly parasympathetic) and thus reduce
      palpitations. This study hypothesizes that patients with atrial fibrillation might benefit by
      practicing yoga. Yoga may also help to better control heart rate and rhythm when used in
      combination with usual medical management.
