  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the impact of Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) on symptoms, physiological
      arousal, stressors, and the ways to deal with them in individuals with schizophrenia and
      related disorders. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the role cognitive coping
      strategies play in mediating the link between stress, physiological arousal, and psychotic
      symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia during recovery from psychosis.

      This study examines the mechanisms of recovery from psychosis. Specifically, the study aims
      to evaluate the putative impact of enhancing cognitive coping strategies via
      Cognitive-Behavior Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) on subjective stress, autonomic regulation
      (physiological arousal), and psychotic symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia and related
      disorders. As part of the study, participants will be randomized to receive up to 26 weekly
      sessions of CBTp (over 30 weeks) or &quot;treatment as usual&quot;. Research evaluations will completed
      at baseline, and after 10, 20 and 30 weeks. The study outcome measures include psychotic
      symptoms as measured by clinical interviews, along with ambulatory measures of autonomic
      regulation and self-reports of psychotic experiences during daily functioning using mobile
      devices (i.e., Palm computers).
