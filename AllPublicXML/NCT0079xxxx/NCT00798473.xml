    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Up to 30% of children and adolescents with Crohn's disease have decreased bone strength,
           or decrease bone density, called osteopenia.

        -  Bisphosphonates are a group of drugs that have been well studied and found to be
           effective in the treatment of osteopenia in menopausal women.

        -  Zoledronate is a very potent third generation bisphosphonate, that is safe and easy to
           administer, and has been found effective in the treatment of menopausal women with
           osteopenia.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that zoledronate can improve bone density in
      children and adolescents with Crohn's disease with osteopenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This study is recruiting 40 children and adolescents, aged 6 to 18, who have a proven
           abnormal bone density as measured on a special type of x-ray called a DEXA-scan.

        -  Participants are allocated at random to one of two groups: either treatment with
           zoledronate, or a placebo.

        -  Neither the participants or the physicians are aware of which group each participant is
           in.

        -  Participants are followed every three months for one year, and assessed with blood
           tests, urine tests, physical examination, diet questionnaire and exercise questionnaire.

        -  Participants have a repeat DEXA scan at 6 and 12 months after beginning the study.

        -  Once all participants are enrolled and followed for one whole year, we will compare the
           bone density of the group treated with zoledronate with the group treated with placebo.

          -  diagnosed with Crohn's disease with osteopenia,

          -  a minimum of 6 months of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. (Osteopenia was
             defined for the purposes of this study as: Z-score lumber spine BMD by DEXA of -2.0 or
             less, or -1.5 and a risk factor (either steroid use for 6 months or more or decrease
             of 0.5 z-score in the preceding 12 months).)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  renal dysfunction,

          -  insufficient calcium or vitamin D intake,

          -  current medication or condition affecting bone metabolism,

          -  documented fracture, previously diagnosed bone disease,

          -  documented intolerance/hypersensitivity to bisphosphonates,

          -  previous treatment with bisphosphonates within the last 6 months.
