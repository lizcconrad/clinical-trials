    <textblock>
      A Phase II, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study in up to 42 subjects with first
      recurrence or progression of GBM at up to 12 sites in Australia, Europe, Israel, and the
      United States. Subjects will receive intratumoral infusion of PRX321 administered via
      convection-enhanced delivery (CED) at a concentration of 1.5 μg/mL and a total volume of 60
      mL over 2 to 7 days.

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy (expressed as overall survival at 6 months [OS-6]) of intratumoral
      infusion of PRX321 in subjects with first recurrence or progression of glioblastoma
      multiforme (GBM).

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the safety of intratumoral infusion with PRX321 in subjects with recurrent or
      progressive GBM.

      To evaluate objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DR), overall survival (OS),
      and progression-free survival (PFS).

      Tertiary Objective:

      To evaluate the relationship of observed infusate distribution with clinical and radiological
      responses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects at least 18 years old

          -  GBM at first recurrence or progression (i.e., disease progressed after any first-line
             therapy including surgery and radiotherapy as confirmed by MR imaging [MRI]);
             screening MRIs used to confirm eligibility must be available to the Investigator and
             the Independent Review Committee (IRC)

          -  Unilateral, unifocal, and supratentorial tumor, with a maximum diameter of 4 cm (i.e.,
             maximum distance between the borders/edges of enhancing regions) visualized in any
             arbitrary imaging plane, as assessed by the IRC on MRI taken pre-study 2 weeks prior
             to catheter placement

          -  Histological confirmation of GBM (confirmation before primary therapy is acceptable)

          -  KPS ≥ 70

          -  If female of childbearing potential, an acceptable method of contraception must be
             combined with negative pregnancy test before entering the study and must be willing to
             use contraception for 2 months after treatment with PRX321; male subjects who are
             non-sterile (i.e., male who has not been sterilized by vasectomy for at least 6
             months) must be willing to use a barrier method of contraception for at least 2 months
             after treatment with PRX321. Acceptable methods of contraception are:

               -  intra-uterine contraceptive device without hormone release system: placed at
                  least 4 weeks prior to treatment with PRX321;

               -  simultaneous use of male condom and diaphragm + spermicide: starting at least 14
                  days prior to treatment with PRX321; or

               -  simultaneous use of male condom and female condom + spermicide: starting at least
                  14 days prior to treatment with PRX321

          -  Able to read, understand, and sign the informed consent document before undergoing any

          -  Tumor with a clinically significant mass effect (&gt; 5 mm midline shift) while on a
             stable corticosteroid dose

          -  Subjects with tumors that are completely liquefied (cystic or ring enhancement) in
             which convection would not be possible

          -  Tumor with geometric features that make them difficult to adequately cover the tumor
             volume with infusate by using CED catheters; these tumors include the following:

               -  Tumors that appear to wrap around ventricular structures, such that the catheter
                  tips may be positioned within 1.0 cm of a ventricle or such that a large angle
                  (such as an &quot;elbow&quot; or &quot;L- shape&quot;) in the tumor shape is present and convection
                  is likely to be compromised;

               -  Tumors in which post-surgical enhancement in T1 images in the margins around a
                  resection cavity may be confused with recurring tumor; subjects in whom this
                  enhancement exceeds 5 mm thickness are excluded

          -  Clinical symptoms that are thought by the Investigator to be caused by uncontrolled
             increased intracranial pressure, hemorrhage, or edema of the brain

          -  Inadequate organ function, defined as 1 or more of the following:

               -  Hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL (support with therapeutic erythropoietin products is
                  acceptable);

             visit, except for adequately treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix, prostate cancer
             not actively treated, and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

          -  Concurrent or a history of other major disease that could, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, put the subject at additional risk or interfere with the interpretation
             of the results of this trial

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the requirements of this protocol, including the
             presence of any condition (physical, mental, or social) that is likely to affect the
             subject's returning for follow-up visits or other unspecified reasons that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, make the subject's enrollment incompatible
             with study objectives
