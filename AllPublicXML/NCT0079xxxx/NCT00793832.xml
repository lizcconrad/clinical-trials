    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the patients in the EXDA group will be able to complete a structured
      exercise program at a level sufficient to accumulate at least 2000 kcal per week, and that
      the structured endurance activity will increase their physical fitness and total daily energy
      expenditure compared to the DA group.
