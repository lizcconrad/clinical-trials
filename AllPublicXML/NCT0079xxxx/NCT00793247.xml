  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to investigate the clinical safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      prucalopride in improving the symptoms associated with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction
      (CIP) in subjects with CIP. The study hypothesis was that prucalopride at doses up to 4 mg is
      safe, well tolerated, efficacious and improves the symptoms associated with CIP.

      This phase II, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-treatment four periods cross-over trial
      investigated the clinical safety, tolerability and the efficacy of R093877 (prucalopride) in
      improving the symptoms associated with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP) in
      subjects with CIP.

      Subjects were treated for 4 periods of 12 weeks each with either R093877 2 mg (2 periods) or
      placebo (2 periods). In each of the first and second 6 month period, there was a placebo
      (PLA) and an active drug (PRU) treatment period. There were no wash-out periods. In total,7
      subjects were randomized; 2 were assigned to the PLA-PRU-PLA-PRU, 2 to the PRUPLA-PRU-PLA, 2
      to the PLA-PRU-PRU-PLA, and 1 to the PRU-PLA-PLA-PRU sequence group. Subjects were allowed to
      use up to 4 mg of prucalopride per day if the 2 mg dose seemed to be insufficient. Two
      subjects used an average of 3 mg of prucalopride per day during the active drug periods.
