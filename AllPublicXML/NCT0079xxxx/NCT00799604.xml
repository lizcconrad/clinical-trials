  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of a bolus dosing regimen of
      clevidipine, a vascular-selective L-type calcium channel antagonist, for the management of
      blood pressure in cardiac surgery patients, as well as to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      pharmacokinetics of clevidipine after bolus administration.

      Study participants were screened up to 14 days prior to their elective cardiac surgery. For
      the purpose of this study, hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 mm
      Hg immediately prior to initiation of study drug.

      On the day of surgery, an IV bolus dose of clevidipine (Bolus 1 - pre-anesthesia) was
      administered to each eligible study participant during Treatment Period 1 to decrease BP
      before induction of general anesthesia. The dose (either 125 μg, 250 μg or 500 μg) given was
      based on the assigned cohort for each participant, listed in the 'Arms' section below.

      At the discretion of the investigator, a second IV bolus dose of clevidipine (Bolus 2 - with
      anesthesia) could have been administered during Treatment Period 2 at either 125 μg, 250 μg
      or 500 μg, based upon the earlier observed response to Bolus 1. This dose was administered
      after the induction of anesthesia, to decrease BP prior to cannulation of the ascending aorta
      for initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass.

      Assessment of safety was performed throughout Treatment Periods 1 and 2 with Adverse Events
      (AEs) followed 6 hours post final bolus dose and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) followed 24
      hours post final bolus dose.

    <measure>The Mean Maximum Absolute Change in Systolic Blood Pressure From Baseline Within 15 Minutes From the First Bolus Dose of Clevidipine (Treatment Period 1, Bolus 1 - Pre-anesthesia).</measure>
    <time_frame>From start to 15 minutes of Bolus 1 dose of clevidipine (pre-anesthesia).</time_frame>
    <description>Blood Pressure was measured at 60, 45, 30, 0 seconds prior to first Bolus dose (Bolus 1), and every 5 seconds after Bolus 1 for 15 minutes. Baseline SBP of Bolus 1 is defined as, 'median of all measurements prior to or at the start of Bolus 1'. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) method was used to determine the minimum SBP value for each patient. Maximum absolute change is the minimum SBP value within 15 minutes from bolus 1 minus baseline value.</description>

    <description>Blood Pressure was measured at 60, 45, 30, 0 seconds prior to first Bolus dose (Bolus 1), and every 5 seconds after Bolus 1 for 15 minutes. Baseline SBP of Bolus 1 is defined as, 'median of all measurements prior to or at the start of Bolus 1'. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) method was used to determine the minimum SBP value for each patient. Maximum percent change is defined as the maximum absolute change divided by the baseline value of bolus 1 and multiplied by 100.</description>

    <time_frame>From start to 15 minutes of Bolus 1 dose of clevidipine (pre-anesthesia).</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage is calculated using the number of patients with a systolic blood pressure ≤85 mm Hg within 15 minutes from the initial Bolus 1 dose divided by the total number of patients who were treated with a Bolus 1 clevidipine, and multiplied by 100.</description>

    <measure>The Median Time to 5%, 10%, and 15% Systolic Blood Pressure Reduction From Baseline Within 15 Minutes From the First Bolus Dose of Clevidipine (Treatment Period 1, Bolus 1 -Pre-anesthesia).</measure>
    <time_frame>From start to 15 minutes of Bolus 1 of clevidipine (pre-anesthesia).</time_frame>
    <description>BP was measured at 60, 45, 30, 0 seconds prior to first Bolus dose (bolus 1), and every 5 seconds after Bolus 1 for 15 minutes. Baseline SBP of bolus 1 is defined as median of all measurements prior to or at the start of Bolus 1. The time at which first target SBP reduction (ex. 5%) from baseline was reached was identified for each patient using fitted values from LOWESS method. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median time. Patients who never reached 5%, 10% or 15% reduction, withdrew from study or changed antihypertensive within 15 minutes were censored.</description>

    <measure>The Mean Percent Change in Systolic Blood Pressure From Baseline Over Time During the First 15 Minutes Following First Bolus Dose of Clevidipine (Treatment Period 1, Bolus 1 - Pre-anesthesia).</measure>
    <time_frame>From start to 15 minutes of Bolus 1 of clevidipine (pre-anesthesia).</time_frame>
    <description>BP was measured at 60, 45, 30, 0 seconds prior to first Bolus dose (Bolus 1), and every 5 seconds after Bolus 1 for 15 minutes. Baseline SBP of Bolus 1 is defined as median of all measurements prior to or at the start of Bolus 1. SBP change (percent change) from baseline is calculated at each collection time point after bolus 1 dose for each patient.</description>

    <measure>The Median Time to 50%, and, When Available, 90% Recovery From Maximum SBP Effect Following the First Bolus Dose of Clevidipine for Patients Who Achieved the Endpoints (Treatment Period 1, Bolus 1 - Pre-anesthesia).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 minutes following the first bolus dose of clevidipine (pre-anesthesia).</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis is of the time in minutes between the recorded time at the maximum absolute change and the time of the systolic blood pressure value at the first 50% recovery. The 50% recovery value is equal to the minimum recorded systolic blood pressure value plus 50% of the maximum amount of systolic blood pressure reduction (the Bolus 1 baseline value minus the value at the maximum absolute change).</description>

      <recruitment_details>Thirty patients were enrolled at two hospitals. All received an initial dose of clevidipine (Bolus 1-pre-anesthesia) during Treatment Period 1; 21 participants received a second bolus dose (Bolus 2-with anesthesia)during Treatment 2 per the discretion of the investigator at 250, 500 or 125μg, depending on patient response to Bolus 1.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A screening period began up to 14 days prior to study drug administration, consisting of obtaining informed consent, confirming patient eligibility, and collecting screening assessments. Patient eligibility was further verified on treatment day to confirm SPB ≥140 mm Hg prior to study drug. If SBP was &lt;140 mm Hg, no study drug was administered.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>The Mean Maximum Absolute Change in Systolic Blood Pressure From Baseline Within 15 Minutes From the First Bolus Dose of Clevidipine (Treatment Period 1, Bolus 1 - Pre-anesthesia).</title>
        <description>Blood Pressure was measured at 60, 45, 30, 0 seconds prior to first Bolus dose (Bolus 1), and every 5 seconds after Bolus 1 for 15 minutes. Baseline SBP of Bolus 1 is defined as, 'median of all measurements prior to or at the start of Bolus 1'. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) method was used to determine the minimum SBP value for each patient. Maximum absolute change is the minimum SBP value within 15 minutes from bolus 1 minus baseline value.</description>

        <description>BP was measured at 60, 45, 30, 0 seconds prior to first Bolus dose (bolus 1), and every 5 seconds after Bolus 1 for 15 minutes. Baseline SBP of bolus 1 is defined as median of all measurements prior to or at the start of Bolus 1. The time at which first target SBP reduction (ex. 5%) from baseline was reached was identified for each patient using fitted values from LOWESS method. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the median time. Patients who never reached 5%, 10% or 15% reduction, withdrew from study or changed antihypertensive within 15 minutes were censored.</description>

          <description>Study participants were sequentially assigned one of three cohorts to receive either a 250 μg, 500 μg or 125 μg bolus dose of clevidipine during Treatment Period 1 prior to induction of general anesthesia (Bolus 1 - pre-anesthesia) by rapid injection (&lt;5 seconds). At the discretion of the investigator, a second bolus could be administered during Treatment Period 2 after induction of general anesthesia (Bolus 2 - with anesthesia) at 125 μg, 250 μg or 500 μg based upon the earlier observed response to Bolus 1.</description>
