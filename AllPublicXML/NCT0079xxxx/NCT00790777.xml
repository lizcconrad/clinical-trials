    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish bioequivalence of paliperidone ER tablets
      manufactured at Gurabo as compared to paliperidone ER tablets manufactured at Vacaville,
      administered as a single dose of 12 mg under fasted conditions to healthy male volunteers,
      and to assess the safety and tolerability of both formulations.

      This is a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study in healthy male adults.The study
      consists of a screening phase and an open label treatment phase during which each patient
      will receive the 2 treatments of the study drug separated by a washout period of 7 to 14
      days. Treatment A will consist of a single oral dose of 12-mg paliperidone ER, tablets
      manufactured at Gurabo, administered under fasted condition. Treatment B will consist of a
      single oral dose of 12-mg paliperidone ER, tablets manufactured at Vacaville, administered
      under fasted condition. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected at
      pre-dose and for 96 hours post-dose for each period. As a change in manufacturing site will
      take place, bioequivalence between 12 mg tablets (highest dose strength) from the 2
      production sites (Gurabo [Puerto Rico, USA] and Vacaville [California, USA]) needs to be
      demonstrated. This pivotal bioequivalence study is designed to examine the pharmacokinetics,
      safety, and tolerability of paliperidone ER manufactured at Gurabo in comparison with
      paliperidone ER manufactured at Vacaville

      Two single oral doses of paliperidone ER 12 mg
