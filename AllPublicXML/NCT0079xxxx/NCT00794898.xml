             Association (Arnett et al., 1988). The disease should have been diagnosed at least 6
             months prior to Screening.

          -  Patients have active disease, in the opinion of the physician, despite the concomitant
             use of DMARDS. Evidence of active disease may include any of the following:

             6 or more swollen or tender joints; and 2 of the following

               -  Morning stiffness &gt;45 minutes

               -  C-reactive protein &gt;2.0 mg/L

               -  ESR &gt;28 mm/h

          -  Patients must have been using oral or parenteral MTX for at least 2 months with no
             break(s) in treatment of more than 2 weeks total during this period. Patients must
             have been on a stable dose of &gt;=7.5 mg/wk (IM, SQ, PO) for at least 8 weeks prior to
             Screening.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be using adequate birth control measures
             (abstinence, oral contraceptives, IUD, barrier method with spermicide or, surgical
             sterilization) and should continue such precautions for 6 months after receiving the
             last infusion.

          -  Patients must be on a stable dose of folic acid prophylaxis for at least 4 weeks prior
             to Screening.

          -  Patients using oral corticosteroids or NSAIDs, must have been on a stable dose for at
             least 4 weeks prior to Screening, and must continue during the treatment period. If
             currently not using corticosteroids or NSAIDs, the patient must have not received
             corticosteroids or NASIDs for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Patients must be able to adhere to the program visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          -  Patients must be capable of giving informed consent and the consent must have been
             obtained prior to any screening procedures.

             wheelchair, and who have little or no ability for self-care.

          -  Patients who have any current systemic inflammatory condition with signs and symptoms
             that might confound the evaluations of benefit from the Remicade therapy, eg, Lyme
             disease, or a rheumatic disease other than RA.

          -  Use of DMARDS other than MTX within 4 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  Use of intra-articular, IM, or IV. corticosteroids (including IM ACTH) within 4 weeks
             prior to Screening.

          -  Prior administration any other therapeutic agent targeted at reducing TNF (eg,
             Etanercept, pentoxifylline, thalidomide or anti-CD4+ antibody) within the previous 6
             months.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within the previous 6 months.

          -  A history of known allergies to murine proteins.

          -  Serious infections, such as hepatitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis in the previous 3
             months. Less serious infections in the previous 3 months, such as acute upper
             respiratory tract infection (colds) or uncomplicated urinary tract infection need not
             be considered exclusions at the discretion of the treating physician.

          -  History of opportunistic infections such as herpes zoster within 2 months of
             Screening. Evidence of active CMV, active pneumocystis carinii, drug resistant
             atypical mycobacterium, etc.

          -  Documented HIV infection.

          -  Current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic or cerebral disease.

          -  Any currently known malignancy or pre-malignant lesions or any history of malignancy
             within the past 5 years.

          -  Patients with alcoholism, alcoholic liver disease, or other chronic liver disease.

          -  Patients with a positive PPD within 3 months and chest X-Ray suggestive of active TB
