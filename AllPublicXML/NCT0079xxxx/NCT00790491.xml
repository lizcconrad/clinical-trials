      ABSTRACT Although most primary healthcare practitioners recognize the important relationship
      among nutrition, physical activity and health, few incorporate either dietary or physical
      activity counseling into routine practice. AUGMENT will employ interactive technology to
      support effective patient life-style counseling during routine office visits. AUGMENT
      technology will automate the administration, collection, and analysis of dietary and physical
      activity questionnaires, and it will guide counseling and present intervention resources and
      strategies tailored to the patient's unique needs. Using tablet computers, wireless LANs, and
      inexpensive Internet communications, AUGMENT will have advantages over existing tools: 1.)
      Lower usage costs (minimal office personal required), 2.) Ability to customize the system,
      and 3.) Real-time, comprehensive assessment.

      The AUGMENT system efficiently and relentlessly gathers important healthcare information
      (such as total fat, type of fat consumption; fruit and vegetable consumption; fiber and
      micronutrient intake; and energy output). This means patients are less likely to have their
      preventive needs overlooked by a busy practitioner. The assessment includes questions to
      determine the amount of effort the patient will commit to improved health. This will enable
      the physician to effectively guide the patient via targeted recommendations, obtainable
      goals, and a course of action that is both preventive and prescriptive; and to monitor
      progress. Patients who receive objective assessments of their healthcare practices and
      recommendations based on their own unique health history will be more likely to accept and
      act on the recommendations.

      The specific aims of the study are to: 1) Incorporate key elements of a previously developed
      prototype tool into a dietary and physical activity risk assessment system, 2) Create a
      provider training tool to build proficiency in using AUGMENT for counseling to reduce disease
      risk.

      3) Validate the AUGMENT dietary and physical activity assessments using dietary recalls and
      accelerometer data, 4) Complete a process evaluation of the AUGMENT program by using it in
      interventions managed by six physicians with at least 240 patients, and 5) Survey
      participating providers and patients to assess acceptability of AUGMENT within a clinical
      setting.
