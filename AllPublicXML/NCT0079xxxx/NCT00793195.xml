  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a trial to examine the
      efficacy of an ω3FA (Omega-3 fatty acid) containing balanced lipid emulsion in the prevention
      of progression of PNALD in infants with Intestinal Failure/Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) and
      early liver dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) associated liver disease (PNALD), remains the primary cause of
      morbidity and mortality in infants with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) and intestinal failure.
      Although, the etiology is likely multi-factorial, lipids within parenteral nutrition solution
      have been implicated in its development. The standard lipid used in PN is typically, a soy
      based lipid (eg: Intralipid® - Fresenius Kabi) that primarily contains omega-6 fatty acids
      (ω6FAs). Animal and human studies have suggested that addition of omega-3 fatty acids (ω3FAs)
      to parenteral nutrition may decrease the incidence of hepatic injury, as well as have
      beneficial immunologic effects. SMOFlipid® (Fresenius Kabi) is a composite lipid emulsion,
      which contains polyunsaturated ω3 and ω6FAs, monounsaturated FAs, as well as medium chain FAs
      as integral constituents. All components (Soy-bean oil, medium chain triglycerides, olive
      oil, fish oil) have been used in humans, and the drug is approved for use in children in
      Europe. Based on its composition, we believe that this lipid preparation has the potential to
      prevent progression of liver disease in infants with SBS who are demonstrating evidence of
      liver dysfunction.

    <description>Dosing will be formulated according to a Nomogram for Parenteral Nutrition (PN) composition, which takes into account the percentage of the subject's caloric intake consumed parenterally. PN solution will be infused continuously over 12-24 hours by infusion pump, and the duration each day will depend on the enteral tolerance of the child. PN shall not be discontinued, unless the patient is taking 95% of calories enterally with good growth as evidence by appropriate weight gain. Subjects will receive the trial lipid for a total duration of 12 weeks or if they develop a serum conjugated bilirubin (sustained for 7 days) of 100 umol/l (6mg/dl) or full enteral tolerance prior to this end-point. Once the trial lipid is discontinued, in the event that PN is continued, subjects will return to the standard lipid preparation. A final follow-up data-point will be collected 4 weeks after the trial lipid is stopped.</description>
