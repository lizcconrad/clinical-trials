      The primary objective of this screening study is to identify and characterize the disease
      status of patients with Gaucher Type 1 disease for potential inclusion in a subsequent Phase
      3 clinical study which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Genz-112638.

      This will be a multi-center, multi-national screening study to assess the disease status of
      patients with Gaucher Type 1 disease utilizing criteria to be eligible for enrollment in a
      subsequent phase 3 clinical study. The assessment performed in this study are standard of
      care for the evaluation of symptoms of Gaucher Type 1 disease. No study drug will be
      administered in this screening study.
