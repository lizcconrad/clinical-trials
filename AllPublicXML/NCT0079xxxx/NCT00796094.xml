      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential importance of tissue elasticity in the
      assessment of soft tissues including muscles, tendons and ligaments and other soft tissue
      structures.

      The evaluation of tissue elasticity (easily stretched or moveable) may assist in assessment
      of various soft tissue structures, such as fatty atrophy of muscles, tendon/ligamentous
      injury and healing and other soft tissue structures.

      This is a prospective study that will recruit males and females 18 years of age and older who
      present to the department for a clinically indicated ultrasound of a superficial soft tissue
      abnormality with prior or following MRI / CT assessment ordered for clinical purposes.

      The elasticity properties of tissues depend on their molecular building blocks and on the
      organization of these blocks. Injuries, disease etc are known to be associated with changes
      in tissue elasticity. Little research has been done on the potential of sonoelastographic
      (elasticity ultrasound imaging) assessment of normal, injured or healing muscles, tendons or
      ligaments.

      Elasticity changes in muscle, ligaments and tendons following injury may have implication on
      the choice of treatment and help in determine how the length of time needed to heal from an
      injury.

      Stiffness/elasticity of the tissue can be assessed by mechanical excitation with measurement
      of resultant tissue motion. Reconstruction of the elastic deformability (strain imaging) in
      real time ultrasound is known as sonoelastography.

      Elasticity ultrasound imaging will be performed on the area being evaluated clinically.
