      Background:

      Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths around the world. It is a serious problem
      in places like East Asia, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe. Researchers want to
      study the causes of gastric cancer. They want to reduce the number of people with stomach
      cancer.

      Objectives:

      To learn more about bacteria factors and other causes of gastric cancer. To study potential
      markers associated with precancer gastric lesions.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 40-70 at certain hospitals in Chile who:

      Are going to have endoscopies

      OR have stomach cancer and need surgery

      Design:

      Participants will give tissue samples about the size of a grain of rice.

      Some participants will donate a portion of the stomach tissue that is removed as part of
      their clinical care.

      Participants will give access to reports of their stomach exam. They will allow researchers
      to photograph the microscope slides of their tissue samples.

      Participants will answer questions. The topics of the questions include:

      Age, height, weight, ethnicity

      Education

      Habits including tobacco and alcohol

      Personal and family history of disease

      Reproductive history

      Diet

      Some participants will give blood, urine, saliva, and stool samples. Study staff will collect
      the blood. They will tell the participants how to collect the other samples themselves.

    <textblock>
      The burden of gastric adenocarcinoma is unevenly distributed, with several Asian and Latin
      American countries having particularly high incidence rates. Although chronic infection with
      Helicobacter pylori is the primary cause of this cancer, environmental and host cofactors
      modify the course of infection and determine whether infected individuals develop cancer. Due
      to the lack of adequate screening strategies and consequent late diagnosis, trends in
      mortality are similar to incidence, making this neoplasia the third leading cause of cancer
      death worldwide. The International Agency for Research on Cancer predicts that there will be
      no reduction in gastric cancer cases until at least 2030 due to population growth and aging.
      H. pylori-related gastric carcinogenesis is a multi-step process and mucosal lesions of
      intestinal metaplasia (IM) and dysplasia confer increased risk of progression. Therefore,
      case-control studies of these premalignant lesions may provide insights into cancer etiology
      and inform risk stratification. In addition, biomarkers to identify high-risk individuals are
      needed for early detection and curative treatment. Accordingly, we propose a 2-year study of
      10,000 Chilean adults undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for clinical or screening
      purposes to identify 600 subjects with advanced premalignant lesions (i.e., incomplete-type
      IM, complete-type IM with extension to gastric corpus and dysplasia) for informative
      comparisons with 600 controls with non-atrophic gastritis, a benign histologic change
      apparent in most H. pylori infected individuals. As an additional case group, 300 individuals
      with newly diagnosed gastric cancer will be recruited from the same clinics. For a 4-month
      pilot phase, we plan to recruit 1550 patients undergoing endoscopy and 10 patients with
      gastric cancer. This multidisciplinary project will simultaneously evaluate bacterial, host
      and environmental factors towards a better understanding of gastric cancer etiology that may
      guide future efforts for prevention and control. We will explore risk factors that have been
      insufficiently studied, such as various hormones, H. pylori genomics, non- H. pylori gastric
      microbiota, and other parasitic infections. We will also evaluate potential noninvasive
      screening markers, including pepsinogens, hormones, miRNAs and DNA methylation. Results from
      this study may lead to improved management recommendations for individuals with advanced IM.
      Additionally, the resulting biobank of gastric tissue, blood, urine, saliva and stool will
      enable state-of-the-art molecular assays and serve as a resource for future research in this
      area by multiple DCEG investigators.
