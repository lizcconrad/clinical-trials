    <textblock>
      This research protocol seeks to compare radiological and clinical outcomes of cervical spine
      disease patients following standard-of-care anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF)
      using allograft fusion versus Cohere porous polyetheretherketone (PEEK) fusion device.

      This clinical study presents little to no additional risk to study subjects beyond those
      associated with standard-of-care ACDF surgery. Adults age 18 and over who are undergoing an
      ACDF procedure will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of a completing a series of
      questionnaires and obtaining radiographs. The primary endpoint of the study will be the rate
      of successful spinal fusion for each group. For evaluation of the primary endpoint and
      additional assessments, descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, minimum,
      median, and maximum for continuous variables and frequency distribution for categorical
      variables will be provided, as well as tabular listings. All complications will be itemized
      including incidence, duration, and relationship to the device used and/or procedures
      performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized comparative outcomes study, in which all subjects who fit
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who agreed to be part of the study will be
      randomized to either Allograft or Cohere polyetheretherketone (PEEK) fusion group and will be
      followed for approximately 12 months following surgery according to the standard-of-care.

      Pain and function will be assessed using neck disability index (NDI), 36-Item Short Form
      Survey (SF-36), and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). A trained study team member will record a
      standardized neurologic examination, including motor, sensory, and reflexes. Neurologic
      success is defined as maintenance or improvement of all 3 neurologic parameters (motor,
      sensory, and reflexes). The clinical results will also be assessed using the Japanese
      Orthopedic Association (JOA) scoring system for cervical myelopathy.

      Flexion and extension radiographs will be obtained pre-operatively, at 6-months and 12-months
      after surgery. A CT scan will be obtained at 6 months, if fusion has occurred no CT is needed
      at 12 months, if fusion did not occur another computerized tomography (CT) scan will obtained
      at 12 months. From previous literature, successful fusion is defined as ≤2° of angular motion
      on lateral flexion and extension radiographs, the presence of bridging trabecular bone
      between the vertebrae being fused, and the absence of any radiolucent zones spanning more
      than 50% of the allograft surface. Two independent blinded radiologists will assess the
      radiographs. In the event of disagreement about fusion healing, a third independent reading
      will be obtained from a third radiologist.

    <description>ACDF is a surgical technique used to treat a variety of cervical spine disorders, such as nerve root or spinal cord compression, cervical spondylosis, and cervical spinal stenosis. The anterior approach to the cervical spine for discectomy and fusion by the insertion of an autologous iliac crest tricortical bone graft was first described by Robinson and Smith in 1955. In 1958, Cloward described a wide anterior cylindrical discectomy performed with a special reamer combined with anterior fusion by the insertion of autologous iliac bone graft of the same shape. At Duke University Health Systems, both allografts and Cohere porous PEEK fusion device are used for ACDF.</description>

    <description>Bagby et al. developed the first interbody fusion cage. Cages of different shapes and materials are used to perform ACDF which, in some cases, could be associated with plate fixation. At Duke University Health Systems, both allografts and Cohere porous PEEK fusion device are used for ACDF.</description>
