  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is the most common complaint in childhood gastrointestinal disease,affecting an
      estimated 20% of the global children.The treatment strategies consist of diet
      control,behavioural intervention and oral and sometimes rectal laxatives. Given higher
      success rate and fewer side effects,the laxative PEG3350 has been considered the first choice
      in childhood constipation.However, effectiveness of PEG 3350 laxative is not lasting,
      additional treatment interventions are still necessary.With an unsatisfactory response to
      current treatments, many patients seek help from Chinese Herbal Medicine.In view of the
      traditional theory, childhood constipation is derived from weakness of gastric and splenic
      function.The functional weakness is characterized by food stagnation and further pathological
      heat accumulation in the gastrointestine. The food stagnation can slow the gastrointestinal
      motility while heat causes constipation by drying the intestines and their content.
      Therefore, the therapeutic principles and practices for childhood constipation must focus on
      the pathophysiological basis accordingly. In the documented traditional medicine
      dictionary(Pi Wei Lun), Xiaojidaozhi Decoction is well described in improving the gastric and
      splenic function, eliminating food stagnation and removing pathological heat accumulation,
      and it has always been used in treatment of constipation throughout Asia since the first
      description in Pi Wei Lun in 1249. It comprises twelve herbs. Through the combined action of
      these herbs, Xiaojidaozhi Decoction can increase fluid in the intestines and facilitate the
      gastrointestinal motility, relieving the symptoms of constipation. Despite of the long
      history of successful use of Xiaojidaozhi Decoction in childhood constipation, a large
      randomized placebo-controlled trial is still not available.The aim of this study was to
      explore the clinical efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine Xiaojidaozhi Decoction in
      the treatment of childhood constipation.
