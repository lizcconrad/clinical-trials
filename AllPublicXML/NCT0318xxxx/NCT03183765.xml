  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Warts are benign epidermal tumors caused by human papilloma virus, which are epitheliotropic
      non-enveloped double stranded DNA viruses. Transmission of warts occurs from direct
      person-to-person contact or indirectly by fomites . Warts appear in various forms including
      verruca vulgaris, plane, plantar, filiform, digitate and periungual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of warts is difficult for patients and physicians . Currently Available treatment
      options include cryosurgery, laser, electrosurgery, bleomycin, and topical keratolytic
      applications; many of them are painful, ineffective, costly and prone for recurrences.

      Cryotherapy, which uses liquid nitrogen to freeze tissues and destroy warts, is one of the
      most common and effective treatments. freezing causes local irritation, leading the host to
      mount an immune reaction against the virus.

      Immunotherapy appears to enhance virus recognition by immune system; allowing clearance of
      treated wart, distant warts , and helps to prevent infection .Recently, intralesional
      immunotherapy using different antigens such as mumps, Candida, and tuberculin has been proved
      effective in the treatment of warts.

      The exact mechanism of action of intralesional immunotherapy is still obscure. Intralesional
      antigen injection probably induces strong non specific inflammatory response against the
      human papilloma virus-infected cells.

      It has been suggested that intralesional measles mumps rubella vaccine results in regression
      of warts via induction of immune system.
