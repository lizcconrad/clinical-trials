  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the significant burden of stroke in rural China, secondary prevention of stroke is
      scarce. The aim of the study is to develop a system-integrated technology-enabled
      intervention (SINEMA) model for the secondary prevention of stroke in rural China and
      evaluate the effectiveness of the model compared with usual care. The hypothesis is that
      trained village doctors, equipped with digital health technology, can provide essential
      evidence-based care to stroke survivors in rural China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SINEMA trial is a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of
      implementation of a system-integrated and technology-enabled model of care to improve the
      secondary prevention of stroke in Nanhe County, a rural area of Hebei province, China. Fifty
      villages from five townships are stratified randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the
      intervention arm (implementing SINEMA model) or the control arm (usual care).

      After a baseline survey, intervention will be implemented in 25 intervention villages,
      lasting for 12 months. Follow-up survey will be conducted in the same way in all villages at
      12-month after the initial of the study. Process evaluation will be conducted every three
      month, and economic evaluation will also be conducted.

    <intervention_model_description>The SINEMA model, cognizant of health system's organization around primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare levels in China, adopts the principles of cascade training with feedback and task-sharing, and relies on existing human resources available at the community level. It also proposes the use of innovative mobile technology as tools (in the form of an Android-based SINEMA APP for village doctors and cellphone voice messages for participants). The overarching aim is to strengthen the capacity of village doctors on delivering services for the secondary prevention of stroke and promoting medication adherence and physical activity among stroke survivors.</intervention_model_description>
