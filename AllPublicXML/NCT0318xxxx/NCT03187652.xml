      A prospective cohort study of idiopathic TTP patients who have presented with their first
      episode and are in remission within the last 30 days. They will be followed for 12 months
      from the time of their remission, followed by a long-term follow up study.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective cohort study at the London Health Sciences
      Centre, Ontario, Canada. The investigators will identify 15-30 idiopathic TTP patients who
      have presented with their first episode and are in remission within the last 30 days. They
      will be followed for 12 months from the time of their remission. Study procedures include
      routine laboratory monitoring, biomarker assessments, cardiovascular and neurocognitive
      functional assessments, and non-invasive imaging studies. The long-term follow-up TTP study
      will help to assess the mechanisms of vascular injuries, evaluate cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular monitoring tools, and generate novel ideas to prevent further vascular
      injuries.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (=18 years) with a recent diagnosis of their first episode of idiopathic TTP,
             who have been treated with plasma exchange with or without other therapies, and who
             are in remission. Remission is defined as the normalization of platelet counts and
             lactate dehydrogenase levels with no clinical signs or symptoms of microvascular
             injury for more than 30 days. The patients will be included in the study within 30
             days of remission of their symptoms. Thepatients will all meet the following
             diagnostic criteria for idiopathic TTP: (1) thrombocytopenia with platelet count &lt;150
             x 109 /L, (2) microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia (presence of red blood cell
             fragmentation by peripheral blood smear), (3) elevation of lactate dehydrogenase
             (LDH)&gt; 1.25 X of the upper limit of normal, and (4) ADAMTS13 Activity &lt; 10%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have diagnoses of typical HUS (diarrhea-associated
             HUS), atypical HUS, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, have abnormal INR at
             the time of presentation, have diagnoses of malignant hypertension at the time of
             presentation, are on the following drugs within 90 days prior to their presentation:
             ticlopidine, clopidogrel, mitomycin C, gemcitabine, cyclosporine, and quinine, have a
             history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantations prior to their presentation, have
             a history and/or diagnosis of vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma,
             rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, or HIV/AIDS, have a history
             of solid organ malignancy within 5 years prior to presentation, i.e. lung, breast,
             gastric, colon, pancreatic, prostate, or liver, are pregnant at the time of
             presentation, have severe bronchospasm, unstable angina, and severe ischemic heart
             disease, have advanced kidney failure (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt; 30
             mL/min/1.73m2), and have history of allergic reaction to contrast dye.
