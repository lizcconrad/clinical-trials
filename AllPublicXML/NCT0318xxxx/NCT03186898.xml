  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well radiation therapy with protons works compared with
      photons in treating patients with liver cancer. Radiation therapy, such as photon therapy,
      uses high energy x-rays to send the radiation inside the body to the tumor while proton
      therapy uses a beam of proton particles. Proton therapy can stop shortly after penetrating
      through the tumor and may cause less damage to the surrounding healthy organs and result in
      better survival in patients with liver cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if Overall Survival (OS) is different for hepatocellular carcinoma patients
      treated with protons compared to photons.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the difference in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with protons compared to patients with HCC treated
      with photons.

      II. To determine the difference in local progression (LP) in patients with HCC treated with
      protons compared to patients with HCC treated with photons.

      III. To determine differences in toxicity in patients with HCC treated with protons versus
      photons.

      IV. To determine differences in fatigue, as measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS) Fatigue in patients with HCC treated with protons, versus
      photons; as well as quality-adjusted survival, if the primary endpoint is met.

      V. To determine if there are correlations between the baseline values of HGF and outcomes
      (OS/PFS/fatigue).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine differences in overall Quality of Life, measured by FACT-Hep in patients with
      HCC treated with protons.

      II. Biospecimen collection for future correlative science projects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo proton therapy over 15-24 days for 5 or 15 fractions.

      ARM II: Patients undergo photon therapy over 15-24 days for 5 or 15 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) or radiographically-proven (based on

          -  Appropriate stage for study entry based on the following diagnostic workup:

               -  All patients must have computed tomography (CT) scan chest/abdomen/pelvis with
                  multiphasic liver CT scan prior to registration. If CT contrast is

                  of abdomen is permitted

               -  Participants must have measurable disease at study entry, defined as at least one
                  lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest
                  diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 2 cm with conventional techniques or as &gt; 1 cm with
                  spiral CT scan

               -  Patients must have 3 or fewer single or multinodular tumors. For patients with a
                  single lesion, lesion must be 15 cm or less in greatest dimension. For patients
                  with two lesions, no lesion may be greater than 10 cm in greatest dimension. For
                  patients with three lesions, no lesion may be greater than 6 cm in greatest
                  dimension. Portal vein involvement or thrombosis combined with a single legion
                  that is ≥ 4 cm and ≤ 15 cm in greatest dimension is allowed.

          -  Zubrod performance status 0-1 within 30 days prior to registration

          -  Negative urine or serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential within 7
             days prior to study entry

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000 cells/mm^3

          -  Platelets &gt;= 50,000 cells/mm^3

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dl; (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to achieve

          -  Transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) &lt;
             6 x institutional ULN

          -  Albumin &gt;= 2.5mg/dl

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl

          -  Prior chemotherapy, targeted biological therapy (e.g. sorafenib), surgery,
             transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), ablation for present disease is acceptable

          -  Must have Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) A or B7

          -  The patient or a legally authorized representative must provide study-specific
             informed consent prior to study registration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  PRIOR TO STEP ONE RANDOMIZATION:

          -  Definitive clinical or radiologic documentation of extrahepatic tumor, defined as
             extrahepatic metastases or malignant nodes (that enhance with typical features of HCC)
             &gt; 3.0 cm, in sum of maximal diameters (e.g. presence of one 3.4 cm metastatic lymph
             node or two 2 cm lung lesions). Note that benign non-enhancing periportal
             lymphadenopathy is not unusual in the presence of hepatitis and is permitted, even if
             the sum of enlarged nodes is &gt; 2.0 cm

          -  Uncontrolled prior invasive malignancy, excluding the current diagnosis

          -  Systemic chemotherapy for the study cancer &lt; 2 weeks prior to registration

          -  Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception. This exclusion is
             necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic.

          -  HIV positive with CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/microliter; note that patients who are human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive are eligible, provided they are under treatment
             with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and have a CD4 count &gt;= 200
             cells/microliter prior to registration. Note also that HIV testing is not required for
             eligibility for this protocol. This exclusion criterion is necessary because the
             treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.

          -  Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of
             radiation therapy fields (to include Y90)

          -  Prior liver transplant

          -  PRIOR TO STEP TWO RANDOMIZATION:

          -  Unable to obtain confirmation of payment coverage (insurance or other) for either
             possible treatment
