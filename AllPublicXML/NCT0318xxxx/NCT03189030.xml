  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of a personalized live, attenuated,
      double-deleted Listeria monocytogenes (pLADD) treatment in adults with metastatic colorectal
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a personalized
      treatment in adults with metastatic colorectal cancer by first analyzing the expression of
      tumor-associated antigens and then treating the patients with a personalized live,
      attenuated, double-deleted Listeria monocytogenes (pLADD)-based immunotherapy. pLADD is based
      on the attenuated form of Listeria monocytogenes that has been genetically modified to reduce
      its ability to cause disease, while maintaining its ability to stimulate a potent immune
      response. pLADD is manufactured using patient-specific antigens and is therefore
      individualized to each patient.
