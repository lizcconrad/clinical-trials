  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ITISHOPE4HF is a randomized controlled trial of telerehabilitation in a heart failure
      population. The goal is to evaluate if a home-based telerehabilitation project can increase
      physical activity in heart failure patients. Patient will be provided telerehabiliation or
      advice on physical activity (standard care).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programs are well documented as an important part of
      treatment and care for heart failure patients. Training with instruction gives the
      participant a commitment to participate. The result is increased activity compared to
      controls.

      This trial will include participants from the about 75 % of heart failure patients who for
      some reason do not participate in regular outpatient rehabilitation. Distance to
      rehabilitation centers and the psychological burden of a group setting are believed to be
      important reasons for not participating. Telerehabilitation can hopefully overcome these
      hurdles for many patients, and thereby provide instructed training for these patients.

      The trial will also include patients with renal disease. Heart disease is the main cause of
      death in patients with renal disease, even at younger ages. Because of the complexity of both
      optimal medical treatment and fluid balance, these patients are often not included in
      clinical trials. The cardiorenal crosstalk will be explored, how in influence the heart
      failure phenotypes and the response to exercise.
