    <textblock>
      This research study will recruit 200 transgender youths between the ages of 15-24. There are
      two arms to the research study: the control and the intervention arm. Each eligible
      participant will be randomized into either arm. The control arm participants receive an
      OraQuick HIV testing kit sent to an address of their choice and instructions of how to
      conduct the test. They will enter their results on the research study website and complete
      surveys at 3 month intervals until an entire year has passed. Participants in the
      intervention arm will receive an OraQuick HIV testing kit sent to them and will receive
      video-based counseling called Motivational Interviewing and Certified Testing and Referral.
      After this counseling session, the results from the OraQuick HIV test will be logged by study
      staff. Then, participants in the intervention arm will fill out surveys at 3 month intervals
      until a year has passed.

    <description>Assess differences and changes in TY's sexual-risk behaviors between those who receive the home-testing with video-based MI/CTR (intervention arm) compared to those who receive the home-testing alone (control arm). 200 TY (100 male: 100 female) will be randomized to either the intervention or control arm and followed for 6 months with surveys taken at baselines and months 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Sexual Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>We measure changes in sexual behavior using behavioral measures based on information collected from the baseline survey, MI/CTR session for the intervention arm participants, and subsequent surveys each 3 months until one year from the initial survey has occurred.</description>

    <measure>Linkage to Care</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure linkage to care with the following outcomes as indicators per the recent recommendations of the Institute of Medicine and CDC: within 3 months of HIV diagnosis, attending at least one clinical care appointment, having at least one CD4 test performed and having at least one viral load test performed.</description>

    <description>Transgender individuals randomized to the experimental group (MI/CTR) will receive HIV counseling and testing via an online, HIPPA-compliant videoconferencing service. The session will last less than one hour and focus on HIV testing, prevention strategies, and/or linkage to HIV care, depending on the individual's test results. Participants will complete follow up surveys at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.</description>
