  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine if the SSI rate following revision total hip
      and knee arthroplasty is reduced in patients treated with the PICO device compared to
      patients with traditional postoperative dressings. Our secondary goals include; comparing the
      amount of wound drainage, rate of resolution of wound drainage, length of hospital stay,
      functional outcomes, and economic implications of wound drainage and SSI after revision
      arthroplasty comparing PICO and traditional dressings.
