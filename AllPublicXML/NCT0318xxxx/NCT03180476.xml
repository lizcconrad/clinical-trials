  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Apatinib as maintenace therapy for
      Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma With Metastasis after Chemoradiotherapy, including progress free
      survival(PFS)、overall survival (OS)、Quality of life score (QoL) and evaluation of drug
      safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC), although radiotherapy and chemotherapy has
      been given, patients still locally recurrence and distant metastasis. There is no standard
      treatment recommendation for metastatic NPC who failed to chemoradiotherapy therapy. Apatinib
      has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Several phase III
      studies of liver cancer, non small cell lung cancer and other tumors also showed apatinib has
      less toxicities and better tolerance. However, the clinical application of apatinib in
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma is still lack of evidence-based medicine. And this trial is designed
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib as maintenance therapy after
      chemoradiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma with metastasis.

This is a nontherapeutic and nondiagnostic protocol to obtain quality of life assessments from cancer patients and survivors who have dermatologic conditions, whether related to cancer therapies, or directly related to the primary cancer diagnosis.

    <description>Apatinib, also known as YN968D1, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2, also known as KDR). It is an orally bioavailable, small molecule agent which is thought to inhibit angiogenesis in cancer cells; specifically apatinib inhibits VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration and proliferation thus blocking new blood vessel formation in tumor tissue. This agent also mildly inhibits c-Kit and c-SRC tyrosine kinases.</description>
