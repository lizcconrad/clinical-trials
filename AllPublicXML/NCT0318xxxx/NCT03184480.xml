  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this post-marketing investigation is to collect and assess the information about
      safety and effectiveness of ARNUITY® ELLIPTA® (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Arnuity&quot;) in daily
      clinical practice. The investigation will include subjects with a diagnosis of asthma
      bronchial who are naïve to ARNUITY. The investigator will monitor the information about
      safety and effectiveness of ARNUITY for one year from the start date of ARNUITY
      administration and Pneumonia will be considered as the priority investigation matter. 300
      subjects, from approximately 150 medical institutions, will be included in this analysis.
      ARNUITY ELLIPTA is the registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) group of companies.

    <measure>Response rate based on global assessment of effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>One year from the start of Arnuity administration</time_frame>
    <description>The response rate is the proportion of subjects assessed as &quot;effective&quot;. Effectiveness will be comprehensively assessed based on the course of subjective and clinical symptoms and changes in Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, etc. from the start date of administration to the end of the observation period.</description>
