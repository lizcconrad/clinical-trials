  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alkaline phosphatase is known to be produced by syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta and its
      levels are normally increased in pregnancy. Therefore, it would be reasonable to hypothesize
      that alkaline phosphatase would be low to low normal in cases of low birth weight /
      intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)/ placental insufficiency.

      The purpose of this study will be to determine if alkaline phosphatase can be used as a
      predictor for suboptimal fetal growth, placental insufficiency and low birth weight (birth
      weight less than 2500 grams). It will also help determine if alkaline phosphatase can be used
      as a screening tool for low birth weight/IUGR at the time of the 24 to 28 week labs.
