  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare subtype of extranodal non-Hodgkins
      Lymphoma (NHL) with rising incidence and variable response to treatment. MRI is considered
      the most useful imaging modality of PCNSL, but conventional MRI has its limitations, and
      contrast-enhanced MRI sometimes does not clearly differentiate PCNSL from other neoplasm or
      non-neoplastic diseases.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) could have a number of potential advantages in refining
      and improving the management of patients with PCNSL. Because of the rare incidence of PCNSL,
      the value of PET has however not been well defined in this subtype of lymphomas. There are a
      few studies that have investigated the role for FDG-PET and amino acid PET in the primary
      staging/diagnosis and response assessment in PCNSL patients, but the results are
      inconclusive. Further studies are therefore needed.

      Previous studies support an integration of both MRI and PET for the routine diagnostic workup
      and response assessment for PCNSL, and the newly available simultaneous PET/MRI scanners may
      have the potential to improve imaging baseline accuracy, response assessment and add
      prognostic value in PCNSL.

      The main aim of the study is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of a combined PET/MRI
      examination with the clinical routine MRI examination given to these patients today. It will
      be investigated whether PET (18F-FDG and 18F-fluciclovine) can provide additional prognostic
      value at baseline and in response assessment compared to MRI and established pre-treatment
      prognostic scores in PCNSL, and evaluate which PET/MRI parameters that are best suited as an
      imaging biomarker for progression-free survival.
