      An open‐label, single centre, nonrandomized clinical study in healthy volunteers, with
      intervention over a 13--‐week period. After written informed consent, subjects will undergo
      screening evaluations (Visit 1). One week after visit 1, subjects who meet the selection
      criteria will enter a run--‐in period of 8 weeks where participants will receive paracetamol
      1g tablet and collect a blood sample at monthly intervals (visits 2, 3 and 4). A final visit
      for safety assessment will take place at week 13 (visit 5). Blood samples will be used to
      quantify P, PG e PS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To be able to predict efficacy and adverse reactions involving compounds metabolized by
      sulfonation, the investigators need more information on SULTs. Studies of in vivo sulfonation
      in humans are lacking, although they are of key importance in assessing the functional
      consequences of individual variation. In our current study, the investigators will start by
      developing an HPLC method of quantifying SULT1A1 activity using paracetamol as probe
      substrate and studying intraindividual variation in healthy adults. Advantages of using
      paracetamol as a probe substrate for in vivo phenotyping of SULT1A1 include: wide safety
      margin for in vivo use, easy and ready administration of the drug, significant metabolism by
      the enzyme of interest, short half--‐life, linear pharmacokinetics over a wide concentration
      range and a limited number of metabolites, quantifiable in plasma.15,24 In a subsequent
      study, the investigators plan to study interindividual variation in a larger sample,
      including subjects with chronic disease and on medication.The investigators expect to provide
      a valuable new tool to explore the clinical significance of variation of SULT1A1 activity,
      the most important SULT on drug metabolism.

    <description>Volunteers will be screened at visit 1, and if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria they will receive the intervention at visit 2. At visit 2, complying subjects will receive a tablet containing 1 gram of paracetamol and have a blood sample collected 2 hours after administration; these procedures will be repeated on 2 more occasions (visits 3 and 4). The subjects will come for 5 visits during the study. Visit 1 and 2 must occur within 7 days of each other, visits 2, 3 and 4 will be four weeks (± 3 days) apart and visit 5 scheduled four weeks (± 3 days) after visit 4.</description>
