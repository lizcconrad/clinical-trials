    <textblock>
      This trial is a pilot, Phase 2, sequential two-cohort study designed to test two de-escalated
      whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) dose levels and assess their ability to maintain
      acceptable in-brain distant control. The WBRT dose would decrease as the study moves forward,
      both in terms of absolute value and equivalent dose in 2 Gray fractions (EQD2) (as determined
      by the linear quadratic radiobiological model). The absolute value of the simultaneous
      integrated boost (SIB) dose will change with each dose level because the number of fractions
      delivered will depend on the WBRT dose. As such, the SIB dose will be manipulated such that
      the EQD2 will remain essentially equivalent despite the difference in the number of fractions
      delivered. This design will ensure that the only variable is the change in WBRT dose.

      The concept is that WBRT with SIB would be expected to maximize both local and in-brain
      distant control as has already been shown in studies exploring WBRT with SRS boost. However,
      by itself WBRT with SIB does not address the concern over neurocognitive outcomes. Therefore,
      investigators hypothesize that there is a lower WBRT dose threshold that will maintain
      acceptable in-brain distant control, particularly in the setting of a SIB to gross lesions to
      maintain treated lesion control. In addition, lower overall brain dose (including lower
      hippocampal dose without specific hippocampal avoidance) may potentially improve
      neurocognitive function. Investigators are also interested in evaluating treated lesion
      control, overall survival, neurocognitive sequelae of therapy, quality of life, performance
      status, and adverse effects of therapy. Biomarker identification for potential correlative
      circulating tumor DNA and microRNA is an exploratory endpoint to generate data for future
      prospective evaluation.

      Primary Objective Evaluate two de-escalated whole brain radiation dose levels (in the setting
      of simultaneous integrated boost to gross lesions) with respect to in-brain distant control
      for brain metastases, defined as an in-brain failure rate outside of the planning target
      volume at 6 months of &lt; 20%.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. Evaluate treated lesion control at 6 months for brain metastases in the setting of a
           predetermined total biologically effective SIB dose as determined by radiographic
           progression within the planning target volume with fusion and overlay of follow-up MRIs.

        2. Evaluate overall survival at 6 months for brain metastases in the setting of WBRT with
           SIB.

        3. Evaluate changes in neurocognitive function after WBRT with SIB in the following
           domains: verbal learning and memory as assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -
           Revised (HVLT-R); memory, executive function, and higher order cognition as assessed by
           the Groton Maze Learning Test; and working memory via either the Two Back Test or One
           Back Test (depending on patient performance at baseline). All tests except the HVLT-R
           are part of a custom battery designed with the help of CogState psychology staff and
           will be delivered via the CogState platform.

        4. Evaluate changes in health-related quality of life as assessed by the Functional
           Assessment of Cancer Therapy with Brain Subscale (FACT-Br) after WBRT-SIB for brain
           metastases.

        5. Evaluate changes in performance status as assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Status
           tool after WBRT-SIB for brain metastases.

        6. Evaluate adverse events after WBRT-SIB for brain metastases according to current CTCAE
           criteria and documented by the LENT-SOMA form.
