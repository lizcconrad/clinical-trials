             hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia)

         17. Thrombolytic use (except to maintain IV catheters) within 10 days prior study

         23. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
             related illness.

             weeks following surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or tubal
             ligation) or be postmenopausal, or must agree to use effective contraception during
             the study and for 3 months following last dose of carotuximab (TRC105). All female
             patients of reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or
             urine) within 7 days prior to study treatment. Male patients must be surgically
             sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the study and for 3 months
             following last dose of carotuximab (TRC105). The definition of effective contraception
             is provided in Section 2.6.1 of this protocol.

         25. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or may
             interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for this study
