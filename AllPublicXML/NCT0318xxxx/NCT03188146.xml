  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several risk assessment scoring systems have been proposed to assess the therapeutic response
      and predict long term prognosis in ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)-treated primary biliary
      cholangitis (PBC) patients, in order to risk stratify PBC patients and guide their
      management. However there scoring systems have not been fully validated in Chinese
      population. This study is going to compare the prognostic ability of these criteria, validate
      the overseas scoring systems, develop and validate a new scoring system in a cohort of
      Chinese PBC patients.
