      -  To compare patients who will undergo orthodontics treatment involving upper premolar
           extraction for space of time whether with or without corticotomy by Piezotome.

        -  Assess the safety of both methods of retraction in regard to the quality of the
           surrounding periodontium and roots of anterior teeth.

        -  Monitor postoperative pain.

    <intervention_name>piezotome assisted orthodontic tooth movement</intervention_name>
    <description>Surgical procedure
After local anesthesia, vertical interproximal incisions will be done under the interdental papilla, on the labial aspect of upper arch using a blade No. 15.
The incisions will be kept minimal.
The incisions go though the periosteum, which permit the blade to reach to the alveolar bone.
A Piezo surgical knife will be used to make the cortical alveolar incision through the gingival incisions to a depth of approximately 3mm.
As we will not use bone graft so we don't need use suturing after cortication.
We give patient antibiotic and analgesic cover.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  On the basis of the diagnosis of the malocclusion, individuals who have Class I and
             Class II malocclusions and requiring extraction of premolars and retraction of
             anterior teeth will be selected (maxillary/mandibular or both).

          -  Good oral hygiene, healthy gingiva and no evidence of bone loss as seen in radiograph.

          -  Healthy systemic conditions.

          -  No previous orthodontic treatment.

          -  Patient needs to be in permanent dentition (hence, we need to define their age range).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with systemic disease.

          -  Patient having any signs of active periodontal disease.

          -  Patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy.

          -  Persons taking medications that slows down bone metabolism.

          -  Craniofacial anomalies.
