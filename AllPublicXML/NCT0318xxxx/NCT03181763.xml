  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) impacts response to
      different types of memory in humans compared to placebo. MDMA is an experimental drug and is
      illegal to possess outside of research; when sold illegally it is referred to as Ecstasy or
      Molly (material supposedly containing MDMA). MDMA may make it easier to face unpleasant
      memories and reduce anxiety, and it may do so in part by influencing response to memories.
      This study will enroll healthy adults who will need to come in for three visits over four
      days. At visit 1, participants will undergo a 1-hour startle test. The startle test measures
      eye-blink response to loud sounds. After this, the participant will also view different
      colored shapes presented on a computer monitor. While watching the computer monitor, the
      participant will experience several brief blasts of air directed at the throat, while
      eye-blink is measured with sensors under the eye. The following day at visit 2, participants
      will be randomized to receive placebo or 100 mg MDMA and will complete tasks similar to the
      ones completed the previous day. The researchers will measure pulse, blood pressure and
      temperature once before and seven times after receiving MDMA or placebo, and study
      participants will complete a questionnaire about their experience. Two days after receiving
      MDMA or placebo, participants will return for a third visit to complete similar tasks to
      previous visits. This study will also measure sleep through a sleep diary and actigraphy,
      which is a device worn on the wrist like a watch that records movement during sleep and lets
      researchers see how much sleep a person is getting.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study that aims to evaluate the
      impact of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on startle response . MDMA is an
      experimental drug and is illegal to possess outside of research; when sold illegally it is
      referred to as Ecstasy or Molly (material supposedly containing MDMA). MDMA may make it
      easier to face unpleasant memories and reduce anxiety.

      This study will enroll healthy participants. At visit 1 all participants will undergo a
      1-hour startle test. Acoustic startle will be measured through assessing eye-blink response
      from the orbicularis oculi muscles in response to a 106 dB noise, using sensors under the
      eye. While watching the computer monitor, the participant will also experience several brief
      blasts of air directed at the throat. At visit 2, 24 hours later, participants will be
      randomized to receive 100 mg of MDMA or inactive placebo, after which they will undergo
      another startle task. The researchers will measure pulse, blood pressure and temperature once
      before and six times after receiving MDMA or placebo, and study participants will complete a
      questionnaire about their experience. At visit 3, participants will return for a final
      startle test and recall task. Sleep will be measured via self-report and Fittbit during study
      participation.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether MDMA affects startle response

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons aged 21 to 50.

          -  Ability to visually read and understand English language.

          -  Live within in metro Atlanta area

          -  Previously used MDMA in a recreational or research setting

          -  If a person is of childbearing potential (able to bear children), they must have a
             negative pregnancy test at study entry and prior to the Experimental Session. They
             must agree to use adequate birth control through 10 days after the last dose of MDMA.
             Adequate birth control methods include intrauterine device (IUD), injected or
             implanted hormonal methods, abstinence, oral hormones plus a barrier contraception or
             double barrier contraception. Two forms of contraception are required with any barrier
             method or oral hormones (i.e. condom plus diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus
             spermicide, oral hormonal contraceptives plus spermicide or condom). Not of
             childbearing potential is defined as permanent sterilization, postmenopausal, or male.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Upon review of medical or psychiatric history, have any current or past diagnosis that
             would be considered a risk to participating in the study.

          -  Are abusing illegal drugs.

          -  Current use of any psychoactive medications, including antidepressants, mood
             stabilizers, sedatives, stimulants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, or beta-blockers

          -  Are not able to give adequate informed consent.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, or clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia, as detected
             by electrocardiogram.

          -  Currently pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  History of acute angle glaucoma.

          -  Hearing impairment as assessed by audiometer; unable to detect tones below 40 dB in
             right or left ear.
