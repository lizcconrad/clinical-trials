  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effects of antithrombotic drugs (anticoagulant drugs or antiplatelet
      drugs) for prevention of ischaemic events in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with spontaneous ICH have an increased risk of recurrent ICH and they also have an
      increased risk of ischaemic diseases. Around 40-50% of patients use, or have an indication,
      for antithrombotic drugs at the time of ICH. However, little is known about the benefits and
      harms of using antithrombotic drugs for prevention of ischaemic events in patients who have
      had an ICH.

      There are only observational studies addressing this question. Because of the lack of
      randomised-controlled trials and the inconclusive findings of the observational studies,
      guidelines have variably endorsed both starting and avoiding antithrombotic drugs after ICH.

      The investigators therefore want to study the effect and safety of using antithrombotic drugs
      after ICH. Furthermore, since findings on MRI can be biomarkers for subsequent bleeding,
      there will also be performed a sub-study of the association between such findings on MRI and
      risk of recurrent ICH during treatment with antithrombotic drugs.

      Patients with indication for antithrombotic drugs who survive primary ICH, will be randomised
      to either starting or avoiding antithrombotic drugs.

      The follow up period is 2 years, and the primary effect variable is new ICH. The
      investigators will also evaluate functional outcome, death, intracranial haemorrhage,
      extracranial haemorrhage and ischemic events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient age ≥18 years.

          -  Spontaneous, primary ICH, of ≥1 day, but not more than 180 days after onset of
             qualifying ICH, i.e.:

               -  No preceding traumatic brain injury, based on history from the patient/witness of
                  spontaneous symptom onset, and brain imaging appearances consistent of
                  spontaneous ICH (i.e. any brain/bone/soft tissue appearances of trauma must have
                  occurred secondary to a spontaneous ICH)

               -  No 'secondary' or underlying structural cause (e.g. haemorrhagic transformation
                  of an ischaemic stroke, aneurysm, tumour, arteriovenous malformation, or
                  intracerebral venous thrombosis)

          -  Patient have indication for antithrombotic (i.e. anticoagulant or antiplatelet) drug
             for the prevention of ischaemic events, either antiplatelet drugs (for patients with
             vascular disease), or anticoagulant drug for patients with atrial fibrillation.

          -  Consent to randomisation from the patient (or personal / legal / professional
             representative if the patient does not have mental capacity).

          -  CT or MRI (for patients in MRI sub-study) is performed before randomisation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clear indication for antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment (e.g. prosthetic heart
             valves).

          -  Patient is pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing age and not taking
             contraception.

          -  For patients in MRI substudy: Contraindication for the brain MRI

          -  Malignancy with life expectancy less than 2 years
