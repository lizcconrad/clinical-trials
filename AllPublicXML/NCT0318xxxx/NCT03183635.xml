    <textblock>
      Stroke survivors have higher risks of falling compared to other healthy non-stroke adults.
      Stroke patients' balance can be trained by Kinect-based training that enable user friendly
      and interactive training.

    <description>It is used to evaluate balance-recovery in chronic stroke patients. Participants will wear a safety harness designed to prevent impact between body and floor, and they will be asked to stand on two force plates in standardized stance and lean forward with around 10% body weight supported by a cable attached to a release mechanism. Compensatory balance-recovery reactions will be evoked by the sudden release of the support cable, inducing a forward fall. Participants will be evaluated under three different conditions: no handrail, handrail on the unaffected side, and handrail on the affected side.</description>
