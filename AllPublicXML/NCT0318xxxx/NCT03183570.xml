      patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stanford University has developed a new PET tracer that selectively binds to integrin avb6, a
      cell surface receptor that is overexpressed in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Increased
      avb6 receptors on IPF lung tissue has been well documented, while its expression remains
      relatively non-existent in the healthy adult lung.

      The selected PET tracer [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 has shown promise identifying integrin avb6 in both
      preclinical and clinical studies at Stanford University. The investigators have demonstrated
      low [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 radiopharmaceutical uptake in the heart and lung region of healthy
      volunteers, which was an expected biodistribution (the normal tissue uptake of the
      radiopharmaceutical within the body) based on immunohistochemical staining of healthy lung
      tissue, which demonstrated the presence of minimal avb6 receptors in healthy lung tissue.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To evaluate the feasibility of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT scanning in patients with IPF.
      Feasibility will be measured by drawing regions of interest (ROI) around the lungs of
      participants with IPF and the lungs of healthy adult volunteers and comparing the calculated
      standarized uptake value maximum(s) (SUVmax).

      The tracer's physiologic biodistribution, safety and tolerability will also be studied.

    <description>The SUVmax in a lung with known IPF will be compared to the SUVmax in a known healthy lung. It is expected that the SUV max, which is a measurement of the maximum value of radiopharmaceutical uptake within the region of interest (ROI) in IPF will be higher than the SUV max in the healthy lung.</description>

    <measure>Time Activity Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>an estimated average of 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for blood time activity measurements taken at 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes after tracer injection, and then at every 30 minute intervals up to 2 hours after tracer injection will allow for tracer kinetic analysis. Tracer kinetic analysis shows radiopharmaceutical distribution from the blood to the tissues over time.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Study Completion (Safety and Tolerability)</measure>
    <time_frame>an estimated average of 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>EKG data, vital signs and laboratory data collected before IV injection of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 and after completion of the scan will allow the investigators to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the radiopharmaceutical. This will be measured as the number of patients who successfully completed the study.</description>
