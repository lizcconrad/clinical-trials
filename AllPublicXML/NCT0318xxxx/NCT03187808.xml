  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the immediate effects of using a single thoracic manipulation
      combined with special massage technique (RT technique) and single thoracic manipulation alone
      on pain level at rest, cervical range of motion, upper limb neurodynamic test, neck
      disability, and adverse effects in chronic mechanical neck pain patients.

      - The subjects will be recruited through posted advertisements, and announcements, to find
      the patients who meet the criteria of mechanical neck pain that is the pain provoked by
      sustained prolonged neck posture, neck movement or palpation of cervical musculature. The
      subjects will be screened by screening questionnaire, and then will be examined by a
      physiotherapist. All subjects will be required to sign an inform consent before participating
      to the study

      - The sample size was calculated by using the averaged of pain level at rest after treatment
      from the single thoracic manipulation combined with special massage group and single thoracic
      manipulation group, after the preliminary procedure that will be conducted with ten subjects
      per each group. After that, the variance was calculated by using the equation σ2 = (n1-1)s12
      + (n2-1)s22/(n1+n2)-2 and the result will be used for calculate the sample size. A drop out
      rate will be set as 20%. The effect size (∆), the significant level of lower than 0.05
      (Zα(0.05) = 1.96) and a power of test at 90 percent (Zβ(0.2)=1.28) was used to calculate in
      the equation as follow: n/group = &quot;2(Zα + Zβ)2σ2&quot; /&quot;∆2&quot;

    <description>A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used for recording level of pain at rest.</description>

    <measure>Cervical Range of Motion (CROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cervical Range of Motion (CROM) device (Performance Attainment Associates, USA) will be used to measure the cervical range of motion, including flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation.</description>

    <measure>Upper limb tension test 1 (ULTT1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The details of performing ULTT1 can be described as follow: the examiner will stand at side of tested limb with turn facing towards patient's head, and hold patient's one hand to control his or her thumb and fingers. Next, the examiner will use other hand to keep patient's shoulder in depression position to prevent the movement of shoulder girdle elevation during shoulder abduction. Then, the examiner will perform shoulder abduction with 110 degrees, forearm supination with the wrist and fingers extend, laterally rotation of shoulder, and elbow extension respectively. The last component of the test is the examiner asked patient turning their head to opposite side of tested arm. In current study, the researcher will measure the changing response of first sequence, that patient have a symptoms, to investigate that the intervention may affect the neural tension or not.</description>

    <description>The Neck Disability Index Thai version (NDI-TH) questionnaire (Appendix C), which is a reliable instrument to assess functional disability in neck pain patients with high internal consistency (ICC = 0.85) (Uthaikhup et al., 2011), will be used to assess the subjects' perceived disability level which can be show the impact of their neck pain to the daily living.</description>

    <description>The subjects, who were randomly allocated to single thoracic manipulation group, will receive the single thoracic manipulation interventions directly to both sides of zygapophyseal joints of T6-T7. Each subject will be asked to lie on prone position on an experimental table. After that, the researcher will mark on both sides of zygapophyseal joints of T6-T7. Then, the subject will be instructed to take a deep inhalation and exhalation. During the exhalation, the therapist will perform the single thoracic manipulation (screw thrust technique) at zygapophyseal joints of T6-T7. If the audio pop is not heard during the first attempt, the therapist will ask the subject to reposition and repeat the technique. The procedure will be performed for maximum of 2 attempts and within 2 minutes.</description>

    <description>The special massage technique or RT technique is a treatment that was developed by Puntumetakul and colleagues in 2013 (copyright registration number 314783). The subjects in this group will be asked to lie on side lying position with 90 degrees of hip flexion and 90 degrees of knee flexion. The researcher will perform the RT technique by press their thumb on the treatment lines beside the posterior vertebral line from level of inferior angle of scapula to the lowest rib for 5 seconds per point and 3 sets per treatment line (Figure 8). Total time of this procedure is approximately 2 minutes.</description>
