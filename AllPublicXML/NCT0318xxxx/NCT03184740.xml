  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Technological advances and non-invasive techniques to modulate brain function have been
      developed, including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). Basically, electrodes
      are placed on the brain regions to stimulate or inhibit it. Subsequently, a continuous
      electrical current (0.4-2 mA) is imposed, for a period of 3-20 minutes, to modify cortical
      excitability. Few are the research groups that work on the topic of primary dysmenorrhea and
      the use of tDCS as the focus of study. Preliminary studies associated the use of tDCS with
      pain reduction, but the outcomes of physical and behavioral function needs further
      investigation.
