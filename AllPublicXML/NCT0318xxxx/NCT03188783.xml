    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, or is life-threatening, or requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. The term &quot;life-threatening&quot; in the definition of &quot;serious&quot; refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event, not an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.</description>
