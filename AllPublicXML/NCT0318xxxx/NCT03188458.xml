  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to support the recommendation of vaccination of all pregnant
      women in Colombia with Diptheria, tetanus and pertussis (dTpa) by studying the transfer of
      pertussis specific IgG antibodies from mother to the child.

      This study will assess the immunogenicity in infants (at birth and just prior to primary
      pertussis vaccination [i.e. diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis [DTP] vaccination] administered
      at 8 weeks of age), of a single Boostrix booster dose administered to their mothers during
      the second or third trimester as per routine practice in Bogota, Colombia.
