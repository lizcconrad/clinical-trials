  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management has improved considerably in
      recent years with thrombolysis and more recently with mechanical thrombectomy (MT).
      Currently, mechanical thrombectomy can only be performed in stroke unit with an
      interventional neuroradiology center by experienced/qualified interventional
      neuroradiologists. In the Rhone area, only one hospital has the authorization to perform
      mechanical thrombectomy. Therefore, transferring directly eligible acute ischemic stroke
      patients for mechanical thrombectomy to this center constitutes an important stake of the
      triage of suspected acute ischemic stroke patients. Some validated scores for the
      identification of severe strokes and large vessel occlusion, including the Cincinnati
      prehospital stroke severity scale (CPSSS), appear to be relevant for pre-hospital use in
      order to identify patients potentially eligible for mechanical thrombectomy and address them
      to a stoke unit with interventional radiology center.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The Cincinnati prehospital stroke severity scale is composed of 3 items: 2 points if the patient has a deviation of the gaze, 1 point if the patient is not able to give the date and answer to a simple order such as closing the eyes or clenching the fist and 1 point if the patient presents a hemiplegia. The CPSSS score ranges from 0 to 4, highest value indicating the worst score. It will be considered positive if it is equal to 2 or more.
Performances will be evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values.</description>

    <description>Tests from Cincinnati prehospital stroke severity scale (CPSSS) will be carried out by the physician at emergency medical services on telephone call with firemen, paramedics or the emergency medical services team for any stroke suspicion that meets the criteria for inclusion. Emergency department physician will have to follow a standardized questionnaire to complete the different items of the score. The score will not be calculated by emergency department physician and will not influence the orientation and management of patients.
The final diagnosis will be the presence or absence of a large vessel occlusion. This diagnosis will be done on cerebral imaging by a neurologist.</description>
