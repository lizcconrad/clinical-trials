  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 22% of patients with elevated Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) MRI guided biopsy will not
      detect significant prostate cancer (PCA) (defined as either: Gleason score (GS) ≥ 3+4 or
      tertiary pattern 5, or final stage ≥ pT3a and/or pN1). Therefore this study evaluates the
      ability of [68Ga]PSMA PET/MRI to detect and localize significant primary PCA to accurately
      direct prostate needle biopsy using the Gleason score from the histology of the core biopsies
      as standard of truth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open label, single center, non-randomized, diagnostic study we plan to include 40 men
      with elevated PSA (ages 30-50 PSA &gt;2.5 ng/mL; ages 50-80 PSA &gt; 4ng/mL), which are assigned to
      a MRI guided biopsy.

      These patients will undergo one additional PET/MRI scan with [68Ga]PSMA within two to three
      weeks before the biopsy (Arm A), or in case of an unclear/negative MRI scan but positive
      biopsy two to three weeks after biopsy (Arm B). In Arm A a radiologist will delineate the
      suspected areas on (A) multiparametric magnetic resonance image (mpMRI) and a nuclear
      medicine physician will delineate and color code the suspicious areas on the PET/MRI: (B)
      [68Ga]PSMA. The images will be loaded into the BiopSee® system. Lesions positive on both
      modalities will be labeled as &quot;AB&quot;. Every suspicious lesion will be targeted with 3 cores. A
      maximum of 3 targets will be selected per patient.

      For arm B: PET/MRI results will be correlated with the template biopsy results.

      The data analysis of Arm A and Arm B will be identical. For the analysis the Gleason score
      from the histology of the core biopsies will serve as standard of truth.
