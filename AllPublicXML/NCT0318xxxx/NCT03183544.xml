  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Early detection of primary diseases and
      recurrence is crucial for patient counseling and management. Conventional imaging modalities
      (CT-MRI) are limited to detect recurrence.

      Choline-based PET/CT is currently widely used as primary staging tool in prostate cancer and
      in patients with suspicious recurrent disease.

      Compared to choline-based tracers, 68Ga-PSMA ligands have been shown to have a higher
      diagnostic efficacy and to increase the detection of metastases even at low PSA levels. The
      most widely used prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand is PSMA-11. A supplier,
      ANMI, has developed a kit formulation of PSMA-11 which will be test in this clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer represents the most common cancer in men and accounts for the third most
      common cancer death in men. Up to 50% of all patients undergoing radical prostatectomy or
      radiotherapy for primary treatment of prostate cancer develop biochemical recurrence. Early
      detection of primary diseases and recurrence is crucial for patient counseling and
      management. Conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) are limited because they focus on morphologic information such as
      lymph node size and tissue structure.

      Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a hybrid imaging technique
      combining functional and morphological information. Choline-based PET/CT is currently widely
      used as primary staging tool in prostate cancer and in patients with suspicious recurrent
      disease. Compared to choline-based tracers, 68Ga-PSMA ligands have been shown to have a
      higher diagnostic efficacy and to increase the detection of metastases even at low PSA
      levels. The most widely used prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand is PSMA-11. A
      supplier, ANMI, has developed a kit formulation of PSMA-11 which can be labeled at room
      temperature by direct incubation of the kit with the gallium-68 eluted from a 68Ge/68Ga
      generator.
