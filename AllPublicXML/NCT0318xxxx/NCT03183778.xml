  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proof-of-concept controlled-feeding study is to determine whether
      patiromer (Veltassa®, Relypsa, Inc., Redwood City, CA) can be used to maintain normal serum
      potassium concentrations in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who are transitioned to a
      plant-rich diet.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stages 3B-4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15-44 mL/min/1.73m2,
             not treated with dialysis)

          -  No prior treatment with patiromer

          -  Mild hyperkalemia (potassium 5.1 to &lt;6.5 mEq/L) on one of the last two blood tests

          -  No prior episodes of moderate-severe hyperkalemia (potassium ≥6.5 mEq/L) in the past 6
             months

          -  Deemed appropriate for the intervention by the patient's nephrologist, considering the
             patient's prognosis, cognition and pending treatments (e.g., dialysis)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Change in medications that alter potassium homeostasis (e.g., RAAS inhibitors,
             diuretics, β-blockers) in the last month

          -  Diagnosed with bowel diseases or syndromes (e.g., bowel obstruction, major GI surgery,
             short-bowel syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic
             diarrhea)

          -  Dietary restrictions (e.g., allergies) or otherwise unable/unwilling to adhere to
             study diets (excludes dietary restrictions on high-potassium foods)

          -  Pregnant (females) or planning to become pregnant (males and females) during the study
