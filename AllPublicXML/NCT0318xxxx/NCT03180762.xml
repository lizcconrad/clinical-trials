  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-64140284
      versus placebo after single oral dose administration (ascending dose levels) under fasted
      condition, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of JNJ-64140284 in plasma, cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) and urine after single oral dose administration and to investigate the effect of
      food (high fat/high calorie) on the PK of JNJ-64140284 following single oral dose
      administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part 1 and 2:

        - Healthy male participants between 18 and 58 years of age, inclusive

        Part 1, 2 and 3:

        - Participants must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
        screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are
        outside the normal reference ranges, retesting of an abnormal lab value(s) that may lead to
        exclusion will be allowed once during the screening phase. The participant may be included
        only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not
        clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the population under study
        according to both the investigator and to the Janssen Safety Physician, are acceptable

        Part 3:

          -  Healthy male and female participants between 59 and 75 years of age, inclusive

          -  Participants must be healthy and medically stable on the basis of clinical laboratory
             tests (at screening) and physical and neurological examination (at screening and at
             admission to the clinical unit). If the participant is medically stable with
             medication, inclusion can be allowed on a case by case basis with written agreement of
             the sponsor's responsible safety physician

          -  Women must not be of childbearing potential (must be postmenopausal with amenorrhea
             for at least 12 months) or permanently sterilized (for example, tubal occlusion,
             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Part 1, 2 and 3:

          -  Participants with a history of or current significant medical illness including (but
             not limited to) cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematological disease,
             lipid abnormalities, bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, renal or
             hepatic insufficiency, thyroid disease, Parkinson's disease, infection, or any other
             illness that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant

          -  Participants with a serology positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies

          -  Participants with a clinically significant acute illness within 7 days prior to study
             drug administration

          -  Donation of 1 or more units (approximately 450 milliliter [mL]) of blood or acute loss
             of an equivalent amount of blood within 90 days prior to study drug administration

        Part 3:

        - participants having a contraindication for spinal puncture including:

          1. A relevant history of lower back pain or scoliosis or kyphosis and/or major (lumbar)
             back surgery (microdiscectomy is allowed) in the opinion of the investigator

          2. Allergy to local anesthetics and/or iodine/disinfectants

          3. Clinically significant abnormal values for coagulation at screening

          4. Use of aspirin (even low dose) within 5 days prior to lumbar puncture

          5. Use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) within 12 hours prior to lumbar puncture

          6. Use of any anticoagulant treatment (besides LMWH described above) within 1 week prior
             to lumbar puncture

          7. Has a topical infection or local dermatological condition at the puncture site prior
             to puncture

          8. Has papilloedema or signs of increased intracranial pressure based on fundoscopy at
             screening
