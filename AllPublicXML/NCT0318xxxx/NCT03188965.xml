  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ATR(ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein) inhibitor BAY1895344 is developed for
      the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. The purpose of the
      proposed trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAY1895344, and to identify the
      maximum tolerated dose of BAY1895344 that could be safely given to cancer patients. Further,
      the response of the cancer to the treatment will be determined.
