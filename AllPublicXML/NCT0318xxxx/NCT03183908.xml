  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the study is to compare safety and immunogenicity of adjuvanted
      inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) (FLUAD) versus High-Dose inactivated influenza (Fluzone
      High Dose) vaccine in ≥65 years (20% aged ≥80 years). A prospective, randomized, blinded
      clinical trial that will be conducted during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 influenza seasons.
      During each season, approximately 220 older adults will be enrolled at Duke University
      Medical Center and 140 older adults at Boston University Medical Center. Eligible subjects
      will be randomized to receive either adjuvanted influenza vaccine or High-Dose influenza
      vaccine. All subjects will receive vaccine and provide a blood draw at Visit 1, and then
      return for a second blood draw without vaccination about 4 weeks later to assess for
      influenza antibody titers. A subset of 100 subjects at Duke will provide a third blood draw 6
      months post-vaccination to assess for waning of influenza antibody titers. Subjects will
      record the occurrence of local and systemic reactions (including fever, pain, tenderness,
      swelling, redness, general systemic systems), unsolicited adverse events, medical care
      utilization, and changes in medications over 8 days following vaccination. In addition,
      serious adverse events and events of clinical interest will be assessed through 42 days
      post-vaccination. Quality of life will be assessed 8 days post-vaccination and vaccine
      perceptions surveys will be administered 8 days and 4 weeks post-vaccination.
