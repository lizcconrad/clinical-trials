  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thanks to improved surgical techniques, postoperative management and immunosuppressive
      therapies, an increasing number of children benefit from renal, hepatic, cardiac and
      pulmonary transplantation. Infection is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in
      these patients, particularly due to vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccination is one of the
      effective means of reducing infection-related mortality in these particularly vulnerable
      children. It is mostly well-tolerated, but all the more effective as it is performed early
      before transplantation, at best during a dedicated consultation, according to a vaccine
      scheme adapted to the immunocompromised child. In the almost constant absence of clinical
      efficacy data in populations of immunocompromised individuals, vaccine efficacy is most often
      indirectly estimated by immunogenicity, using protective correlates obtained by extrapolation
      in immunocompetent individuals.

      Primary objective: To estimate the immunogenicity of vaccines recommended in children
      transplanted or candidate for renal, hepatic, cardiac and pulmonary transplantation, using
      serological titers measurements before and after a vaccine injection for: influenza,
      pneumococcus, chicken pox, measles, tetanus, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.

      These serological titers will be compared to correlates of protection existing for each
      valency.

      The evolution of serological titers will be described during the first year. The vaccination
      will be carried out within the routine care, according to the recommendations.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  describe and quantify the vaccination status of patients

        -  describe the vaccination coverage of their entourage

        -  evaluate the tolerance and efficacy of vaccines
