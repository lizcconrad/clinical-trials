  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paravertebral Block (PVB) was shown to be a successful and useful technique of anesthesia and
      analgesia. Its effect was evident in thoracic and abdominal surgeries. In the setting of
      appendectomy, somatic PVB has been used for pediatric patients. It was shown to decrease
      opioid consumption and provide prolonged pain relief. Hence, it would be beneficial to
      examine the analgesic effect of PVB on appendectomy in adult patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing appendectomy will be randomly allocated into two equal groups using the
      sealed envelope technique. All patients will receive general anesthesia (GA). Patients in
      group I will receive two PVB injections at levels T12-L1 and L1-L2 using anesthetic mixture,
      while patients in Group II will receive placebo.

      Paravertebral Block Technique Unilateral right side nerve stimulator-guided PVB is performed
      while patients are in the left lateral decubitis position. The appropriate levels for the PVB
      are determined by palpation of the spinous processes. An intervertebral line is drawn at the
      appropriate levels and the injection site is marked 2.5 cm lateral to the midline. After
      aseptic preparation of the skin, 1 mL 1% lidocaine is infiltrated at the injection sites. A
      21-G nerve stimulation needle (Stimuplex; B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) is advanced 1-2 cm
      perpendicularly to the skin using a nerve stimulating current of 2.5-5.0 mA, while closely
      watching for contractions of the abdominal muscles. The tip of the needle is adjusted to
      maintain muscle contractions while reducing the stimulating current to approximately 0.5-0.6
      mA.

      4 mL of the local anaesthetic mixture is injected at each injection site. Each 20 mL of the
      local anaesthetic mixture contains: 8mL lidocaine 2%, 8 mL lidocaine 2% with epinephrine
      5µg/mL and 4 mL bupivacaine 0.5%.
