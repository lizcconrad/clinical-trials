  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two period study design consisting of a 6-month, randomized, double-blind
      placebo-controlled treatment (period 1) followed by a 6-month, open-label treatment (period
      2).

      Primary safety objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of REGN2477 in
      male and female patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP).

      Primary efficacy objective of the study is to assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on
      the change from baseline in heterotopic ossification (HO) in patients with FOP, as determined
      by 18-NaF uptake in HO lesions by positron emission tomography (PET) and in total volume of
      HO lesions by computed tomography (CT).

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on the change from baseline in HO, as
           determined by the number of new HO lesions identified by 18F-NaF PET or by CT

        -  To assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on the change from baseline in 18F-NaF
           standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) of individual active HO site(s) by PET

        -  To compare the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on pain due to FOP, as measured by the
           area under the curve (AUC) for pain based on daily numeric rating scale (NRS) scores

        -  To assess the effect of REGN2477 versus placebo on the change from baseline in
           biochemical markers of bone formation

        -  To characterize the concentrations of total activin A at baseline and over time
           following the first dose of study drug

        -  To characterize the concentration-time profile (pharmacokinetics [PK]) of REGN2477 in
           patients with FOP

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of REGN2477

             flare-ups; or worsening of joint function, or radiographic progression of heterotopic
             ossifications (increase in site or number of HO lesions) with/without being associated
             with flare-up episodes.

          5. Willing and able to undergo PET and CT imaging procedures and other procedures as
             defined in this study.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant concomitant illness or history of significant illness such as, but not
             limited to cardiac, renal, rheumatologic, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrine,
             metabolic or lymphatic disease, that in the opinion of the study investigator might
             confound the results of the study or pose additional risk to the patient by their
             participation in the study.

          2. Use of bisphosphonate within 1 year of screening.

          3. Concurrent participation in another interventional clinical study, or a
             non-interventional study with radiographic measures or invasive procedures (e.g.
             collection of blood or tissue samples). Participation in the FOP Connection Registry
             or other studies in which patients complete study questionnaires are allowed.

          4. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          5. Male and women of childbearing potential patients who are unwilling to practice highly
             effective contraception.
