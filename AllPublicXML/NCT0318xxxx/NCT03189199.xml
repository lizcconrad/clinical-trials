    <textblock>
      Safety surveillance on Chinese Medicine injection is an important problem that needs to be
      sorted out ,because in mainland China hospitals ,Chinese Medicine Injection are used widely.
      Population for taking medicine characteristics,the incidence rate of ADR and other uncertain
      factors influence can few be found now.A registry study for Dazhuhongjingtian injection
      safety surveillance with 3000 patients will be conducted from June.2017 to
      Dec.2019.Eligibility criteria Patients who will use Dazhuhongjingtian injection in 4 selected

    <time_frame>The registry procedure will last about 3 years only for patients using Dazhuhongjingtian</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be measured and assessed at the time Dazhuhongjingtian is administered to them until they discharge. Patients using Dazhuhongjingtian will be registered on a registration form including disease background, Dazhuhongjingtian's administration, and extraction information from hospital information system. An adverse event or drug adverse reaction form also will be used to describe any doubted symptoms or signs from patients. A judgment will be made by doctors directly and a further analysis will be conducted by researchers to decide those potential side effects of Dazhuhongjingtian.</description>
