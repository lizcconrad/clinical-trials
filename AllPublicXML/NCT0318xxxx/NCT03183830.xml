  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the potential anti-inflammatory effects of inorganic dietary nitrate in
      a model of acute inflammation relevant to cardiovascular disease (CVD).

      Green leafy vegetables contain large amounts of inorganic nitrate, and research suggests that
      this nitrate has beneficial effects on the heart and blood vessels. We have shown
      anti-inflammatory benefits of inorganic nitrate in pre-clinical models of CVD, early
      mechanistic studies in healthy volunteers, and in patients with hypertension,
      hypercholesterolaemia and those suffering acute heart attacks that translate to
      cardiovascular benefits. Understanding the mechanism of how this is achieved may open new
      therapeutic options in CVD.

      We therefore wish to explore whether inorganic nitrate might alter inflammatory responses
      using a blister-model of acute skin inflammation. This study is a randomised control trial
      with parallel limbs where half of patients receive nitrate-rich beetroot juice, and the other
      half a nitrate-deplete placebo beetroot juice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is an important substance produced continuously by all blood vessels. It is
      thought to maintain health, in part, by preventing and suppressing inflammatory responses. NO
      is normally generated at the endothelium by a group of important enzymes called nitric oxide
      synthases. However, in chronic inflammatory states such as those seen in cardiovascular
      disease (CVD), the endothelial isoform of the enzyme becomes dysfunctional and produces less
      NO, and the NO that is produced is scavenged by the products of oxidative stress.

      Giving NO back to the blood vessel to mediate its beneficial effects is not straightforward.
      However, we have shown that dietary inorganic nitrate, both as a capsule and a dietary
      intervention with nitrate-rich beetroot juice, has a number of beneficial effects in CVD
      states. This beneficial effect is mediated through it's endogenous conversion from nitrate to
      nitrite in the mouth, and then from nitrite to NO via nitrite reductases within the blood
      vessel. We have shown benefit of inorganic nitrate in pre-clinical models of CVD, early
      mechanistic studies in healthy volunteers, and anti-inflammatory benefits in patients with
      hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and those suffering acute heart attacks.

      We wish to prospectively investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of inorganic nitrate using
      a cantharidin-induced blister model of acute inflammation. This allows us to investigate the
      innate immune response to an acute insult and characterise the inflammatory and resolution
      phases. Cantharidin is commonly used as a vesicant in the treatment of plantar verrucae and
      molluscum contagiosum, and experimentally to study the pharmacokinetics of drugs within the
      interstitial space.

      This will be a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel limb study supplementing 24 healthy
      volunteers with dietary-rich beetroot juice versus nitrate-deplete placebo juice, to
      investigate blister formation, and inflammatory cell recruitment and activation.

    <description>Individuals will receive a once daily dose of dietary nitrate in the form of a beetroot juice concentrate (70mL) containing ~5-6mmol inorganic nitrate (James White Drinks, UK) for 12 +/- 2 weeks. This dose has been chosen due to several reports demonstrating efficacy in patients with cardiovascular disease.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The placebo control is an identical juice from which the nitrate anion has been removed using a standard anion exchange resin. Visually there is no detectable difference between the juices and previous spectral, ion concentration, sugar levels, ascorbate analysis and taste testing has confirmed no differences in colour and constituents. The process to extract nitrate from the juice is the same technique used to remove inorganic nitrate from general drinking water supplies, and has been approved for use by Ethics Committees. The nitrate-free juice is not considered a drug or medicine, and is classified as a foodstuff.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers

          -  Caucasian

          -  Willing to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects unwilling to consent

          -  Non-caucasian volunteers

          -  History of any serious illnesses, including recent infections or trauma

          -  Subjects taking systemic medication (other than the oral contraceptive pill)

          -  Subjects with self-reported use of mouthwash or tongue scrapers

          -  Subjects with recent or current antibiotic use

          -  Subjects with a history, or recent treatment of (within last 3 months) any oral
             condition (excluding caries), including gingivitis, periodontitis and halitosis

          -  Subjects with a history of skin conditions

          -  Subjects with and history of allergic reaction to any topical application

          -  Subjects with any history of a bloodborne infectious disease such Hepatitis B or C
             virus, or HIV

        We have excluded non-caucasian volunteers due to a small incidence of prolonged skin
        hyperpigmentation in non-caucasians in previous studies.

        We have excluded subjects using mouthwash/tongue scrapers and oral conditions as we know
        that the nitrate ingested from the diet (i.e. beetroot juice) is converted to nitrite by
        the commensal bacteria in the back of the mouth. Subjects who have oral conditions or use
        mouthwash/tongue scrapers would have differences in oral bacterial populations, both in
        number and species. Therefore, by excluding these subjects, we will try and keep this
        variable as similar as possible in both groups.
