  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stimulation of the spinal cord may induce the growth and reorganization of neural pathways
      leading to the re-animation of paralyzed limbs. Growing evidence indicates that electrical
      spinal cord stimulation improves motor functions immediately via modulating the excitability
      of spinal circuitry in patients with spinal cord injury. Recently, a novel, non-invasive,
      well-tolerated and painless transcutaneous electrical stimulation strategy was demonstrated
      to be effective for improving lower limb motor function in healthy individuals and in
      patients with spinal cord injury. The investigators hypothesize that transcutaneous cervical
      electrical stimulation can enhance conscious motor control and functions of hand and arm via
      neuromodulation of spinal network.

      This study is a prospective efficacy trial of transcutaneous cervical electrical stimulation
      for improving upper limb function in patients with traumatic or degenerative cervical spinal
      cord injury. Transcutaneous electrical spinal stimulation device is not regulated by the
      United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of spinal cord injury.

      The interventions include either transcutaneous cervical spinal electrical stimulation
      combined with physical therapy or physical therapy only. The order of the interventions will
      be randomized for each subject in a delayed cross-over design. Total duration of the study is
      6 months, including 4 weeks baseline measurements, 8 weeks intervention and 12 weeks
      follow-up. Both immediate and lasting improvements in hand motor and sensory function via
      transcutaneous cervical spinal stimulation will be evaluated.

    <description>GRASSP is a clinical impairment measurement tool that quantifies hand impairment caused by cervical spinal cord injury. The tool measures three domains of function, including strength (manual muscle strength testing), sensibility (Semmes Weinstein monofilament sensation test) and prehension (ability and performance to generate various grasp and pinch movements using water bottle, jar, key, pegs, coins and nuts).</description>
