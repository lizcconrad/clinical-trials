  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the progression-free survival of patients with
      surgically staged, Stage I-II papillary serous, clear cell, or endometrioid carcinomas with
      high-intermediate risk factors treated by vaginal cuff brachytherapy followed by
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive radiation therapy. Treatment will be delivered either by LDR or HDR
      brachytherapy. The treatment plan must be started at the time of enrollment. The vaginal
      brachytherapy should be started within 4 weeks of surgery (within 2 weeks of enrollment), in
      order to avoid delays in initiation of systemic therapy, which should start on post-operative
      day 21. The dose will be prescribed to the vaginal (mucosal) surface as defined at the
      surface of the applicators. Following vaginal cuff radiation therapy, all patients will
      receive chemotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have undergone hysterectomy. Bilateral salpingooophorectomy is
             strongly encouraged but not mandatory. Pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy are
             optional, but strongly encouraged. Peritoneal washing are optional. If either a
             bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or nodal dissection was not performed, post-operative
             pre-treatment CT/MRI is required. All patients will be staged according to the FIGO
             2009 staging system and with endometrial carcinoma (endometrioid types) confined to
             the corpus uteri or with endocervical glandular involvement. Patients with Stage II
             endometrial carcinoma with cervical stromal invasion. Patients with serous or clear
             cell histology (with or without other high-intermediate risk factors) are eligible if
             disease is uterine confined. Adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic and neurologic
             function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with recurrent disease. Greater than 12 weeks elapsed from surgery to
             enrollment. Prior pelvic or abdominal radiation therapy. Known hypersensitivity to any
             component of study treatment. Active pregnancy or lactation. Treatment for prior
             malignancy in the last 3 years.
