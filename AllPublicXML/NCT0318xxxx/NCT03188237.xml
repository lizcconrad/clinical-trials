  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is a program evaluation of a group care delivery model designed for pregnant
      women that was implemented as a pilot project in Teso District, Kenya in 2012.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will carry out a pre/post evaluation of this program comparing maternal and
      child health indicators collected at the facility and at 10 comparison facilities in the year
      prior to implementation (2012) and throughout the duration of the program (2013-2014). They
      will also analyze program attendance records, anonymous exit surveys, and training records.

    <intervention_model_description>AfyaJamii is a group care model in pregnancy facilitated by Government of Kenya (GOK) Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) and Ministry of Health (MOH) nurses. Pregnant women are assigned to specific care groups according to their Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) and meet 3 times antenatally and 4 times postnatally. These groups are meant to provide women with antenatal and postnatal care, peer support, and knowledge to improve their health outcomes and the health outcomes of their infants. This model of group prenatal and postnatal care is being evaluated as an alternative to the existing policy of focused antenatal care that individualizes care to a single woman at a time.</intervention_model_description>
