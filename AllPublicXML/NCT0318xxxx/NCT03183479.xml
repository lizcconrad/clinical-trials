  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic blood products transfusions are often necessary to treat perioperative bleeding in
      patients undergoing complex scoliosis surgeries. A prospective, randomized trial is designed
      to evaluate if the infusion of fibrinogen concentrate may reduce allogeneic blood transfusion
      in patients undergoing scoliosis surgery. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to
      treatment group (fibrinogen concentrate infusion) and control group (normal saline infusion),
      and functional fibrinogen will be measured to guide the infusion of fibrinogen concentrate.
      Perioperative blood loss, intraoperative blood loss, and the amount of perioperative
      allogeneic blood transfusion will be compared between the two groups to determine the effect
      of fibrinogen concentrate infusion.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the
      effects of fibrinogen concentrate infusion on perioperative blood loss and the amount of
      perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing scoliosis surgery.

      Recently, the inherent risks of blood, along with the continued rise in blood costs,
      activated the development and use of alternatives to blood transfusion. Fibrinogen
      concentrate may limit postoperative bleeding and lead to a significant reduction in
      allogeneic blood products transfusions in cardiac surgery and craniosynostosis surgery.
      However, the effect of fibrinogen concentrate in scoliosis surgery is still uncertain.
      Therefore, a prospective, randomized trial is designed to evaluate if the infusion of
      fibrinogen concentrate may reduce allogeneic blood transfusion in patients undergoing
      scoliosis surgery.

      Patients older than 12y/o with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis planed for elective posterior
      scoliosis correction surgery will be enrolled for this study after informed consent. Patients
      will be randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group. Functional fibrinogen will
      be measured using TEG 5000 (Haemoscope Corp, IL, USA) at the start of surgery and the results
      of FLEV and MA will be recorded. When the estimated blood loss reaches 15% of estimated blood
      volume, a second functional fibrinogen will be measured and the patients in treatment group
      will receive fibrinogen concentrate (FIBRORAAS, Shanghai RAAS Blood Products Co, Ltd,
      Shanghai, China) 30mg kg-1. For safety concern, the maximum fibrinogen concentrate
      administration for each individual shall not exceed either 2g or the results calculated based
      on functional fibrinogen measurements: fibrinogen concentrate dose (g) = (FLEVintraop [mg/dL]
      - FLEVpreop [mg/dL])×bodyweight (kg)×0.0007. Patients in the control group will receive
      placebo treatment with normal saline. After 15 minutes from fibrinogen concentrate or placebo
      administration, a third functional fibrinogen measurement will be performed to assess the
      effect of treatment. The following treatment will be guaranteed by the standard protocol in
      the presence of ongoing bleeding.

      Data includes all the demographics, preoperative conditions, procedure details,
      intraoperative data, and outcome measurements will be recorded. Additional data including
      FLEV and MA value, as well as fibrinogen values both preoperatively and at the arrival at
      wards. The primary endpoint of this study will be the total perioperative blood loss, and
      secondary endpoints will include: total intraoperative blood loss, total units of
      perioperative allogeneic pRBCs transfused, total volume of FFP transfused, total PLT units
      transfused. Safety endpoints will include operative mortality and perioperative
      thromboembolic complications.

    <masking_description>After randomization, the unblinded independent investigator will be in charge of fibrinogen concentrate (drug) or placebo preparation, which will be performed in a laboratory next to the operating room. When the patient meets the inclusion criteria and is enrolled in the study, the functional fibrinogen tests will be done in the same laboratory by the same researcher, and drug or placebo will be prepared in sterile bags with opaque covers afterwards. Fibrinogen concentrate will be diluted in 100mL of sterile water or an equivalent volume of 0.9% saline solution as placebo and will be delivered to the operating room by the investigator. The anesthesiologists, the surgical staff, and the patients will all be blinded.</masking_description>
