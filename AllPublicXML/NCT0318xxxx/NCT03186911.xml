  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a phone screen and then one laboratory session. After completing
      in-person screening assessments, eligible participants will complete additional
      questionnaires. Participants will then choose an e-liquid flavor to use for the rest of the
      session. Participants will then sample two e-liquids that vary in nicotine content from
      little or no nicotine to a moderate level of nicotine, and questionnaires evaluating the
      subjective effects of each one. Participants will then complete a preference assessment where
      they choose between the two e-liquids. Participants will be blind to the nicotine contents.
