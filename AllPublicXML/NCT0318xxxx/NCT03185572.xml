  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension is a common complication of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD). It is reported that over half of COPD patients develop pulmonary hypertension. COPD
      and pulmonary hypertension may have pathological or genetics interactions so that patients
      having both disorders tend to have poor prognosis. Echocardiography is widely used to detect
      pulmonary hypertension, but it's not accurate enough. Therefore, high-quality data reflecting
      the prevalence, disease course and outcome of pulmonary hypertension in COPD is very limited
      in China. The aim of the study is to detect pulmonary hypertension with right heart
      catheterization, describe its outcome in Chinese COPD patients and explore the underlying
      interaction mechanism.
