  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous Paravertebral block (PVB) was reported to provide less episodes of hypotension
      than continuous thoracic epidural block (TEB). The maintenance of optimal tissue perfusion is
      essential for esophageal anastomosis in patients undergoing oesophagectomy. the aim of this
      study is to compare Hemodynamic effect of continous PVB compared to TEB , in patient
      undergoing oesophagectomy with laparoscopy and thoracotomy.

    <description>echoguided thoracic continous paravertebral block was placed before the surgery.
A bolus of 5 ml of ropivacaine 0.2% and 10µg of Sufentanil was injected in the catheter at the end of the abdominal time. A continuous infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% at 4ml/h was then initiated at the thoracic time. Postoperative patient-controlled analgesia consisted on an infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% at 6ml/h and a permitted bolus of 4ml every 15min as required.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ASA score 1 to 3

          -  oesophagectomy : abdominal time with laparoscopy ans thoracic time with thoracotomy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnancy

          -  Uncooperative patient

          -  patient refusal

          -  Coagulopathy

          -  allergy to local anesthetic

          -  Psychological Disorders

          -  Failure to install the epidural or paravertebral catheter. The patient will therefore
             be excluded secondarily but will be able to benefit from an alternative technique for
             the management of his pain.
