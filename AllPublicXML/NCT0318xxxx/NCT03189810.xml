  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high prevalence of cannabis and other substance use disorders are a major barrier to
      recovery in people with schizophrenia. Moreover, schizophrenia patients have significant
      deficits in cognitive function, which may be exacerbated by cannabis use. Complicating these
      problems is the lack of evidence-based treatments for co-morbid cannabis use disorders (CUDs)
      in schizophrenia; there are no established pharmacotherapies. Therefore, this study is
      investigating the effects of high-frequency (20Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) on cannabis use disorder and cognitive function in patients with co-morbid
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder. The proposed study would be the first randomized,
      double-blind, sham controlled trial of rTMS in patients with schizophrenia and co-morbid CUD.
      A total of N=40 schizophrenia smokers with co-morbid cannabis use disorder will be assigned
      to either active rTMS (N=20) or sham rTMS (N=20) as a treatment regimen of 5X/week treatment
      for four consecutive weeks. All participants will receive weekly behavioral therapy for 4
      weeks. The investigators predict that active rTMS will be well-tolerated and superior to sham
      rTMS for the treatment of CUD in schizophrenia.

    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks (Day 28) and 8 weeks (Follow-Up Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>Urine samples at Day 28 and Follow-Up (Day 56) will be sent to CAMH's clinical laboratory for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis to obtain quantitative THC-COOH and creatinine concentrations. Thus abstinence will also be assessed with combined quantitative urinalysis (&lt;50 ng/ml) and TLFB assessment.</description>

    <description>The cognitive battery (Day 28) will include the primary outcome of verbal memory (assessed by HVLT) and will be compared to baseline (Day 1) performance. Cortical inhibition will also be assessed and compared between Day 1 and Day 28 performance.</description>
