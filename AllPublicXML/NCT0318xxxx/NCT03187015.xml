  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Entinostat on the bioavailability of
      Midazolam.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of a single oral dose of entinostat on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of midazolam in healthy subjects.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of combined administration
      of entinostat and midazolam in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, 2 period, fixed-sequence study.

      Twenty-two (22), healthy, adult male subjects will be enrolled; additional subjects may be
      enrolled to replace discontinued subjects, at the discretion of the Sponsor.

      Screening of subjects will occur within 28 prior to the first dose.

      On Day 1 of Period 1, a single oral dose of midazolam will be administered followed by PK
      sampling for midazolam and 1 OH midazolam for 24 hours.

      On Day 1 of Period 2, a single oral dose of midazolam will be administered 0.75 hours after a
      single oral dose of entinostat. Following midazolam dosing on Day 1 of Period 2, PK samples
      for midazolam and 1 OH midazolam will be taken for 24 hours.

      There will be a washout period of at least 7 days between the dosing in Period 1 and
      entinostat dose in Period 2.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by repeated clinical and laboratory
      evaluations.
