  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of treating acute ischemic
      stroke patients with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, paralleled study. 40 patients will be separated into two
      groups, and receive basic treatment (Aspirin Tablet). Patients in experimental group will
      receive hUC-MSC once a month, total 3 times. After the treatment, investigator will have
      follow-up visit for 6 months, evaluate the security and efficacy of hUC-MSC.
