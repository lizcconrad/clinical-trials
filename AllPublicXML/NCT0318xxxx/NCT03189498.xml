    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and systemic
      exposure of JNJ-63549109 and JNJ-64167896 after a single oral dose of JNJ-64041575 in adult
      participants with various degrees of renal function (mildly, moderately, or severely
      impaired, or end-stage renal disease [ESRD] with or without hemodialysis) compared to adult
      participants with normal renal function.

             extremes included, and a body weight not less than 50.0 kg, inclusive, at screening

          -  Contraceptive use by female participants, male participants and their female partners
             should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods

             proposed in these inclusion criteria in the protocol

        Participants with normal renal function (Group 1):

        -Participant must have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &gt;= 90 milliliter per

        Participants with renal impairment (Groups 2 to 4):

        - The following classifications of renal function are used: Mild renal impairment (eGFR
        greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 60 to less than [&lt;] 90 mL/min), Moderate renal impairment
        (eGFR &gt;= 30 to &lt;60 mL/min), Severe renal impairment (eGFR &gt;=15 to &lt;30 mL/min)

        Participants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with or without hemodialysis (Group 5):

          -  Participant must have an eGFR &lt;15 mL/min if not on hemodialysis

          -  Participant on hemodialysis treatment must have been on the same hemodialysis regimen

             with the exception of renal impairment

          -  Participant has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (example,

             protocol-specified assessments

          -  Participant with a history of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not
             limited to, sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy diagnosed in previous
             studies with experimental drugs

          -  Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to JNJ-64041575 or
