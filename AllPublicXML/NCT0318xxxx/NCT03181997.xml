  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As for today, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is indicated only in symptomatic
      patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) at high surgical risk. As cancer therapy improves,
      some AS patients suffering active malignancy (including advanced metastatic diseases) may be
      more endangered by their untreated valvular disease than their oncological disease. Among
      these patients, TAVI may be indicated before cancer related surgery or cardiotoxic
      anti-cancer therapy in order to achieve better anti-cancer therapy outcomes. Individualized
      life expectancy assumptions should be evaluated by the heart team in the clinical
      decision-making process as an essential factor in weighing the risk-benefit ratio for
      oncologic patients undergoing TAVI. A multicenter, international TAVI in Oncology Patients
      with AS (TOP-AS) registry was designed to collect data on patients with an active malignancy
      and severe AS undergoing TAVI. The aim of the study is to evaluate the outcomes, benefits and
      risks of oncology patients undergoing TAVI, mainly the patients' survival and cause of death
      and also the interactions between the valvular and the oncologic conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TAVI program was initiated in Rabin Medical Center in 2008 and the institutional review
      board approved the prospective collection of our TAVI Database (i.e. RECORD TAVI). During
      these years, several oncology patients were treated with TAVI. Also, in daily practice a few
      asymptomatic AS patients in whom TAVI was indicated before cancer related surgery /
      cardiotoxic anti-cancer therapy underwent TAVI.

      This study will initiate a multicenter, international registry designed to collect data on
      TAVI in cancer patients in correspondence to medical records within each center. Data will be
      collected retrospectively for cases performed before registry initiation and prospectively
      thereafter. All inconsistencies regarding data collection will be resolved directly with
      local investigators and on-site data monitoring. Patients' inclusion approval is by a local
      ethics committee in each center.

      Saving Data: Data will be recorded in Excel table; each center and patient will receive a
      unique code so the data file will be anonymous.
