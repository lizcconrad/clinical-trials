  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center clinical trial will evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy of hybrid
      fractional 2940 nm and 1470 lasers for improvement of symptoms of urinary incontinence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both 2940 nm Er:YAG (Erbium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) and 1470 nm diode lasers are
      cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ablation, vaporization, coagulation of
      soft tissue and for skin resurfacing. Fractional delivery of laser is a well-established
      method that stimulates tissue remodeling in the dermis while leaving the surrounding tissue
      intact in order to decrease healing time. The layers of skin and vaginal mucosal tissue
      exhibit similarities that suggest the clinical results seen with skin resurfacing may be
      translated to the vaginal tissue. Improved vaginal tissue tone and increased collagen
      formation in the lamina propria beneath the urethra may lead to improved urinary control.
      This multi-centered, 18-month prospective clinical trial will determine the safety and
      long-term effectiveness of hybrid fractional 2940 nm and 1470 nm lasers (Hybrid Fractional
      Laser) as an alternative non-surgical, non-hormonal treatment for improvement of symptoms of
      urinary incontinence.
