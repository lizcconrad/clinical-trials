  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is usually characterized by long-term poor
      airflow, resulting in chronic pulmonary heart disease, chronic respiratory failure or even
      death. For COPD patients, pulmonary bronchus structures are damaged and cannot be repaired by
      recent clinical methods so far. This study intends to carry out a single-centered and
      non-randomized phase I/II clinical trial with concurrent controls to investigate whether
      bronchial basal cells can regenerate damaged lung tissue. During the treatment, bronchial
      basal cells will be isolated from patients' own bronchi and expanded in vitro. After careful
      characterization, expanded cells will be transplanted autologously into the lesion by
      fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The safety and efficacy of the treatment will be monitored by
      measuring the key clinical indicators.
