  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study builds, in part, upon preliminary results generated as part of the
      Pharmacogenomics Anti-Platelet Intervention (PAPI) Study (NCT00799396). The purpose of this
      investigation is to assess the impact of genetic variation in the carboxylesterase 1 (CES1)
      on response to clopidogrel as well as dual antiplatelet therapy (i.e. clopidogrel and
      aspirin), as assessed by ex vivo platelet aggregometry, in healthy Amish individuals. The
      investigators hypothesize that participants who carry alleles that modify the activity or
      expression of CES1 will have altered response to clopidogrel as well as dual antiplatelet
      therapy.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will enroll 50 healthy Amish participants who have been identified through existing whole genome and exome sequencing along with bioinformatic approaches that have genetic variants that are predicted to significantly impact CES1 expression or catalytic function. Enrolled participants will undergo a two-stage intervention with clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose then 75 mg per day for the next 6 days), followed by clopidogrel (75 mg) plus aspirin 324 mg for 1 day. Platelet aggregation studies and other measures of platelet function will be performed before and after each intervention. In combination with previously collected data as part of the PAPI Study, the investigators will then characterize the impact of genetic variation in CES1 on clopidogrel and dual antiplatelet therapy response through single- and multi-variant association modeling.</intervention_model_description>

It is possible that deidentified data will be deposited into large public databases as per NIH data sharing policies (e.g. dbGAP, PharmGKB). Data to be shared would include, but not limited to, anthropometric data, study outcome data, and relevant covariate data used in statistical models of association. It is anticipated that data would be available after the completion of the trial. The data will be obtained from the participants and the study-related research procedures.</ipd_description>
