  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to evaluate if after 14 days of grape juice ingestion there is improvement
      of the parameters of strength, fatigue and oxidative stress in judo fighters. The study will
      be a randomized, blind, crossover clinical trial of 20 Judo athletes. Judo wrestling
      simulations will be performed on 3 different days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grape juice has a high concentration of phenolic compounds and is capable of modulating
      biochemical parameters and oxidative stress. By naturally containing carbohydrates grape
      juice can help acutely minimize fatigue during exercise as well as long-term oxidative stress
      parameters in athletes. This project aims to evaluate if after 14 days of grape juice
      ingestion there is improvement of the parameters of strength, fatigue and oxidative stress in
      judo fighters. The study will be a randomized, blind, crossover clinical trial of 20 Judo
      athletes. Judo wrestling simulations will be performed on 3 different days. Each exercise
      session will consist of four 7-minute bouts, with 14-minute rest between them. The athletes
      will perform a first fight simulation without ingestion of any beverage (control group 1),
      and then will be randomized to determine the order of participation in the groups:
      maltodextrin (group 2 placebo) and grape juice (intervention group 3). Analyzes of oxidative
      stress; Muscle strength and fatigue; Perceived effort rate; Lactate; Heart rate; Analysis of
      food consumption and body composition.Two-way ANOVA will be used to evaluate the relation of
      the intervention and physical exercise, besides parameters of strength and fatigue. The level
      of significance adopted will be 5% and for the analysis, the SPSS summer 23 statistical
      program will be used.

    <description>Specific to muscle fatigue, a state arrived at through prolonged and strong contraction of a muscle. Studies in athletes during prolonged submaximal exercise have shown that muscle fatigue increases in almost direct proportion to the rate of muscle glycogen depletion. Muscle fatigue in short-term maximal exercise is associated with oxygen lack and an increased level of blood and muscle lactic acid, and an accompanying increase in hydrogen-ion concentration in the exercised muscle.</description>
