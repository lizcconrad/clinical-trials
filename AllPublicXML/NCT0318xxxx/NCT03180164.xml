  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic airways diseases involve alterations in the person's social roles, relationships and
      self-perception so demands continual psychological adjustment .

      Also Kunik studied patients with chronic breathing disorders for depression and anxiety and
      found that 65% of patients were positive for depression and anxiety.

      Shackell found that patients' anxiety and fears of breathlessness and dying extended into the
      night and were aggravated by feelings of isolation and frustration. One patient reported that
      they often thought 'am I going to see the next morning?'

      This fear and sense of helplessness can lead to panic and evidence suggests that patients
      with chronic breathlessness often call for emergency assistance during the night According to
      GOLD report 2017, anxiety and depression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients
      are both associated with poor prognosis.

      Much of the evidence explored so far relates to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While
      other chronic lung diseases have received less attention In addition to, several studies have
      been found relationship between asthma and psychological disturbance .One review of
      literature describes an increased prevalence of psychological co-morbidity in asthmatic
      adults and another research suggests that anxiety and depression are more common in patients
      with moderate to severe asthma than in the general population Gift. found significantly
      greater self-reported depression scores among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease receiving prednisone compared to patients not receiving any steroids.

      Interestingly, the psychiatric sequel of steroid treatment are often sudden in onset and
      appear to generally occur within 2 weeks after steroid introduction
