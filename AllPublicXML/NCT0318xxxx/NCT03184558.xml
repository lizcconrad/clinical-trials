    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm, multi-centre phase II study to assess the anti-tumour
      activity and safety of bemcentinib (BGB324) in combination with pembrolizumab in up to 56
      patients with previously treated, locally advanced and unresectable, or metastatic TNBC or
      TN-IBC. The study will utilise an extension of Simon's 2-stage design. The primary objective
