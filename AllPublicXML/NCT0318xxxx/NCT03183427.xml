  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine size of corpus callosum on midsagittal MR scan in patients with
      a pineal cyst and to compare it with the control group without a pineal cyst.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pineal cyst (PC) is a benign affection of the pineal gland, its prevalence in population
      reaches 1-2 %. Etiopathogenesis of PC is unknown, several hypotheses have been proposed. One
      of the hypothesis consider perinatal hypoxia as a causative factor for a development of PC in
      later life. Ozmen et al. showed significantly higher prevalence of PC in patients with
      cerebral palsy (p&lt;0.001). Bregant et al. studied presence of PC in patients that suffered
      from a mild to moderate perinatal hypoxia. Prevalence of PC reached 36 % in these patients
      and presence of PC was associated with a atrophy of the corpus callosum (p&lt;0.005). The
      atrophy of the corpus callosum is considered to be a sign of a periventricular leukomalacia,
      i.e. an ischemic insult in a perinatal period.

      In the present study, we are going to compare an area of corpus callosum on a midsagittal
      magnetic resonance T2-weighted scan in the group of patients with PC and in the control group
      without PC. The goal of the study is to determine if there is a relationship between atrophy
      of the corpus callosum and PC. Such finding would support abovementioned theory of
      etiopathogenesis of PC.
