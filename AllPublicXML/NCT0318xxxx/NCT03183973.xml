  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sternal wound and there complication such as infection, Bruising and scar formation are known
      as major complication cardiac surgery with a high mortality rate up to 50%. Several
      approaches have been proposed for treatment of chronic sternal wounds in these patients.
      however, Underlying confounding factors such as old ages,diabetes mellitus, systemic hypoxia,
      atherosclerosis and malnutrition have main role against wound repairing. In this study
      investigators aimed to treatment of patients with open heart surgery and need to strict
      monitoring of sternal wound repair by Platelet Rich Fibrin.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with an acute STEMI or NSTEMI (confirmed by segment
             elevation (ST) changes on serial ECG, elevated troponin, coronary artery stenosis or
             occlusion identified by angiography, and a wall motion abnormality identified by
             angiography or echocardiography)

          -  The patient is scheduled to undergo coronary artery bypass surgery.

          -  The patient does not possess any contraindication for cardiovascular magnetic
             resonance (CMR).

          -  The patient is capable of giving informed consent.

          -  The patient is geographically accessible and willing to return for all follow-up
             investigations and clinical visits associated with study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is over the age of 65 years.

          -  The patient has previous myocardial infarction (MI) (other than the qualifying event)
             and/or has scar or non-viable myocardium identified by CMR in any other left
             ventricular (LV) territory.

          -  The patient is undergoing other cardiac surgery (i.e. concurrent cardiac valve, or
             aortic surgery).

          -  The patient requires emergency surgery (i.e. operative intervention (CABG or
             ventricular assist device) within 24-hrs of assessment).

          -  The patient has undergone previous cardiac surgery.

          -  The patient's postsurgical life expectancy is less than 45 days, in the investigator's
             opinion.

          -  The patient is of excessively poor baseline health, health-related quality of life, or
             physical functioning that would preclude a reasonable expected post-operative
             recovery.

          -  The patient has received radiotherapy to the chest wall, is receiving
             immunosuppressive therapy, or is in any way immunocompromised.
