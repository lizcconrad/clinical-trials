  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm randomized, wait-list control study with 610 participants total: 600
      patient participants and 10 staff participants. 600 smokers will be recruited to complete a
      9-week intervention that integrates financial management and smoking cessation counseling.
      Participants will be randomized (300 per arm, stratified by site) to receive the intervention
      immediately after enrolling (Intervention Arm) or 6 months later (Waitlist Control Arm). Both
      arms will receive nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for four weeks as part of their time in
      integrative counseling. Participants will be observed at baseline, 2 months, 6 months and 12
      months to assess outcomes and their satisfaction with treatment.
