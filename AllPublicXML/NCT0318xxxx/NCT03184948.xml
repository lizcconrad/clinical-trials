  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study exploits the distribution of low-cost high-quality phototherapy devices
      (Brilliance by D-Rev) to public hospitals in Rwanda to assess whether the provision of
      improved technology improves health care for infant jaundice. Specifically, the investigators
      are interested in measuring whether the provision of an additional high-quality phototherapy
      device, a known effective treatment for jaundice, successfully translates into improved care
      of neonatal jaundice in Rwanda where the burden of jaundice is particularly high.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Ministry of Health (MIH) in Rwanda has planned to provide Brilliance devices
      (phototherapy) to 46 public hospitals in Rwanda. The investigators have worked with MIH to
      have the delivery of these machines be staggered over three phases through random selection.
      The methodology relies on the staggered distribution of Brilliance devices and survey data
      collected prior and during delivery dates to evaluate the provision of low-cost high quality
      phototherapy machines, following the basic design of a staggered randomized controlled trial.
      Specifically, the investigators will survey all hospitals prior to the receipt of any
      Brilliance devices to provide a baseline description of the care received in these
      facilities. These surveys will collect information on the facility itself, including average
      infant jaundice caseloads and descriptions of recent cases. The investigators will then
      randomly select 15 hospitals to receive the Brilliance units. Three months after installation
      of Brilliance has occurred at these facilities (Group 1), another randomly selected subset of
      16 facilities (Group 2) will receive their Brilliance machines. Three months after these
      installations have been completed, the remaining facilities (Group 3) will receive their
      Brilliance machines. During this period, there will be ongoing data collection from the
      hospitals, creating a panel dataset on the jaundice-related caseloads at these facilities.
      The data collected will be akin to collecting hospital records of patients diagnosed with
      jaundice, but no identifiable patient information will be collected.

    <intervention_model_description>Hospitals (i.e., participants) receive the intervention (i.e., Brilliance phototherapy device) at different times in the study. In the first phase, a set of hospital facilities receive the device. After three months of using the device, another set of hospital facilities receive the device. And after an additional three months (approximately 6 months after the first set of hospitals implemented their device), all hospitals will have been provided with the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Number of hours infant diagnosed with jaundice is provided phototherapy (PT).

    <description>Using different measures of estimated bilirubin levels for one patient and the age at which those tests were provided, we will estimate the change in bilirubin levels over the change in age (by hours) as the rate of reduction in bilirubin levels. This assumes that age at diagnosis is similar across treatment arms. If this is not the case or if our estimates are not precise, we will use maximum bilirubin levels recorded as a proxy. The analysis is conditional on the subset of infants diagnosed with jaundice.</description>

    <description>The intervention is the provision of the Brilliance phototherapy machines to hospitals. This device is to be provided to facilities regardless of the study -- the study's involvement has been to collaborate with the Ministry of Health so that Brilliance is distributed in a randomized staggered method. In that sense, the study may be considered observational, as the study is not driving whether or not a hospital receives Brilliance, only when it receives Brilliance in a short time frame.</description>
