      Aim: to collect further information on issues related to tobacco control which should be
      addressed and advocated in further tobacco control measures in Hong Kong

      The objectives of this policy-related survey are as follows:

        1. to update information on trends and prevalence of secondhand smoke, smoking attributable
           health effects, cessation services, and e-cigarette;

        2. to investigate the level of public support on current and future tobacco control
           measures and taxation;

        3. to address the timely impacts of smoke-free policies, public support for further tobacco
           control measures and assist COSH in shaping policy direction for government.

      Current study is a cross-sectional retrospective telephone survey based on questionnaires. In
      total, 5,104 subjects will be randomly selected for a telephone interview. The subjects will
      be categorized into three groups, i.e. never smokers (1,700), ex-smokers (1,700) and current
      smokers (1,704). They will be required to answer a questionnaire via telephone. All data
      shall be collected using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system, which allows
      real-time data capture and consolidation. All interviews shall be conducted anonymously.
      Analysis of survey data will aim to identify current opinion on tobacco control policies and
      implications for future policies. Analyses will be controlled for confounding variables as
      required by stratification into sub-groups based on important pre-defined characteristics
      and/or by multivariate analysis. Comparison with past trends and, where possible,
      extrapolation of future trends will be explored. Weights will be applied to adjust for the
      sex and age of Hong Kong population, and to handle the over-sampling issues of current
      smokers. The data analysis will be conducted by statisticians.
