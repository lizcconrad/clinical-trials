  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the intrapulmonary penetration of nacubactam in
      healthy volunteers. Nacubactam is a novel non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor being
      developed as a combination therapy with the beta-lactam meropenem for the treatment of
      serious gram-negative bacterial infections. Adult male and female healthy participants will
      receive a single intravenous infusion of nacubactam co-administered with meropenem and then
      undergo a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedure to collect lung epithelial lining fluid
      (ELF) for measurement of intrapulmonary concentrations of nacubactam and meropenem.

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
