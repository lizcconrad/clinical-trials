  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is considered one of the most common and costly health
      conditions today. Due to its complex aetiology, both psychopharmacological and psychosocial
      treatments have been struggling to lower pain intensity and disability in patients suffering
      from CWP. However, recent research has found that there is a strong association between low
      parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity and pain intensity in patients diagnosed with
      CWP. Furthermore, research has suggested that increasing PNS activity by stimulating the
      vagus nerve may lower pain intensity in patients with CWP. This present study will
      investigate and compare the effects of non-invasive transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation
      (tVNS) and deep breathing (DB) on low PNS activity in patients with CWP. We hypothesise that
      by stimulating the vagal nerve, either exogenously with tVNS or endogenously with DB, we will
      increase PNS activity and therefore decrease pain intensity, disability, and increase both
      psycho and physiological wellbeing in patients suffering from CWP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is one of the most difficult conditions to treat due to its
      unclear aetiology and multidimensional sensory-discriminative, motivational-affective, and
      cognitive-behavioural nature. However, current findings within the fields of autoimmune
      dysregulation, parasympathetic dysregulation, and neurocognitive-affective syndromes suggests
      three domains in which chronic pain may be successfully treated. This study will be the first
      of its kind to use a randomised, controlled, two-stage experimental design to investigate and
      compare the efficacy of non-invasive transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) and
      diaphragmatic breathing (DB) for the treatment of CWP. We hypothesise that both tVNS and DB
      will significantly increase ECG-measured high-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) and
      therefore increase pain inhibition and vagal parasympathetic tone while decreasing
      pro-inflammatory sympathetic overactivity (as indicated by hair cortisol levels and
      pro-inflammatory markers) in participants with CWP. Patients randomised to the tVNS treatment
      will undergo a 60-minute low- frequency stimulation once a day for 6 weeks while patients
      randomised to the DB program will practice specific deep breathing exercises for a duration
      of 60 minutes per day for 6 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will use a randomised, controlled, two-stage experimental design which will be implemented with seven groups of patients diagnosed with CWP. Stage 1 of the study involves the recruitment of consenting CWP patients that will be randomized into four groups. Half of these participants will be randomized to either an experimental tVNS group or a sham control group. The other half will be randomised to either an experimental DB group or a sham control group. An untouched control group will also be included in order to control for any Hawthorne effects. In Stage 2, the tVNS treatment and the DB program are implemented in two separate and one combined experimental group. Stage 1 establishes potential effect for the tVNS and the DB program whereas Stage 2 tests whether one manipulation is superior to another, separately or combined. After completion of the second stage, all blood and hair samples will be analyzed collectively.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Heart Rate Variability (HRV) at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-6 week Intervention); Post-6 week Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) will be derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings and serve as the primary outcome. RMSSD corresponds to the parasympathetic regulation of heart beats which is associated with pain intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pain at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-6 week Intervention); Post-6 week Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS for pain is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. It is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of their pain. This will provide a subjective evaluation of pain intensity as compared to the parasympathetic tone of each patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-6 week Intervention); Post-6 week Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Conditioned pain modulation (CPM) will test endogenous pain inhibition and pro-nociceptive patterns of pain modulation. Heat pain ratings are taken from one arm while the other arm is immersed in a hot water bath. CPM will be tested using the published protocol from the Tromsø Study, in Tromsø, Norway. This gives us comparison data from over 10000 people, increasing the ecological value of the CPM measure.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Cortisol at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-6 week Intervention); Post-6 week Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Hair Cortisol analysis presents a means of monitoring chronic stress, capturing systemic cortisol exposure over longer periods of time. Hair samples can be easily attained while cortisol can be measured by using a competitive radioimmunoassay in methanol extracts of hair samples frozen in liquid nitrogen and mechanically pulverised.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Pro-Inflammatory and Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre-6 week Intervention); Post-6 week Intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Venus blood samples will be taken from the median cubital vein in order to evaluate and analyse pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations (i.e. interleukin 5 (IL-5), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8)) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10)).</description>
