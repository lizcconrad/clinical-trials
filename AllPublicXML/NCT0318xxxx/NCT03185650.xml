      Purpose: Characterize the depositional attributes of a specialized trans-nasal aerosol
      delivery device in healthy people using clinical measurements of mucociliary clearance.

      Participants: 10 Healthy non-pregnant volunteers aged 18 to 65 (inclusive) with a body mass
      index &lt;30 kg/m² will enrolled.

      Procedures (methods): 7% hypertonic saline (HS) aerosol containing the radio tracer
      Tc99m-sulfur colloid will be delivered via the tPAD and compared to the well characterized
      PARI LC Star nebulizer using planar gamma scintigraphy (i.e. particle clearance). The
      fraction of sulfur colloid particles that clear over the ensuing 24 hours with each device
      will indicate the fraction deposited in conducting airways.

      Purpose: This is an early device characterization study to define the fraction of delivered
      aerosol generated by a novel nebulizer (tPAD) that deposits in conducting airways.

      Design: Open label, cross-over design, using a standard oral nebulizer (PARI LC Star) as a
      comparator. The order of visits will be randomized.

      Methods: Gamma scintigraphy will be performed following use of each device on separate study
      visits.

      Primary Outcome: Fraction of inhaled particles that clears over 24 hours.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive), and with a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 kg/m2.

          2. Non-pregnant female subjects must be either not sexually active, post-menopausal,
             surgically sterilized, or agree to use an appropriate &quot;double-barrier&quot; method (such as
             a diaphragm and condom); or, must currently be using a prescribed transdermal,
             injection, implant, or oral contraceptive during study participation.

          3. Subjects who are in good health, as determined by a medical history and examination.

          4. Subjects who have normal lung function with a FEV1 ≥80% predicted and a FEV1/FVC &gt;70%.

          5. Subjects who are capable of providing written informed consent in English to
