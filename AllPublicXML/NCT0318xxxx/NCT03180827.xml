      Background:

      Due to the remarkable improvement in treatments these last decades, long term survival can be
      expected in more than 80% of childhood cancer patients. Unfortunately, cancer treatments can
      be harmful to the gonads and can affect reproductive and endocrine functions. While loss of
      fertility is a major concern for most patients, only the experimental option of ovarian
      tissue cryopreservation can be proposed to prepubertal girls with a high risk of infertility.
      For pubertal patient, cryopreservation of mature oocytes after ovarian stimulation can be
      offered if oncological treatment debut can be delayed. As it is often not possible, ovarian
      tissue cryopreservation can also be offered.

      Primary aims

      - To cryopreserve ovarian tissue of prepubertal and pubertal patient who will be receiving
      highly gonadotoxic oncological treatment.

      Secondary aims

        -  To create a database in order to record clinical and biological follow-up data

        -  To pool resources with Fertisave Registry

        -  To create a research biobank for future research projects
