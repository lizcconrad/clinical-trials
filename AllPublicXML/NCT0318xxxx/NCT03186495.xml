  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the steady state
      exposure of somapacitan in subjects with various degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate,
      severe renal impairment, requiring haemodialysis treatment) compared to subjects with normal
      renal function

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged 18-75 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing informed
             consent

          -  Body mass index between 18.5-34.9 kg/sqm (both inclusive)

          -  Meeting the pre-defined glomerular filtration rate for any of the renal function
             groups 1-4 (based on the measured glomerular filtration rate using exogenous sinistrin
             (InutestÂ®) as a filtration marker) or being in treatment with haemodialysis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant, breast-feeding or intends to become pregnant or is of
             child-bearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method (adequate
             contraceptive measure as required by local regulation or practice). Male of
             reproductive age who or whose partner(s) is not using adequate contraceptive methods
             (adequate contraceptive measures as required by local regulation or practice) or male
             who is not willing to refrain from donating semen for at least 16 days after last
             trial product administration

          -  Any disorder, except for conditions associated with renal impairment in the groups of
             subjects with reduced renal function, which in the investigator's opinion might
             jeopardise subject's safety, evaluation of results, or compliance with the protocol.
             For example, arterial hypertension, anaemia, impaired glucose tolerance or type 2
             diabetes are accepted in the group of subjects with renal impairment
