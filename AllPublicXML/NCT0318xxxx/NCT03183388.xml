  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New treatments to help to reduce the emotional dysregulation of mood disorders are critically
      needed. This is a study of an emotional dysregulation psychotherapy treatment in which
      subjects will learn skills to help to down-regulate maladaptive emotional responses and learn
      beneficial, healthy habits. Investigators will perform symptom and behavioral assessments and
      scanning prior to the treatment and will then repeat scanning, symptom and behavioral
      assessments at the midpoint, and after the psychotherapy is completed. This collected
      information will assess whether the treatment can improve functioning of emotion regulation
      brain circuitry.

      Aim: To use fMRI, before, at mid point, and after an emotional regulation intervention, to
      assess intervention-associated changes in brain circuitry responses to emotional stimuli.

      Hypothesis : The emotional regulation psychotherapy treatment will be associated with changes
      in emotional regulation circuitry.

    <description>Subjects will participate in 12 therapy sessions, at a rate of about 1 session every one to two weeks. Sessions are anticipated to last about 1 hour each. Sessions may be focused on teaching skills to regulate emotions or regularize sleep and activity. These therapy sessions may be videotaped and audiotaped (only with the expressed written consent of the subject, and when appropriate, the subject's parent or guardian). Subjects will be asked to complete worksheets and practice the skills learned from these sessions and they will be asked questions about how they are feeling. There will interview assessments and scanning performed prior to treatment and at the midpoint and end to assess progress. The intervening 9 sessions may be by video telecommunication.</description>
