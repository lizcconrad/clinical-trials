  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dual task training has been shown to reduce the risk of falls more than single task training.
      However, there have been no studies which compared the effects of single task training, dual
      task training and asynchronous cognitive, balance exercise training during same day on the
      risk of falls among healthy older individuals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
      investigate differences among the effects of single task training, dual task training and
      exercise-cognitive activity combined training on balance and gait performances and fall risk
      in elderly at risk of fall.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term &quot;dual task&quot; refers to the ability of performing 2 tasks simultaneously, for example,
      a cognitive and a motor task. Previous studies demonstrated that dual task training is more
      effective than single task training in reducing falls among elderly. These studies
      demonstrated that the improvements in balance and gait speed resulted in a decrease of fall
      frequency. Although dual task training has been shown to reduce the risk of falls more than
      single task training, to date, there have been no studies which compared the effects of
      single task training, dual task training and asynchronous cognitive, balance exercise
      training during same day on the risk of falls among healthy older individuals. Therefore, the
      aim of this study was to investigate differences among the effects of single task training,
      dual task training and exercise-cognitive activity combined training on balance and gait
      performances and fall risk in elderly at risk of fall.

    <description>The participants in single task training received 30 minutes single task balance and gait exercises, 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The program included static and dynamic balance exercises. Static balance exercises involved body stability (e.g., standing legs open and closed, standing with eyes closed, tandem standing, standing on foam surface and one leg standing, standing while throwing and catching a ball ), forward and backward weight shifting and keeping standing position while being disturbed by external perturbation. Dynamic balance exercises included tandem walking, walking to different direction (backward, side to side), transfer activities (from 1 chair to another) and sit to stand 5 times</description>

    <description>The participants practiced 30 minutes balance and gait exercises while simultaneously performing cognitive tasks. The program included static and dynamic balance exercises. Static balance exercises involved body stability, forward and backward weight shifting and keeping standing position while being disturbed by external perturbation. Dynamic balance exercises included tandem walking, walking to different direction, transfer activities and sit to stand 5 times. The participants practiced cognitive tasks while simultaneously performing balance and gait exercises. The cognitive tasks included visual attention, auditory attention, planning, verbal fluency, simple mental math and maze activities. At each week, participants performed different type of activities which were designed to foster the executive functions: (1) Visual and auditory attention, (2) Planning and verbal fluency, (3) Simple math problems (4) Visual and auditory attention, planning, verbal fluency, math problems</description>
