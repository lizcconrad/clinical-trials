    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded, single center, parallel design pediatric study, on 45 subjects
      with type 1 diabetes (T1D), aged six to 15 (inclusive) years, measuring sensor time in
      glucose values within range 3.9 - 10 mmol/l (70 - 180 mg/dl) achieved using the FreeStyle
      Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System (FGM - intervention, Abbott Diabetes Care, California,
      USA) versus Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG - control).

      Study duration will be two weeks per subject and two weeks overall, it will take place at
      youth summer camp for children with T1D. Main inclusion criteria include age of six to 15
      (inclusive) years, clinical diagnosis of T1D for at least six months, at least three months
      of current use of insulin pump therapy, HbA1c between 6.3 and 10 % (both inclusive), no other
      chronic medical conditions (beside treated hypothyroidism and celiac disease) and no current
      medications (other than insulin) (detailed list of inclusion and exclusion criteria list can
      be found at section 6).

      The objectives of this clinical investigation is:

      1. to evaluate the efficacy of glucose control using the FreeStyle Libre FGM in children with
      T1D during two weeks of summer camp.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - 1. The subject has documented T1D, as defined by the American Diabetes Association and
        World Health Organization (ADA/WHO) for at least six month prior to study enrolment 2.
        Documented evidence should exist within the patient history of T1D 3. The subject is
        between six and 15 years of age (inclusive) at the time of enrolment 4. The subject has
        been treated with an insulin pump for at least 3 months 5. The subject has an A1C value
        between 6.3 and 10% (both inclusive) based on analysis from the local laboratory. A1C
        testing must follow National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) standards.

        6. The subject is willing to follow all study instructions 7. Subject is willing to perform
        daily self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). 8. If subject has celiac/Hashimoto disease,
        the disease has to be adequately treated as determined by the investigator 9. Subject has a
        BMI above 5th centile and below 95th centile for age, respectively.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Concomitant diseases that influence metabolic control (e.g. anemia, significantly
             impaired hepatic function, renal failure, history of adrenal insufficiency) or other
             medical conditions, which in the investigator's opinion, may compromise patient
             safety; Note: Adequately treated thyroid disease and celiac disease do not exclude
             subjects from enrollment.

             2. Significant co-morbidity that, in the opinion of the investigators would preclude
             participation in the study (e.g. current treatment for cancer, mental disorder) 3.
             Subject is taking or has taken oral or parenteral glucocorticoids within 1 month prior
             to screening, or plans to take oral or parenteral glucocorticoids during the study.

             4. Subject is taking antidiabetic agents or other medications, which could be a
             contraindication to participation in the study by the judgment of the investigator.

             5. Subject is participating in another study of a medical device or drug that could
             affect glucose measurements or glucose management or Receipt of any investigational
             medical product within 1 month prior to screening.

             6. Female subject of child-bearing potential who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or
             planning to become pregnant during the study.

             7. Subject has known hypoglycemic unawareness or recurrent severe hypoglycemic events
             with seizure and/or coma (more than two episodes) within 6 months prior to screening.

             8. Subject has a history of one or more episodes of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
             requiring hospitalization within a month prior to the screening.

             9. Subject has current or recent history of alcohol or drug abuse. 10. Subject has
             visual impairment or hearing loss, which in the investigator's opinion, may compromise
             patient ability to perform study procedures safely (child and parent should be
             evaluated as a unit).
