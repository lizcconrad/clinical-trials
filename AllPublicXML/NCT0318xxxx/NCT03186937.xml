  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given preliminary data demonstrating that methionine deprivation enhances cell surface
      expression of TRAIL receptor-2, the objective of this clinical trial is to confirm that
      methionine restriction enhances its expression in triple negative breast cancer and to
      establish the feasibility and acceptability of this dietary intervention in humans. This
      study will also examine the effect of methionine restriction on cancer stem cells and
      metabolic health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Under the supervision of a registered dietitian, subjects will receive an individualized
      dietary prescription that incorporates a methionine-free amino acid-modified medical food
      (Hominex-2, Abbott Nutrition) supplemented with low-methionine foods. Hominex-2 contains a
      mixture of L-amino acids but lacks methionine. Subjects will be instructed in the preparation
      of Hominex-2 beverages (approximately 4-5 per day or per dietician recommendation) to deliver
      100% of daily protein requirements (0.8 g/kg/day) and 40-45% of the caloric requirements. The
      remaining calories will be met with low-methionine foods, including fruits, vegetables,
      grains (e.g., specified cereal and bread), margarine and cooking oils. Subjects will be
      provided with a list of foods that are low in methionine. Calories will not be restricted.
      Subjects will be encouraged to follow their usual level of physical activity and instructed
      to maintain a daily diet and exercise diary that will be reviewed weekly by the dietitian.

Participants will be asked to have an optional non-contrast MRI to assess body composition prior to and at completion of the methionine-restricted (MR) diet. Not completing a scheduled MRI is not considered a protocol deviation.
Participants will be followed for 30 days after surgery or biopsy date. Subjects removed from study for unacceptable adverse events (AEs) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the AE.</description>
