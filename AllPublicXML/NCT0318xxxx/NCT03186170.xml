    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to assess one method of sperm selection based on the
      characteristics of spermatozoa recently introduced: Sperm Selection Assay, which used a
      gradient of concentration of progesterone to act as chemoatractant of spermatozoa of better
      quality. We will assess in vitro fertilization with two techniques (SSSA versus traditional
      technique of swin up) as well as embryo development.

      The project is a RCT follow the orientation of CONSORT. The investigators propose to assess
      one method of sperm selection based on the characteristics of spermatozoa recently
      introduced: Sperm Selection Assay, which used a gradient of concentration of progesterone to
      act as chemoatractant of spermatozoa of better quality. We will assess in vitro fertilization
      with two techniques (SSSA versus traditional technique of swin up) as well as embryo
      development.

We will assess in vitro fertilization with two techniques (SSA versus traditional technique of swin up) as well as embryo development.
In this arm, the sperm selection for IVF will be performed by the new proposed technique of Sperm Selection Assay which consist to expose spermatozoa a progesterone quemoatractant Sperm selection via SSA technique</description>

We will assess in vitro fertilization with two techniques (SSSA versus traditional technique of swin up for sperm selection) as well as embryo development.
In this arm, the sperm selection for IVF will be the traditional swin up technique with different Percoll gradient Sperm selection via traditional swin-up</description>
