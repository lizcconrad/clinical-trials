  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene is associated to several biochemicals imbalances, as
      changes in folic acid serum levels and some inflammatory markers, elevating the oxidative
      stress and increasing the risk of developing non communicable diseases (NCDs).

      Thus, a diet containing folate as a main antioxidant nutrient, could reduce not only the
      oxidative stress, but also has many others benefits for individuals with this genetic
      alteration, like the anti-inflammatory function, which could help restore the altered serum
      levels and minimizing or avoiding the development of future diseases.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR
      gene and the effect of a diet containing folate in the inflammatory markers levels, such as
      homocysteine, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins in women with overweight
      or obesity. This is an intervention study, double-blind, held in a city in northeastern
      Brazil, with a sample of 48 adult women (20-59 years old) with BMI among 26.19 kg / m² and
      49.64 kg / m². In which we evaluated the TNF-α levels, Interleukins 1β, Interleukin 6,
      Interleukin 8, Interleukin 12p70, Interleukin 10, homocysteine, folic acid and in addition to
      these markers evaluation, were made the genotyping for the C677T polymorphism in the MTHFR
      gene and the food consumption assessment by the 24 hour dietary recall (24HR). For the
      intervention, the sample was divided by randomization into two groups, each one with 24
      indivuals, receiving daily during 8 weeks, a salad with 300g vegetables containing 191 ug of
      folate for group 1 and 90 ug for group 2.

      This work is linked to a population-based survey entitled &quot;Diagnosis and Intervention II
      Cycle Situation Food, Nutrition and Noncommunicable Diseases prevalent over the city of João
      Pessoa Population / PB&quot; (II DISANDNT / PB). For the realization of this dissertation we
      (teams of undergraduate researchers and graduates of Nutrition Course, masters and doctoral
      students of the Post Graduate Program in Nutrition Sciences (PPGCN) of UFPB) did home visits,
      applied questionnaires related to anthropometric and food intake assessment, by duly
      previously trained at the beginning of data collection and after completion of the pilot
      study.

      After the selection of individuals from the sample of adults who participated in the II
      DISANDNT / JP and considering the inclusion criteria and genotyping of the C677T polymorphism
      in the MTHFR gene, they were invited to participate.
