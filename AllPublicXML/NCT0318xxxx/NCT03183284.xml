  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenic purpra(ITP) is an autoimmune thrombocytopenic syndrome characterized
      by decreased platelet count and increased risk of bleeding, primarily due to immunoglobulins
      G(IgG)autoantibodies opsonizing the individual's platelets,resulting in markedly enhanced Fc
      receptors(FcR)-mediated phagocytosis and destruction by macrophages in the
      reticuloendothelial system within spleen Severe ITP defined as :Patients who have clinically
      relevant bleeding that mean that patients have bleeding symptoms at presentation sufficient
      to mandate treatment,or occurrence of new bleeding symptoms requiring additional therapeutic
      intervention with a different platelet-enhancing agent or an increased dose.

      relevant bleeding that mean that patients have bleeding symptoms at presentation sufficient
      to mandate treatment,or occurrence of new bleeding symptoms requiring additional therapeutic
      intervention with a different platelet-enhancing agent or an increased dose.Prednislone is
      the standard intial first-line therapy in na√Øve ITP patients.Prednislone is usually given at
      0.5 to 2mg/kg until platelet count increase(&gt;30-50 *10^9/L )which may require several days to
      several weeks,however prednisone should be rapidly tapered after 4 weeks to avoid
      corticosteroid related complication. In a trial to shorten the duration and reduce adverse
      effects of corticosteroids treatment. Dexamethasone in a dose of 40mg/day has been
      administered for 4days (equivalent to~400mg of prednisone per day) achieved 85% initial
      reponse and sustained response 50% of adult cases of ITP at 6 months follow up
