  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical benefit of ASP2215 therapy in
      participants with FMS-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) mutated AML who are refractory to or have
      relapsed after first-line AML therapy as shown with overall survival (OS) compared to salvage
      chemotherapy. In addition, this study will evaluate safety as well as determine the overall
      efficacy in event-free survival (EFS) and complete remission (CR) rate of ASP2215 compared to
      salvage chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Participants considered an adult according to local regulations at the time of signing
      informed consent will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive ASP2215 or salvage
      chemotherapy. Participants will enter the screening period up to 14 days prior to the start
      of treatment. Prior to randomization, the investigator will preselect a salvage chemotherapy
      regimen for each participant; options will include low-dose cytarabine (LoDAC), mitoxantrone,
      etoposide and intermediate-dose cytarabine (MEC) or fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine and
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (FLAG). The randomization will be stratified by
      response to first-line therapy and preselected salvage chemotherapy. Participants will be
      administered treatment over continuous 28-day cycles.

      Among the participants, approximately 20 Chinese participants who are randomized into the
      ASP2215 arm will be allocated to the pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort. Participants in the PK
      cohort will be requested to be hospitalized from the date of randomization (Day 1) to at
      least the completion of all the assessments planned on Day 2. All participants in the PK
      cohort will undergo blood sampling for PK measurement of ASP2215. Participants in PK cohort
      will be administered the study drug in the same manner and undergo the same efficacy and
      safety assessments as other participants except for blood sampling for additional PK
      measurements.
