    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive an oral dose of SER-109 in 4 capsules once daily for 3 consecutive days
      in Treatment Group I or matching placebo once daily for 3 consecutive days in Treatment Group
      II. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of SER-109 vs placebo to
      reduce recurrence of CDI in adults up to 8 weeks after initiation of treatment.

      ECOSPOR III is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SER-109 versus placebo in
      adult subjects 18 years of age or older with recurrent CDI, defined as: a history of ≥ 3 CDI
      episodes within 9 months, inclusive of the current episode. This study is designed to
      demonstrate the superiority of SER-109 versus placebo to reduce recurrence of Clostridium
      difficile infection (CDI) in adults who have received antibacterial drug treatment for
      recurrent CDI (RCDI), based on the proportion of subjects experiencing a CDI recurrence
      requiring antibiotic treatment up to 8 weeks after initiation of treatment. Approximately 320
      subjects with a history of CDI, diarrhea and a positive C. difficile toxin test result on a
      stool sample, who have responded to standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotic treatment will be
      enrolled. Subjects will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to 1 of 2 treatment groups
      (Treatment Group I [SER-109] or Treatment Group II [Placebo]) and stratified by age (&lt;65
      years; ≥65 years), as well as antibiotic regimen for the qualifying episode (vancomycin;
      fidaxomicin).

      Subjects will receive an oral dose of SER-109 in 4 capsules once daily for 3 consecutive days
      in Treatment Group I or matching placebo once daily for 3 consecutive days in Treatment Group
      II.

      Subjects with confirmed CDI recurrence, as defined in the Protocol, up to 8 weeks after
      administration of SER-109 or placebo treatment, and who have completed their Week 8 visit,
      may be eligible to enroll in the open- label SER-109 extension study (Study SERES-013).

          1. Signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific procedure or
             treatment. The subject must be able to provide written informed consent and understand
             the potential risks and benefits from study enrollment and treatment.

          2. Male or female subject ≥ 18 years of age.

          3. A qualifying episode of CDI as defined by:
