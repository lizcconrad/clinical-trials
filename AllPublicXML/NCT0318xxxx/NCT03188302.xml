  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to validate a new direct method for the measurement of stool
      consistency, using Texture Analyser. Forty healthy subjects are enrolled in this trial for
      collection of stool samples. Every stool produced during 2 collection periods of
      approximately 60 hours each is collected and subjected to the measurement of consistency
      using Texture Analyser. The stool consistency results are compared with the Bristol Stool
      Form Scale scores for each stool. The relationships of stool consistency with other stool
      parameters, bowel habit and sleeping habit are also evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is now obvious that the proper functioning of the gastrointestinal tract has a positive
      effect on the quality of life. Normal bowel habits vary considerably from person to person
      with regard to frequency of bowel movements, and bulk and consistency of stools. Constipation
      is the common digestive complaint in European populations, and softening stool consistency
      can be regarded as beneficial for such population in terms of reducing incidence of hard or
      lumpy stools .

      The Bristol Stool Form Scale (BS) is validated as a surrogate measure for gastrointestinal
      transit time, and has been also applied to an evaluation of stool consistency. Subjects
      compare their stool with the BS chart consisting of seven categories and choose one score
      which has a nearest analog form. The BS has been widely used in the studies to evaluate
      changes in stool consistency after dietary intervention using probiotics and/or prebiotics.
      However, there is a lack of evidence in the validity of BS to yield consistent and
      reproducible estimates of changes in stool consistency over time. In order to obtain a closer
      estimate of its change, it would be preferred to use a more directly observable and objective
      parameter or combination of parameters.

      From the above mentioned backgrounds, this study is conducted to validate a new direct method
      for the measurement of stool consistency, using Texture Analyser: TA.XTExpress Texture
      Analyser (Stable Micro Systems Ltd.).

    <description>Bristol Stool Form Scale (BS) is for classifying the form of stool into 7 categories scored from 1 to 7; (1) Separate hard lumps like nuts (difficult to pass); (2) Sausage-shaped but lumpy; (3) Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface; (4) Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft; (5) Soft blobs with clear-cut edges (passed easily); (6) Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool; (7) Watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid. Subjects choose one of the BS scores which has a nearest analog form with their stools at every defecation.</description>

    <description>The subjects collect stool samples to be used for validation of a new direct measurement of stool consistency. Every stool sample produced during 2 collection periods of approximately 60 hours each have to be collected using the Commode Specimen Collection System (Medline Industries, Inc.). Each collection period starts preferably in the evening (20h00) and ends 3 days later in the morning (08h00). The collected samples must be stored at subject's home in a refrigerator provided by the sponsor until handover to the site staff.</description>
