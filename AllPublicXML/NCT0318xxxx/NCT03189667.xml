      stenosis rates in dialysis arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs).

      Objectives of the Study:

      Hypothesis: Drug-coated balloons improve functional and patency outcomes of
      failing/dysfunctional hemodialysis fistulas compared to plain uncoated balloons

      Aim of the Study:

      Compare the effectiveness of drug-coated balloons to plain balloon angioplasty in reducing
      stenosis rates in dialysis AVFs.

      Specific Objectives:

      Primary functional endpoint: Access circuit patency based on functional criteria at 12 month.

      Primary safety endpoint: Peri procedural complication rate

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Technical success (&lt;30% residual stenosis without postdilation)

        -  Access circuit dysfunction free survival (Time to event) based on functional criteria

        -  Target lesion restenosis free survival (Time to event) (in case of new lesion causes
           circuit dysfunction)

All lesions to be predilated with high pressure balloons until waist is obliterated.
At least two minutes dilatation.

    <description>Lutonix® Drug Coated Balloon: The balloon is coated with a specialized formulation that includes the drug, paclitaxel. The paclitaxel coating is evenly distributed across the working length of the balloon at a surface concentration of 2 μg/mm2. The key functional characteristic of the formulation is to allow for release of paclitaxel to the tissue of the vascular wall during inflation.
Inflation to nominal pressure for at least 1 minute.
Balloon size: similar to the predilation balloon.
New drug coated balloon will be required for each lesion.</description>
