  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is the in-house development of a 200 mg ibuprofen acid orodispersable tablet
      (ODT; meltlet). It is designed to appeal to consumers who want a dosage form that may be
      taken without water and can be used 'on the go'. Vanquish has an improved organoleptic
      profile compared to the currently marketed meltet by the Sponsor. ODTs are also considered as
      a suitable dosage form for children who may be reluctant to swallow tablets. This product has
      the potential for application in both adults and children due to the convenience of the
      format and the ease of administration for both groups.

      This will be the first pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment of the ibuprofen acid ODT formulation.
