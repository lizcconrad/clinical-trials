      This study aims to evaluate the coordinated implementation of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy
      in Community Mental Health Services in Ireland.

      There are three main objectives of the current study:

        -  evaluate the effectiveness of DBT for adults and adolescents attending Community Mental
           Health Services in multiple sites across Ireland

        -  conduct an economic evaluation of the coordinated implementation of DBT in community
           settings in Ireland

        -  evaluate the implementation initiative by means of quantity, quality and experience of
           the coordinated implementation

      The National Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) Project, Ireland was established in the
      Republic of Ireland in 2013. The aims of the project were twofold: to implement DBT in
      Community Mental Health Services across Ireland and to evaluate this coordinated
      implementation of DBT at a national level.

      DBT was initially formulated as a treatment for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) which
      is typically characterised by patterns of emotional and behavioural dysregulation that often
      manifests in self-harm and suicidal ideation. DBT is noted to be an intervention with a
      growing evidence base that demonstrates its effectiveness in treating individuals with BPD.
      More than a dozen controlled trials have been completed at multiple independent sites. The
      results of these trials have reported a reduction in suicidal behaviours, inpatient
      hospitalisations, depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation among other constructs which
      individuals with BPD experience.

      While the efficacy of DBT has been demonstrated through multiple controlled trials, few
      studies have examined the effectiveness of DBT in community mental health settings. In
      particular, no study has evaluated a coordinated national implementation of DBT across
      multiple sites in a publicly funded health system. The current study aims to evaluate the the
      coordinated implementation of DBT in Community Mental Health Services in Ireland

    <description>Change in frequency of self-harm behaviour. Frequency of self-harm behaviour for a six month period will be recorded by the DBT therapist working with each individual by means of clinical file review. Self-harm behaviour frequency is scored on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 = Not at all, 2 = Rarely; 3 = Occasionally, 4 = Often, 5 = Most of the time.</description>

    <description>Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) is a psychological intervention which was originally developed for women with Borderline Personality Disorder. DBT is delivered by a team of multidisciplinary mental health professionals, and comprises of individual therapy sessions for each patient, group skills training sessions, phone coaching and consultation meetings for the clinicians on the DBT team. Group skills are delivered in blocks of three modules which teach mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness. The three modules are delivered over a 24-week period and are then repeated.</description>
