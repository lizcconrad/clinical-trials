  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the neurological function in patients with multiple brain
      metastases undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT). Assessment of neurocognitive function may help show that SRS preserves neurological
      function in patients with multiple brain metastases better than SBRT

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of neurocognitive function at months 4.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of neurocognitive function at months 2, 6, and 12 as measured by neurocognitive
      decline on a battery of tests.

      II. Assessment of symptom burden, as measured by the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory- Brain
      Tumor Module (MDASI-BT).

      III. Assessment of quality adjusted survival and health outcomes using the European Quality
      of Life Five Dimension Five Level scale questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).

      IV. Assessment of local control, in brain control. V. Assessment of progression free survival
      (PFS), and overall survival (OS). VI. Assessment of side effects and toxicities.

    <description>Neurocognitive function as measured by neurocognitive decline on a Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) for Trail Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in neurocognitive function as measured by neurocognitive decline on a battery of tests conducted by the primary investigator or a trained member of the clinical team</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient will serve as his or her own control, and the relative decline in HVLT-R scores from baseline to pre-specified post-treatment internals will be defined as follows: ΔHVLTi = (HVLTB − HVLTF) ÷ HVLTB, where B = baseline and F = follow-up. A positive change indicates a decline in function. Comparison of HVLT-R DR results between control and different time points will be tested using the one-side Wilcoxon signed rank test with significance level of .05. The dichotomous indicator of neurocognitive decline based on this battery of tests at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months will be analyzed using a repeated measures logistic regression model.</description>
