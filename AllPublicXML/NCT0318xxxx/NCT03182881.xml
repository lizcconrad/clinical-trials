    <textblock>
      Objective. To compare the effectiveness of myofascial therapy against manual lymphatic
      drainage in the reduction of sequelae secondary to conservative surgery and radiotherapy in
      women who survived breast cancer.

      Design. Randomized clinical trial. Site. Faculty of Physiotherapy of the University of
      Valencia. Participants. Twenty-four patients were included in the study. Interventions. 13
      patients were randomly assigned to treatment with myofascial therapy and 11 to receive manual
      lymphatic drainage.

      Main measurements. Pain measured using the Visual Analogue Scale, shoulder joint range,
      shoulder functionality using the DASH questionnaire, quality of life assessed using the
      FACT-B questionnaire, and the depressed status of the patients using the PHQ-9 . All of this
      was assessed before and after treatment, and one month later as follow-up.

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (EVA) was used. This scale consists of marking on a horizontal line of 10 cm in length VAS is a 10-point rating scale (0 = absolute discomfort and 10 = full comfort).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of 36 items separated into two components: a general one formed by the first 27 items, and a specific one related to the symptoms of breast cancer constituted by the remaining 9 items. The survey represents five domains: physical well-being (7 items), social and family welfare (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), functional well-being (7 items) and a specific subscale related to breast cancer and its treatment.</description>

    <measure>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast (FACT-B). This questionnaire is a specific instrument for assessing quality of life related to upper limb problems. It consists of 30 items, which assess situations of daily life and the patient responds by giving a score to each item that ranges from 1 &quot;no difficulty&quot;, 2 &quot;Little difficulty&quot;, 3 &quot;Moderate difficulty&quot;, 4 &quot;Very difficult&quot; and 5 &quot;Unable&quot;.</description>

    <description>The measurement of the angular travel of all the movements of the shoulder was evaluated through a universal goniometer which proved to be a valid and reliable instrument.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive state</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated using the patient's health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). It consists of 9 items that assess the presence of depressive symptoms during the last two weeks. The score range is 0-27, each item ranges from 0 (never) to 3 (more than half the days).</description>

    <description>Myofascial Release (MR), with the purpose of releasing fascial restriction zones and major fibrosis (thoraco-brachial) caused by restriction after CM tto. IM therapy was applied to the affected area. The position of the patient was identical during both treatment sessions.</description>

    <description>It was applied following the Leduc method with the patient in a supine position with 30º elevation of the arm and very superficial and smooth maneuvers were performed in the axillary lymph nodes, in the chest region and in the arm with the same sequence as Guerero et al. The objective of the application in our study is to obtain a beneficial treatment for the patient since it produces an increase of blood and lymphatic circulation, with positive effects on the peripheral vegetative nervous system.</description>

    <description>For the use of the treatment the bases of Pilat, A. 2016 were followed. The global and specific techniques for the periganglionar and upper thoracic region were chosen. The application of each smooth maneuver three-dimensional fascial movement has been carried out has an approximate duration of about 10 minutes and a total of 50 minutes.</description>
