  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to verify the effect of a combined supplementation [n-3 PUFA (known
      to induce anti-inflammatory effects) plus vitamin E (known for its antioxidant properties)]
      on lipidic, glycemic, redox status and inflammatory parameters in type 2 diabetic patients.
      In addition, considering that exercise, at high intensities, can induce a transient
      inflammatory state and increase oxidative stress (OS) markers, the investigators tested if
      our nutritional intervention could attenuate this response within this population (thus,
      using high intensity exercise as inductor of acute inflammatory/OS state).

      Herein the investigators tested the effect of eight weeks of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acid (n-3 PUFA) and vitamin E supplementation before and after an acute high intensity
      exercise bout on lipid profile, glycemic, redox and inflammatory parameters in type 2
      diabetic (T2DM) patients. Thirty T2DM patients, without chronic complications, took part in
      this study. Blood and urine samples were collected after 12 h-fasting state for baseline
      biochemical analysis. Thereafter, subjects performed an incremental workload VO2max test on a
      cycle ergometer to determine the load of the high intensity submaximal exercise. On the
      following week, blood samples were collected before and immediately after the exercise test
      for measurements of oxidative stress (OS) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).
      Afterwards, participants were randomly allocated into two groups: placebo (gelatin) and n-3
      PUFA (capsules containing 180 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, 120 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and
      2 mg of vitamin E). Three capsules were ingested daily for eight weeks. Then, the examination
      protocol and the exercise test were repeated and the samples collected.

    <intervention_model_description>The selected subjects were referred to the University laboratory. During their first visit, the subjects were submitted to perform the first high intensity sub-maximal test. In the same day, volunteers received the supplementation capsules that should be taken throughout eight weeks, as described in the supplementation section.
The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: (1) group placebo and (2) n-3 PUFA group. After the supplementation period, all subjects reported back to hospital to biochemical testing and thereafter to the university exercise laboratory for the second high intensity sub-maximal test, following the same protocol described above.</intervention_model_description>
