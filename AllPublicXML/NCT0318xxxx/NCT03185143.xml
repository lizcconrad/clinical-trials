  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof-of-concept study compares side-by-side ALLOD-2 to sumatriptan in the acute
      treatment of migraine.

      The investigational product (ALLOD-2), is a combination of two marketed drugs. Both drugs are
      used at much lower doses than the doses used for the approved indications.

      The combination is a First-in-Class drug due to its new and unique mechanism of action.

    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening visit, at home treatment of a migraine attack with a single
      dose of the study drug within 8 weeks, and End-of-Study Visit 2-7 days after the treatment of
      a moderate or severe migraine attack. The duration of patients' participation in the study is
      up to 9 weeks.
