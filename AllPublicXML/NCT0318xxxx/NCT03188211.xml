  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and the main cause of
      cardioembolic stroke. Oral Anticoagulation (OAC) has been shown to significantly prevent
      AF-related thromboembolism, however, despite convincing evidences and current guidelines
      recommendations, OAC tends to be underused in clinical practice especially in the oldest.
      Education and training to appropriately select people suitable for OAC for stroke prevention
      could be pivotal in the decision making process. According to the study project, physicians
      working in Internal Medicine and Geriatric wards, where are mainly admitted elderly people
      with AF, will undergo to a program of e-learning through computer-based simulation method
      reproducing clinical scenarios of patients aged 65 years or older, with known or newly
      diagnosed AF, admitted to hospital for any medical reason and requesting that a decision
      about long-term antithrombotic therapy is taken.

      Primary objective of the study is to investigate whether such educational intervention will
      improve the appropriate use and prescription rate of OAC in hospitalised elderly patients
      with AF, multimorbidity and polypharmacy, in comparison to the usual practice.

      The study will be a cluster randomised controlled trial involving a network of Internal
      Medicine and Geriatrics wards. Thirty-two wards will be recruited based on voluntary
      participation and randomised to receive an educational intervention through computer-based
      simulation, (N=16) or to continue with the usual practice (N=16). Subjects receiving the
      intervention will be all the staff physicians of the wards randomised in the intervention
      arm.

      The impact of the intervention compared with the usual practice will be evaluated in patients
      aged 65 years or older admitted to the participating centres with a known diagnosis of AF or
      newly diagnosed with AF during the hospitalisation.

    <description>Clinicians allocated to intervention arm will receive an e-learning educational program based on simulation-based technologies (Dr Sim). Dr Sim provides a powerful editing system that allows to create clinical cases according to the educational need and purposes. It will be distributed on an e-learning platform, allowing the user to act in a highly interactive learning environment. Management of the virtual patients is carried out interactively and each diagnostic and or therapeutic choice will be supported by any scientific data, guidelines recommendations, drug descriptions and literature references useful to address the best choice for that specific patient as it should be in real practice.</description>
