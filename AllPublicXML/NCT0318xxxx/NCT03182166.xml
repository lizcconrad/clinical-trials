  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is planned to enroll 80 UC patients who will require optimization of golimumab after
      secondary LOR. The review of the study protocol and its approval by an Independent Ethics
      Committee of the University of Saint Etienne are pending. All patients enrolled will give
      their written informed consent before being included. This study will be conducted in
      accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of
      Helsinki, in compliance with the approved protocol, good clinical practice and applicable
      regulatory requirements. Patients will visit the investigator from screening visit to visit 6
      at W-1, W0, W2, W4, W8, and at the end of the follow-up at wk 24. During their participation,
      patients will record clinical parameters required to calculate the partial Mayo score
      reported over 3 days prior to the visit and endoscopy at W0, W2 (optional) , W4, W8
      (optional) and at the end of the follow-up to calculate total Mayo score.

    <description>The optimization procedure is:
For patients treated at 50 mg of golimumab every 4 weeks (less than 80 kg) will have an increase dose of golimumab: 100 mg every 4 weeks for 8 weeks. They will have rectosigmoidoscopy for measured mayo score and blood samples for measured the concentration of golimumab antibodies.
For patients treated at 100 mg of golimumab every four weeks (more than 80 kg) will have an increase dose of golimumab: treated at 100 mg every 2 weeks for 4 weeks.
They will have rectosigmoidoscopy for measured mayo score and blood samples for measured the concentration of golimumab antibodies.</description>
