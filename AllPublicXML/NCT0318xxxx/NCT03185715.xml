  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple pregnancies are considered an ART complication. The only effective way to reduce its
      incidence is to transfer a single embryo. Nonetheless, there is some reluctance among the
      patients to accept this strategy. In IVF/ICSI programs, it has been demonstrated that, after
      receiving the information about the similar cumulative live birth rate after single embryo
      transfer (SET) and double embryo transfer (DET) and the obstetric and perinatal risks of
      multiple pregnancy, a significant number of patients opt for SET. Up to date, no comparable
      studies have been published in oocyte recipients. The aim of this study is to evaluate if the
      information given to the patients influence their preference on the number of embryos to be
      transferred. It also seeks to identify factors which determine the initial preference and
      factors which can explain a hypothetic change in this preference.

    <description>All recipients completed a validated self-report questionnaire on the preference on the number of embryos to be transferred and the relevance for the decision-making process attributed to certain factors. The questionnaire also included questions on sociodemographic characteristics, medical-reproductive background and cycle's results and risks perception. All recipients received oral and written counselling. After counselling, during the treatment, the recipients completed a second questionnaire in order to check if their decision had changed.</description>
