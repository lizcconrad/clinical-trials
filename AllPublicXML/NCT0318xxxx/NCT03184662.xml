  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition whose prevalence is increasing globally. Kidney
      disease is a key complication of diabetes and is among the most common cause of end-stage
      renal disease, requiring renal replacement therapy.

      It has been shown that the trajectory of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate
      - eGFR) is of great prognostic value for renal and cardiovascular endpoints in diabetic
      patients. However the clinical use of this prognostic marker is not associated to date with a
      clear therapeutic intervention, effective in patients with type 2 diabetes identified with
      this biomarker.

      In France, type 2 diabetes patients have twice less physical activity than non-diabetic
      persons. Recently, it has been published that physical activity was associated with an
      improvement of renal risk in patients with type 2 diabetes, recruited from the LOOK-AHEAD
      study. It was demonstrated that high-intensity physical activity (HIPA) can have several
      additional advantages over moderate-intensity, on blood pressure improvement, and
      cardiovascular risk profile modification. In addition, this procedure was shown to be safe in
      patients with high cardiovascular risk.

      We plan to perform a randomized intervention comparing a structured program of high-intensity
      physical activity (HIPA) vs standard recommendations for physical activity on renal function
      decline (primary outcome) and mortality, renal and cardiovascular endpoints, patients' safety
      and quality of life (secondary outcomes). Study participants will be patients with
      established type 2 diabetes and a high renal risk, identified by rapid renal function
      decline, defined as a eGFR slope below -5ml/min per 1.73 m2/yr. The intervention is planned
      to last for 2 years.
