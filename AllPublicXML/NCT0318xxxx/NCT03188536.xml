  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the multiple myeloma (MM) participants with
      symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease in Spain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult participants with a diagnosis of MM who have received at least one previous treatment
      line and have experienced symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease in the previous 6
      months, who are still in follow-up at the time of the study visit will be observed in this
      study.

      The study will look into sociodemographic data, current clinical and therapeutic data,
      clinical data relative to the latest relapse and clinical data at diagnosis and previous
      relapses will be collected.

      The study will enroll approximately 350 patients.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in a total of 30 public sites in Spain. The overall
      time to collect data will be approximately 1 year from June 2017 to May 2018.

    <measure>Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire- Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QOL scale. Most of the 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL. The questionnaire is completed with assessment over the previous 7 days.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-MY20 has 20 items across 4 independent subscales, 2 functional subscales (body image, future perspective), and 2 symptoms scales (disease symptoms, and side effects of treatment). Scores are averaged, and transformed scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the future perspective scale, higher score = better perspective of the future. For the body image scale, higher scores = better body image. Higher score for the disease symptoms scale = higher level of symptomatology. The questionnaire is completed with assessment over the previous 7 days.</description>
