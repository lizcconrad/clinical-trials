  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy with
      involving compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Although many conservative
      managements of CTS, the effectiveness of these methods is insignificant or only persist for a
      short duration. The platelet rich plasma (PRP) is a new and potential treatment for patients
      with kinds of musculoskeletal disorders and recent reports showed being beneficial for
      peripheral neuropathy in animal studies. Since 2014, four small clinical trials showed the
      positive effect of PRP in peripheral neuropathy. Among these studies, two small trials showed
      beneficial effect of PRP for patients with mild CTS. However, the definite clinical effect of
      PRP for peripheral neuropathy from currently published studies is unclarified because these
      studies enrolled a few patients and lacked long-term follow-up (no more than 6 months
      follow-up).

      After obtaining written informed consent, patients of clinically diagnosed with bilateral CTS
      were randomized into intervention and control side. Intervention group received one-dose
      ultrasound-guided PRP injection and control group received one-dose ultrasound-guided normal
      saline injection. No additional treatment after injection through the study period. The
      primary outcome is visual analog scale (VAS) and secondary outcomes include Boston Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve, sensory
      nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve, and finger pinch strength. The evaluation was
      performed pretreatment as well as on the 2nd week, 1st, 3rd, 6th month and one year after the
      treatment.

    <description>The antidromic sensory nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve was performed on all subjects according to the protocol reported by the American Academy of Neurology (USA).
