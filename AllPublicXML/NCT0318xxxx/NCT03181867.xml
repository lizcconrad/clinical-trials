      Background:

      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. When prostate
      cancer is confined to the prostate there is a high chance of cure. However, it is outside the
      prostate or comes back after treatment, additional therapy may be needed. Current methods of
      imaging prostate cancer are limited. Researchers want to see if a radiotracer called
      18F-DCFPyL can identify prostate cancer in patients who have a high risk of cancer spreading
      outside the prostate or who have signs of recurrent cancer after treatment.

      Objectives:

      To see if the radiotracer 18F-DCFyL can help identify prostate cancer in the body before or
      after therapy.

      Eligibility:

      Men ages 18 and older who have prostate cancer that has been newly diagnosed, or has relapsed
      after radiation or surgery

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have blood
      taken.

      Participants will be divided into 2 groups.

        -  Group 1 will be men with cancer that has been newly diagnosed as high risk by their
           doctor who are scheduled to have prostate removal surgery or undergo biopsy before
           radiation therapy.

        -  Group 2 will be men who have presumed prostate cancer relapse after prostate removal
           surgery or radiation therapy.

      Both groups will have scans taken. Participants will lie still on a table in a machine that
      takes pictures of their body. 18F-DCFyL will be injected by intravenous (IV) line.

      Participants will be contacted for follow-up after scans.

      Participants in Group 1 may have surgery to remove their prostate gland or a biopsy to remove
      some prostate tissue. This procedure will be standard of care and is not a part of this
      study. They will also have an extra MRI scan of their prostate. For this, a tube, called an
      endorectal coil, will be placed in their rectum. Other tubes may be wrapped around the inside
      of their pelvis. A contrast agent will be given by IV.

      Participants in Group 2 may also undergo an MRI of the pelvis and may have a biopsy of
      abnormalities found on the 18F-DCFyL scan.

      Participants will have data about their prostate cancer collected for up to 1 year.

      Background

        -  Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men.

        -  Patients with high risk but apparently localized disease are often understaged because
           disease beyond the prostate is not well detected and thus leads to overtreatment with
           prostatectomy

        -  Recurrence of PCa after surgery or radiation is very common and sometimes progresses to
           death.

        -  Early intervention for recurrence has been shown to be of benefit but current methods of
           localizing recurrence are either insensitive (CT), non-specific (MRI) or both (bone
           scan) Many prostate cancers express the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) a
           transmembrane protein with NAALADase (N-acetylated-alphalinked- acidic dipeptidase) and
           folate hydrolase enzymatic activity. PSMA is also expressed in angiogenesis but
           otherwise has limited expression in normal tissue.

        -  An initial test of (18)F-DCFBC, a first-generation PET agent targeting PSMA, in patients
           with advanced local disease and biochemically recurrent prostate cancer demonstrated the
           potential of PET to detect sites of recurrence but it was hampered by excessive blood
           pool activity.

        -  (18)F-DCFPyL, a second generation PSMA PET agent, binds with high affinity to PSMA yet
           clears rapidly from the blood pool and thus, whole-body PET imaging with this agent, may
           provide a new tool in staging high risk cancers and detecting recurrent disease.

      Primary Objective

      - To assess the ability of (18)F-DCFPyL to accurately stage high-risk primary prostate cancer
      and detect sites of recurrent prostate cancer.

      Eligibility

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  ECOG 0-2

        -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

        -  Patients fit criteria for one of the following categories:

             -  Cohort 1: known localized high risk prostate cancer (PSA &gt;10, Gleason 8-10 or
                clinical stage greater than or equal to T2c) with evidence of disease on standard
                imaging, or

             -  Cohort 2: nonspecific or no evidence of disease on standard imaging modality AND
                biochemical prostate cancer relapse with a PSA &gt; 0.2 ng/ml

      Design

      This is a single site study enrolling a total of 330 patients; 55 patients with presumed
      localized high risk prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy or biopsy within 4
      months of enrollment and 275 patients with suspected recurrent prostate cancer without
      definitive evidence of disease on conventional imaging. All patients will undergo a standard
      of care, clinical multiparametric endorectal coil MRI in the NCI Molecular Imaging Clinic
      within 4 months of the PET scan.
