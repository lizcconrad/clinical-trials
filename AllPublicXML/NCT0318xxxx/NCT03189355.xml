  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With a prevalence of more than 15% in ICU, septic shock today represents a real public health
      problem and remains the leading cause of mortality in ICU. Undernutrition is characterized by
      an alteration of the body composition and in particular by a loss of muscle mass. In
      intensive care, there are indirect elements suggesting a link between loss of muscle mass and
      prognosis.

      Muscle mass results from a balance between the pathway of proteolysis and that of protein
      synthesis, depending on many factors, not one of the most important are insulin. The protein
      PTP1B (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B), by the dephosphorylation of its numerous substrates,
      constitutes an endogenous regulator of numerous intracellular signaling pathways, including
      that of insulin. PTP1B could play a role in the protein synthesis abnormalities observed
      during sepsis leading clinically to impaired body composition including muscle body mass.
      Therefore, we propose to study the association between PTP1B and loss of muscle mass in
      patients in sepsis in resuscitation.

      The intestinal barrier plays an essential role in protecting against microbial luminal flora
      and the phenomenon of bacterial translocation. Zonulin is one of the major regulators of
      tight junctions, important actors in the intestinal barrier function. The increase in plasma
      zonulin levels, greater than 0.6 ng / mg, is directly correlated with increased intestinal
      permeability (16). However, elevation of plasma zonulin has never been evaluated in septic
      resuscitation patients. This is why we propose the evaluation of the association between
      plasma zonulin and the loss of muscle mass in these resuscitation patients.
