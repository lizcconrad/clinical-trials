  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhancing children's sleep may be a novel approach for prevention of obesity and
      cardiovascular (CV) disturbance. Observational studies with children demonstrate that short
      sleep increases risk of obesity and other CV risk factors. Randomized controlled trials with
      children 8-11 years old demonstrate that enhancing sleep duration leads to positive changes
      in eating and activity behaviors and weight status, particularly for children who enhance
      their sleep the most. Enhancing sleep may be particularly important for racial minority
      children and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds given their increased risk for short
      sleep, obesity and CV risk factors. In this study two active obesity preventive interventions
      will be evaluated: a) enhancing sleep alone (Optimize Sleep [OS]), and b) enhancing sleep
      along with eating and activity behaviors that have demonstrated efficacy for obesity
      prevention and are implicated in self-regulatory pathways related to sleep (i.e., energy
      dense snack foods and beverages, TV viewing, and physical activity) (OS-Plus). Two hundred
      four children 8-11 years old who are African American/black, primarily from low socioeconomic
      backgrounds, and who sleep &lt; 9.5 hours/night into a 12-month study will be enrolled. Children
      will be randomly assigned to either OS or OS-Plus. Over the 6-month treatment phase, all
      children will attend an 8-session treatment; monthly phone contacts will occur during
      maintenance (6-12 months). Primary aim is to determine the efficacy of OS-Plus relative to OS
      on change in body mass index z-score (BMIz) at end of treatment. Secondary aims will assess
      efficacy of OS-Plus relative to OS on additional cardiometabolic risk factors, eating and
      activity behaviors. Exploratory aims will assess maintenance of effects at 12 months.
