  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, open-label, non-controlled, multicenter phase II clinical trial
      with two different primary objectives: a biological and a clinical objective.

      From a clinical point of view, the objective is to assess the clinical benefit of the
      combination of palbociclib and hormonotherapy in patients with advance breast cancer that had
      previously received endocrine therapy in combination with palbociclib and had achieved
      clinical benefit during palbociclib treatment with subsequent disease progression.

      From a biological point of view, the challenge is to define a molecular profile that allow
      identifying patients that could benefit more from continuing on palbociclib after progression
      on a prior palbociclib-containing regimen

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive palbociclib capsules orally for 21 days every four weeks in
      combination with endocrine therapy (physician's choice based on prior administered agent
      including tamoxifen, exemestane, fulvestrant, anastrozole, or letrozole).

      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression (with the exception of patients who
      develop isolated progression in the brain), unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation
      from the study treatment for any other reason.

      Patients discontinuing the study treatment period will enter a post-treatment follow-up
      period during which survival and new anti-cancer therapy information will be collected every
      six months (± 14 days) from the last dose of investigational product. The treatment follow-up
      period will conclude at six months after the last patient has received first treatment dose
      in the study.
