      Background: Youth from low-income and minority families are disproportionately affected by
      obesity and its complications. This study presented pilot work to develop and implement a
      multi-component physical activity and healthy eating intervention at a Boys &amp; Girls Club
      (BGC) after school program.

      Methods: Using a community-based participatory approach, BGC staff and academic researchers
      developed intervention components informed by formative studies and based on a social
      ecological theory framework. Components included healthy eating and physical activity policy
      implementation, staff training, a challenge/self-monitoring program for healthy behaviors, a
      peer-coaching program for healthy behaviors, and a social marketing campaign. Preliminary
      intervention efficacy was assessed through a single group, pre-post study design with
      measured collected at baseline and 6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy was assessed with a survey adapted from instruments developed for the Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise plus Nutrition program for low-income, ethnically diverse adolescents. It was scored on a 10-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (extremely confident).</description>

    <description>Motivation for physical activity was scored on a 10-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all motivated) to 10 (extremely motivated).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in body mass index</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For body mass index (BMI), weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a single scale. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadiometer. BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height squared (m2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Kinetic Activity Monitor accelerometer was used for objective physical activity assessment. Participants were asked to wear the accelerometer at their waist during waking hours for 10 consecutive days. The accelerometer was activated and data collected without providing feedback to participants. A valid assessment required 5 days of wear for at least 10 hours a day. Data output included sedentary time and time spent performing mild, moderate, and vigorous physical activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dietary quality</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary assessment was performed with the Beverage and Snack Questionnaire 2. The instrument was adapted to include nine items (on a 7-point Likert scale) that addressed consumption of fruits, vegetables, and sugar sweetened beverages. The Likert scale ranged from &quot;never or less than 1 per week&quot; to &quot;4+ per day.&quot; The greater number of fruits and vegetables, and fewer number of sugar sweetened beverages were considered a positive change in dietary quality.</description>
