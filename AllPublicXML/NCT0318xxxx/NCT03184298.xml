  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will provide data concerning dating and sexual interactions that occur
      on Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The investigators will be able to use data from this research
      to develop a program that promotes health in men's sexual and dating relationships and
      address the role of alcohol in sex and dating in subsequent research studies. The long term
      goal of this research is to reduce rates of sexual assault in the military by providing a
      sexual assault prevention program tailored to at risk male Soldiers that can be disseminated
      across military posts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that one beneficial preliminary step to sexual assault prevention is the
      examination of a population's social norms pertaining to sex, dating, and alcohol- use.
      Studies show that the social norms surrounding these behaviors can be risk factors that
      increase the likelihood that certain high-risk men will perpetrate sexual assault.

      Among college-age men, research on social norms has been used to inform the development of a
      sexual assault prevention program that positively impacts high-risk men. A hallmark of this
      approach is its exploration of the climate of a given population with regard to sex, dating
      and alcohol-use, and its use of data gathered to inform the development of a sexual assault
      program. Researchers have yet to study the effectiveness of this approach in the U.S. Army.

      It has been well documented that sexual assault in the Army carries a significant threat to
      the readiness of the force. As such, the Army continues to make strong and laudable efforts
      to reduce sexual assault. However, there remains a need to better understand how young
      at-risk men behave in the social situations where sexual assault can occur and what they
      subjectively believe about these behaviors in order to effectively reduce perpetration.

      In order to fill this gap, the investigators propose to conduct exploratory research on the
      climate of sex, dating, and alcohol-use at Fort Bragg via anonymous questionnaires and
      confidential interviews and focus groups. The data from this research has the potential to
      produce insights that could help leaders and the investigators more effectively promote
      health in male Soldiers' dating and sexual relationships.
