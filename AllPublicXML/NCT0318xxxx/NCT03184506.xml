  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inadvertent perioperative hypothermia is an unintentional drop in core body temperature below
      36°C. Intraoperative hypothermia can lead to serious clinical complications such as,
      myocardial ischemia, coagulopathy, immunosuppression, and surgical wound infection.
      Hypothermia develops easily during surgeries that require irrigation fluid, such as
      laparoscopic surgery and transurethral resection of the prostate. Although isothermic
      irrigation fluid was suggested to prevent perioperative hypothermia, it can be difficult to
      warm a large volume of irrigation fluid.

      Re-distribution after induction of anesthesia is the most important cause of perioperative
      hypothermia. The extent of re-distribution is proportional to the gradient between the core
      and peripheral compartments. Pre-warming increases the heat content of the peripheral thermal
      compartment, reducing the gradient for redistribution. Recently, A recent-meta analysis
      suggested that as a single strategy, preoperative forced air warming had significant benefits
      than other warming methods. Also, it was reported that only 20 (or even 10) min of
      pre-warming mostly prevented patients from perioperative hypothermia under general
      anesthesia. However, few studies have examined whether short time pre-warming can reduce
      hypothermia due to a large amount of irrigation fluid during surgery under spinal anesthesia.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the application of preoperative forced air
      warming set to high temperature (&gt; 43°C) for brief period can prevent hypothermia or
      shivering during procedures requiring large volumes of cold irrigation.

    <description>On arrival at the preoperative care unit, assignments were determined using an opaque sealed envelope opened by investigator with no clinical involvement in the study. In the pre-warming group, the forced-air blanket (COVIDIEN™ WarmTouch™ Full Body/Multi Access Blanket, Covidien Ilc, Mansfield, MA, USA) was positioned over the whole body except head and neck, covered by cotton blanket. Forced air warmer (COVIDIEN™ WarmTouch™ WT6000 Warming Unit, Covidien Ilc, Mansfield, MA, USA) was set to 'high level' (45℃) during 20 min. During the warming procedure, patients were asked every 5 min about their thermal comfort; if they felt overheated, the warmer was lowered to 41℃</description>
