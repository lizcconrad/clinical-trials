  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a prevalent and debilitating symptom experienced by cancer
      survivors. CRF can persist for months or years after cancer therapy is completed and has a
      negative impact on all areas of mental and physical function. Treatment options for CRF are
      extremely limited and finding safe, inexpensive, and effective interventions for managing
      this distressing symptom are urgently needed. Massage therapy is one of the fastest growing
      complementary therapies. A recently completed study in breast cancer survivors with CRF found
      that Swedish Massage Therapy (SMT) caused a significant reduction in fatigue and improvement
      in quality of life. This study investigates the effects of massage therapy on CRF among
      prostate cancer survivors. The study will evaluate whether SMT improves quality of life,
      depression, and anxiety. Second, this study will evaluate if SMT reduces CRF by decreasing
      the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Lastly, to establish measures of reduced
      fatigue beyond self report at the treatment visits, the researchers will implement
      continuous, real-time monitoring of physiologic and psychological signs and symptoms,
      throughout the treatment period. This study will improve care for CRF and other
      hard-to-manage symptoms of cancer treatment and provide preliminary evidence of immune
      modulation as a potential mechanism of action.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of Swedish massage therapy
      (SMT) versus an active control condition (light touch, LT) on cancer related fatigue in men
      with prostatic cancer, at least 2 months after the end of their radiation therapy and who are
      on androgen depletion therapy. The primary outcome is the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory
      (MFI). Secondary outcomes are the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement System (PROMIS)
      Fatigue Scale, plasma concentrations of cytokine IL-6, self-reported quality of life,
      depression, and anxiety, wearable measures of activity and sleep, and Automated Monitoring of
      Symptom Severity (AMoSS) ratings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is the most common, and one of the most devastating symptoms among patients with
      cancer. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), cancer-related fatigue
      (CRF) is &quot;a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or
      cognitive exhaustion related to cancer or its treatment that is not proportional to recent
      activity&quot;. Fatigue occurs across the spectrum of cancer types and treatments. CRF has a
      negative impact on all areas of function, including mood, physical function, work
      performance, social interaction, family care, cognitive performance, schoolwork, and
      community activities. CRF has been rated as more troublesome and to have a greater negative
      impact on quality of life than other cancer-related symptoms such as pain, depression, and
      nausea. CRF can persist for months or years after cancer therapy is completed.

      Meaningful, evidence-based treatment options for CRF are limited. Over 50% of patients with
      cancer have used a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approach for symptom
      management and quality of life. One of the widely employed CAM interventions is massage
      therapy. Most of the studies investigating massage for patients with cancer focus on
      depression, anxiety, or pain as the outcomes of interest. A previous investigation of breast
      cancer survivors reported decreases in mood symptoms and an improvement in fatigue, however,
      CRF was not the primary outcome measure. This randomized clinical trial will test the
      efficacy of Swedish massage therapy (SMT) vs. an active control condition (light touch, LT)
      on cancer related fatigue in men with prostatic cancer, at least 2 months after the end of
      their radiation therapy, and who are on androgen depletion therapy. Participants will receive
      weekly treatments for 6 weeks.

      The aims of the study are as follows:

      Aim 1: To conduct a feasibility study to determine whether a 6-week SMT intervention can
      decrease CRF among prostate cancer survivors who have received both radiation and androgen
      deprivation therapy and have CRF.

      Aim 2: To determine whether the hypothesized decrease in CRF is due to SMT modulating the
      immune system of subjects with CRF. The researchers hypothesize that SMT will decrease plasma
      concentrations of IL-6 (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) more than LT and that the decrease in
      plasma IL-6 will mediate the decrease in fatigue as assessed with the MFI.

      Aim 3: To determine whether SMT improves self-reported quality of life, depression, and
      anxiety more than LT, as assessed (respectively) by the Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and
      Satisfaction Questionnaire - short form (Q-LES-Q), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms
      - Self-Report (QIDS-SR), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale.

      Aim 4: To evaluate the peripheral physiological changes associated with treatment of CRF. The
      researchers predict that treatment with SMT will cause a progressive increase in wearable
      measures of activity and step count, improved sleep quality (duration and latency), and
      decrease in pulse over 6 weeks when compared to baseline measures.

      Aim 5: To determine if valid and useful tests of SMT effectiveness for treating CRF can be
      obtained through daily self-report ratings of fatigue and continuous monitoring of
      physiological signs. The researchers predict that SMT will cause a significant decrease in
      daily self-ratings of fatigue and mood when compared to baseline ratings and that the
      decreases in daily self-ratings of fatigue and mood observed with SMT will correlate with
      changes in Q-LES-Q, QIDS-SR, GAD-7 scores obtained at in-person visits as well as
      physiological signs.

    <measure>Change in Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a brief (20-item) self-report instrument that assesses 5 dimensions (subscales) of fatigue, including general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced activity, and reduced motivation. Respondents indicate their level of agreement with fatigue related statements on a 5 point scale ranging from &quot;Yes, that is true&quot; = 1 to &quot;No that is not true&quot; = 5. Possible scores for each subscale range from 4 (no fatigue) to 20 (maximum fatigue). The primary outcome measure for this study will be the total of four MFI subscales (general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, and reduced motivation).</description>

    <description>The therapist uses non-aromatic massage oil to facilitate making long, smooth strokes over the body. Swedish massage is done with the subject covered by a sheet, a technique called &quot;draping.&quot; One part of the body is uncovered, massaged, and then covered up before moving onto another part of the body. Primary techniques used in the research protocol therapy are: effleurage, petrissage, tapotement. These will be administered according to a very specific, standardized protocol. The total session time will be 45 minutes.</description>
