  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the outcomes of patients treated with concomitant hip arthroscopy at
      the time of periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) for patients with hip dysplasia compared with
      patients treated with PAO alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no absolute indications for intraarticular assessment at the time of
      periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). Based on investigators' review of the literature and
      experience, patients who may benefit from intraarticular assessment are those with
      radiographic or MRI evidence of damage where an intraarticular inspection may help in
      determining whether a PAO is a reasonable procedure, those with mechanical symptoms likely
      related to labral pathology, round ligament or cartilage problems and those with hip
      dysplasia and cam deformities with limited range of motion that may benefit from femoral head
      neck junction osteochondroplasty. However, despite these relative indications today there is
      no clear evidence to suggest that these patients will do better than those that do not have
      intraarticular work done. Hence, the objective of this project is to determine whether
      intraarticular work at the time of PAO surgery leads to improved pain and function when
      compared to patients that do not undergo intraarticular work at the time of PAO.

    <masking_description>Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion. The first arm will be the &quot;PAO alone&quot; group who will receive a standard periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) on the day of surgery. The second arm will be the &quot;PAO + HA&quot; group who will receive a PAO and hip arthroscopy (HA) on the day of surgery. Any pathology if present that can be corrected with the arthroscope (cartilage and labral abnormalities) will be addressed. This will be followed by a standard PAO. Patients from both groups will have dressings placed in the location of hip arthroscopy portals to remain blinded to the treatment arm during the perioperative period. Only patients in the PAO + HA group will have incisions and sutures under these dressings. The dressings will come off for all patients after 2 weeks, which is standard of care. All other study team members will remain unblinded.</masking_description>

    <description>The Bernese periacetabular osteotomy has become the osteotomy of choice in North America for correction of the dysplastic hip. The ability to position the acetabular component in a specifically desired position for each individual patient improves joint biomechanics, restores joint balance and stability, and offloads the structures at risk for damage such as the labrum and the adjacent articular cartilage.</description>
