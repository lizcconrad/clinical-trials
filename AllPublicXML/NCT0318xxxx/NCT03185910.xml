      Being a mother is a huge change for women, and she will undergo a high degree of change and a
      strong threat in this transformation process. The purpose of this study is to explore the
      efficacy of a Mindfulness-Based Childbirth and Parenting(MBCP) Education Program on prenatal
      stress, depression, mindfulness, childbirth self-efficacy, and postnatal maternal outcomes.

      Randomized Controlled Trial comparing two education programs with health and singleton
      pregnant women is run by the Random Allocation Software (Saghaei, 2004). Use the G-Power
      3.1.9 windows: repeated measures and between factors among two groups to calculate the number
      of samples, and setting the power = .8, Î± = .05, effect size = .25. The estimated number of
      samples may be lost 20%, total 104 samples ( 52 samples in each group).

      The protocol for the study used MBCP education, this program helps participants practice in
      the present moment, so that they may develop more confidence and well-being during pregnancy.
      The MBCP course is held for 3 hrs once a week for 8 weeks. They also had the home practice of
      30 minutes a day with a DVD for the experimental group. The control group attending a
      hospital-based antenatal education program for 2 hrs once a month for 2 months from hospital
      staff nurses in all aspects of pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum. This study uses a
      standard verbal script to the eligible participants who were volunteers of pregnant women in
      the waiting room of metropolitan hospital in Taiwan.
