  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy need postpartum blood pressure (BP)
      surveillance to detect persistent hypertension. Various barriers result in only 30%
      attendance at postpartum BP visits. A more effective strategy is needed. Women with
      hypertension of pregnancy will be randomized to either text-based monitoring or office
      visits. Those randomized to the intervention will receive a BP cuff and text in their BP to
      an automated, clinician derived, HIPAA compliant text-based algorithm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a leading cause of maternal morbidity, mortality and obstetrical
      readmissions. Peak blood pressure usually occurs 3-6 days postpartum, and is typically
      unaccompanied by warning symptoms. Although there is a clear need for effective and reliable
      blood pressure surveillance after delivery, there are significant obstacles to in-person
      visits in the immediate postpartum period, including sleep deprivation, newborn care, and
      transportation needs. These barriers have proven real as we observed only 30-50% attendance
      to office blood pressure visits following delivery. This proposal will investigate whether
      text-based communication between patients and providers is an effective alternative method
      for monitoring postpartum hypertension in at risk women.

      Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with access to a cell phone with unlimited
      text message capabilities will be randomized to either office visit blood pressure checks
      after discharge or receive a blood pressure cuff and text in blood pressures for two weeks
      postpartum using a standardized, HIPAA compliant, physician derived automated platform.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be a randomized, two arm trial. Patient will be randomized to usual one time office visit based blood pressure check or to text-message based remote surveillance for two weeks. Randomization will be performed using a computer generated sequence using REDCAP. Demographic information will be collected from those who decline randomization or are ineligible in order to assess patient characteristics of those willing to be randomized and who meet eligibility.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Those randomized to remote surveillance will be provided with electronic blood pressure monitors prior to discharge and instructed on their use. Every day, for two weeks post-discharge, patients will receive a standard text message in the morning from a HIPAA compliant automated monitoring system reminding them to text their blood pressure. They will be asked to send in one blood pressure a day at minimum. They may be asked to send in more depending on the blood pressure result and clinical algorithm. This system will provide timely responses to patient texts and create a physician derived response to elevated blood pressures based on a programmed algorithm. Additionally, for blood pressures that reach a dangerous threshold, a clinical provider will be alerted per the algorithm and contact the patient for further evaluation.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or preeclampsia who deliver
             at HUP will be eligible to participate. All patients must be &gt; 18 years old, able to
             speak and read English, have a hypertension diagnosis, and have access to a cell phone
             with unlimited text message capabilities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women without access to a cell phone with unlimited text message capabilities will be
             excluded from the study in order to eliminate barriers to participate in remote
             surveillance. However, we will track the number of women not eligible for this reason
             in order to understand generalizability in an urban population.
