      A non-randomized prospective clinical, pilot study in a single centre assessing the safety
      and feasibility of the esophageal biodegradable covered stent for refractory benign
      esophageal strictures with or without fistulae. The follow-up will be 6 months form
      implantation. After 3 months a control endoscopy will take place to evaluate stent and
      degradation process.
