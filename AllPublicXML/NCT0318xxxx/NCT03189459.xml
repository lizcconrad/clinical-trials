  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced Parkinson's Disease is a debilitating, costly, and understudied condition. Improving
      access to comprehensive, specialized, in-home patient care and caregiver support offers the
      potential to minimize the downward spiral of morbidity and preventable healthcare
      utilization. The aim of this study is to test whether and to what degree an interdisciplinary
      home visit program, with and without peer mentoring for caregivers, will improve patient- and
      caregiver-reported outcomes and reduce healthcare costs when compared with usual care in
      advanced Parkinson's Disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This interdisciplinary home visit program consists of 4 visits to patients' homes over the
      course of one year from a team of a movement disorders doctor, a nurse, a research
      coordinator, and a social worker. The team will come to a patient's home and assess the needs
      of both the patient and caregiver, and connect the patient with any needed services. These
      visits can replace or be in addition to seeing another movement disorders doctor.

      As part of this study, not only would the patient receive home visits, but his/her caregiver
      would be paired with another caregiver from the community with lots of experience caring for
      someone with PD whose loved one may have passed away, but who volunteers to serve as a
      mentor. Current caregivers who enroll in the study will be asked to speak to their mentor
      once a week over a course of 4 months. These meetings can take place in person, by phone, or
      through video chat on an iPad that will be provided by our study team.

      The information collected from the study participants will be compared to data available in
      the National Parkinson's Foundation's Parkinson's Outcome Project. The data will be matched
      according to age, gender, and disease severity.

    <description>Patients will be asked to participate in four study visits, which will involve in-home clinical assessments, a needs assessment, and completion of some questionnaires. Additional information will be obtained from patients' routine medical records: their medical and medication history, family history, neurological examination findings, and office visit records.

    <description>Caregivers enrolling in the study will be asked to participate in the four home visits, which will involve in-home clinical assessments and completion of some questionnaires. After the first home visit, caregivers will be matched with a peer mentor, an individual who was a prior caregiver to someone with PD who is interested in sharing their knowledge, experience, and time to help improve the lives of current caregivers. Once a week, for a period of 4 months between home visits 2 and 3, caregivers will be asked to meet with their peer mentor, who will be trained to serve as a resource and listening ear, in addition to the medical team.

During this training, caregivers will be asked to complete some questionnaires about their background and caregiving experience. After completion of the mentorship training, peer mentors will be paired with a mentee who is a current caregiver enrolled in the home visit study along with their loved one with Parkinson's. Peer mentors will be asked to speak with their mentee once a week for 16 weeks. After a 16 week break, peer mentors will be paired with a second mentee and will repeat the process for another 16-week-long mentoring session.

             race, and any ethnicity.

          -  Subjects must have a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (inclusive of
             Parkinson's Disease Dementia) by a neurologist.

          -  Subjects will have been seen at least once in the past two years in the outpatient
             movement disorders clinic at Rush University Medical Center

          -  Subjects must be rated as HY stage 3-5 at the time of screening via chart review of
             the most recent clinical visit.

          -  Subjects must reside within a 60-minute public transit or driving distance of Rush
             University.

          -  Subjects must live at home (as defined by an independent dwelling such as an
             apartment, condominium, or house owned or rented by, or provided to/shared with the
             subject).

          -  Subjects must be home-bound according to the Medicare definition: &quot;Leaving your home
             isn't recommended because of your condition; your condition keeps you from leaving
             home without help (such as using a wheelchair or walker, needing special
             transportation, or getting help from another person); leaving home takes a
             considerable and taxing effort.&quot; (http://www.medicare.gov/pubs/pdf/10969.pdf)

          -  Subjects have one or more of the following criteria, as determined by the referring
             neurologist: motor or cognitive fluctuations, multi-morbidity, medication
             mismanagement, cognitive impairment, symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, high risk
             for hospitalization or hospital readmission, high risk for nursing facility admission,
             suspected elder abuse, recent history of increased falls in home, caregiver burnout
             suspected, &gt;2 cancelled or no-show appointments with the movement disorders providers

          -  Subjects must either: 1) demonstrate capacity to consent, or 2) pending caregiver
             capacity assessment and caregiver consent, give assent or not dissent. Excluding
             individuals with cognitive impairment, dementia, depression, or psychosis would limit
             the generalizability of this study given the prevalence of each in advanced PD.

             &gt;20 hours weekly engaged in care-related tasks related to the patient-subject. The
             caregiver-subject does not need to be the patient-subject's health care proxy or
             guardian.

          -  Each subject must demonstrate capacity to consent.

          -  Each subject must agree to participation in the nested trial of caregiver peer
