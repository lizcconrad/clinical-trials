  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) cause almost all cases of cervical cancer.
      Vaccines that protect against HPV can substantially reduce the risk of cervical cancer.
      However, HPV vaccination rates are too low, especially in countries with very high rates of
      cervical cancer. HPV vaccines are expensive-many countries cannot afford them-more than one
      dose is needed, and giving multiple doses is difficult. Researchers want to find out if one
      dose prevents HPV infection. If it does, more people might get the vaccine.

      Objective:

      To find out if giving only one dose of either the Cervarix or Gardasil9 HPV vaccines work the
      same as giving two doses of these vaccines to young women.

      Eligibility:

      Females ages 12-20 who live in Costa Rica.

      Design:

      There are two components to the study: (1) a controlled, randomized, double-blinded
      non-inferiority clinical trial to compare one-dose to two-dose vaccination; and (2) a
      concurrent epidemiologic survey for HPV status among unvaccinated women.

      The trial will enroll twenty thousand girls 12 to 16 years old residing in Costa Rica.
      Participants will be randomized in two stages to one of four arms (one dose of the bivalent
      vaccine, two doses of the bivalent vaccine, one dose of the nonavalent vaccine and two doses
      of the nonavalent vaccine); the first randomization at enrollment will assign participants to
      one of the two study vaccines and at the second visit they will be randomized to one or two
      doses. Girls randomized to the one dose arm will receive an active control (i.e.: Tdap) at
      the time of the second vaccine dose. After vaccination, girls will be followed every six
      months for four years.

      The epidemiologic HPV survey will enroll a group of unvaccinated girls from the same
      geographic areas; they will range in age from 17 to 20. These women will attend two study
      visits six months apart to determine their HPV DNA status, there will be no additional
      followup. These women will be offered HPV vaccination at the enrollment and six-month study
      visits.

      At each visit, participants will fill out a questionnaire and give a urine sample. They may
      give blood samples. The older participants will use a swab to collect cervical cells from
      their vagina....

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer and other HPV-associated cancers comprise an important public health burden
      worldwide, with over 600,000 HPV-associated cancers diagnosed each year. Prophylactic human
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination with three doses of commercially available vaccines, the
      regimen currently approved by the FDA, is highly efficacious in preventing targeted
      carcinogenic HPV infections and related cervical cancer precursors. In some regions of the
      world, two-dose vaccination schedules for adolescents have started to be recommended, based
      on immunobridging studies demonstrating immunologic non-inferiority of two doses in that age
      group, compared with three doses of the vaccine in the adult women in the phase III efficacy
      trials. Still, the majority of women who are at the greatest lifetime risk for cervical
      cancer are not being vaccinated because cost and logistical considerations for administering
      multi-dose vaccine programs continue to impede progress in reducing this preventable cancer.

      The NCI-sponsored Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT) and the commercially-sponsored Papilloma
      TRIal against Cancer In young Adults (PATRICIA Trial), both of which tested the bivalent HPV
      vaccine, showed similar vaccine efficacy over four years among women who received one, two
      and three doses of the HPV16/18 vaccine, and stable antibody responses have been observed
      throughout the seven years of follow-up accrued to date in CVT, suggesting durability of
      responses. Additionally, 36-month preliminary analysis of a large, post-licensure trial of
      the quadrivalent vaccine in India showed similar protection against HPV16/18 cervical
      infection whether the women received one dose, two doses, or three doses. However, vaccine
      recipients in these trials were not randomized to receive these fewer doses, and
      immunogenicity among one-dose recipients was lower than that observed following two- or
      three-doses, leading regulatory bodies to conclude that the level of evidence in support of
      single-dose HPV vaccination is insufficient to warrant changes in current recommendations for
      two- or three- dose schedules.

      A study of the minimum number of doses needed to confer durable protection could provide
      seminal evidence to justify changing the current vaccine recommendation from two to one dose
      for adolescents. Therefore, we are proposing to conduct a trial in Costa Rica to formally
      evaluate one- and two-dose vaccination, and to estimate the public health benefit of one- and
      two-dose schedules versus none. More specifically, we will conduct a four-arm trial of 20,000
      12-to-16-year-old girls randomized, in two stages, to receive one or two doses of the Merck
      nonavalent (Gardasil-9) or GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals bivalent (Cervarix) HPV vaccines and
      to be followed initially for four years, to formally evaluate the non-inferiority of one
      versus two doses of each of these two vaccines. This trial will be complemented by an
      epidemiological HPV survey (followed by vaccination) to estimate the public health benefit of
      reduced-dosage vaccination versus none. As a primary endpoint, we will focus on the
      prevention of new, persistent infection by HPV types 16 and 18, because they account for the
      largest public health burden. The trial will also evaluate protection against the other
      cancer- and genital wart-causing HPV types, while documenting infection by non-vaccine HPV
      types to verify continued exposure among trial participants.

      In addition to the evaluation of efficacy against HPV infection, we propose to monitor
      participants immunological response to vaccination, to demonstrate robust, stable, and
      durable antibody responses following one- and two-dose vaccination, and to enable studies to
      compare immune responses induced by the two vaccines, which contain different adjuvants. This
      effort will establish the foundation for immunobridging studies that could accelerate future
      vaccine development. We envision that these immunobridging studies could bridge our study to
      different populations and age groups and/or to next-generation vaccines that are based on the
      same virus-like particle technology (i.e., biosimilar vaccines).

      We anticipate that results from this proposed effort will provide the evidence required for
      global policy changes towards single-dose vaccination programs, if non-inferiority of
      one-dose is demonstrated, and lead to a better understanding of antibody levels required for
      protection. If one-dose protection is observed in these first four years, follow-up might
      need to be extended by at least six years to assess durability of the response to
      vaccination. If one dose of either vaccine is found to be inferior to two doses, our study
      will also provide estimates of the impact of single dose vaccination versus none, so that
      policy makers in regions where widespread vaccination programs have yet to be implemented can
      consider the decrement in efficacy of one versus two dose vaccination in light of the
      estimated public health impact of a single-dose program. Finally, the proposed work holds the
      potential to transform current approaches to vaccine development, as it could provide the
      first example of a single dose (prime only) subunit vaccine that induces durable and
      protective (sterilizing) immunity.

      Randomized trial data on the comparative effectiveness of alternative vaccine and dose
      regimens is necessary. Public health policy makers also require information on the projected
      cost and long-term health outcomes associated with each vaccine regimen to make evidence-
      based decisions regarding the large-scale implementation of sustainable, cost-effective HPV
      vaccination programs. Mathematical simulation models of cervical carcinogenesis can integrate
      biologic, epidemiologic, economic, and behavioral data from the 1DT and other studies to
      project the long-term health and economic impact of different vaccine and dose regimens and
      evaluate the comparative- and cost-effectiveness of alternative vaccination strategies to
      inform public health policy. Optimal implementation policies may depend on the level and
      duration of efficacy for a single dose and achievable completion rates for a two-dose
      regimen. Even if one- dose protection is found to be lower than protection associated with
      two or three doses, the relative costs and effects of vaccinating more individuals with one
      dose might yield a greater reduction in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. We will use
      mathematical models to quantify the potential tradeoffs between resource utilization,
      simplicity of implementation and administration, and program effectiveness based on
      real-world data on intervention costs and effectiveness.
