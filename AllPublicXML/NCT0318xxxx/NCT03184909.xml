      Tulsi and its effects on facilitative cognitive enhancement through lowering levels of stress
      and anxiety. A randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ocimum Sanctum or Holy Basil, commonly called Tulsi is a traditional Indian herb. It is
      believed to bring about a facilitative enhancement of cognitive ability and lower stress
      levels in individuals. Stress and an inability to perform at a required level of cognition
      can induce anxiety. This study is looking at the effects of daily consuming Tulsi among a
      group of individuals who work in an environment that demands memory, attention and executive
      functioning.
