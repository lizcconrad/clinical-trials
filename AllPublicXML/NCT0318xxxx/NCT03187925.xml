      Patients undergoing open transcervical or endoscopic approach in which a laser or stapler is
      used to divide the common wall between the diverticulum and esophagus, or who are not
      surgical candidates but agree to follow-up.

    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-institutional study comparing the effectiveness of the above procedures
      will provide a large cohort using standardized diagnostic studies, diverticulum size
      measurements, treatment approaches, pre-operative and post-operative assessment of symptoms
      in order to both compare the effectiveness of the procedures and to stratify the patients in
      order to determine whether demographics such as age, pre-operative size, and/or
      peri-operative co-morbidities influence outcomes.

    <measure>Include dysphagia outcomes comparing both endoscopic and open repair of Zenker's diverticulum to develop preliminary evidence-based indications and long-term outcomes, exploring various relevant subset analyses.</measure>

    <description>Would standardize the above data and lend increased power due to its multi-institutional nature. The post-operative data will include the following surveys EAT-10, RSI, VHI in order to assess for post-operative resolution of symptoms as well as an esophagram at 12month</description>

    <description>The goal of the project is to perform the first prospective, multi-institutional long-term (5 year) study comparing the outcomes of open, transcervical versus rigid endoscopic treatment of cervical esophageal diverticulum and cricopharyngeal dysfunction in resolving associated symptoms, complications, and recurrence rates of dysphagia surgery. This study will also include cricopharyngeal bar as it pertains to an early Zenker's diverticulum.</description>

        No intended gender or racial/ethnic distribution. Intended age range is 18-100 years of
        age. The vulnerable population (patients) will be protected from potential coercion or
        undue influence as this is an observational study with elective participation in follow-up
        patient surveys in which patient data will otherwise be deidentified upon inspection

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of cervical esophageal diverticulum, with Zenker's as most
             common, or CP bar (with diagnosis of early Zenker) as indicated on an esophagram who
             the participating institutions enroll regardless of surgical management and future
             treatments. Patients undergoing open transcervical or endoscopic approach in which a
             laser or stapler is used to divide the common wall between the diverticulum and
             esophagus, or who are not surgical candidates but agree to follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who undergo division of the common wall between the diverticulum and
             esophagus using flexible endoscopy will not be included in the study.
