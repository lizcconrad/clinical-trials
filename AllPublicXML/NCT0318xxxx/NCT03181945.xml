  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no guidelines or studies evaluating duration of anti-epileptic drugs in central
      nervous system infections. The duration of anti-epileptic drug is extrapolated from traumatic
      brain injury in which duration of 1 weeks to 3 months is suggested. So the investigators plan
      to conduct this study to decide the optimal duration of anti-epileptic drug in acute
      symptomatic seizure in central nervous system infections

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Demography data, seizure details at diagnosis of acute encephalitis syndrome, details of
      etiology, neuroimaging findings and electroencephalography. A detailed neurological
      examination will be done in all participants and asked for seizure semiology at admission.
      Seizure details include seizure type, duration, number of seizures, number of days for which
      seizures were recurring, status epilepticus, encephalopathy in between seizures. After the
      initial assessment participants would be randomized into 2 groups: Group 1: Anti-epileptic
      drug for 4 weeks followed by taper in 10-14days and Group 2: Anti-epileptic drug for 12 weeks
      followed by tapering over 10-14days. The primary outcome would be be to study the seizure
      relapse rate (proportion) after stopping anti-epileptic drugs in participants with acute
      symptomatic seizure given 4weeks and 12 weeks anti-epileptic drug therapy in the two study
      groups.

      Clinical status will be assessed at enrollment as defined by Pediatric Cerebral Performance
      Category, Pediatric overall Performance Category and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended Pediatric
      Version (GOS-P)
