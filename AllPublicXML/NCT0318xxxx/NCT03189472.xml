  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized controlled pilot study to test the effects of
      Remotely-Supervised (RS)-tDCS using a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex montage to ameliorate
      fatigue and cognitive slowing in PD.

      Fatigue and slowed thinking are very prevalent symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease
      (PD). To date there are no concrete effective treatment available for either symptom. This
      study will test transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to ameliorate fatigue and
      slowed thinking in PD. tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that is low-cost,
      relatively safe, and reproducible when conducted in repeat clinic visits.

      Following procedures for our validated protocol, participants will receive training on the
      use of study tDCS device and pre configured laptop computer. The device will be programmed to
      deliver either active or sham tDCS (all study personnel and participants will be blinded),
      and operated with unlock codes provided by the study technician daily to release one session.
      Once trained, and following an initial in-clinic baseline tDCS tolerability test and initial
      treatment session, participants will use the equipment to complete the remaining sessions
      from their home using our tele medicine platform. Remote supervision will be provided using
      HIPAA secure online video conference with the study technician following clearly-defined
      operational procedures. Participants will be monitored to determine if any predefined &quot;stop&quot;
      criteria are met using VSee software, a telemedicine software. Additionally, Team Viewer
      software will allow study technicians to troubleshoot any computer issues, to initiate the
      video conference on behalf of participants, and to remotely supervise the entire tDCS
      session.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of PD confirmed by neurologist;

          -  Parkinson fatigue scale binary coding scoring a score of &gt; 7;

          -  Able to understand the informed consent process and provide consent to participate in
             the study

          -  Has stable and continuous access to internet service at home compatible with the study
             laptop (Wi-Fi or ethernet cable)

          -  Adequate internet capacity for remote monitoring, as tested by
             http://www.speedtest.net/)

          -  Subjects who are stable in their PD medication for 2 or more weeks prior to
             enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Visual, auditory and motor deficits that would prevent full ability to understand
             study instructions or operate the tDCS device or study laptop, as judged by treating
             neurologist or study staff

          -  Current chronic headaches or migraines. In addition, if a subject has had a change in
