  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immune chekpoints (ICI) are evaluated in many digestive cancers. Certain types of cancer
      appear to be rather refractory to ICI such as colorectal cancers (CRC). However, the MSI CRC
      representing approximately 15% of the CRCs exhibits a high mutational load which generates
      many potentially immunogenic neoantigens. In addition, strong expression of PD-L1 was found
      in the MSI CRCs relative to the CRC (MSS) stages. Localized MSI CRCs have a better prognosis
      than MSS CRCs, probably due to immunogenic neoantigens associated with a CD8 + T-specific
      immune response. On the oher hand, in metastatic CRC (mCRC) things are different because i)
      the MSI frequency is only 4 to 7% and ii) the good prognosis conferred by the MSI status is
      controversial.

      Preliminary results suggest that patients with MSI mCRC are highly sensitive to ICI even
      chemoresistant tumors receiving several lines of chemotherapy. Recently, another anti-PD1
      alone or in combination with an anti-CTLA4 (antigen associated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 4)
      was tested in the MSI CRCs and a selection of interesting results in heavily pretreated
      patients with a disease control rate of 56% for monotherapy and 81% for combinated therapy.

      Anti-PD1s now have marketing authorization for patients with melanoma and metastatic
      pulmonary carcinoma , Which are known to have a high level of mutations . ICIs appear to be
      as promising in MSI CRCs as in other tumors and therefore face the same major challenges.

      Avalumab is an anti-PD-L1 antibody recently tested in several different types of tumors with
      promising results and is currently being studied in phase III in gastric cancer. There is no
      data on the effectiveness of this ICI in the MSI mCRCs. In addition, only anti-PD1 was used
      in the MSI-mCRC and not the anti-PD-L1, and only in chemoresistance (3rd line or more). The
      main objective of the SAMCO study is to test the efficacy and tolerance of avelumab in the
      2nd line of treatment in patients with a MSI mCRC progression after standard 1st line
      chemotherapy +/- targeted therapy.
