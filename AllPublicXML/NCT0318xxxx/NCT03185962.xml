    <textblock>
      Extubation failure can directly worsen patient outcomes. Therefore, the decision to extubate
      is a critical moment during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay. The decision to extubate is
      usually made after a weaning readiness test involving spontaneous breathing on a T-piece or
      low levels of ventilatory assistance. However, extubation failure still occurs in 10 to 20%
      of patients. The investigators focused on previously reported physiological risk factors, and
      were able to obtain from common clinical practice: 1) age, 2) underlying cardiovascular
      disease, 3) underlying respiratory disease or occurrence of pneumonia, 4) rapid shallow
      breathing index (RSBI), 5) positive fluid balance during the previous 24 hours, 6) the ratio
      of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen, 7) Glasgow Coma Scale, 8)
      respiratory tract secretions. The investigators aimed to assess the incidence and risk
      factors for extubation failure among critically ill patients who passed the 30 min
      spontaneous breathing test (SBT) using a low level of pressure support (PS) with positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), in a prospective multicenter study.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      Reintubation within 48 hours after extubation (logistic regression will be used to assess the
      risk factors)

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        -  Use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation or nasal high flow within 48 hours
           after extubation.

        -  Risk factors for extubation failure, with quantitative variables expressed as means
           (standard deviation) or medians (interquartiles 25%-75%) and compared using the student
           t test or Wilcoxon test as appropriate

        -  Length of ICU and hospital stay, vital status at ICU and hospital discharge, 28-day
           mortality
