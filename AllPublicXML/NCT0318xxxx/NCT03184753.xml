      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous
      ovarian cancer immunogene-modified T cells (OC-IgT cells).

      Ovarian cancer (OC) is a cancer that forms in or on an ovary. The majority of OC arises from
      the epithelium (outer lining) of the ovary. In 2015 OC was found in 1.2 million women and
      resulted in 161,100 deaths worldwide. Among women it is the seventh-most common cancer and
      the eighth-most common cause of death from cancer. Treatment for OC consists of surgery,
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy and sometimes, novel immunotherapies. The best treatment options
      depend on many factors, including the type of OC, its stage and grade, as well as the general
      health of the patient.

      Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes reactive with specific antigens has
      proven to be effective. Novel chimeric antigen receptor gene modified T cell (CART) based
      immunotherapy has demonstrated great successes in B cell malignancies. Here, the study aim is
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of genetically engineered OC-specific and immune
      modulatory T cells in patients. The primary study objectives are to evaluate the safety of
      the investigational product, autologous OC-IgT cells, to subjects by IV and intratumoral
      injection. The secondary study objectives are (1) to evaluate the success rate of generating
      autologous OC-IgT cells in vitro, and (2) to determine the anti-OC efficacy of the OC-IgT
      cells.

    <description>Objective response (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria. CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
