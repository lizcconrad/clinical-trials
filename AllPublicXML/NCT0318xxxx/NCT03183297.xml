  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 4-way crossover design with
      subjects administered study drug (JMI-001), placebo, fexofenadine alone and naproxen alone on
      different study days, in conjunction with a quantity of alcohol estimated to be sufficient to
      produce a hangover the next day. The primary objective of the study is the evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of two different doses of JMI-001
      administered in conjunction with alcohol to healthy adult subjects.

      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with a 4-way crossover design with
      subjects administered study drug (JMI-001), placebo, fexofenadine alone and naproxen alone on
      different study days, in conjunction with a quantity of alcohol estimated to be sufficient to

      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two different doses of JMI-001 administered in
      conjunction with alcohol to healthy adult subjects. The secondary objective of this study is
      to compare the PK characteristics of fexofenadine administered as JMI-001 with administration
      of fexofenadine alone, and the PK characteristics of naproxen administered as JMI-001 with
      administration of naproxen alone. To compare overall hangover severity after administering
      JMI-001 with overall hangover severity after administration of fexofenadine alone or naproxen
      alone. To analyze possible quantitative differences in symptom profiles by treatment.

        0.04% - 0.11% BAC correlates approximately with a 120-160 pound female drinking 2 to 5
        drinks in 2 to 3 hours, respectively, and a 160-200 pound male drinking 3 to 7 drinks in 2
        to 3 hours, respectively; 4. Subject has prequalified as likely hangover-sensitive based on
        pre-study questionnaire; 5. Body mass index between 19 and 32 kg/m2, inclusive ; 6. Report

        cancer or diabetes; 7. Subject has a previous or current Substance-Related Disorder as
        defined by DSM 5; 8. A score of 8 or greater on the AUDIT scale; 9. Self-report of recent
        (within one month) or current use of smoked or chewed tobacco products, or use of nicotine
        (e.g., nicotine gum or patch); 10. Positive alcohol Breathalyzer test at check-in for any
        treatment visit; 11. Positive urine drug screen at screening or at check-in for any

        15. Clinically significant psychiatric illness, including chronic psychiatric illness or
        the history or presence of any Axis I condition; 16. Any clinically significant abnormal
        finding on physical examination or vital signs; 17. Subject has previously experienced an
        allergic reaction or adverse event associated with aspirin, NSAIDs, or antihistamine usage;
        18. Subject requires the use of any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) oral pain
        medication(s) on study treatment days; 19. Women who are breastfeeding; 20. Any medical
        condition or any condition or situation that in the investigator's opinion may put the
        subject at significant risk, confound the study results, or interfere significantly with
        the subject's participation in the study; 21. Concurrent participation in an
        investigational drug or device study, or use of any investigational drug within 30 days
