    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose finding study evaluating the
      safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of subcutaneously injected BPI-3016 in Chinese
      healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      BPI-3016 is a novel analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that developed for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, dose finding study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of subcutaneously injected BPI-3016 in Chinese healthy subjects.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect or any other situation according to medical or scientific judgement will be categorized as SAE</description>
