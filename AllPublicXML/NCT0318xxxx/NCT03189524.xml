    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics/
      pharmacodynamics of BTK inhibitor BGB-3111 in Chinese patients with B-cell lymphoma, by
      conducting in two stages, the first stage being the safety assessment of dose, and the second
      stage being the dose expansion.

      Part I: Safety evaluation - according to the results of preclinical toxicological trials and
      the results of the phase I clinical study conducted in Australia and New Zealand, two
      regimens of BGB-3111 320 mg daily (160 mg BID, administered in the morning and at night, or
      320 mg QD) and &quot;3+3&quot; design is adopted for the assessment. The recommended dose and method of
      administration of phase II clinical study will be determined according to the Part I results.

      Part II: Dose expansion - this stage is to further evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor
      effects of BGB-3111 in Chinese subjects with follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone
      lymphoma (MZL), approximately 20 subjects with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma
      (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) will be enrolled. The recommended Phase 2 dose will be
      used in the Part II.
