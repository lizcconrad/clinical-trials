  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will utilize electroacupuncture, a type of needleless acupuncture that
      uses electrostimulation, in a randomized, double blind study, to evaluate the incidence of
      post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing spinal surgeries with the
      transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) compared to patients without TEAS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rates of PONV will be evaluated over the first 24 hours after surgery, opioid consumption
      in units of morphine equivalence, and any adverse side effects will be recorded. Subjects who
      are included in the research will be randomly assigned to one of two groups - one group is
      the control group, receiving no TEAS, and the other group receiving TEAS. An anesthesiologist
      trained in acupuncture will utilize the Excel Pointer to locate the specific acupoints
      previously identified as associated with prevention PONV. Anesthesiologist will place
      electrocardiogram (ECG) pads at the identified acupoints prior to surgery. Subjects will be
      connected to the ES-130 (electro-therapy) device upon entering the operating room. Prior to
      the surgical closure, the unblinded researcher will initiate delivery of TEAS, or not,
      according to study protocol based on the randomization group of the participant. The
      anesthesiologist will not know the group assignment. At the end of surgery, the subject will
      be disconnected from the ES-130 and the ECG pads will be carefully removed. Researchers will
      follow up with the subject in recovery regarding any occurrence and severity of PONV, adverse
      events, and verbal pain scores, until 24 hours after end of surgery.

    <description>Subjects in the &quot;Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation&quot; (TEAS) group will receive 20 minutes of TEAS via ES-130 beginning at the time ondansetron is administered (usually given 30 minutes before the end of surgery), for prevention of PONV.</description>
