    <textblock>
      Some subsets of lymphocytes are able to inhibit immune response and thus, could be used to
      control auto-immune diseases and transplant reject. In mice, the main source of those
      anti-inflammatory lymphocytes is the peritoneal cavity. No data are available in human. This
      study aims at exploring the presence of those anti-inflammatory lymphocytes in human
      peritoneal cavity and at determine how to expand those cells.

  <detailed_description>

      B cells will be collected during procedures planned for patients' standard care. Peritoneal
      fluid and peripheral blood of patients will be collected during coelioscopy for exploration
      of ovarian cysts or dialysis for treatment of chronic renal insufficiency.

      Regulatory B cells (Breg cells) will be measured in peritoneal fluid and in peripheral blood
      after in vitro stimulation and assessment of intracellular interleukin-10 by flow cytometry.
      Proportion of Breg cells among B cells will be compared between peritoneal fluid and
      peripheral blood in both groups.

      Different protocols to induce differentiation of B cells into Breg cells will be tested and
      compared.
