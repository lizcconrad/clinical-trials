  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of an evidence-based, multi-modal, &quot;digital
      pain-reduction kit&quot; as a non-pharmacological supplement to managing patients with acute pain
      due to orthopedic injuries. Outpatients will be randomized to receive either the pain
      reduction kit or an active control. The kit will contain a virtual reality (VR) headset,
      therapeutic VR visualization software, a low-cost wearable transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS) unit, and a remote activity monitor. Clinical staff will monitor progress
      and provide scheduled coaching and outreach to patients in the intervention group. The
      control group will receive a remote activity monitor alone; they will not receive VR, TENS,
      or remote coaching. Study devices will be delivered to the patient's home with instructions
      for use; patients will receive remote clinical and technical support. Patients will be
      followed for 60 days and monitored for functional status, pain levels, use of pain
      medications (including opioids), satisfaction with care, and time to returning to work.
