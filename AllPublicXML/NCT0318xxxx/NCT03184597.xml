  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) include mild maculopapular exanthema (MPE) and
      severe cutaneous reactions such as hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS),
      and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). cADRs are considered as a major public health issue
      because of their potentially life-threatening morbidity, especially severe cutaneous
      reactions. The incidence of SJS/TEN is estimated to vary from 1 in 1,000 to 10,000 drug
      exposures, and its mortality is as high as 35%. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), particularly
      those with aromatic ring structures such as carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine (OXC),
      lamotrigine (LTG), phenobarbital (PB), and phenytoin (PHT), are among the most common causes
      of severe cutaneous reactions. The incidence of AED-induced SJS was estimated as 0.2% and all
      cases occurred in individuals receiving aromatic AEDs.

      Previous studies have validated that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele HLA-B*15:02 is
      strongly associated with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in southern Han Chinese and populations in
      southeast Asia. Our recent studies indicated that HLA-A*24:02 is a common genetic risk factor
      for CBZ-, LTG-, and PHT-induced SJS/TEN. It is also associated with MPE. Additionally,
      another four alleles, including HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*15:11, HLA-A*02:01,and HLA-DRB1*01:01,
      were showed to be potential risk factors for aromatic AEDs-induced SJS/TEN. In 2007, the US
      Food and Drug Administration issued the safety alert that recommended HLA-B*15:02 screening
      for people with Asian ancestry before starting CBZ, and avoidance of the drug if the test is
      positive. Subsequent studies from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand demonstrated that
      HLA-B*15:02 screening before commencing CBZ can significantly reduce the incidence of
      CBZ-induced SJS/TEN. However, the overall incidence of AEDs-induced SJS/TEN remained
      unchanged in Hong Kong, as PHT-induced SJS/TEN increased when CBZ-SJS/TEN decreased.
      Moreover, no study focuses on the incidences of AEDs-induced cADRs with and without HLA
      screening before commencing aromatic AEDs. Therefore, we are planning to conduct a
      multicenter prospective study to examine the reduction of AEDs-induced cADRs after the HLA
      screening prior to the beginning of aromatic AEDs administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, 4000 or more patients from multicenters in southern China will be
      recruited. A HLA screening will be conducted before these patients start aromatic AEDs
      treatments. According to the HLA genotype, these patients will be divided into four groups
      that are three positive groups with different risk alleles and one negative group with no
      known risk allele. Aromatic AEDs were avoided or administrated with caution according to the
      risk level in the three positive groups, while they can be prescribed in the negative group.
      The effectiveness of HLA screening prior to the beginning of aromatic AEDs administration
      will be observed by the reduction of overall incidence of AEDs-induced cADRs.
