  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study will assess whether people with major depressive disorder experience
      psychological and behavioral benefits and/or harms from psilocybin. This study will
      investigate acute and persisting effects of psilocybin on depressive symptoms and other
      moods, attitudes, and behaviors. The primary hypothesis is that psilocybin will lead to rapid
      and sustained antidepressant response, as measured with standard depression rating scales.
