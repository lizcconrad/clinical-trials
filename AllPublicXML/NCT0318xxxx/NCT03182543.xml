      Introduction. The post-consumption physiological effect of mango cv. &quot;Ataulfo&quot; pulp (MP) and
      peel (MC) in humans before exercise has been poorly evaluated.

      Objective. To evaluate the physiological response, to consumption of two mango base
      beverages, AM1 (200g MP/ 600mL water) and AM2 (160g MP; 40g MC / 600mL water), before and
      after a submaximal exercise test.

      Methods. The antioxidant profile and physicochemical characteristics of AM1 and AM2 were
      evaluated. Several cardiorespiratory, anthropometric and body composition parameters of 19
      university students, prior to the consumption of AM1, AM2 and water, were evaluated in three
      non-consecutive sessions (self-control cases). The glycemic, lactic and antioxidant (FRAP),
      uric acid (AU), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid oxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonyls
      (PC) responses were evaluated in plasma before and after an incremental cycle ergometer
      exercise test.
