  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studying the therapeutic effect of paravertebral injections of BoNT-A (botulinum toxin A)
      requires further studies to confirm the reported short-term therapeutic effect and to
      determine potential predictive factors of efficacy.

      This study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial comparing
      BoNT-A Type A injections to a placebo in patients with chronic Low-back Pain (LBP). This
      superiority trial obtained support from the French Hospital Clinical Research Project (PHRC)
      and the approval of a French ethics committee (2003/02) (&quot;Comit√© Sud-Ouest et Outre-Mer III&quot;,
      consent obtained in February 2003).

      The number of participants included in the study was chosen to be similar as those included
      in previous studies, that showed a strong positive effect of BoNT-A injections on LBP.
      Furthermore, the design of our study (i.e. a crossover) increased the power of the
      statistical analysis. A scientific committee has been solicited at this step, after including
      19 patients, to assess the results.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  LBP defined as a pain located between the thoracic lumbar hinge and the gluteal
             sulcus, where pain had evolved over a period of 6 months despite well conducted
             medical treatment, self-assessed lumbar pain intensity over 50 millimeters long on a
             visual analogue scale of 100 millimeters (0=no pain; 100=maximal pain),

          -  having been on sick leave for 60 or more days in the year preceding the inclusion (in
             order to include patients with high consequences of chronic low-back pain on their
             work),

          -  same long-term chronic pain treatment for at least 6 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  age under 18 or over 55 years (to avoid secondary causes of low back pain, like spinal
             tumor),

          -  ongoing pregnancy or breast-feeding,

          -  a neuromuscular pathology (myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myopathy,
             polymyositis), aminoglycoside treatment at the time of inclusion,

          -  skin infection at injection points,

          -  diabetes and alcoholism (in order to avoid other etiologies of chronic pain),

          -  a history of injecting BoNT-A A,

          -  anticoagulation treatment, sciatica,

          -  suspected spinal inflammatory disorder (spondylitis, inflammatory rheumatism, tumoral
             pathology),

          -  a failed back surgery syndrome (when surgery failed to relieve low-back pain), -
             incapacity to stand, cardiorespiratory deficiency which does not allow the isokinetic
             exploration of the spinal muscles,

          -  cognitive disorders limiting patient participation,

          -  conflicts of interest owing to existing pain (unconsolidated work accident, ongoing
             damage compensation).

          -  Spine infection, tumour or trauma had been specifically excluded by an MRI done by all
             patients before the inclusion in the present study.

          -  No patient was allowed to take opiates during the time of the study,

          -  facet joint injections were also not permitted during the study period.
