  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to observe the changes in the combined ESWT application and
      physiotherapy program in the frozen shoulder pathology associated with diabetes. Different
      treatment approaches will try to identify the most effective treatment method. Changes in
      muscle tone will be observed with ESWT treatment. For the first time placebo-controlled
      research is being conducted with different doses of ESWT in our country and in the World
      literature. In this way the lower floor of the further work to be done will be established.

      The study will be performed with participants who has diabetic frozen shoulder diagnosis
      after clinical examination and imaging procedures performed, held at Okan University
      Hospital, Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Clinic. Data will be recorded with the shoulder
      evaluation form in the study and cases will be divided into three groups with simple
      randomization method. The initial range of motion of the participants will be evaluated
      bilaterally using an electro-goniometer. Muscle strength assessment will be performed with
      the MicroFET2 dynamometer at the appropriate measurement positions. Participants' pain
      assessment will be done in the rest, activity and night pain using the Visual Analog Scale.
      The Shoulder Pain Disability Scale will be used to assess participants' shoulder function.
      The short-form-36 questionnaire will be used evaluating the quality of life. Physiotherapy
      application will be applied to all three groups in the form of standard treatment protocol,
      duration and number. For the first group ESWT application will be done at energy density of
      0.12 mJ/mm2, in the second group, at an energy density of 0.3 mJ/mm2, for the third group
      application will be done as sham ESWT. The physiotherapy program will be held for three
      sessions per week for four weeks. The ESWT will be administered once a week and in two
      separate sessions of 2000 strokes. It will be applied in combination with the physiotherapy
      program and will last for four weeks. After initial measurements, re-evaluations will be done
      in the fourth and sixth weeks. The statistics will be analyzed by appropriate methods.

    <intervention_name>Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) is a treatment method for the application of single-pulse acoustic pressure waves generated by sudden changes in pressure by creating shock waves with piezoelectric, electrohydraulic and electromagnetic systems. The main purpose of the treatment is to stimulate tissue repair and regeneration. It has been reported that ESWT treatment is effective in the treatment of pain with hyperstimulation analgesia by inhibiting afferent pain receptors, and also improve angiogenesis and restore and reorganize the musculoskeletal system</description>
