  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline (AC) chemotherapy has substantially reduced the mortality rate from several
      common cancers globally. Unfortunately, AC treatment is associated with up to 19% risk of
      heart failure (HF). Current standard of care for preventing AC induced HF (AIHF) is cardiac
      surveillance followed by initiation of treatment once HF is diagnosed. With this approach 89%
      of patients fail to recover heart function and 46% will experience adverse cardiac events.
      Therefore there is a need for effective preventive therapy to reduce the risk of AIHF. Based
      on small human studies, animal studies, and our own pilot data, statins are an ideal class of
      drug for this purpose.

      We will conduct a pilot double blinded, placebo controlled, randomized controlled trial to
      assess whether pre-treatment with statins before AC can prevent heart dysfunction. Eligible
      patients with cardiovascular risk factors scheduled to receive AC will be recruited. They
      will be randomized to statin therapy or placebo and followed until the end of cancer
      treatment. Primary outcome is the difference in cardiac MRI-determined left ventricular
      ejection fraction between pre-AC and end of treatment.

      STUDY DESIGN: This is a double blind, placebo controlled randomized controlled trial (RCT).
      We will also use stratification to ensure that the proportion of patients with different
      malignancies is balanced between the study arms.

      PATIENT RECRUITMENT: Patients will be recruited from respective oncology clinics at Princess
      Margaret Hospital, Mount Sinai Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences
      Centre and Scarborough General Hospital.

      INTERVENTION: Patients will receive treatment with 40mg/day of atorvastatin or placebo
      started 2-10 days prior to the initiation of AC and continued for one month after completion
      of cancer treatment.

      CARDIAC MRI (CMR): Studies will be performed on a 3.0T scanner (Siemens) and will include
      complete function and tissue characterization. CMR studies will be performed pre-therapy and
      after completion of AC. After de-identification and randomization, a research assistant
      blinded to all clinical data will perform all CMR analysis using commercially available
      software.

      ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: Routine echocardiography studies will be performed at the time of Cardiac
      MRI.

      SERUM BIOMARKERS: Blood work will be obtained on the day of baseline imaging, immediately
      after each cycle of anthracycline, and on the day of post treatment imaging . At each time
      point samples of bio-banking will be collected. Blood sample collection will be done locally
      at the participant's respective site and transferred to University Health Network (UHN)
      biobank for future analysis or analysis of markers that are not available at all sites (e.g.
      high sensitivity troponin I and BNP).
