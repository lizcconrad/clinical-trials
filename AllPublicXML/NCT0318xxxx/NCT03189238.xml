      Female Orgasmic Disorder (FOD) is defined as a female sexual disorder with the presence of
      the following &quot;on all or almost all (75%-100%) occasions of sexual activity&quot;:

        1. Marked delay in, marked infrequency of, or absence of orgasm

        2. Marked reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations.

        3. The absence of orgasm must cause personal distress (bother) in order for these symptoms
           to be considered a disorder. (for example, women who are not very bothered by their lack
           of orgasm do not have FOD).

      Symptoms must have been present for at least 6 months and are not better explained by a
      mental disorder or because of a relationship problems or other significant stress in the
      participant's life and not due to effects of substance abuse or new medications or other
      medical conditions.

      Approximately one in twenty women have FOD and it is the second most frequently reported
      sexual problem in American women. FOD can either be lifelong (primary) or acquired
      (secondary).

      There are no currently FDA approved treatments or devices for FOD. Therefore, common
      off-label treatments include psychotherapy/sex therapy, hormone therapy, and medications that
      increase blood flow to the genitals.

      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a platelet concentrate that may help to speed up tissue
      healing, without serious side effects, in some medical conditions. It has been tried as
      treatment for diabetic foot ulcers, muscle injury, tendon injury, and in a variety of
      cosmetic procedures. The only condition for which there are high-quality data and clear
      demonstration of effectiveness is arthritis of the knee. It is also apparent from the
      majority of published studies that PRP therapy has minimal risk of scar tissue formation or
      significant bad side effects.

      It has been suggested by many scientists that in some women FOD may be caused by decreased
      clitoral and genital blood flow secondary to blockage in the small blood vessels going to the
      clitoris (similar to that seen in erectile dysfunction (ED) in men) and/or diminished nerve
      conduction (also as seen in ED). PRP activates cells to develop into new tissue—nerves,
      collagen, and blood vessels. As such, PRP may potentially reverse the changes responsible for
      FOD. In addition, it has been shown that improved sexual function in women is highly linked
      with increased blood flow through the clitoris. One component of PRP is known to cause growth
      of new blood vessels. Therefore, the investigators anticipate PRP injections may potentially
      improve blood flow through both the clitoris and the tissue around the urethra, thereby
      improving sexual function and decreasing FOD.

      In addition, it has been shown that women who easily achieve orgasm are more likely than
      women with FOD to have a larger clitoris and a clitoris positioned closer to the vaginal
      wall. Since PRP has been shown to increase connective tissue, injection of PRP into the
      clitoris may potentially enlarge the clitoris and may bring the clitoris closer to the
      vaginal wall, thereby improving orgasm.

      There are some reports that physicians using the PRP as an injection near the urethra and
      clitoris have seen some patients with improvement in FOD after the injections. This is the
      first study that uses an objective comparative study to find out if this treatment works or
      not.

    <description>The ANCOVA will give the investigators adequate power for the proposed sample size (20+20). From the reports of clinicians performing the treatment, the investigators are estimating that the effects to be significant for about 80% of clients. The placebo effect for sexual dysfunction is usually around 40% (see Bradford review, 2013) so that the estimated difference is 40 points which corresponds to a RR (risk ration) = 2, a large effect. A repeated measure ANCOVA with 20 participants per group (2 groups) would have 80% chance of finding a significant difference between groups if the effect size was at least d = .88. An 80% chance is a standard experimental choice that is in line with clinical and medical trials. A Cohen's d above .8 is considered large effect for a treatment study and a d between .5 and .8 is considered medium, thus a sample of 20 + 20 participants is estimated to be adequate to find a large effect as the one expected for this treatment.</description>
