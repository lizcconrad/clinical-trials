      Attainment of peak healthy lung function during the 18-26 yr window is a strong determinant
      of the rate of lung function decline during the later years of life. The attainment of a
      healthy peak lung function is mediated by pre and peri natal exposures ( in utero environment
      and nutrition) and exposure to environmental toxicants and nutrition during childhood and
      early adulthood. Towards this Indian birth cohorts, having collected comprehensive data on
      maternal nutrition and anthropometry can provide invaluable insight into the factors
      affecting lung function growth and their effect sizes in the Indian population. Therefore, in
      this observational study, the Investigator will be collecting data on lung function, current
      nutritional and environmental exposures and linking it to pre and peri natal data of the same
      participants in order to understand lung function growth and the reasons for an early decline
      in the Indian population, using a life course approach.

      Introduction:

      Attainment of peak healthy lung function during the 18-26 yr window is a strong determinant
      of the rate of lung function decline during the later years of life. The attainment of a
      healthy peak lung function is mediated by pre and peri natal exposures ( in utero environment
      and nutrition) and exposure to environmental toxicants and nutrition during childhood and
      early adulthood. Towards this Indian birth cohorts, having collected comprehensive data on
      maternal nutrition and anthropometry can provide invaluable insight into the factors
      affecting lung function growth and their effect sizes in the Indian population. Therefore, in
      this observational study, the Investigator will be collecting data on lung function, current
      nutritional and environmental exposures and linking it to pre and peri natal data of the same
      participants in order to understand lung function growth and the reasons for an early decline
      in the Indian population, using a life course approach.

      Sampling:

      F1 generation of previously registered Indian Birth Cohorts, having collected comprehensive
      data on maternal exposures, nutrition and anthropometry.

      Techniques Employed:

      Spirometry , Forced OscillationTechnique, Anthropometry, Questionnaire, Biochemical analysis
      of nutritional, immunomodulatory and inflammatory biomarkers.

    <description>Study has been planned on the F1 generation of the mothers recruited under the PMNS study at Diabetes Unit, KEM-Pune. Data on maternal nutrition, exposures and anthropometry have been collected, in the F1 generation. This study will be adding cross sectional lung function measurement, biochemical analyses for nutritional, immunological and inflammatory biomarkers.</description>

    <description>F.O.T. method can be used to assess obstruction in the large and small peripheral airways , Changes in lung volumes will be measured using a digital spirometer . Every participant will be asked to sit straight, seal the mouthpiece completely with their lips, breathe in fully, blow as hard as possible into the mouthpiece, emptying the lungs completely., Whole blood collected on site (20 mL from every participant, for about 23 metabolites) will be separated into cells and serum. A detailed questionnaire assessing respiratory health, demographic data, habits, and environmental exposure has been developed and validated by Chest Research Foundation.</description>

        Both birth cohorts,will be instrumental in understanding the link between intergenerational
        nutrition, early life exposures metabolism and lung health, particularly in rapidly
        developing lungs. Subjects have already been enrolled in the cohort. Complete datasets of
        offspring, now aged around 18-30 years, are available through this study, starting from
        pre-natal environment.
