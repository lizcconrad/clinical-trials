  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to evaluate the efficacy of the electrical muscle stimulation (EMS)
      device in patients with patellofemoral pain known as anterior knee pain. Usual treatment for
      it is physical therapy (PT). We want to evaluate and see if adding the electrical muscle
      stimulation will fasten the recovery and improved outcome in patellofemoral pain syndrome.
      Half of participants will receive EMS and PT while other half will receive PT only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patellofemoral pain syndrome also known as anterior knee pain is a common entity in young
      athletic population. In patellofemoral knee syndrome, one of the theory is that the vastus
      medialis obliquus muscle is weak. To strengthen the muscle, physical therapy exercises are
      commonly used. This study evaluates addition of the electrical muscle stimulation device.The
      electrical muscle stimulation device &quot;Flex MT Plus&quot; (Electrostim Medical Services Inc. Tampa,
      FL) is a FDA approved device and has been used in knee for other conditions like treating for
      weakness associated with knee injuries or after knee surgeries. It has shown to improve the
      outcomes in above mentioned conditions. Its efficacy has been tested in patellofemoral pain
      syndrome but in smaller sample size. We intend to test it in larger sample size patient
      population.

      Bily et al (2008) (reference #1) published their results on patellofemoral pain syndrome
      comparing EMS +PT to PT only and found that overall significant improvement in outcome score
      in all patients but when compared between the groups there was no difference. But there
      sample size was 19 patients in each group. Small sample size was one of the limitation of
      their study. We intend to collect 46 patients in each group to find significant difference
      based on power analysis.

    <intervention_model_description>It's a phase III study. A randomized, observer blinded, single center study. Patients will be divided in two groups based on randomization. One group will receive electrical muscle stimulation and Physical therapy and other group will receive only physical therapy. Assessment and follow up will be performed before start of treatment, at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-start of treatment . Assessment will be done at each visit based on Kujala patellofemoral score, pain visual analog scale (VAS) during activities of daily life and isometric strength measurement.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>2 years. Total duration of study is two years. But each patient will be followed for total 12 months after enrollment. If any patient enrolled at 1 year mark after start of study , he will be followed for one year. So total duration of study is 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done at each visit (pre-treatment, post-start treatment 3 weeks,, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months) based on Kujala patellofemoral score. The Kujala score assesses following points: Limp, support, walking, stairs, squatting,running, jumping, prolong sitting with knee flexed,pain,swelling,abnormal painful kneecap movements, atrophy of thigh and flexion deficiency. Repeated measures linear regression models will be used to compare the two treatment arms with respect to knee function, pain score, and muscle strength from baseline to 12 months.
Total duration of study is two years. We intend finish enrolling 92 patients by the end of one year after start of study. But each patient will be followed for total 12 months period. If any patient enrolled at 1 year mark after start of study , he will be followed for one year.</description>
