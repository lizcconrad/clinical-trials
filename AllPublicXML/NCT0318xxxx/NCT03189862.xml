  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity in children is a major public health risk factor and a health objective
      for the nation. This study aims to investigate the short- and long-term effects of a movement
      and physical activity program - the Children Health and Motor Programs (CHAMP) on motor
      competence, perceived motor competence, and physical activity. A secondary aim of this
      project (i.e., Science of Behavior Change Administrative Supplement) is to examine the
      immediate (pre- to post-test) effects of the CHAMP intervention on self-regulation and
      associations between self-regulation and changes in motor competence, perceived motor
      competence, and physical activity. The long term goal is to provide evidence-based movement
      experiences during the early childhood years that promote and contribute to overall healthy
      growth and development.

    <description>ActiGraph GTX3+ tri-axial accelerometer will be used to measure the frequency, intensity and duration of PA among children at school and in free-living settings. Participants will be asked to wear the same accelerometer for 7 full days (5 week and 2 weekend days). Data will be collected at 80 hz. Cut points from a study in preschoolers by Butte et al will be applied to activity counts. This study utilized information from all three axes (versus just the vertical axis) thus time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous categories will be defined as vector magnitudes of up to 819 (sedentary), 3907 (light), 6111 (moderate) and above 6112 for vigorous activity. The outcome will be minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA per day, greater than 6111 activity counts.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), post-intervention (month 9)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed with the Harter &amp; Pike Pictorial Scale of PMC and Social Acceptance (PSPCSA). The PSPCSA will measure the child's global perceived physical competence. The PSPCSA physical competence subscale consists of six items that are presented in pictures and each child will select a picture that is more like them. The six items included are swinging, climbing, tying shoe laces, skipping, running, &amp; hopping. For both assessments, children will (1) select the picture that is most like them. One picture depicts a child who is skilled competent and the other shows a child who is not skilled; (2) focus on the designated picture and indicate whether they are just a &quot;little bit&quot; or &quot;a lot&quot; like that picture. Separate pictures for girls and boys will be used in accordance with the manual procedures. The range of scores for each item on the subscale is 1 (low competence) to 4 (high competence).</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), post-intervention (month 9)</time_frame>
    <description>The Dimensional Change Cart Sort (DCCS) Task is a measure of cognitive flexibility. The task requires children to learn and remember a rule and apply it one way, and then apply a new rule as instructions change. Children match pictures that vary by two dimensions, shape (rabbit vs. boat) and color (brown vs. white). Children complete trials with one set of instructions, then another, and are encouraged to go as fast as they can without making mistakes. 0 = did not pass color sort (Less than 5/6 items correct on color sort)
1 = pass of color sort, fail on shape sort)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Working Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), post-intervention (month 9)</time_frame>
    <description>Working Memory will be assessed using a visual-spatial working memory task which requires children to accurately recall information they have seen before. Children are shown visual information (stickers on the body of a cartoon character) and next shown the character without the stickers, and asked to identify these locations after a brief retention interval. Test trials increase in difficulty (i.e., WM demand) as the task progresses. Test continues until a max. of 8 levels or failure on all 3 trials at the same level of difficulty. For working memory, faster, more accurate responses reflect better self-regulation.WM capacity was indexed by a point score calculated as follows: beginning from Level
1, one point for each consecutive level in which at least two of the three trials were performed accurately, plus 1/3 of a point for all correct trials thereafter.</description>

    <measure>Change in Behavioral Inhibition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), post-intervention (month 9)</time_frame>
    <description>The Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders Task (HTKS; 10 min.) will be used to measure behavioral inhibition. It reflects a child's ability to remember commands and to behaviorally inhibit a pre-potent response in favor of a less-dominant response. A child is trained to perform actions in response to an examiner's commands (e.g., &quot;touch your toes&quot;) then asked to do the opposite (e.g., touch toes when instruction is &quot;touch your head&quot;). Scores across trials are summed to reflect self-regulation. The task has begins with 6 practice items and between the first and second set of items there are 5 more practice trials. The score range is 0-40; higher score equal better behavioral inhibition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Observed Self-Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), post-intervention (month 9)</time_frame>
    <description>Observed self-regulation will also evaluate the child ability to stay on-task during HTKS as an aspect of self-regulation. Child compliance and engagement will also be rated using the Child Assessor Report which has been used in prior SR trials. This 10 item questionnaire is scored on a 0-3 scale. The mean is taken and higher score indicates better observed self-regulation behaviors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Teacher Reported Self-Regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), post-intervention (month 9)</time_frame>
    <description>Teacher-Reported. Teachers will report on child emotion regulation, another key aspect of SR at this age, using the 24-item Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC), which generates Emotion Regulation and Negative Lability subscales. It is a 24 item, four-point Likert scale 1 = Never to 4 = Almost Always). The mean is taken and higher score indicates better emotional regulation (i.e., self-regulation behaviors).</description>

    <description>The control/free play condition will be the preschools typical activity programs (i.e., outdoor/indoor recess) and will be implemented according to the existing procedures within the preschool centers. The centers outdoor program consist of outdoor free-play activity on a large playground area with a variety of play structures (swings, slides, ladders) that promote gross movement and activity in preschoolers. For the control condition, there will be no planned instruction nor activities provided by the classroom teachers.</description>

    <description>The behavioral motor skills intervention (CHAMP) is an intervention strategy that uniquely addresses differences in children's developmental levels on an individualized basis. CHAMP does not equate to a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach. Children will be in an environment that promotes opportunities for them to develop improvements in motor skills based on their specific individual needs and choices. The CHAMP intervention promotes a mastery climate that allows each individual child to be successful and learn while promoting intrinsic motivation and autonomy. CHAMP will be implemented 4x/week for 30 minutes across ≈30 weeks for ≈3000 minutes of intervention time.</description>
