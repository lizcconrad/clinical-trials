  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moving from child care to adult care is a hard time for patients and their families. Parents
      of children with chronic conditions say they need more support around the time of changing
      care. Care providers say they do not have the tools to provide smooth transitions or help
      their patients manage their own health. This study is to see if a smart-phone-based app
      (named MyTransition) can improve healthcare transition experiences and health outcomes for
      youth, compared to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transition to adult care is an unavoidable and challenging period for patients and their
      families, and comes with adverse outcomes in experience of care, population health, and
      costs. Parents of children with chronic conditions report a greater need for support around
      the time of healthcare transition. Providers report neither having the tools nor appropriate
      resources to foster smooth transitions for patients and their families. We hypothesize that
      an app-based transition toolkit (named MyTransition) designed to support youth moving from
      child to adult care can improve their experiences and lead to better health. The main
      objective of this study is to collect information to design a large multi-centre randomized
      control trial to assess implementation of the MyTransition app including recruitment,
      completion of follow-up, and scale-ability of the intervention. The secondary objective is to
      assess the feasibility and potential effect of the MyTransition app-based transition toolkit
      for improving health of youth (quality of life), healthcare transition experience, and
      achievement of health and life goals.

    <intervention_model_description>After completing the baseline assessment, participants will be randomized into one of two groups: intervention or control. Those in the control group will be thanked for their time and informed that the research coordinator will be in touch to set up the follow-up visits (3- and 6-months following baseline). Those in the intervention group will be provided access to the MyTransition app (intervention). The research coordinator will help them navigate through the app and will instruct them on how to use it. These participants will also receive monthly reminder messages from the research coordinator to promote the use of the app.</intervention_model_description>
