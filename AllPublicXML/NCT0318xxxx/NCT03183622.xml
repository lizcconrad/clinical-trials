      This is an open-label follow up study to evaluate the safety for the subjects with
      ALLO-ASC-DFU treatment in phase 1 clinical trial (ALLO-ASC-BI-101) for 23 months.

      ALLO-ASC-DFU is a hydrogel sheet containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
      Adipose-derived stem cells have anti-inflammatory effect and release growth factors such as
      vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which can
      enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new option in
      treating a burn.
