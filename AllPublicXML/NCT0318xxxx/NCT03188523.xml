  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART) activity of MK-8504 monotherapy, a tenofovir (TFV) pro-drug, in
      ART-naïve, HIV-1 infected participants. The primary hypothesis is that MK-8504 has superior
      antiretroviral activity compared to placebo, as measured by change from baseline in plasma
      HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) at 168 hours postdose.
