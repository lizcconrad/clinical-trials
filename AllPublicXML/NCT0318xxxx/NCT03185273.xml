    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study building upon the existing cohort study on the
      effectiveness of the Trekkers Family Enhancement Scheme. This study will sample 200
      low-income parent-child pairs and follow them up for 24 months with yearly assessment on
      parental stress and child health using both subjective measures and objective physiological
      parameters. Additional data on parenting style, neighbourhood cohesion, child physical
      assault and neglect potential, parental mental health and HRQOL and family disharmony will
      also be collected at each assessment time point for testing mediating and moderating
      mechanisms between parental stress and child health. The baseline assessment will be carried
      out in 2016-17 with three repeated assessments after 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.

      Study aims

        -  To examine the relationship between parental stress and child health.

        -  To evaluate the stress of parents as indicated by their subjective perception of mental
           health, quality of life and allostatic load on the body.

        -  To evaluate the health of children as indicated by their well-being, behaviors, body
           mass index (BMI) z-score and telomere length.

        -  To examine the correlation between changes in parental stress and changes in child
           health over time.

        -  To identify the moderators and mediators of the relationship between parental stress and
           child health.

      Eligible participants in the main cohort study will be approached by call or during
      face-to-face sessions. Parents who express interest in participation will be provided with an
      information sheet about the research and asked to sign the consent form for themselves and
      for their children. After providing consent, the parent of each parent-child pair will
      complete a set of structured questionnaires on parental mental health and HRQOL, parenting
      style, neighborhood cohesion, and their children's well-being and behaviors. Physical
      examination including blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height, and waist-to-hip ratio will
      also be carried out on both parents and children. A swab of buccal cells will be taken from
      each child. Venous blood will be sampled from each parent.

      This study will have four assessment waves: Baseline, T2 follow up (6 months), T3 follow up
      (12 months), and T4 follow up (24 months). Physical health data and biological samples will
      be collected by research nurses and research assistants during health assessment session held
      in community centers. Questionnaire data will be collected by trained interviewers during
      telephone survey. To minimize attrition, a package of questionnaires and a sheet of
      instructions and equipment (i.e. brushes) for swab-taking at home may also be sent to parents
      upon request.

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life: Child Health Questionnaire - Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50) is a parent proxy measure of children's physical and psychological wellbeing, with 50 items grouped into 12 multi-item subscales. Its Chinese version has been shown to have good psychometric properties in local Chinese children</description>

    <description>Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a 25-item parent-completed questionnaire measuring children's behavioral issues. The SDQ, with 5 subscales, has been translated into traditional Chinese and tested with satisfactory reliability and validity in local children.</description>

    <measure>Change in Child telomere length from baseline to 24 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Telomere length will be measured by the method adapted from that originally published by Cawthon. For each sample, the telomere length will be represented by the relative ratio of the telomere repeat copy number (T) to the single copy gene 36BA copy number (S). The T/S ratio will be determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPcR) using a 7900HT Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems).</description>

    <description>A review of literature has identified a set of physiological parameters that can reflect allostatic load and yet be conveniently measured, including blood pressure, heart rate, body-mass-index, waist-to-hip ratio, lipid profile, fasting glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin. An index score of allostatic load will be calculated by summing the number of parameters that fall into the &quot;highest&quot; risk quartile defined by local clinical practice guidelines</description>
