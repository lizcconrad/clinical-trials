    <textblock>
      plasmaMATCH is a multi-centre phase IIa umbrella trial platform consisting of a ctDNA
      screening component and a therapeutic component. plasmaMATCH aims to assess whether ctDNA
      screening can be used to detect patients with targetable mutations, and will assess the
      safety and activity of the targeted treatments in patients with targetable mutations
      identified at ctDNA screening.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female.

          2. Aged â‰¥ 18 years old.

          3. Histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma.

          4. Metastatic or recurrent locally advanced breast cancer that is not suitable for
             treatment with radical or curative intent.

          5. Demonstrated progression of disease by radiological assessment or by clinical
             assessment within the last 6 weeks.

          6. Measurable disease by RECIST v1.1.

          7. Patients must have completed at least one prior line of treatment for advanced breast
             cancer and/or relapse within 12 months of completing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy.
             Patients with HER2 positive breast cancer must have been treated with at least two
             courses of HER2 targeted therapy in the advanced setting (or one course if no further
             courses of HER2 targeted therapy are available locally).

          8. Patient must either be suitable for a baseline biopsy of recurrent disease or have an
             archival biopsy of recurrent disease available. Patients are requested to consent to a
             baseline biopsy but if deemed unsafe by the Investigator, an archival biopsy of
             recurrent disease can be used instead. If it is deemed unsafe to proceed with baseline
             biopsy, and no archival recurrent disease biopsy is available, the patient will not be
             eligible for entry into the treatment cohort.

          9. ECOG performance status â‰¤ 2.

         10. Life expectancy &gt;3 months.

         11. Patients must be surgically sterile, be postmenopausal or must agree to use effective
             contraception during the period of trial treatment and be willing to do so for 6
             months following the end of trial treatment. Effective contraception is defined as
             double barrier contraception (e.g. condom plus spermicide in combination with a
             diaphragm, cervical cap or intrauterine device). Ovarian suppression with an LHRH
             agonist is not a method of contraception.

         12. Patients of childbearing potential should have a negative serum pregnancy test within
             14 days prior to initiation of trial treatment.

         13. At least 4 weeks washout period after the end of trial treatment on a different cohort
             within plasmaMATCH.

         14. Adequate haematological, renal and hepatic function as defined by: Haematology: -
             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) â‰¥1000/mm3 (â‰¥1.0 x 109/L) - Platelet count â‰¥100,000/mm3
             (â‰¥100 x 109/L) - Haemoglobin â‰¥9g/dL (â‰¥90g/L); Renal function: - Serum creatinine â‰¤1.5
             x upper limit of normal (ULN) and calculated creatinine clearance more than 30ml/min;
             Liver function tests: - Total bilirubin â‰¤1.5 ULN - Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) â‰¤3
             ULN. In the presence of liver metastases ALT â‰¤5 ULN. For patients in Cohort B, C and
             D: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) â‰¤3 ULN. In the presence of liver metastases AST â‰¤5
             ULN.

         15. For patients with ER positive breast cancer in Cohorts A, B and C: EITHER
             postmenopausal, as defined by at least one of the following criteria: Age &gt;60 yearsÍ¾
             Age &lt;60 years and cessation of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with
             no alternative pathological or physiological causeÍ¾ and serum estradiol and follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level within the laboratory's reference range for
             postmenopausal femalesÍ¾ Documented bilateral oophorectomyÍ¾ medically confirmed ovarian
             failure. OR Pre-/peri-menopausal (i.e. not meeting the criteria for being
             postmenopausal) if being treated with an LHRH agonist that was commenced at least 4
             weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, and continues on the LHRH agonist throughout the trial
             period.

        NB. Additional eligibility criteria apply for entry into each treatment cohort.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatment with radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy,
             immunotherapy, chemotherapy or IMPs during the previous 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas, Mitomycin-C) before trial treatment, except for hormonal therapy with
             LHRH analogues, which are permitted, and bisphosphonates or RANK ligand antibodies
             that are permitted for the management of bone metastases.

          2. Uncontrolled CNS disease (brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease). Patients with
             prior diagnosis of CNS metastases must be stable by clinical assessment having ceased
             steroids after prior treatment.

          3. History of clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac disease, including
             congestive heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction within the last 6 months or
             ventricular arrhythmia. Patients with a history of any of the above listed cardiac
             conditions judged not to be clinically significant by the local investigator must be
             notified to the trial team at the ICR-CTSU for approval by the CI and/or Cohort Lead.

          4. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments Grade â‰¥1. Exceptions to this are
             alopecia or toxicities which in the opinion of the Investigator should not exclude the
             patient. Such cases should be clearly documented in the patient's notes by the
             Investigator.

          5. Major surgery (excluding minor procedures, e.g. placement of vascular access) within 4
             weeks of the first dose of trial treatment.

          6. Pregnant or breastfeeding.

          7. Any condition that according to the treating physician may compromise the patient's
             safety or the conduct of the trial.

          8. Current malignancies of other types, with the exception of adequately treated in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix and basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Cancer
             survivors, who have undergone potentially curative therapy for a prior malignancy and
             have no evidence of the disease for 3 years or more are eligible for the trial.

        NB. Additional eligibility criteria apply for entry into each treatment cohort.
