  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is one of the most common sports-related knee
      injuries. Because it is such a significant injury - requiring a long period of rehabilitation
      before the injured person is ready to return to physical activity, the burden of injury is
      high. This can help to explain why so much of orthopaedic research is devoted to evaluating
      the outcomes of ACL injury. However, while there has been extensive study of short-term (up
      to 5 years after injury) outcomes, few studies have followed patients beyond 15 years after
      their ACL injury. This is important because long-term follow-up can provide key insights to
      guide the information provided to newly injured patients (e.g. to help set realistic
      expectations of what the injured person can expect of their knee function in the future), and
      help us evaluate the efficacy of previous treatments.

      The primary aim is to assess the influence of an acute ACL injury on knee function and
      quality of life, 32-37 years after the index injury. Approximately 300 patients injured
      between 1980 and 1985 will be invited to participate in the study. Patient- and
      clinician-reported outcomes, and radiographic osteoarthritis will be evaluated.

      Patients injuring their ACL between 1980 and 1985 have periodically been followed since the
      injury. Now, we plan to contact all patients and invite them to participate. The patients
      will be asked to

        1. complete a questionnaire battery

        2. visit the movement laboratory at Link√∂ping University for an objective assessment of
           knee function and

        3. have an x-ray of both knee joints.

      Baseline information including associated injuries, treatment and activity level exist for
      all the patients. At that time, rehabilitation was normally completed after 4-6 months for
      non-operatively treated patients, and nine months after ACL surgery.

        Baseline data from the time for injury were collected consequently. The initial 167
        patients were included in a randomised clinical trial of surgical vs. non-surgical
        treatment and the following patients were treated according to common practise at that
        time.
