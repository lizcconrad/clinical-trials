  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most previous trials support the absolute increase in bleeding risk with perioperative
      administration of antiplatelet. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that perioperative
      major bleeding may be related to increase cardiovascular risk. The investigators will compare
      the efficacy and safety of continuing versus stopping antiplatelet therapy during
      perioperative period in patients underwent PCI(Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) with next
      generation DES(Drug Eluting Stent).

  <detailed_description>

      Most current guidelines recommend to focus on continuing antiplatelet therapy (mostly with
      aspirin) during noncardiac surgery if possible. Although previous study showed efficacy of
      continuous antiplatelet therapy in reducing perioperative ischemic cardiovascular events, its
      effectiveness is still not clear between perioperative bleeding and ischemic risk. Most
      previous trials support the absolute increase in bleeding risk with perioperative
      administration of antiplatelet. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that perioperative
      major bleeding may be related to increase cardiovascular risk. The investigators will compare
      the efficacy and safety of continuing versus stopping antiplatelet therapy during
      perioperative period in patients underwent PCI(Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) with next
      generation DES(Drug Eluting Stent).

    <description>Subject assigned to control arm will maintain antiplatelet therapy using aspirin only at least 7 days before surgery. If subject is taking one or more antiplatelet drugs, it should be changed (for subjects taking antiplatelet drug except aspirin at enrollment) or continued (for subject taking aspirin at enrollment) with low-dose, aspirin monotherapy before surgery. Cessation of clopidogrel, ticagrelor, and prasugrel should be started at least 5 days, 3 days and 7 days before surgery, respectively. Administration of aspirin will be started at the day of cessation of previous antiplatelet regimen and maintained until third postoperative day with 100 mg once a day.</description>

Antiplatelet therapy may be restarted as previous regimen at fourth postoperative day or sooner unless significant bleeding risk or bleeding event occurs.</description>
