  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tenofovir
      alafenamide (TAF) in virologically suppressed chronic hepatitis B participants with renal
      and/or hepatic impairment.

      This study consists of 2 Parts. Approximately 90 renally impaired participants will be
      enrolled in Part A and approximately 30 hepatically impaired participants will be enrolled in
      Part B.

    <description>GFR is a measure of the rate at which blood is filtered by the kidney. Cockcroft-Gault is an equation (calculation) used to estimate GFR based on serum creatinine, weight, and gender. eGFRcg = (140 - age) * (body weight in kg) * (0.85 if female) divided by 72 * serum creatinine in mg/dL</description>
