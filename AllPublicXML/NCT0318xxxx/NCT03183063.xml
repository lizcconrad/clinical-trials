  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, typically in the
      lower extremities. Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a DVT clot (or fragment) breaks free
      and travels through the heart to the pulmonary arteries (having to do with the lungs) and
      lodges in an artery causing a partial or complete blockage. PE is difficult to diagnose due
      to the non-specific signs and symptoms patients have with this condition such as a cough,
      shortness of breath, increased heart rate, blood tinged sputum, low oxygen levels.

      The standard test to diagnose PE is the Pulmonary Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA). This
      can be prohibitive with some patients due to the amount of radiation exposure as well as the
      complications associated with the need to use intravenous (IV) contrast. In patients not
      eligible for CTA, the other option for diagnosis is a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) single
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan. Though this is often prohibitive due to
      transport to Nuclear Medicine dept., prolonged test time, no test during off hours, etc. In
      this study the investigators are looking at an alternative method of diagnosing PE's in the
      Emergency Department where the investigators look at the breathing and blood flow to the
      lungs thru respiratory gated non-contrast CT (commonly called 4DCT).

      The investigators hypothesize that respiratory induced blood mass change in the lungs will
      allow the identification of under-perfused lung regions. The investigators did a prelimary
      study and tested this theory in cases with low oxygen levels, narrowing of the blood vessels,
      airway obstruction, comparing 4DCT with SPECT scan. The images compared well. It is unknown,
      however, if this process works to detect perfusion defects due to PE where the perfusion is
      obstructed and breathing normal.

      15 participants will be enrolled with a diagnosis of PE by CTA. Each will receive SPECT/CT
      and 4DCT imaging on the same day. Respiratory induced blood mass change images will be issued
      from the 4DCT and compared to the SPECT/CT images.

      Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, typically in the
      lower extremities. Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a DVT clot (or fragment) breaks free
      and travels through the heart to the pulmonary arteries (having to do with the lungs) and
      lodges in an artery causing a partial or complete blockage. Together DVT and PE comprise
      venous thromboembolism (VTE), a major public health problem in the United States. PE is
      associated with a high short-term mortality, requiring a timely and accurate diagnosis for
      the initiation of antithrombotic therapy. PE is difficult to diagnose due to the non-specific
      signs and symptoms patients have with this condition such as a cough, shortness of breath,
      tachycardia, hypoxia and hemoptysis.

      The standard test to diagnose PE is the Pulmonary Computed Tomography Angiogram (CTA). This
      can be prohibitive with some patients due to the amount of radiation exposure as well as the
      complications associated with the need to use intravenous (IV) contrast. CTA can detect acute
      PE with a sensitivity of 99 percent and specificity of 95 percent when combined with CT
      venography. In patients not medically eligible for CTA, the other option for diagnosis is a
      ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan. Though
      this is often prohibitive due to transport to Nuclear Medicine dept., prolonged test time, no
      test during off hours, etc. In this study the investigators are looking at an alternative
      method of diagnosing PE's in the Emergency Department where the investigators look at
      ventilation and perfusion images thru respiratory gated non-contrast CT (commonly called
      4DCT).

      99mTc-MAA imaged with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is considered the
      standard method for the quantitative determination of pulmonary perfusion. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) with contrast agents have been utilized experimentally to image the pulmonary
      vasculature and tissue perfusion. Quantification of SPECT images requires correction of the
      acquired data for attenuation and attenuation correction, which has lead to the development
      of SPECT/CT scanners. The low-dose CT can be utilized to evaluate the lung airway
      architecture, lung parenchyma, and pleural space in conjunction with the registered perfusion
      images rivaling CTA in sensitivity and specificity.

      In a study comparing CT attenuation with SPECT perfusion defects, patients were found to have
      hypo-attenuated pulmonary regions corresponding to regions with decreased perfusion in 57
      percent of acute pulmonary emboli and 88 percent of chronic emboli cases. In the same study,
      hyper-attenuated regions were found to correspond to regions with hyperperfusion. A method to
      measure pulmonary perfusion based on subtraction digital fluoroscopy without contrast has
      been reported. In that study, subtraction images were generated between chest projection
      images at systole and diastole generating an image representing the perfusion difference.
      These perfusion projection images were correlate with 99mTc-MAA scintigraphy. Thus, changes
      in the amount and distribution of pulmonary perfusion throughout the respiratory cycle can be
      expected and these changes may be apparent on dynamic CT.

      Simon described a technique to calculate the change in fractional content of air within
      pulmonary tissue between anatomically matched CT regions based on a simple model that assumes
      the density changes were solely due to air content. The investigators successfully applied
      that model to inhale and exhale breath-hold CT image pairs as well as 4DCT images to create
      ventilation images. However, the amount of blood in the thorax and lungs varies with the
      respiratory cycle, thus violating the assumption of this model. The investigators found a
      cyclic variation in the apparent weight of the lung on 4DCT and others have reported
      respiratory induced variations in pulmonary perfusion of the lung on MRI. The pulmonary
      density changes found on 4DCT thus result from both changes in air and blood content.

      4DCT derived ventilation images can also be inferred from the respiratory motion induced
      local tissue volume changes independent of the 4DCT density values. The Jacobian determinant
      of the deformation field, calculated fro the DIR result of images depicting different
      respiratory phases of the lungs, is used to estimate the local volume changes or ventilation.
      There is a discrepancy between the density based and the Jacobian based ventilation images
      suggesting a method to extract respiratory induced blood mass change from 4DCT images. The
      investigators hypothesize the respiratory induced blood mass changed (RIBMC) will only occur
      within perfused lung regions. Each image set will contain information representing the
      density change resulting from both ventilation and RIBMC. Extracting both ventilation and
      perfusion-like image from the 4DCT image intensities, referred to as Hounsfield Units (HU) is
      our goal.

      The investigators found a cyclic variation in the apparent mass of the pulmonary parenchyma.
      The investigators hypothesize this variation is due to changes in pulmonary perfusion from
      respiratory-induced variation in cardiac output. The investigators hypothesize this
      respiratory induced blood mass change (RIBMC) will allow the identification of hypoperfused
      lung regions. The investigators did a prelimary study by creating 4DCT RIBMC images from
      cases with hypoxia induced vasoconstriction, patients with malignant airway constriction. The
      resulting images compare well with 99mTc-MAA SPECT images. It is unknown, however, if this
      process works to detect perfusion defects due to PE where the perfusion is obstructed and
      breathing normal.

      In this study patients found to have new segmental, lobar or greater perfusion defects, will
      be imaged with 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and 4DCT to compare perfusion with RIBMC defects. This is a
      prospective imaging trial of 20 subjects diagnosed by CTA. 15 subjects will be enrolled into
      Cohort 1 and each will receive 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and two (2) 4DCT imaging scans
      (back-to-back) on the same day. 5 subjects will be enrolled into Cohort 2 and they will also
      receive 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and two (2) 4DCT imaging scans (back-to-back) on the same day,
      with the first one being obtained with normal breathing as previously done and the second one
      being obtained with positive pressure breathing via BiPAP. Respiratory induced blood mass
      change (RIBMC) images will be derived from the 4DCT images and quantitatively compared with
      the SPECT perfusion images.

      Subjects will be followed for a period of 48 hours after imaging for any adverse effects to
      the 99mTc-MAA. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0)
      will be used to grade all treatment-related adverse events. All Adverse Event (AE) effects
      will be reported to the Principal Investigator, who will determine the course of action for
      the study participant and will determine whether the AE affects the study and requires
      changes to the protocol and/or informed consent form.
