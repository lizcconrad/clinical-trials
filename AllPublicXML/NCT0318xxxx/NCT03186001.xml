  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The botulinum toxin was first identified in the late 19th century(1). With its 40 different
      subtype this toxin is produced mainly by the gram positive anaerobic bacteria Clostridium
      Botulinum(2). This neurotoxin has great affinity to the neuro muscular junction preventing
      neurotransmitter release in the synaptic space of acetylcholine(3). The first clinical use
      was reported by Alan Scott in 1980(4). The most commonly used subtype is toxin A commercially
      found as BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA, Allergan, approved by FDA in 1989), Dysport
      (abobotulinumtoxinA, Medicis, approved by FDA in 2009) and Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA, Merz,
      approved by FDA in 2010). As for other commercial toxins botulinum neurotoxin serotype B
      product (MYOBLOC™). Neurotoxin Blast generally 12-15 weeks compared to 3-6 month for
      neurotoxin A. the FDA approved its use for strabismus in 1989(5), blepharospasm and
      hemifacial spasm in 1990(6,7), cervical dystonia in 2000(8), glabella in 2000, hyperhidrosis
      in 2004(9), chronic migrane and detrusor overactiviy in 2014. Other off-label uses have
      emerged like lanyngeal dysponia, chronic pain etc… (10). Multiple studies with a reduced
      number of patients have aimed to quantify the effect of botulinum toxin on brow higth. Some
      studies used injections only to the lateral part of the orbicularis,while others added a
      corrugator injection. We aimed in this study to compare a known techniques in brow lifting
      and associanting that with 2 frontalis injection techniques. The main objective is to
      evaluate the shape of the brow and the elevation in multiple brow landmarks before and after
      the injection and to see if the frontalis botulinum bloc causes brow ptosis

      Botulinum toxin:

      This toxin has been used clinically since 1989 with label (8) and off-label techniques(3).

      This is a becoming a routine procedure for men and women with little side effects.

      Brow lifting The ideal brow position is always an issue in plastic surgery(12). When face
      ages, the brow descends. Many approaches to a brow elevation are described in the literature.
      The first surgical approach is through a coronal incision(13), then came the temporal
      incision(14) and the direct approach(15), and finally the endoscopic approach(16).
      Non-surgical methods include radiofrequency(17), percutaneous sutures and botulinum
      toxin(11).

      Standardized measure Anteroposterior pictures will be taken at rest pre and post injection.
      Using photoshop 7 brow landmarks will be measured to the midpupillary line.

    <description>Objective assessment will be done on anteroposterior views of pre-and-post injection photographs. The mid pupillary line will be drawn and the eyebrow vertical height will be measured from this line to the upper border of the brow at seven horizontal points: the most medial aspect of the eyebrow, medial canthus, and medial limbus, mid pupil, lateral limbus, lateral canthus, and most lateral eyebrow.</description>

    <measure>1-Investigators Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in Overall appearance of the upper face, as assessed by the 3 investigators (2 plastic surgeons and 1 dermatologist) using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). GAIS will be completed based on photographic assessment comparing post-treatment photos taken at day 15 post intervention to baseline photos (the lower eyelids and lower face will be cropped), to assess overall aesthetic improvement. The GAIS is a 5-point scale (1-5) as follows:
Very Much Improved: optimal cosmetic results
Much Improved: marked improvement in appearance from initial condition but not completely optimal
Improved: obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition but additional treatments are advised
No Change: the appearance is the same as the original condition
Wose: the appearance is worse from the original condition</description>
