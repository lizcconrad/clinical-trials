  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To show that the nurse implementation of a sedation and analgesia algorithm is beneficial to
      the patient in terms of sedative drugs reduction and thus overall decrease in duration of
      mechanical ventilation and the morbidity and mortality which is associated with it, without
      altering patient comfort and tolerance of the environment. This, compared to the less
      frequent assessments by doctors and thus regular adjustments during the day as opposed to a
      fixed drug dose.

      Outcome Measures : The primary objective of this non-invasive, non-interventional study is to
      show that the establishment of a titration algorithm for sedation and analgesia administered
      by nurses is more beneficial to the patient than the use of such a drug without a suitable
      regimen. The goal is to improve the quality of our painkillers and sedative drugs use needed
      in the intensive care environment in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated
      with it, without altering patient comfort and tolerance to the environment. For this we
      propose to collect a database including patient demographic details, pharmacological
      information and any possible complications during the ICU stay as well as a distant
      assessment exploring the psychological complications (3, 6 months and 1 year). The primary
      endpoint will be the duration of mechanical ventilation, and secondary endpoints, the length
      of stay in ICU and in hospital, mortality and other complications.

      Methods: The two study populations will be in two distinct time periods, the first so-called
      control without any modification of practices, and the second, by introducing the algorithm
      with the same drugs being used. Quantitative comparisons of data following a normal
      distribution will be done using a Student's t test. Otherwise quantitative data will be
      compared using a Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon. The comparison of qualitative data will be
      done using a Fisher exact test. To increase the power of this before / after study, we
      calculated the number of patients to be included by period, based on the reduction in
      duration of mechanical ventilation with such protocols in the literature, and the mean
      duration of mechanical ventilation in our unit before the study.
