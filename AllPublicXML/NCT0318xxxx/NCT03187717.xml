  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of us is to define the incidence of postoperative complications and recovery time in
      view of two anesthesia procedures.

      During the period between 01.01.2016 and 01.01.2017, totally 583 patients were included in
      the study, who had oral and maxillofacial surgeries. Anesthesia types were determined as
      total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and inhalation anesthesia (IA). Postoperative
      complications and recovery period were determined as tachycardia, bradycardia, hypertension,
      hypotension, recovery time, additional analgesia, nausea-vomiting. Both anesthesia procedures
      were compared in terms of these postoperative complications and recovery time.

      Totally American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II, 18-60 ages, 583 patients who had
      had oral and maxillofacial operations for 30 minutes and over with TIVA and IA methods
      between 1st Jan, 2016 and 1st Jan, 2017. The ones who had insufficient data in their files
      and who were conscious / superficial sedation patients were excluded from the study. The
      patients were allocated to two groups as TIVA and IA. The total intravenous anesthesia group
      was named &quot;Group TIVA&quot; , and the volatile anesthesia group was named &quot;Group IA&quot;.

      All the patients were opened vascular access after being taken into the operation room and
      were given anesthesia induction with 1 µg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol and 0,8 mg/kg
      rocuronium. The patients in Group IA were given 1-2% volume sevoflurane in 50% oxygen and 50%
      nitrous oxide during maintenance of anesthesia, while the patients in group TIVA were applied
      4-10 mg/kg/h propofol and 0.05-0.1 µg/kg fentanyl IV infusion with 50% oxygen and 50% air.
      While being woken up, each patient was given 0.3 mg/kg tenoxicam for analgesia and 0.2 mg/kg
      metoclopramide for nausea-vomiting prophylaxis in a routine way. Each patient was taken into
      recovery room after extubation and pulse rate, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) and oxygen
      saturation monitorization were done. Postoperative complication and vital finding tracks of
      each patient were done as usual and were recorded.
