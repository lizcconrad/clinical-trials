  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-Stage Liver Disease (ESLD) is one of the ten leading causes of death in US. It is marked
      by episodic acute exacerbations of the underlying liver disease which often leads to severe
      symptoms, poor quality of life, mental deterioration and repeated hospitalizations.

      The overall purpose of this project is to introduce a telehealth based intervention
      (involving remote monitoring of symptoms and cognitive function initiated at the time of
      discharge of ESLD patients. This will support enhanced clinical care and improve
      self-management in ESLD population. In addition, it will reduce healthcare utilization,
      improve medication adherence and overall health outcomes
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study to assess the effectiveness of an experimental telehealth
      intervention within the treatment of ESLD, and compare it with a historic cohort. All
      inpatients with advanced liver disease and at least 1 complication will be eligible to
      participate. the study group receives the Telehealth intervention and will be given an ipad
      preloaded with the instruments used for symptom monitoring and cognitive function assessment
      during the hospital admission.

    <description>Patients assigned to this arm receive the intervention in addition to routine standard of care. Telehealth based remote monitoring of symptoms and brain tests is the intervention in this study. A device with preloaded questionaires will be given to patients randomized to this group. The patients will respond on a daily basis for the 3 months of intervention phase.</description>
