  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and its associated diseases are increasing worldwide. However, the mechanisms behind
      the development of obesity is not fully understood. There is evidence that intestinal
      bacteria may play a role in the development and perpetuation of obesity through regulation of
      energy and fat storage.

      Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective modality for treating severe obesity with
      evidence to support long-term sustained weight loss and improvement in obesity-related
      comorbidities. The two most commonly performed bariatric surgical procedures are the
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). RYGB leads to greater weight
      loss than SG and improved diabetes control in patients following surgery. Despite the success
      of RYGB and SG in inducing weight loss and improving comorbidities, the underlying mechanisms
      leading to clinical improvement following these operations is not completely understood.
      Multiple factors are thought to play a role including reduced caloric intake, decreased
      nutrient absorption, increased satiety, release of hormones and shifts in bile acid
      metabolism.

      Recent evidence has suggested that the gut bacteria mediates a number of the beneficial
      effects of bariatric surgery. Small studies have demonstrated changes in the composition and
      diversity of the gut microbiota after RYGB and SG in humans. One study also confirmed
      long-term microbial changes for RYGB. However, comparative trials have been small (less than
      15 participants per treatment group) and important differences between specific bacterial
      populations have not been well elucidated. Furthermore, no human study has examined the
      differences in bacterial composition following RYGB and SG in relation to their metabolic
      consequences.

      The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the metabolic and microbial changes that
      occur with RYGB, SG, and dietary controls. Specifically, we aim to use a systems biology
      approach utilizing powerful analytic techniques including metagenomics, metabolomics, and
      multiplex immune profiling to define the combined microbial, metabolic and immunologic
      changes that occur after bariatric surgery.
