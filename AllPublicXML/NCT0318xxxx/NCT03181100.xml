      Objectives:

      Primary:

      To determine if targeted therapy + atezolizumab (cohorts 1-3) will lead to improved overall
      survival (OS) in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC).

      Secondary:

        1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy (RECIST response rate, progression-free survival
           [PFS]) of targeted therapy + atezolizumab (cohorts 1-3) in ATC and poorly differentiated
           thyroid cancer (PDTC).

        2. To determine the OS in patients with PDTC treated with targeted therapy + atezolizumab
           (cohorts 1-3).

        3. To determine the efficacy (RECIST response rate, progression-free survival [PFS]) and OS
           of ATC and PDTC patients treated with taxanes + atezolizumab (cohort 4)

      Induction Therapy:

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on what groups are available, the disease type that you have, and the mutations
      that are being checked for at screening:

        -  If you have the BRAF mutation, you will be assigned to Group 1.

        -  If you do not have the BRAF mutation but you do have the RAS mutation, you will be
           assigned to Group 2.

        -  If you do not have either the BRAF or the RAS mutation, you will be assigned to Group 3.

        -  If you are not eligible to be in Groups 1-3, you may be assigned to Group 4.

      You and the study staff will know to which group you have been assigned.

      You will receive a separate consent form for the Study Group to which you have been assigned.
      That consent form will describe the study treatment you have been assigned to receive in more
      detail, including a study visit schedule and possible risks and benefits.

      You may need to have additional screening tests to make sure you are eligible to receive
      treatment as part of that group. These will be described in the separate consent form. Some
      of these tests may show that you are not eligible to be in that specific group. If this is
      the case, you may be able to be enrolled in one of the other study groups. The study doctor
      will explain this to you if it is needed.

      Induction:

      You may be able to begin receiving study treatment in your Study Group right away. However,
      it may take some time to complete the screening tests. In this case, you will be offered
      induction therapy with either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel. If you receive induction therapy,
      you will receive the drug by vein over about 30 minutes 1 time each week for up to 3 weeks.

      This is an investigational study. Neither paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel are FDA approved or
      commercially available for the treatment of thyroid cancer.

      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Group 1:

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will first have a &quot;Run-In&quot;
      period. On Days 1-21 of the Run-In Period, you will receive vemurafenib and cobimetinib. You
      will take vemurafenib by mouth 2 times each day, about 12 hours apart each time. You will
      take cobimetinib by mouth 1 time each day. On Days 22-28 of the Run-In Period, you will
      continue taking a lower dose of vemurafenib, but you will not receive cobimetinib.

      After the Run-In Period, you will begin receiving the study drugs in 28-day study cycles.

      On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, you will receive atezolizumab by vein. The first time you
      receive atezolizumab, it will be given over about 60 minutes. After that, it may be given
      over about 30 minutes depending on how you tolerate it.

      You will also continue taking the lower dose of vemurafenib 2 times each day of every cycle,
      and receiving cobimetinib on Days 1-21 of every 28-day cycle.

      Bring any unused study drug, as well as any containers, to each study visit.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 15 of the Run-In Period, you will have an EKG.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam. If the screening physical exam was
           performed within 7 days before Day 1 of Cycle 1, it will not need to be repeated.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      On Day 15 of each Cycle:

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  At Cycles 1, 2, 3, then every 3 cycles after that, you will have an EKG.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for tests of the immune system and genetic
           testing.

        -  You will have an ECHO.

        -  You will have an eye exam.

        -  You will have a biopsy for tests of the immune system and genetic testing.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  At Cycle 4 and every 3 cycles after that, you will have a skin exam.

        -  At Cycle 5, 8, 11, and then every 4 cycles after that, you will have an eye exam.

        -  At Cycle 5 and every 3 cycles after that until Cycle 14, then every 4 cycles after that,
           you will have an ECHO.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      Every 8 weeks, you will have CT scans or MRIs to check the status of the disease.

      If at any point the disease gets worse:

      Â°Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn, and you will have a biopsy for tests of the
      immune system and genetic testing.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  You may have an EKG and an ECHO.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have CT scans or MRIs to check the status of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      You will be called several times after you stop receiving the study drugs and asked about how
      you are doing. Each call should last about 5 minutes. You will be called every 3 months for
      the first 2 years, then every 6 months during Years 3 and 4, then every year after that.

      About 6 months after your last dose of study drugs, you will have a skin exam.

      This is an investigational study. Atezolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer. Vemurafenib and cobimetinib
