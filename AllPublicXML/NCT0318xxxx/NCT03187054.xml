      The objective of the Preoperative Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ) versus
      Simulated Apical Support as a Guideline for Anterior or Posterior Repair at the Time of
      Transvaginal Apical Suspension (PREPARE) trial is to compare surgical outcomes of POPQ-based
      surgery with simulated apical support-based surgery for anterior or posterior vaginal wall
      prolapse at the time of transvaginal apical suspension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PREPARE trial is a prospective, randomized trial conducted with the aim to determine
      non-inferiority of the primary outcome between POPQ-based surgery and simulated apical
      support-based surgery for anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse. Participants will
      undergo transvaginal surgery for prolapse, including the assigned procedure for anterior or
      posterior vaginal prolapse under general or spinal anesthesia. Concomitant procedures will be
      performed as intended prior to surgery. Women with a uterus in situ will undergo hysterectomy
      and all women will receive transvaginal vault suspension, including uterosacral ligament
      suspension, sacrospinous ligament fixation, and iliococcygeal suspension with both delayed
      absorbable and permanent sutures, according to the preference of surgeon. Incontinence
      surgery will also be performed for women with documented urodynamic stress incontinence.

      A standardized protocol for enrollment, treatment and data collection will be employed by all
      sites. The study will be a single-blind study, as it is impossible to blind the study surgeon
      for the surgical procedure to which the subject in assigned. However, it is our intent that
      when feasible and ethical, all outcomes assessors and the subjects will be blinded to the
      treatment assignment. Postoperative follow-up will take place after 5 weeks and 6, 12, and 24
      months. Patients will undergo a standard gynecological examination including POPQ and fill in
      questionnaires.

    <description>Anatomic failure is defined as anterior or posterior vaginal descent beyond the hymen (i.e. POPQ point Ba or Bp&gt;0) or descent of the vaginal apex beyond half-way point of vagina (i.e. POPQ point C&gt;- total vaginal length (TVL)/2).
The presence of vaginal bulge symptoms is defined as an affirmative response to the question 3 from the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI)-20 (&quot;do you usually have a bulge or something falling out that you can see or feel in your vaginal area?&quot;).</description>

    <description>The PFDI-20 is a valid and reliable condition-specific quality-of-life questionnaires for women with pelvic floor disorders. It has 20 items and 3 scales (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory, Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory and Urinary Distress Inventory). Each scale is scored from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater symptom burden. The PFDI-20 total score is obtained by adding the scores from the 3 scale scores together (0-300).</description>

    <description>The PFIQ-7 is a valid and reliable condition-specific quality-of-life questionnaires for women with pelvic floor disorders. It has 7 questions and each question has 3 separate responses (one for each of 3 scales; Urinary Impact Questionnaire, Colo-rectal-anal Impact Questionnaire, and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire). Each scale is scored from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater symptom burden. The PFIQ-7 total score is obtained by adding the scores from the 3 scales together (0-300).</description>

    <description>The PISQ-12 is a valid and reliable condition-specific questionnaire that evaluates sexual function in women with urinary incontinence and/or pelvic organ prolapse. It has 12 items and responses are graded on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4. A total of 48 is the maximum score; higher scores indicate better sexual function.</description>
