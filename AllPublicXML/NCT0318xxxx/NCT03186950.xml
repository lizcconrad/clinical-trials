  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pulp therapy in primary teeth is designed to eliminate the infection and keep the tooth
      in a functional state until its natural exfoliation. An important step for the success of
      endodontic therapy is the final restoration, which must seal the tooth, avoiding new
      contamination. Thus, this study proposes to carry out a randomized clinical trial with
      longitudinal follow-up of two years, in order to compare the degree of success of endodontic
      treatment in primary teeth restored with two different techniques: composite resin (Filtek
      Bulk Fill - 3M ESPE) or stainless steel crowns (3M ESPE). Success will be measured by
      clinical and radiographic features of primary teeth treated with the different restorations
      after 1, 6, 12 and 24 months. Among the secondary outcomes that will be assessed are the
      quality and durability of restorations and the cost benefit of treatments. Patients who seek
      the university clinics and require endodontic treatment will be invited to participate. The
      sample unit is the tooth and these will be randomized in groups through a randomization list
      created and distributed in sequential opaque envelopes. The envelope will be opened only
      after the end of endodontic treatment, to ensure allocation concealment. The data will be
      statistically analyzed using the Stata 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
      The longevity of the treatments will be evaluated by estimating survival rates using the
      Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between survival rates according to the type of endodontic
      proposed treatment will be analyzed using the log-rank test. All other clinical variables
      will be analized using Cox regression. The significance level for all analyzes will be 5%.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the success or failure of endodontic treatments evaluated through the tooth permanence in the arcade on clinical and radiographic conditions of normality compared between groups restorations (steel crown or composite).
The clinical criteria to determine success are: absence of fistula, absence of painful symptoms, absence of pathological mobility and adequate gingival contour. Radiographically, the success criteria are: absence / reduction of rarefaction and absence / bone thinning in the furcation region later, maintenance of periradicular space, root resorption compatible with eruptive phase and absence of pathological resorption</description>

    <description>It will be assess the need for any type of reintervention, both for the steel crown group and for the composite resin. Thus, our primary outcome will be measured in accordance with the evaluation of restorations, not only by the failure or not endodontic treatment.
Clinical sucess: no fistulae or abscess Radiographic sucess: Reduction or maintenance of the interradicular lesion; No crypt breakup</description>
