      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of major bleeding and
      stroke/systemic embolism (SE) among novel oral anti-coagulant (OAC) naïve and warfarin naïve
      Medicare Advantage patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) treated with
      apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin.

        Patients will be selected from the MORE Registry according to the inclusion/exclusion
        criteria. Four different cohorts will be evaluated: patients who were prescribed warfarin,
        apixaban, dabigatran or rivaroxaban. Only users of oral anticoagulant treatment from
        January 1, 2013 to January 1, 2016 will be included in this study.
