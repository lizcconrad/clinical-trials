    <description>the Four Square Step Test (FSST) performance video for enhancing the dynamic balance and the video including participants' daily activities to increase the gait ability such as walking in a corridor, walking around the hospital, walking to the therapy room, coming out of the ward after opening and closing the door of it, coming in and out of toilet, shifting their blue plate. and bringing something from a refrigerator were produced and watched.</description>
