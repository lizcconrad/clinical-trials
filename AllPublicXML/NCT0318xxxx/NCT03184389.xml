  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to build systems that can recognize when people are stressed and
      then provide them with relaxation prompts in the moment to reduce their likelihood of being
      stressed, smoking, or overeating in the near future. Using these systems should help smokers
      be more effective in their attempts to quit by reducing their tendency to lapse when they are
      stressed or experiencing other negative moods or behaviors.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is (1) to evaluate the feasibility of a just-in-time intervention
      to decrease stress in recently quit smokers; and (2) to examine whether a just-in-time
      adaptive intervention that decreases stress also reduces the near-term odds of a smoking
      lapse.

      The primary hypothesis of this study is that the administration of a prompt to perform a
      relaxation exercise as compared to no prompt will lead to a lower likelihood of being
      stressed in the subsequent two hours, and that this effect will be stronger when the prompt
      is administered when the individual is stressed. The secondary hypothesis is that stress
      episodes will predict the timing of smoking lapses. The third hypothesis is that
      administration of a prompt to perform a relaxation exercise will reduce the odds of smoking
      for the next two hours, and that this effect will be stronger when the prompt is administered
      when the individual is stressed. The fourth (exploratory) hypothesis is that stress will
      predict the timing of overeating episodes.

      These data will also be used for developing automated risk prediction of smoking relapse, and
      for developing decision rules for the timing of Just-In-Time-Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs).

    <description>Study smartphone and software will be used to deliver intervention prompts to use stress management applications on the study smartphone at various times throughout the day, during at least 10 days of study participation. The delivery of prompts will be micro randomized to occur when participants are classified as stressed, and when participants are not classified as stressed. Headspace, a commercial stress management application, will be installed on the study smartphones. Thought Shakeup and Mood Surfing, stress management applications that are not commercially available, also will be installed on the study smartphones. These smartphone applications guide participants through stress management exercises that draw upon techniques from mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acceptance and commitment therapy.</description>

    <ipd_description>Following completion of this study, a de-identified dataset, (i.e., containing no raw location/GPS information), will be generated and made available to interested researchers upon request. The dataset will be stripped of any information that could be linked back to the original data or to an individual participant. Prospective users of this dataset must sign a confidentiality agreement, requiring that they must get permission from the MD2K Center to share the data with anyone else. All external requests for data will be directed to Dr. Bonnie Spring and routed through the MD2K Center. Prospective investigators will submit a written proposal to the MD2K Executive Committee outlining the question they will investigate, the specific variables that they need to answer that question, their analytic plan for answering that question, and documentation of sufficient Institutional Review Board oversight. Investigators will also need to sign a confidentiality agreement.</ipd_description>
