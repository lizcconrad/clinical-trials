    <textblock>
      Patient Empowerment through Predictive PERsonalised decision support (PEPPER) is an European
      Union (EU) funded research project to develop a personalised clinical decision support system
      for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) self-management. The tool provides insulin bolus dose
      advice, tailored to the needs of individuals. The system uses Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), an
      artificial intelligence methodology that adapts to new situations according to past
      experience. The PEPPER system also incorporates a safety module that promotes safety by
      providing glucose alarms, low-glucose insulin suspension, carbohydrate recommendations and
      fault detection.The principal research objectives are to assess the usability, safety, and
      technical proof of concept and feasibility of the PEPPER in participants with T1DM.
      Evaluation of safety is a priority and will be assessed throughout the clinical studies. The
      safety components only of the PEPPER system will initially be evaluated in an out-of-clinic
      environment (phase 1) and will measure incidence and percentage time spent in hypoglycaemia,
      evaluate usability and incidence of technical faults. Following the initial safety study, the
      overall PEPPER system (integrated with the CBR algorithm) will be assessed (phase 2) and the
      primary outcome will be percentage time spent in hypoglycaemia.

      1. Description of the components of the PEPPER system:

           Decision support algorithm The decision support algorithm is based on case-based
           reasoning (CBR). CBR is an artificial intelligence technique that tries to solve newly
           encountered problems by applying the solutions learned from solved problems encountered
           in the past. A combination of parameters makes up the case problem presented to the CBR
           algorithm. Using this information the algorithm will find a similar case scenario from
           the pool of previously encountered cases and recommend an improved solution (insulin
           dose) to achieve the best possible outcome (post-prandial blood glucose). Each new case
           includes information about the problem (e.g. capillary blood glucose, meal information
           etc), solution (recommended insulin dose) and outcome (post-prandial blood glucose).

           PEPPER offers a dual architecture for both Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) or Continuous
           Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) therapy. In both cases, the user periodically wears
           a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and an activity monitor.

           Handset CSII version: The handset is a portable touch-screen device, which communicates
           directly with the insulin pump. Its primary function in PEPPER is to allow the user to
           precisely manage insulin therapy by accepting or rejecting bolus insulin dose
           recommendations, calculated by the CBR based decision support algorithm, via a graphical
           interface. In addition, it measures and automatically records glucose levels (via a
           built-in Blood Glucose (BG) strip reader) and allows logging of food intake and other
           parameters.

           MDI version: This handset is a commercially available Smartphone with the insulin
           recommendation application running locally on a standard operating system such as iPhone
           Operating System (iOS) or Android. It has the same functionality as the CSII version,
           except that it does not have a built-in capillary blood glucose (CBG) reader but instead
           imports data wirelessly from external CBG monitors.

           Secure web server Revision: The handset wirelessly reports the user's case history to
           the secure portal, a web site which allows the clinician to add new patients, and review
           the cases to decide which ones should be kept. A case comprises multiple parameters such
           as carbohydrate intake, BG reading, meal composition, physical activity and hormone
           cycle.

           Personal Health Record on the secure portal allows patients and clinicians to view and
           update selected components of the detailed history.

           Insulin delivery system MDI: will continue using the same insulin they were on. CSII:
           will use the Cellnovo insulin pump.

           Continuous glucose monitoring system The glucose sensor that will be used throughout the
           clinical studies is the Dexcom sensor (CE marked, manufactured by Dexcom). This current
           is proportional to the glucose concentration in interstitial fluid and is calibrated
           against blood glucose a minimum of 12-hourly. The Dexcom CGM data is automatically
           transmitted to a secure web-based server and the secure PEPPER web-portal. Participants
           will be able to see their CGM data at all times and this will be used continuously
           throughout the studies.

           Safety features Low and high glucose alarms will be incorporated to alert the user when
           hypo- and hyperglycaemia is detected to enable the user to act accordingly to bring the
           glucose levels back to target range.

           Glucose prediction algorithm for hypoglycaemia prediction The hypoglycaemia prediction
           algorithm will enable the system to automatically activate the low glucose suspension
           feature in pump participants (suspension of insulin delivery until glucose levels are
           within the target range) and/or trigger an adaptive carbohydrate adviser, which will
           recommend a personalised carbohydrate snack.

           Insulin safety constraints Personalised maximum insulin dose thresholds will be
           incorporated to prevent overdosing on insulin.

           Fault detection Insulin pumps and CGMs are well-established technologies, but faults in
           these devices (e.g. pump occlusion, loss of sensor sensitivity) may occur. A fault
           detection system will identify such faults and alert the user to recommend a
           corresponding action to revert to the normal state.

           Participants will have the opportunity to call a physician for medical support and an
           engineer for technical support 24 hours a day.

           2.2 Recruitment This is a multicentre study and recruiting for the clinical study will
           be undertaken in the diabetes clinics at the Institut d'Investigació Biomédica de Girona
           (IdIBGi) (Spain) and the Imperial College London (ICL) (UK) from registered research
           databases and from interested participants who contact us.

           2.3.2 Phase 2: Clinical evaluation of safety, feasibility and usability of the PEPPER
           system.

           Objective: To demonstrate safety and technical proof of concept of the overall PEPPER
           system (integrated with the CBR algorithm).

           Primary outcome and secondary outcomes are defined in Outcome Measures.

           Timescale and population are the same as in phase 1.

           Visit 4: 6-week visit (6 weeks after visit 2) Same as in phase 1 visit 4

           Visit 5: Final visit Step 5 of usability study

           2.3.3 Usability study

           Usability of the system will be evaluated throughout the clinical trial phases and
           redevelopment of the system will be done accordingly.

           Objectives: to evaluate usability of the PEPPER handsets over a sustained time period.

           Step 1: Training observation Participants will be trained in use of devices. The handset
           will be filmed during the training to see which aspect is being described.

           Step 2: Contextual interview The aim is to gather data at an early stage of the
           usability engineering process. They will be used to understand the intended use of all
           parts of the system and the characteristics that relate to safety, within an everyday
           context. The interview will be semi-structured with choice of questions.

           Step 3: Diary study Data will be collected via the Smartphone in a variety of formats.
           The study follows on from the contextual interview and concludes with an exit interview.
           Participants will also be phoned at weekly intervals to see how they are finding the
           bolus advice and to check that there are no problems.

           Data collection. Participants will be asked to make diary entries each time they use the
           PEPPER bolus advisor. Data will be collected using a Smartphone app. It may take a
           variety of formats including photos, voice memos, text. In addition, written notes will
           be made after each weekly phone call.

           Step 4: Diary exit interview The purpose is to drill down into some of the diary entries
           to discover supplementary information. Participants will be asked to review each of the
           diary entries, giving further explanation.This will be followed by an unstructured
           interview.

           The diary will be filmed during the conversation to see which entry is being described.

           Step 5: Contextual group All of the members of the feasibility study will be invited to
           a social meeting in an informal location. The purpose of the session will be to validate
           the findings from the previous steps.The researcher will endeavour to be an unobtrusive
           bystander in the discussion, and not offer personal opinions but listen for common
           issues and themes.

           Data collection. Data will be gathered on a notepad or laptop in a visible way.

           Data will be gathered using an audio recorder in steps 1-4.

           2.4 Statistics The sample size is comparable to other technology pilot safety studies,
           is a realistic number for recruitment and provides robust safety data. The study is not
           powered to show a change in the primary or secondary outcomes compared with usual care
           but is an assessment of a new technology.

           2.5 Confidentiality of data collected during interviews To ensure security, data
           obtained during the course of the interviews will be encrypted and stored securely, with
           access limited solely to the researchers. Data will be de-identified such that only the
           researchers will be able to link the data to the participant involved using reversible
           codes. This is done purely for the purpose of comparison and evaluation across the
           separate interviews. Any resulting publications using the data will not identify the
           participants, and any quotes will kept anonymous should participants consent to this.

           2.6 Electronic data storage on secure web-server Data security and privacy will be a
           priority whilst dealing with medical data such as that held in the PEPPER system. During
           the clinical studies (phases 1-2) anonymous clinical data will be entered and stored on
           a secure web-server. Anonymous data collected by the PEPPER handset (such as glucose,
           meal information, physical activity, alcohol, exercise) and the Dexcom CGM system will
           be automatically transmitted to the secure web-server. For this purpose, EU regulatory
           procedures (Directives 95/46/EC and 2002/58/EC) will be observed. Medical data will be
           stored and protected against non-authorised access; transmission of data will be
           secured; only authorised users will have access to services and stored data.
           Authentication will be required for application use and data synchronisation. PEPPER
           will operate according to standard interoperability guidelines (e.g. HL7), so that
           information can be exchanged seamlessly between the various components. Authorised users
           will include study team members from the PEPPER collaborators. Collaborators will only
           be able to view anonymous PEPPER handset data.

           The data generated by the study will be analysed by the collaborative PEPPER research
           team at their respective sites. The analysis will be on anonymised data which will be
           aggregated during joint meetings on either clinical site.

           Missing, unused, and spurious data will be assessed on an individual basis and may be
           ignored, withdrawn or the visit may be removed from the analysis with appropriate
           justification adjudicated by the Principal Investigator.

           2.7 Adverse Events (AEs) Reporting Procedures All adverse events will be reported.
           Depending on the nature of the event the reporting procedures below will be followed.
           Any questions concerning adverse event reporting will be directed to the Chief
           Investigator in the first instance.

           Non serious AEs: All such events will be recorded.

           Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): An SAE form will be completed and faxed to the Chief
           Investigator within 24 hours. However, hospitalisations for elective treatment of a
           pre-existing condition do not need reporting as SAEs.

           Reports of related and unexpected SAEs will be submitted within 15 days of the Chief
           Investigator becoming aware of the event. The Chief Investigator will also notify the
           Sponsor of all SAEs, where in the opinion of the Chief Investigator, the event is:

             -  'related', i.e resulted from the administration of any of the research procedures;
                and

             -  'unexpected', i.e an event that is not listed in the protocol as an expected
                occurrence Local investigators will report any SAEs as required by their Local
                Research Ethics Committee, Sponsor and/or Research &amp; Development Office.
