  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory experiment, aims to explore the effective and safety of thalidomide in
      the treatment of TI to improve the hemoglobin level, improve the quality of life, reduce
      blood transfusion, so as to avoid the adverse reactions caused by transfusion,60~100 patients
      will be enrolled.

      The project is a single arm research of thalidomide in TI,patients volunteered to participate
      in this trial and met the following inclusion criteria will be enrolled: age from 18~65,
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 2 or less. Subjects
      should take thalidomide 50mg per day. During this time, hepatic and renal function,
      hematologic function, electrocardiogram and the adverse reactions were closely observed.
      According to the protocol, the blood routine, peripheral blood reticulocyte count, nucleated
      red blood cell count, hemoglobin electrophoresis and other indicators were evaluated in
      screening-period visit,1-month visit, 3-months visit , 6-months visit ,9-months visit,
      12-months visit and 15-months visit.
