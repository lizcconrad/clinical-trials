    <textblock>
      Introduction: Pelvic floor muscle dysfunctions (PFMD) represent a major public health problem
      manifesting through lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), anorectal and sexual dysfunction.
      PFMD is a common problem in cervical cancer (CC) survivors with a negative impact in quality
      of life (QoL). Aim: This study aims to assess the effect of the exercise protocol in the
      overall quality of life. Secondly, it is aimed to evaluate the effect of a exercise protocol
      in the PFMD; the QoL in the PFMD and the adherence to exercise protocol. Methods: Patients
      with a diagnosis of CC, of any stage, histology and grade, accompanied by the Oncology
      Gynecology Service of the Clinic Hospital of Medical School of Ribeirão Preto of University
      of São Paulo will be studied in the period between 2004 and 2014. For the analysis of the
      prevalence of PFMD will be applied the Discomfort Questionnaire on the Floor Pelvic (PFDI-20)
      for evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) complaints, anorectal symptoms and urinary
      incontinence, and the Sexual Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence and Pelvic Organ Prolapse
      (PISQ-12) for evaluation of sexual function. Both questionnaires have already been validated
      for the Portuguese language and are specific for women with PFMD. The Pelvic Floor Impact
      Questionnaire (PFIQ-7) will also be applied to assess the impact of PFMD on QoL, daily life
      activities and emotional health. For the evaluation of overall QoL, the EORTC QLQ-C30
      questionnaire and its specific module for patients with CC, QLQ-CX24, will be used. Patients
      evidenced with PFMD through the application of the proposed questionnaires will be invited to
      participate in a exercise protocol with sessions held once a week with a duration of 45
      minutes each during the period of 12 week. Protocol will be supervised by a single
      physiotherapist.
