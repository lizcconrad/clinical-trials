  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to learn how patients breathe on portable oxygen
      concentrators (POCs), and to get feedback from patients using POCs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This observational study aims to examine patient oxygenation levels and markers of exertion
      (e.g. breath rate, heart rate and breath pattern) while using a portable oxygen concentrator,
      with the aim to understand exercise desaturation in hypoxemic subjects.
