  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to evaluate efficacy of prophylactic Ingavirin intake by people
      having contact with sick people infected with influenza and other acute respiratory viral
      infections

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes 7 days of treatment period and 30 days of follow-up, 37 days total.

      The participant was receiving Ingavirin or placebo for 7 days. Then during 30 days the
      participant was under supervision.

      Visits were performed at days 2-7 (every day) since inclusion and then every 5 days during
      follow-up period.

      Wherever during the study the participant developed symptoms of flu or other acute
      respiratory viral infection, the participant was taken for medical care to observe his
      condition, symptoms dynamics, lab tests, including laboratory verification of viral origin of
      the disease. Medical care was established for 10±2 days since symptoms. Everyday for 3 days
      and additional visits for 5±1 and 10±2 days of the disease.

      The patient had the required symptomatic treatment, additionally the patient could be
      institutionalised if necessary.

      Wherever the participant developed symptoms during treatment period, the patient was taken
      investigational drug on schedule.

    <description>To evaluate incidence difference between Ingavirin and placebo groups. Incidence defined as ratio between number of people got sick in the group to all people in the group. 1) Efficiency Index (EI) was defined as incidence of flu in placebo group to incidence of flu in Ingavirin group. 2) Efficacy Ratio (ER) defined by formula: ER=(incidence in placebo group - incidence Ingavirin group)*100% then divided by incidence in placebo group.</description>
