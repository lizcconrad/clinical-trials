  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dapagliflozin is a medicine to treat diabetes. Its mechanism of action is via sodium-glucose
      co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition. In adults with diabetes, use of sodium-glucose
      co-transporter 2 inhibitors is associated with moderate weight (fat) loss, in addition to
      other health benefits, including decreased blood pressure, decreased inflammation, and
      decreased oxidative stress. It is unclear as to whether these health benefits are due to
      SGLT2 inhibition per se, or as a secondary effect of weight loss. We wish to compare the
      health benefits of dietary counseling for weight loss with and without concomitant use of an
      SGLT2 inhibitor.

      This is a randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled, double blind, repeated measures study.
      50 overweight/obese adults (body mas index &gt; 27.5 kg/m2) will be recruited for participation
      and randomly assigned to one of two 12 week treatments: (1) daily oral administration of
      Dapagliflozin with dietary counseling to promote weight loss; or, (2) daily oral
      administration of a placebo with dietary counseling to promote weight loss.
