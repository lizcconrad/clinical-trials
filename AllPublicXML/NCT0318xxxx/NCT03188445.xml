      Intravenous iron isomaltoside versus oral iron supplementation for treatment of iron
      deficiency in pregnancy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency (ID) in pregnant women can cause iron deficiency anaemia (IDA). ID is defined
      by low iron stores, measured by a low level of s-ferritin. Iron is essential for the
      synthesis of haemoglobin (Hb). Anaemia is defined by a low Hb level (&lt;11.0 g/dL in 1st
      trimester, &lt;10.5 g/dL in 2nd, and &lt;10.5 - 11.0 g/dL in 3rd trimesters).

      In Danish pregnant women, who do not take iron supplementation approximately 50 % have ID and
      21 % have IDA. According to WHO anaemia, defined as Hb &lt;11.0 g/dL, regardless the cause is
      estimated to occur in 24 % of Danish pregnant women.

      This trial is designed to evaluate and compare the effect of IV iron isomaltoside to a fixed
      dose of oral iron administered as tablet ferrous fumarate with ascorbic acid as correction of
      IDA in pregnant women after 4 weeks of standard treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women aged ≥18 years

          2. Pregnancy at GA 14+0 - 19+0

          3. Ferritin &lt;30 μg/L after 4 weeks of standard treatment in a clinical setting

          4. Willingness to participate and attend all planned follow-up visits, and signing the
             in-formed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of anaemia caused by e.g. thalassemia, hypersplenism or haemolytic anaemia
             (known haematologic disorder other than iron deficiency)

          2. Iron overload or disturbances in utilisation of iron (e.g. haemochromatosis and
             haemosiderosis)

          3. Drug hypersensitivity (i.e. previous hypersensitivity to IV iron)

          4. Known hypersensitivity to any excipients in the investigational drug products

          5. History of active asthma within the last 5 years

          6. History of multiple allergies

         10. Treated with IV iron products or blood transfusion within 4 weeks prior to inclusion

         11. Treated with erythropoietin (EPO) within 4 weeks prior to inclusion

         12. Participation in any other interventional trial where the trial drug has not passed 5
             half-lives prior to inclusion

         13. Any other medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may cause the
             subject to be unsuitable for the completion of the trial or place the subject at
             potential risk from being in the trial

         14. Meeting RBC-transfusion criteria (Hb ≤6.9 g/dL= 4.3 mmol/L with intolerable symptoms
             of anaemia like severe palpitations, severe dizziness, shortness of breath at rest or
             syncope or an Hb ≤6.4 g/dL (4.0 mmol/L) without intolerable symptoms of anaemia)

         15. Multiple pregnancies

         16. Inability to read and understand the Danish language
