      This multi-center, Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, 3-Period Crossover,
      Positive Control study designed to evaluate the QT interval prolongation potential of 10 mg
      to 60 mg doses of APL-130277 compared to placebo and the positive control, 400mg moxifloxacin
      in subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD) who experience motor fluctuations (&quot;OFF&quot; episodes)
      The patient is titrated to the highest tolerated dose from 10mg to 60mg, and then is
      randomized to one of six crossover sequences. Each sequence includes treatment with the
      following:

        1. Treatment A: APL-130277 at the dose determined in the Dose Titration Phase,

        2. Treatment B: Matched placebo,

        3. Treatment C: A single 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin
