      To use a variety of renal imaging modalities, including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI),
      blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) imaging, T1rho (T1rho) imaging, and dynamic contrast
      enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to evaluate the intra-renal blood flow,
      perfusion, cellularity, fibrosis and atrophy within the kidneys of patients with lupus
      nephritis (LN) and compare these parameters to renal biopsy findings to determine whether
      DWI, BOLD, T1rho, and DCE-MRI may provide a set of non-invasive tools to assess renal
      function and pathology in LN.

    <description>This is a multicenter, non-interventional, pilot study. Eligible subjects will have a baseline MRI of the kidney, including anatomical, DWI, BOLD, T1rho, and DCE-MRI, utilizing a macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA), followed by planned standard of care (SOC) renal biopsy and clinical laboratory assessments. Additional serum and urine will be collected from subjects at baseline for analysis of research biomarkers. Following the results of the biopsy and clinical laboratory assessments, subjects will be treated for their underlying disease at the discretion of the investigator.
At 6 months, subjects will return to the clinic for a second MRI, SOC clinical and laboratory evaluation and collection of serum and urine for analysis of research biomarkers.</description>
