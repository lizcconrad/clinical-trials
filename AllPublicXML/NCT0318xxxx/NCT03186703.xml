  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal is to be a trustworthy source for health
      information. The Portal team can see (through measuring analytics of website use) that
      thousands of people are using the Portal and the knowledge-sharing strategies in place (email
      alerts, Twitter and Facebook), with many more users added each month. Previous studies have
      measured the quality and trustworthiness of health information available online; others have
      studied the numbers and populations who use different types of information and how easy it is
      to use and understand. This study builds on that knowledge to find out: if easy-to-understand
      evidence-based messages reach members of the public, do these messages change what people
      know and think to do to stay healthy (in this case, what they know and think to do to lower
      their risk of cancer)?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Half of cancers are preventable through lifestyle modification such as smoking cessation,
      healthy eating, increasing physical activity and reducing alcohol intake; however, few
      Canadians engage in behaviours that are in line with cancer prevention guidelines. This may
      be in part due to lack of access to evidence-based information and the mixed messages on
      effective cancer prevention strategies that are propagated in the popular media.

      The McMaster Optimal Aging Portal (the Portal) is a knowledge translation (KT) tool launched
      in 2014 to increase public access to trustworthy health information. Citizen-friendly content
      (blog posts, evidence summaries, web resource ratings) provide easy-to-read 'bottom line'
      messages appropriate for all audiences. Investigators would now like to know if and how KT
      strategies used to disseminate citizen-targeted information on cancer prevention impact
      knowledge, behavioural intentions and health behaviours of Canadian adults.

      This study will use a sequential mixed-methods design consisting of a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) and a qualitative process study to explore RCT findings in depth. This
      formative approach will allow for a deeper analysis of the outcomes of interest (knowledge,
      intentions and behaviours), and the KT process. Following baseline data collection, eligible
      participants will be randomized to a 12-week intervention or control group.

      During the intervention, participants will have access to the Portal, be invited to follow a
      Twitter and Facebook feed, and receive tailored weekly email alerts including blog posts and
      evidence summaries on cancer prevention. Control group participants will have access the
      Portal in a 'self-serve' fashion, but will not receive KT strategies.
