  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mother-to-Child-Transmission (MTCT) of HBV is the most important route in high endemic
      countries. Although active-passive immune prophylaxis is generally administrated to infants
      delivered by HBsAg positive women, there are a lot of people infected with HBV in China. High
      HBV DNA load (&gt;10^5IU/ml) is the vital cause of MTCT. So some researchers used TDF
      （tenofovir） or LDT（telbivudine） to treat patients with high HBV DNA load during middle, late
      pregnancy, in order to decrease MTCT. As a result, some data about it were gradually reported
      in late years. Recently, American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, European
      Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and China guidelines for CHB (chronic hepatitis
      B) suggest that pregnant women with high HBV DNA load be treated with TDF or LDT at 24-28
      weeks of gestation to lower MTCT of HBV.

      Although TDF or LDT is classified as pregnancy B drugs by FDA, and many studies report that
      MTCT rate of HBV decreases after women with high HBV DNA load are administrated with TDF or
      LDT at 24-28 weeks of gestation, a few birth defects are reported. Furthermore, the
      long-effect of TDF or LDT on infants remains unclear thoroughly.

      Some CHB women had severe liver dysfunction before pregnancy or during pregnancy, and routine
      liver protection therapy could not effect. Some of them could develop into liver failure,
      fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even died. Moreover, severe liver dysfunction often leads to adverse
      effects to pregnant women and fetuses, such as pregnancy failure, lower weight, premature
      birth, etc. As a result, these women have to accept TDF or LDT before pregnancy, or during
      early pregnancy. So the long-effect of TDF or LDT on infants needs thoroughly investigating.

      Taken together, the investigators will enroll women with chronic HBV infection and evaluate
      their state of illness. Then the investigators treat participants with TDF or LDT or routine
      liver protection therapy, and follow up the participants for a long period. The
      investigators' objectives are as follows:

      A, To clarify efficacy and adverse effects of TDF/LDT in preventing MTCT between
      immune-tolerant and immune-active CHB patients.

      B, To clarify efficacy and adverse effects of TDF/LDT in preventing MTCT during different
      trimesters of pregnancy.

      C, To compare MTCT rate between patients received TDF/LDT therapy and patients without
      TDF/LDT therapy.

      D, To compare MTCT rate and adverse effects between LDT and TDF.
