  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thermotherapy is a technology aiming at destroying tissue, for example tumor tissue.
      Immunostimulating Interstitial Laser Thermotherapy (imILT) is a specific form of
      thermotherapy, which, in addition to destroying tumor tissue, has been optimized to cause a
      tumor specific immunologic response. In laboratory animals the imILT method has also been
      shown to induce a so called abscopal effect. This means that when one tumor is treated with
      imILT other, untreated, tumors also decrease in size.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate efficiency when it comes to local tumor destruction
      of the imILT treatment method performed pecutaneously in patients diagnosed with pancreatic
      cancer. The purpose is also to investigate the functionality and safety of the method.

      This trial is an open-label, double-arm study. Twenty patients diagnosed with pancreatic
      cancer will be treated in this trial, ten recieving imILT treatment and ten recieving
      standard chemotherapy. The study is estimated to be carried out during a time period of 21
      months.
