  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2269557 is being developed as an anti-inflammatory and anti-infective agent for the
      treatment of inflammatory airways diseases. This is the first study using a new formulation
      of GSK2269557 in healthy subjects and will evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of a
      single dose of GSK2269557. Data derived from this study will inform on the PK profile and
      systemic exposure expected during Phase 2b. Approximately twelve healthy subjects will be
      randomized to receive a single dose of GSK2269557 750 micrograms (µg) or a single dose of
      GSK2269557 500 µg via the ELLIPTA® dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulated in a blend containing
      0.4 percent magnesium stearate (MgSt) in 1:1 ratio. This randomized, parallel group study
      will be carried out in 3 phases, including screening phase, treatment phase and follow-up
      phase. The total study duration for each subject will be up to 6 weeks. ELLIPTA is a
      registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.

          -  Current smoker or a history of smoking within 6 months of Screening, or a total pack
             year history of &gt;5 pack years. [Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per
