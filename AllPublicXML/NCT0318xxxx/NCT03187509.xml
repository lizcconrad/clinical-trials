  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized open-label pilot study. The purpose of the study is to
      compare standard of care outpatient heart failure management versus a weight based torsemide
      regimen. Subjects admitted to the hospital for heart failure exacerbation will be randomized
      upon discharge to either standard of care outpatient heart failure management or a weight
      based torsemide regimen. Those subjects randomized to standard of care therapy will be
      prescribed a daily fixed dose of a loop diuretic at hospital discharge and have a follow-up
      appointment within one week of discharge. All management decisions including loop diuretic
      type, dose and frequency will be made at the discretion of the subject's personal physician.
      Those randomized to an individualized weight based torsemide regimen will be prescribed a
      dose of torsemide upon hospital discharge based on a prespecified algorithm. These subjects
      will then undergo physician-subject phone encounters three times a week where the subject's
      torsemide dose will be modified based on the prespecified algorithm which incorporates
      current symptoms and weight. Primary end-point will be an unbiased estimate of 30-day all
      cause readmission rates. Secondary end-points include incidence of acute kidney injury,
      changes in brain natriuretic peptide levels from baseline and a preliminary estimate of the
      effect size and feasibility of a weight-based torsemide regimen intervention in order to plan
      a future larger study.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized to complete a weight-based torsemide dosing regimen for their outpatient heart failure management. These subjects will prescribed a specified dose of torsemide on discharge from the hospital and subsequently have a phone encounter with a physician three times a week where their dose of torsemide will be titrated based on an algorithm which factors in current symptoms and weight. Study subjects will have a final follow-up appointment at the completion of the study to evaluate current symptoms, weight and perform blood work to assess kidney function, electrolytes and brain natriuretic peptide levels.</description>
