    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was aimed to
      evaluate of sperm motility improvement effect of fermented ginseng(GINST). Experimental arm
      and control arm were randomly assigned among the volunteers who met the inclusion criteria:
      men between the ages of 18 and 60 who had sperm motility of less than 32%.

      To experimental arm, capsules including 160mg of fermented ginseng(GINST) ingredients will be
      provided for 12 weeks. To control arm, capsules of the same shape and weight as GINST
      capsules will be provided. These capsules are made of a cellulose component.

      Primary outcome is sperm motility. Secondary outcome are &lt;Brief Male Sexual Function
      Inventory&gt; , &lt;Fatigue Severity Scale&gt;, and &lt;the Short Form (36) Health Survey&gt; measured at
      baseline and end of the trial.
