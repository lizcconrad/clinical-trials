  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to assess whether celecoxib can reduce the change in
      collagen alignment and inflammatory response in the tumor tissue of primary breast cancer
      patients with invasive breast carcinoma after 2 weeks of oral intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in early detection techniques and improvement in systemic treatment of early stage
      breast cancer have led to a small decline in overall breast cancer mortality in the last 20
      years. New advances will require understanding of breast cancer biology at the molecular
      level. Inhibition of COX-2 and its analysis of effect in breast cancer tumor microenvironment
      provide one such fruitful therapeutic target. Tumor microenvironment is poorly understood in
      breast cancer research. Despite new drugs being developed to treat breast cancer and tested
      in clinical trials, it is rarely possible to assess how the drug is affecting the breast
      cancer cells at a molecular level. The use of collagen properties such as alignment and
      deposition will allow giving a faster diagnosis of breast cancer status and seeing how
      celecoxib with respect to collagen can change the tumor microenvironment in human tissue.
      This window trial provides a way to look at cancer and stromal cells before and after
      celecoxib intake to see if the drug is actively working. If we can do this before and after a
      patient has surgery, and see how the tumor microenvironment responds, then the physician
      could pick a better suited adjuvant treatment for this patient after surgical intervention
      that would improve their overall survival rate.

    <masking_description>Due to the characteristics of the design of this clinical trial, the patient will not be blinded but the researcher completing analysis will be. The researcher will be handling deidentified patient samples and comparing whether there are changes of biological markers within the same patient before and after celecoxib intake. It is important that the researcher be as unbiased as possible when analyzing collagen alignment and amount of other breast cancer biological markers.</masking_description>

    <description>The participants will be scheduled for the two quantitative breast MRI exams. Following the first MRI exam, participants will start taking celecoxib 200mg twice a day with food. Subjects will take a minimum of 26 doses and no more than 32 doses of celecoxib during the study.
Participants will intake 200mg of celecoxib two times a day (400mg/day total) for 2 weeks after biopsy. Histologic tissue samples will be obtained for evaluation at time of biopsy of the tumor and at time of surgery removal of the tumor.</description>

    <description>Celecoxib is the only COX-2 inhibitor currently approved by the FDA to be used in the United States. Recently, it has been shown that celecoxib prevents sporadic colorectal adenomas and there are more clinical trials evaluating the use of celecoxib in combination with chemotherapy regimens in breast cancer settings. Celebrex® oral capsules that will be used in this study contain 200 mg of celecoxib, in combination with inactive ingredients that include the following components: croscarmellose sodium, edible inks, gelatin, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, povidone and sodium lauryl sulfate.</description>
