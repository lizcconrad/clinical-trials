  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of patients with AML will die of the disease, and no standard chemotherapy
      regimen were defined for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Previous studies have
      confirmed the efficacy of cladribine in the treatment of AML, both de novo or
      relapse/refractory AML. Our previous experience has shown that Cladribine in combination of
      CAG (G-CSF priming, low dose cytarabine, and aclarubicin) are effective with tolerable
      toxicity profiling.Thus, this phase 2 clincial trial is going to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of cladribine in combination with G-CSF, low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin (C-CAG)
      in patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.
