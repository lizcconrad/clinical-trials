    <textblock>
      FLU-v is a broad spectrum influenza vaccine that targets regions in the influenza virus that
      are conserved among many different influenza strains.This study aims to assess efficacy of
      FLU-v vaccine in protecting healthy FLU-v vaccinated volunteers against an influenza
      challenge delivered intranasally under quarantine.

      Efficacy of FLU-v will be assessed by measuring the incidence and severity of the disease in
      the treatment groups compared to the placebo group. In addition, the immune responses of the
      volunteers to FLU-v will also be explored.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus is a highly variable virus. Most of its variability comes from the proteins
      on its surface, NA and HA. Current vaccines use these highly immunogenic proteins to induce
      production of neutralising antibodies, however because these proteins change from strain to
      strain, the antibody response is only efficient against the strain present in the vaccine and
      if the circulating strain is different to that in the deployed vaccine, it will not be
      protective.

      FLU-v, a novel peptide vaccine, aims to provide a broad-spectrum response and for that it
      uses as antigens viral proteins that are conserved throughout the different strains. These
      proteins are not located on the surface of the influenza virus like NA and HA are, but
      internally. These antigens are not capable of producing neutralising antibodies but can
      induce cytotoxic T cell responses and non-neutralising antibodies. When cells are infected
      with influenza, these internal viral antigens are presented on the surface of infected cells.
      Vaccination with FLU-v generates a population of T cells and non-neutralising antibodies that
      can recognise these antigens on the surface of infected cells. On recognition, T cells are
      activated and secrete Th1 cytokines such as INF-gamma, TNF-alpha, and release granzyme and
      perforin. Non-neutralising antibodies will activate complement and/or induce cytotoxic
      responses led by Natural Killer cells (NK cells). These T cells and antibody actions will
      result in the destruction of infected cells.

      A series of pharmacology, safety and toxicology studies have been carried out in two animal
      species, the mouse and the rat. Pharmacology studies have demonstrated that FLU-v is able to
      generate both a cell mediated and humoral response in vaccinated animals and that the cell
      mediated response is enhanced when FLU-v is injected together with an adjuvant. A safety
      pharmacology study in rats demonstrated that FLU-v had no biologically relevant effects on
      cardiovascular or respiratory parameters when administered subcutaneously alone or in
      combination with the adjuvant.

      The current study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, will assess the
      efficacy and safety of adjuvanted FLU-v administered as 2 vaccinations or 1 vaccination vs
      placebo prior to intranasal challenge with the Influenza A 2009 H1N1 human virus.

      In this study, the main efficacy comparisons are for each of the FLU-v groups to placebo. The
      study will also compare the two FLU-v dosing arms but will only have power to detect a
      significant difference in Mild to Moderate Influenza Disease (MMID) rates between the FLU-v
      groups and placebo and not against each other.

               -  Must not donate sperm following discharge from quarantine until 90 days after the
                  date of viral challenge/last dosing with IMP (whichever occurs last).

             Females:

             If of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and just
             prior to the date of Viral Challenge, and must be using contraception consisting of
             two forms of birth control (one of which must be a barrier method) starting from at
