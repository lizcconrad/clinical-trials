  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computer-based cognitive training has been found to be helpful for improving attention and
      working memory in pediatric and adult patients with existing cognitive difficulties. A
      previous study was conducted at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with survivors of
      childhood cancer who were experiencing difficulties with attention and/or working memory.
      Findings from that study indicated that the use of Cogmed, computer-based cognitive training,
      is effective in improving attention and working memory in survivors.

      Researchers want to learn whether Cogmed intervention completed at the end of therapy for
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia will be effective for all survivors (i.e., regardless of whether
      they have existing difficulties).

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the overall participation rate in a randomized, standard-of-care controlled
           trial of computerized cognitive intervention administered at the end of TOTXVI therapy.

        -  To estimate the study completion rate in a randomized, standard-of-care controlled trial
           of computerized cognitive intervention administered at the end of TOTXVI therapy.

        -  To estimate the compliance rate for participants randomized to the intervention arm of a
           computerized cognitive intervention administered at the end of TOTXVI therapy.

        -  To estimate the standard deviation for the overall cohort on a measure of working
           memory.

        -  To use neuroimaging data collected in the context of the Total Therapy XVI trial to
           explore candidate biomarkers predictive of response to the computerized cognitive
           intervention.

      Participants enrolled on the TOTXVI protocol at SJCRH will be randomized to either complete
      the Cogmed intervention at the end of their therapy, or to a standard-of-care condition.

      Cogmed is a computer-based cognitive training program that consists of rotating exercises
      that train attention and working memory. The exercises are presented in a child-friendly,
      game-like format. Training is completed at home in 25 sessions for 15-30 minutes each weekday
      for 5-9 weeks. A research team member serves as a coach who monitors progress and provides
      support through weekly phone calls with study participants and their parents/guardians.
      Information regarding compliance and performance is tracked over the internet and used to
      tailor feedback during weekly telephone coaching.

      Neurocognitive assessments will be conducted at the end of TOTXVI therapy (after
      randomization to Cogmed or standard of care), 4 months after completing TOTXVI therapy, and 1
      year after completing TOTXVI therapy.
