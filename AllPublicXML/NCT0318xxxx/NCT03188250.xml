  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preventing maternal and newborn deaths remain high on the global agenda. To address this, the
      Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH), in partnership with the Government of
      Kenya, launched Chama cha MamaToto, a community-led peer-support model that groups women
      together in pregnancy and infancy. Central to the chama approach is the integration of
      health, social and financial literacy education with a savings/loans program.

      To evaluate the feasibility of chamas, we analysed group attendance rates, GISE
      participation, membership retention, and continuation of the groups beyond the one year. To
      evaluate the effect of chamas, the investigators compared data from a prospective cohort of
      women in chamas with a group of controls who did not belong to a chama, matched for age,
      parity, and location of prenatal care. To evaluate the acceptability of chamas, FGDs were
      carried out with chama and non-chama participants, health providers and community health
      workers.
