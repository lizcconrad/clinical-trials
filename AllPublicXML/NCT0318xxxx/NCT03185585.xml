    <textblock>
      The COAST nutrition screening tool will be validated in 300 community-dwelling older adults
      in Florida.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population to be studied (n=300) will be individuals who are 60 years or older and
      participate in congregate meal sites or other community groups in Florida. Demographic
      information will be collected and participants will be assessed by the MNA® (Mini Nutrition
      Assessment) and screened by the COAST nutrition screening tool. Participants' hand grip
      strength and performance on the five times Sit to Stand test will be used to evaluate their
      functional status. Weight, height, mid-arm circumference and calf circumference will be
      measured as part of the MNA screening tool.

    <description>Participants will be asked to take the full MNA and COAST tools, separately .They will take a hand grip strength test to evaluate their functional status and five times Sit to Stand test as part of the COAST screening tool. Moreover, their weight, height, mid-arm circumference and calf circumference, will be measured as part of the MNA screening tool.</description>
