  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung recruitment maneuver induces a decrease in stroke volume, which is more pronounced in
      hypovolemic patients. The authors hypothesized that the changes of dynamic variables through
      lung recruitment maneuver could predict preload responsiveness in pediatric patients with
      lung protective ventilation

    <description>Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, pulse pressure variations, pleth variability index, and photoplethysmographic waveform were recorded before lung recruitment maneuver (application of continuous positive airway pressure of 25 cm H2O for 20 s), during lung recruitment maneuver when stroke volume reached its minimal value.
Stroke volume measured before and after volume expansion (10ml/kg saline, 0.9%, infused during 10 min). Patients were considered as responders to fluid administration if stroke volume increased greater than or equal to 10%.</description>
