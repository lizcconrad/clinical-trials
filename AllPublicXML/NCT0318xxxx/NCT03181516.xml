  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a
      health benefit on the host. One of the most common indications for probiotic treatment is the
      prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Unfortunately, many probiotic products
      used for AAD are not supported by rigorous independent research, and often results in
      non-evidence-based usage. The overarching objective is to move research forward for the most
      well-studied Bifidobacterium strain. The primary aim is to test the efficacy of high dose,
      BB-12-supplemented yogurt in preventing AAD, compared to yogurt without BB-12, in children
      receiving antibiotics. Other aims are to further assess the safety of yogurt supplemented
      with BB-12, and to carry out longitudinal community structure and gene expression analysis of
      fecal microbiota to evaluate the impact of high dose BB-12 in a pediatric population
      receiving antibiotics. The microbiota includes hundreds of species, and its disruption is
      hypothesized to be an important factor in the development of AAD.
