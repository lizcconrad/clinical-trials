    <textblock>
      The hypothesis to be investigated is that no difference will be found upon comparing resin
      composite strip crowns and NuSmile zirconia crowns (NuSmile ZR) esthetic primary anterior in
      restoring anterior primary teeth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to clinically evaluate the performance of a new NuSmile ZR esthetic
      primary anterior crowns, compared with anterior resin composite strip crowns in the
      restoration of 120 teeth (primary incisors and lateral anterior teeth in the deciduous
      dentition of child patients).
