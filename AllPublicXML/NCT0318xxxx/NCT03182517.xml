  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondary hyperparathyroidism is an important complication in patient with chronic kidney
      disease . It is associated with bone complication and an increase in cardiovascular mortality
      The parathyroid hormone rises in these patients as consequence of low concentration of
      vitamin D3 ,reduction in quantities of serum calcium, phosphorus retention and reduction of
      vitamin D receptors sensitive to calcium.
