  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial is comparing outcomes of customary Fit and Strong!, to Fit
      and Strong! Plus, an enhanced version of the program that incorporates weight management. We
      hypothesize that Fit and Strong! Plus participants will show improved diet behaviors at 2, 6,
      12, and 18 months that will be accompanied by a significant 5% weight loss at 6 months and
      maintained to 18 months, compared to participants in customary Fit and Strong!.

    <description>Fit and Strong! is a group exercise and self-management program that meets for 90 minutes, 3 days per week, for 8 weeks. Each 90 minute session consists of 60 minutes of multi-component physical activity (stretching/flexibility exercises, low-impact aerobics, and strength/resistance exercise) and 30 minutes of health education delivered from a structured curriculum. The health education topics build self-efficacy for managing arthritis through physical activity.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of the traditional Fit and Strong! intervention (see previous description), but the health education component has been revised to focus on diet and weight management in addition to physical activity and arthritis.</description>
