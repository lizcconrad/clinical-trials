  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct genetic comparisons between Turner Syndrome (TS) patients with
      and without Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) to identify causative agents of BAV in people with
      TS.

      The investigators will correlate the patterns and prevalence of structural heart defects in
      TS women with emerging molecular data to identify patients who are at high risk for
      cardiovascular complications

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Turner syndrome (TS) is a common chromosomal disorder that affects approximately 1 in 2500
      live female births. Complete or partial monosomy of one of the X chromosomes in a female is
      associated with various congenital heart defects (CHDs), which include aortic dilatation,
      coarctation of aorta and BAV. Congenital cardiovascular defects related to BAV are the
      leading cause of death in women with TS. The Turner Syndrome Network Registry (TRN Registry)
      and genetic sample repository can address gaps in knowledge of CHD in TS by facilitating the
      recognition of demographic and genetic patterns. TRN Registry-based research can improve
      surveillance of TS patients who are at risk for BAV and provide valuable insight into genetic
      components of BAV.

      The investigators will recruit TS patients into the TRN Registry and obtain blood and/or
      saliva samples after informed consent. The genetic diagnosis of TS will be confirmed using
      chromosomal microarrays. The array data will be also be used to identify genomic copy number
      variants, and rare variants in protein coding genes will be determined by exome sequencing.
      The investigators will derive induced pluripotent stem cells from some participants to
      determine why BAV is so prevalent in TS. BAV risk genes will be identified in comparisons
      between TS cases with and without BAV. To facilitate these comparisons, the investigators
      will abstract the demographic and medical data of registry participants from questionnaires
      and medical records. Imaging will be used to confirm the diagnosis of BAV and to determine
      the prevalence and severity of additional cardiovascular defects.

        The study population consists of females diagnosed with Turner Syndrome. This diagnosis can
        be based on physical symptoms (e.g. short stature, developmental delay, pubertal delay,
        etc.) or karyotype (e.g. 45X/46XX mosaic, 45X, etc.).
