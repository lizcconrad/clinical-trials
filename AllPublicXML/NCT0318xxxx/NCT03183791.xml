  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to assess the utility of smartphone-based progressive muscle
      relaxation (PMR) for the treatment of headaches. While there are many commercially available
      electronic diary and mind-body intervention apps for headache, there is little data showing
      their efficacy. RELAXaHEAD app incorporates the electronic PMR that was successfully used in
      an earlier epilepsy study and beta tested with headache specialist and migraine patient
      input. It also has functionality to track medications. This 2-arm randomized controlled study
      will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of RELAX for use with headache patients. One
      arm will be the RELAX group (the RELAXaHEAD app) and the other arm will be a monitored usual
      care (MUC) group (this group receives standard of care and uses the electronic daily symptom
      reporting diary). The goals are to assess the feasibility and adherence of the RELAX
      intervention in persons with headache (Aim 1) and to gather data on the effects of the RELAX
      intervention on headache disability (Aim 2).

    <description>The Research Volunteers (RV) will explain the rationale for PMR and load the RELAXaHEAD app onto the patients' smartphones. The RV will review the app with the subject, focusing on user knowledge, usability, and engagement. The patient will perform the 5 minute PMR session and discuss the optimal time and place to practice PMR at home. Subjects will also enter their headache log daily on the app.</description>

    <description>To match the time spent with the RV, patients will be given a general education session consisting of basic migraine information, such as evidence-based ways to treat headaches: treat early, limit acute medications &lt; 2-3 days/week, and call the primary care physician (PCP) if abortive medications are used more frequently. The RV will load the app onto the patients' smartphones but the PMR component will be blocked on the version of the app that the MUC patients receive. All patients will be asked to track headache frequency, intensity, and acute medication use on app.</description>
