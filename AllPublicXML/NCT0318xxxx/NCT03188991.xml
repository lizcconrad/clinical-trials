  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate intracystic NanoPac® (Sterile Nanoparticulate Paclitaxel)
      administered via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle injection (EUS-FNI) in subjects
      with mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label, dose rising trial with an expanded cohort at the dose of NanoPac®
      (Sterile Nanoparticulate Paclitaxel) determined to have the best tolerability and safety
      profile, subjects with mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms will receive intracystic NanoPac®
      via endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle injection (EUS-FNI). The study will include a
      dose escalation phase and a dose confirmation phase.

      Subjects will be enrolled in sequential cohorts of NanoPac® at 6, 10, and 15 mg/mL at volumes
      equal to the amount of fluid aspirated from the cyst. Each cohort will have three subjects,
      with cohorts enrolled sequentially starting at the lowest concentration. Following Data
      Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) review of the cohort data, the next cohort may begin
      enrolling, an additional three at the current dose may be enrolled, or if the first dose does
      not provide adequate safety and tolerability the study may be halted. The dose determined to
      be the most suitable for further evaluation, defined as the highest dose with an acceptable
      safety and tolerability profile (as determined by the DSMB), will enroll additional subjects
      to provide a total of 12 subjects at that dose level.

      Plasma samples will be taken on the day of NanoPac® injection at 1 and 2 hours after
      injection, as well as at each of the subsequent study visits, to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of intracystic NanoPac®.

      Subjects will be followed for 6 months after NanoPac® injection for safety, and cyst response
      to therapy (as shown by imaging). Cyst fluid will also be extracted and analyzed for cyst
      fluid markers.
