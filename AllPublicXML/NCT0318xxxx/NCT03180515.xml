  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous deep brain stimulation (cDBS) is an established therapy for the major motor signs
      in Parkinson's disease, however some patients find that it does not adequately treat their
      freezing of gait (FOG). Currently, cDBS is limited to &quot;open-loop&quot; stimulation,without
      real-time adjustment to the patient's state of activity, fluctuations and types of motor
      symptoms, medication dosages, or neural markers of the disease. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if an adaptive DBS system,responding to patient specific, clinically relevant
      neural or kinematic feedback related to FOG, is more effective than continuous DBS on the
      motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III) and gait measures of PD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, with bilateral symptoms at Hoehn and
             Yahr Stage greater than or equal to II.

          2. Documented improvement in motor signs on versus off dopaminergic medication, with a
             change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor (UPDRS III) score of &gt;=
             30% off to on medication.

          3. The presence of complications of medication such as wearing off signs,fluctuating
             responses and/or dyskinesias, and/or medication refractory tremor,and/or impairment in
             the quality of life on or off medication due to these factors.

          4. Subjects should be on stable doses of medications, which should remain unchanged until
             the DBS system is activated. After the DBS system is optimized(during which time the
             overall medication dose may be reduced to avoid discomfort and complications such as
             dyskinesias) the medication dose should remain unchanged, if possible, for the
             duration of the study.

          5. Treatment with carbidopa/levodopa, and with a dopamine agonist at the maximal
             tolerated doses as determined by a movement disorders neurologist.

          6. Ability and willingness to return for study visits, at the initial programming and
             after three, six and twelve months of DBS.

          7. Age &gt; 18

          8. Has a history of and/or displays freezing of gait

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with significant cognitive impairment and/or dementia as determined bya
             standardized neuropsychological battery.

          2. Subjects with clinically active depression, defined according to the Diagnostic and
             Statistical manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria and as scored
             on a validated depression assessment scale.

          3. Subjects with very advanced Parkinson's disease, Hoehn and Yahr stage 5 on medication
             (non-ambulatory).

          5. Subjects with an implanted electronic device such as a neurostimulator, cardiac
             pacemaker/defibrillator or medication pump.

          6. Subjects, who are pregnant, are capable of becoming pregnant, or who are breast
             feeding.

          7. Patients with cortical atrophy out of proportion to age or focal brain lesions that
             could indicate a non-idiopathic movement disorder as determined by MRI

          8. Subjects having a major comorbidity increasing the risk of surgery (prior
             stroke,severe hypertension, severe diabetes, or need for chronic anti-coagulation
             other than aspirin).

          9. Subjects having any prior intracranial surgery.

         10. Subjects with a history of seizures.

         11. Subjects, who are immunocompromised.

         13. Subjects, who require diathermy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or transcranial
             magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat a chronic condition.

         14. Subjects, who have an inability to comply with study follow-up visits or study
             protocol.

         15. Subjects, who are unable to understand or sign the informed consent.
