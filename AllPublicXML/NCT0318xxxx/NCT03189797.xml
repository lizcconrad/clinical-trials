      This study will be conducted to evaluate The Effect of tailored preventive program on caries
      incidence using International Caries Classification and Management System (ICCMS) at a follow
      up periods of 3 and 6 months.

      A detailed coded chart is designed including patient's personal data (name, age, gender,
      parent's occupation, address, and phone number) then medical history. Past dental history of
      the patient that is later confirmed during the clinical examination.

      a)In the study group Each person will undergo a clinical and oral examination in the dental
      surgery of the hospitals participating in the study. Pre-packaged and disposable
      instruments—dental mirrors, tweezers, probes will be used and cotton rolls will be used to
      remove plaque. ICCMS caries risk analysis will be assessed the likelihood of new lesions or
      caries progression. It involves the stratification of individuals into low, medium, or
      high-risk status according to the stage and the activity of the lesion

      After defining the individual patient's likelihood risk status and the diagnosis for each
      lesion, ICCMS presents a management element to build a comprehensive patient care plan as
      follow:

        1. Homecare program:

             1. Tooth brushing 2/day with a higher efficacy fluoride toothpaste (≥ 1,450 ppm F-),
                or High F- prescription toothpaste following the dental team instructions

             2. Prescribed F- mouth rinse .

        2. Clinical approaches :

             1. Motivational engagement (discuss with patients how to improve oral health
                behaviours - including amount of sugar), maintain dental visits at risk-based
                intervals .

             2. Sealants

             3. F- varnish 2 times /6months

             4. F- gels or solution (2% NaF) .

             5. Recalls up to every 3 months: professional cleaning &amp; topical F- application on
                active lesions .

             6. Dietary intake interventions

             7. Altering medication-induced hyposalivation if exists.

           b)In the Control group Participants assigned to the control condition will be advised to
           maintain their existing lifestyles. For ethical reasons, if the program shows its
           effectiveness, it will be made available to all groups at the end of the study.

Before the dental educational program, an oral examination will be done for the patient. Examination will be done by using mouth mirror and probe in natural day light. The educational program and outcome assessment will be assessed by ICCMS three times (immediately, three and six months) as the follow:
Score 0 Tooth surfaces show no evidence of visible caries (no or questionable change in enamel translucency). Score 1 First or distinct visual changes in enamel seen as a carious opacity or visible discolouration not consistent with clinical appearance of sound enamel and which show no evidence of surface breakdown or underlying dentine shadowing.
Score 2 A white or brown spot lesion with Localised enamel breakdown, without visible dentine exposure.
Extensive stage Score 3 A distinct cavity in opaque or discoloured enamel with visible dentine.</description>
