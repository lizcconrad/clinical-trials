  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to explore the impact of initiation of ART with different
      regimens in naïve MSM (in the setting of acute and chronic HIV-infection) on the probability
      of transmission of HIV by mathematical modeling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) continues to expand in low, middle,
      and high-income countries. The disproportionate HIV disease burden in MSM is explained
      largely by the high per act and per-partner transmission probability of HIV transmission in
      receptive anal sex . Current strategies are inadequate to control HIV spread among MSM; much
      more vigorous prevention efforts are required, including the early initiation of
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) that has been shown to reduce the rates of sexual transmission
      of HIV-1 and the adaptation and expanded use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent
      the acquisition of HIV-1 infection .

      Initiation of ART with regimens based on integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) is
      associated with a faster decline in HIV-RNA load than what is observed with regimens based on
      non-nucleoside transcriptase inhibitors (nnRTI), and protease inhibitors (PI). The clinical
      impact of this finding is unknown although clinical anecdotes suggest that it may it may
      cause a rapid decline in HIV RNA in women presenting with HIV in late pregnancy.

      The objective of this study is to explore the impact of initiation of ART with different
      regimens in naïve MSM (in the setting of acute and chronic HIV-infection) on the probability
      of transmission of HIV by mathematical modeling.
