  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the persistence, immunogenicity and safety of Havrix® (hepatitis A
      vaccine) in adults primed in infancy. The enrolled subjects will be assessed for circulating
      antibodies against hepatitis A and will also receive a challenge dose of Havrix Adult
      vaccine. In the present study, the anamnestic response will be assessed 30 days after the
      challenge dose.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Sponsor cancelled the study as real life impact data has already shown the value of HepA
    vaccination &amp; as no critical need to gather additional data in Israel.

    <time_frame>During the 4-day (Days 1-4) follow-up period after the challenge dose</time_frame>
    <description>The following local (injection-site) AEs will be solicited:
Pain at injection site, Redness at injection site, Swelling at injection site.
The following general AEs will be solicited:
Fatigue, Fever*, Gastrointestinal symptoms**, Headache.
*Fever is defined as temperature ≥38.0°C / 100.4°F. The preferred location for measuring temperature in this study will be the oral cavity.
**Gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal pain.
The AEs will be categorized depending on their intensity into the following grades:
(mild) = An AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.
(moderate) = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.
(severe) = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities.</description>

             specific procedure

             excluding the 20th birthday)

        has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccine administration, and has agreed to
        continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and for 2 months after
        completion of the study vaccine administration
