  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether postoperative ventilation with
      INTELLiVENT-ASV(adaptive support ventilation) in high risk patients, after cardiothoracic
      surgery, is as effective, more user-friendly and as safe as compared to the conventional
      modes of ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently, Hamilton Medical has introduced the new mechanical ventilation mode
      &quot;INTELLiVENT-ASV&quot;. This is a fully closed ventilation mode that can automatically adjust the
      ventilation settings based on the measured End tidal CO2 (ETCO2) and the measured saturation
      (SpO2) in both passive and active ventilated patients. Current literature has shown that this
      mode is safe to use in patients admitted on the intensive care unit. A pilot study in the
      Catharina Hospital Eindhoven confirmed that in postoperative low risk patients on the
      intensive care unit INTELLiVENT-ASV is safe. Compared to continuous mandatory or pressure
      controlled ventilation with pressure support (conventional mechanical ventilation),
      INTELLiVENT-ASV is even as effective as conventional mechanical ventilation, with a
      significantly reduced number of interactions with the ventilator. However, available research
      about the effectiveness of INTELLiVENT-ASV in postoperative high risk patients is lacking.
      Also the knowledge about the user-friendliness of the above modes of mechanical ventilation
      for the users is lacking.

      This is a prospective randomized study with a control group and a intervention group of
      postoperative high risk patients. Through randomization will be determined whether the
      participant, after surgery, will be mechanically ventilated with INTELLiVENT-ASV and
      Quickwean or with conventional mechanical ventilation.

The primairy investigator and care providers are aware of which ventilation mode is used since it is not possible to blind the care providers because they will need to change ventilating parameters if necessary.
