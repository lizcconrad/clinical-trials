  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in the form of a prospective Phase II, single centre, single arm
      hypoxia study of oral tongue cancer with FAZA-PET imaging and pimonidazole targeted IHC of
      surgical specimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In head and neck cancer, areas of tumours with low oxygen supply (called tumour hypoxia)
      harbour cells that are resistant to radiation and are prone to metastasize. Modern
      radiotherapy techniques are precise enough to deliver radiation to these small areas and
      could be used to target these areas to receive higher doses of radiation than the rest of the
      tumour to overcome resistance. Hypoxia can be &quot;seen&quot; in the body using special imaging such
      as [F-18]-FAZA-PET ([F-18]-Fluoroazomycin arabinoside positron emission tomography) but it
      has not been tested as a method for creating radiation treatment targets. As part of regular
      pathology tumour tissue is sliced extremely thinly (&lt;1/100th of a millimeter) and stained so
      that individual cells can be seen under a microscope. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special
      type of &quot;stain&quot; that can specifically highlight hypoxic areas. This method is considered the
      most accurate way to inspect for the presence of hypoxia. There is not a specific staining
      target for hypoxia ordinarily, but when patients ingest a substance called pimonidazole-HCl
      it builds up specifically in hypoxic areas and can be targeted for IHC staining. In this
      study participants with oral tongue cancer will have a [F-18]-FAZA-PET scan and take a single
      dose of oral pimonidazole-HCl before having surgery to remove their cancer. The whole tumour
      will be used to create microscope slides using very thin slices of the tumour. The slices
      will be stained using IHC to show where the pimonidazole has built up and digital scans of
      the slides will be made. The hypoxia seen on the FAZA-PET scan will be &quot;matched&quot; with hypoxia
      on the electronic slides to see if the FAZA truly shows where hypoxia is in tumours and if it
      could be used as a way to plan radiation treatments to deliver more radiation to just those
      areas.
