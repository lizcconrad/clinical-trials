  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying two different combination chemotherapy regimens to
      compare how well they work in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      objectives:

        1. To compare the response rates and toxicity of R-CHOP versus DA-EPOCH-R in untreated
           CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.

        2. To compare the event-free survival of R-CHOP versus DA-EPOCH-R chemotherapy in untreated
           CD20+ diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.

        3. To develop predictors of outcome of R-CHOP and DA-EPOCH-R chemotherapy.

    <description>Patients receive the following treatment: Cycle 1 Doses:Rituximab 375 mg/m^2 IV infusion on Day 1 prior to EPOCH chemotherapy. Doxorubicin 10 mg/m^2/day CIVI on Days 1-4.Etoposide 50 mg/m^2/day CIVI on Days 1-4. Vincristine 0.4 mg/m^2/day (no cap) CIVI on Days 1-4 (total 1.6 mg/m2 over 96 hours). Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m^2 IV on Day 5 (following completion of 96 hour infusions). Prednisone 60 mg/m^2 PO BID on Days 1-5 Administer filgrastim 480 mcg subcutaneous daily from Day 6 until ANC &gt; 5000 after the nadir (nadir usually between Days 10-12) Doses for subsequent cycles will be determined by the absolute neutrophil (ANC) or platelet nadir from the previous cycle. Cycles will be repeated every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles. Restaging will occur after Cycles 4 and 6.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Histologically documented de novo CD20+ DLBCL with stage II, III or IV disease.

        Stage I primary mediastinal (thymic) DLBCL is also eligible. Diagnosis should be based on
        an adequate tissue sample, including open biopsy or core needle biopsy.

        Needle aspiration for primary diagnosis is unacceptable.

        Patients must have one of the following WHO classification subtypes:

        Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (includes morphological variants: centroblastic,
        immunoblastic, T-cell/histiocyte rich, and anaplastic) Mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell
        lymphoma Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma Patients without adequate frozen material
        should have a biopsy performed to obtain material.

        2. Patients may be entered if they have received prior limited field radiation therapy or a
        short course of glucocorticoids (&lt; 10 days) for an urgent local disease complication at
        diagnosis (e.g., cord compression, SVC syndrome).

        3. Age &gt;16 years old. 4. ECOG Performance Status 0-2 5. If there is suspicion of cardiac
        disease, a cardiac ejection fraction must show LVEF &gt; 45%.

        6. Required Initial Laboratory Values (unless non-Hodgkin lymphoma):

          -  ANC ≥ 1000/μL

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL

          -  Creatinine≤ 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 cc/min

          -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dL (unless a history of Gilbert's Disease)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1- Patients with an underlying low-grade lymphoma, such as a transformed lymphoma or
             low-grade lymphoma in the bone marrow, are not eligible.

             2- Patients with low international prognostic index are not eligible. 3- Prior
             cytotoxic chemotherapy or rituximab. Patients who have received chemotherapy for prior
             malignancies are not eligible.

             4- Active ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure. 5- Known lymphomatous
             involvement of the CNS. A lumbar puncture prior to study is not required in the
             absence of neurological symptoms.

             6- Known HIV disease. Patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or any other
             behavior associated with an increased risk of HIV infection should be tested for
             exposure to the HIV virus. Patients who test positive or who are known to be infected
             are not eligible.

             7- Pregnant and non-nursing. Treatment would expose an unborn child to significant
             risks. Women and men of reproductive potential should agree to use an effective form
             of contraception.

             8- Patients with active medical processes (e.g., uncontrolled bacterial or viral
             infection, bleeding) not related to their lymphoma should be excluded.
