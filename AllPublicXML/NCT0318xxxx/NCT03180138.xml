  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the impressive economic progress in developing countries, significant proportion of
      young children and pregnant women living in low-resource settings remain inadequately
      immunized. Progressive decline in immunizations are in large part attributable to poor
      follow-up and compliance. National and international pediatric bodies, recommend a time
      sensitive schedule for childhood immunizations, boosting immunity with each subsequent cycle,
      leading to adequate levels of immune protection. Due to inadequate protective immunity,
      resulting from poor vaccination compliance, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases are
      rampant, making childhood mortality in this group among the highest in the world. Major
      challenges of vaccination programs include maintaining / tracking records, linked to positive
      identification of individual children, and strategies to improve follow-up and compliance.
      Novel cellular technology based approaches targeting behavior modifications can therefore
      significantly impact health outcomes in these communities. In this proposal, the
      investigators will evaluate a novel software platform, utilizing biometric identification of
      subjects, paired with cell-phone reminders and compliance-linked incentives to improve uptake
      and coverage of primary vaccinations in young children and pregnant women.

      A web-based, biometric-linked vaccination record, cell-phone reminder and compliance-linked
      incentive software platform to provide robust and universal access of vaccinations. The
      investigators will implement this platform in a low-resource settings with the following
      features: a) Web-based for robust and universal access. b) Biometric-linked for positive
      identification. c) Digital storage and reporting for transparent view of program operations.
      d) GPS-linked, allowing rapid assessment of vaccination status of communities. e) Increasing
      vaccination uptake and coverage by automated text message reminders and compliance-linked
      incentives.
