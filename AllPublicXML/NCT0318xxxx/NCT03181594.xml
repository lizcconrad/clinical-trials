    <description>Effectiveness will be assessed by the change in nasal symptoms using the four-symptom rTNSS (reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score). The rTNSS is the sum of 4 individual subject-assessed symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing, each evaluated using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, and 3=Severe. The rTNSS has a possible score of 0-12. The reflective scores are based on the subject's evaluation of symptom severity over the preceding 12 hours.</description>
