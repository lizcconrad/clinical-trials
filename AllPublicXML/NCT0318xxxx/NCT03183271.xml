  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to test the local response and the acute toxicity (which
      can be observed within 90 days).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local response and acute toxicity are primary endpoints of the trial. At CNAO a proton boost
      is delivered on the PTV1rx (area at high risk of relapse) up to at least 70 Gy [RBE] in 2-3
      Gy [RBE] per fractions for 8-15 total fractions.

      PTV2 rx (area at low or intermediate risk of relapse) will be irradiated with photon IMRT up
      to a total dose of 50-60 Gy [RBE].

      Secondary endpoints of the trial are local control, relapse free survival, overall survival,
      tumor specific survival, intermediate and long term toxicity.
