  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are always poor outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction(AMI) combined
      with elevated BNP/NT-proBNP level. An elevated BNP/NT-proBNP level highly indicates acute
      heart failure(AHF).Levosimendan is recommended in many clinical trials of heart failure and
      Chinese heart failure guidelines. As a result, the investigators form a hypothesis that when
      patients with AMI combined with elevated BNP/NT-proBNP level are in conditions before AHF, to
      use levosimendan may reduces the risk of heart failure and improve the outcome.
