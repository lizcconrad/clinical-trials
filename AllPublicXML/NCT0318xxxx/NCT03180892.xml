    <textblock>
      Background: Autoimmune hypothyroidism has been regarded as the most common cause of primary
      hypothyroidism in iodine sufficient area and has relationship with excess iodine induced
      hypothyroidism. However, non-immune related hypothyroidism and its relationship with excess
      iodine have been rarely evaluated.

      Objective: Therefore, the investigators planned to calculate proportion of non-immune related
      hypothyroidism and relationship with iodine intake using nationwide data from Korea National
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2013-2015.

      Design:

        1. Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey VI (2013 to 2015) - The national
           data - which is the government designated statistics (Approval No. 117002 ) of South
           Korea based on the Article 17 of the National Health Promotion Act - were used. The
           survey was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea Centers for Disease
           Control and Prevention, and provides only non-identified measures for academic research
           purposes.

        2. The participants who were examined for thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroxine,
           thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO Ab), and urine iodine concentration (UIC) were
           included.

        3. The proportion of immune related and non-immune related hypothyroidism was evaluated.
           Demographic variables and severity of hypothyroidism were compared between the two
           groups. To analyze iodine effect on hypothyroidism in TPO Ab positive or negative
           population, prevalence of hypothyroidism were assessed in each TPO Ab negative and
           positive population according to UIC subgroups.

        4. This study protocol was approved by IRB of SMC (2017-05-149).

        The investigators used a dataset from the KNHANES VI (2013 to 2015), a nationwide,
        cross-sectional survey of the Korean population for surveillance of health and nutritional
        status. The survey used stratified, multistage clustered probability sampling to select a
        representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized Korean population. Research
        subjects were selected through two-stage stratified cluster sampling using population and
        housing census data. The investigators included the subjects who were examined for TSH,
        FT4, TPO Ab, and UIC. Subjects previously diagnosed with benign thyroid diseases or thyroid
        cancer were excluded.
