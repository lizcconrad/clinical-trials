  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Influenza is a very common infectious disease. Influenza is also called flu. Vaccines teach
      the body to prevent or fight an infection. When the body learns to fight an infection, this
      is called an immune response. Researchers want to develop a vaccine against flu. They want to
      test two new vaccines to help the body make an immune response to flu.

      Participants will get the vaccines (shots) in the upper arm muscle. One vaccine, the
      Influenza HA Ferritin vaccine, will be given to all participants with needle injection. The
      other vaccine, Influenza DNA vaccine, will be given to participants in Group 3 by a
      needle-free device that uses high pressure to push the vaccine through the skin and into the
      muscle.

      Objective:

      To test the safety and side effects of two new vaccines for prevention of H2 influenza (flu).

      Eligibility:

      Part I: Healthy adults at least 18 years old and born after 1969.

      Part II: Healthy adults ages 18-70, but not born in 1966-1969.

      Design:

      Volunteer participants will be tested for eligibility in a screening study.

      In Part I, all participants will get shots of HA Ferritin vaccine. Five participants in Group
      1 will get one shot of low dose vaccine at Day 0 to test if it is safe and has no serious
      side effects. Then, five additional participants in Group 2 will get two shots of a higher
      dose at Day 0 and 4 months later.

      Part II will study responses of adults born before 1966 and those born after 1969. Also, Part
      II will compare responses to 2 different vaccine plans. Group 3 will get a DNA Influenza
      vaccine at Day 0 and the HA Ferritin vaccine 4 months later. Group 4 will get HA Ferritin
      vaccine at Day 0 and 4 months later.

      Participants will record their temperature and look at the injection site(s) each day for 7
      days after each injection- they will write any symptoms at home on a paper diary or enter
      this data online.

      Participants may choose to have leukapheresis. This is a procedure where the blood will be
      removed through a needle in an arm. A machine will separate some of the white blood cells
      from the blood. The rest of the blood will be returned through a needle into the other arm.
      The leukapheresis procedure lasts 3-4 hours.

      There will be about 9 to 10 clinic visits over 10 months. At each visit, participants will be
      asked about health changes or problems. They will have a short physical exam. Blood will be
      taken. Participants might have extra visits and blood tests if they have changes in their
      health. Vaccination visits will last approximately 4-6 hours; other visits will last
      approximately 1 hour.

      Study Design: This is a Phase I open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose,
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-FLUNPF081-00-VP (HA-F A/Sing) vaccine alone
      or in prime-boost regimens with VRC-FLUDNA082-00-VP (DNA A/Sing) vaccine. The ypotheses are
      that VRC-FLUNPF081-00-VP and VRC-FLUDNA082-00-VP vaccines are safe, well-tolerated, and
      induce an immune response to the H2 antigen. The primary objectives are to evaluate the
      safety and olerability of two different doses of the HA-F A/Sing vaccine alone and in
      prime-boost regimens in healthy adults. Secondary objectives are related to the evaluation of
      the immunogenicity of the HA-F A/Sing and DNA A/Sing vaccines in prime-boost regimens.

      Study Products: The investigational HA-F A/Sing vaccine, developed by the Vaccine Research
      Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is composed of
      Helicobacter pylori non-haem ferritin with an influenza virus H2 hemagglutinin (HA) insert to
      form a nanoparticle displaying eight HA trimers from A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2) influenza.

      The investigational DNA A/Sing vaccine, developed by the VRC, NIAID, is composed of a single
      closed-circular DNA plasmid that encodes the H2 protein of A/Singapore/1/57 influenza.

      Subjects: Up to 80 healthy adults ages 18-70 will be enrolled; adults born between 1966 and
      1969 will be excluded from the trial.

      Study Plan: Vaccines will be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle. This
      study has two parts:

      Part I will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 1 or 2 doses of the HA-F
      A/Sing vaccine in a dose-escalation design. In Group 1, five subjects will receive a low dose
      of the HA-F A/Sing vaccine via needle and syringe on Day 0. If this low dose is assessed as
      safe and well tolerated, enrollment will begin for Group 2. In Group 2, five subjects will
      receive the

      higher dose of the HA-F A/Sing vaccine via needle and syringe on Day 0 and Week 16. If this
      higher dose is assessed as safe, enrollment will begin for Part II.

      Part II will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of HA-F A/Sing vaccine in
      prime-boost regimens. Subjects will be stratified by age and randomized equally into Groups 3
      and Group 4 as shown in the vaccination schema. In Group 3, subjects will receive DNA A/Sing
      vaccine via PharmaJet Needle-Free Injector on Day 0 and HA-F A/Sing vaccine via needle and
      syringe on Week 16. In Group 4, subjects will receive HA-F A/Sing vaccine via needle and
      syringe on Day 0 and Week 16.

      For Group 1, the protocol requires about 8 clinic visits and 1 telephone follow up contact
      after the injection.

      For Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4, the protocol requires about 10 clinic visits and 2
      telephone follow-up contacts after each injection.

      For all Groups, solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated using a 7-day diary card.
      Assessment of vaccine safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of
      hematological and chemical parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.

      Study

      Duration: Subjects will be evaluated for 40 weeks following the first vaccine administration.
