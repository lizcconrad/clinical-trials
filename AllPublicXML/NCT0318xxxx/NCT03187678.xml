  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of selexipag for intravenous administration will be useful to avoid treatment
      interruptions in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) already treated with
      selexipag administered orally as tablets (Uptravi®). The target population for intravenous
      selexipag includes those PAH patients who are hospitalized and are unable to swallow tablets
      of Uptravi.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether it is safe for patients with PAH to
      temporarily change from selexipag tablets (Uptravi®) to selexipag given directly into a vein
      (intravenous selexipag), and then switching back to the initial oral dose of selexipag.

      After screening (Visit 1), each subject will participate in the following consecutive
      treatment periods: Period 1(treatment with oral selexipag at Visit 2/Day 1), Period 2
      (treatment with intravenous selexipag at Visit 2/ Day 2 and Day 3), Period 3 (treatment with
      oral selexipag starting in the evening of Visit 2/Day 3 and ending 7 to 11 days later at
      Visit 3). Then a safety follow-up period is planned up to end of study visit (EOS), which
      occurs between Day 33 and Day 40.
