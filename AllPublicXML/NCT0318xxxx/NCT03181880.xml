    <textblock>
      ASTUTE is a pragmatic open randomised 12-week multinational trial to evaluate the
      effectiveness of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate fixed-dose combination
      compared to standard of care bronchodilators in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASTUTE is a longitudinal, randomised, multicentre, and multinational pragmatic study of
      patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease to evaluate the comparative effectiveness
      of Aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate fixed-dose combination (Duaklir™ Genuair®) and
      Standard of Care bronchodilators in patients treated with long acting bronchodilator
      monotherapies OR patients who abide to the following treatment category: patient is newly
      diagnosed, or naïve to maintenance therapy, or treated with short-acting bronchodilators as
      rescue medication, or has not been treated with long-acting bronchodilators in the last 3
      months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in overall early morning COPD symptom severity score of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate inhalation powder vs. Standard of Care bronchodilators as measured by the Early Morning Symptoms of COPD Instrument over 12 wks.</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry and previous day (retrospectively), days 22-28, days 50-56, days 78-84</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline compared between aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate inhalation powder and Standard of Care bronchodilators. Baseline values for EMSCI will be averaged over the study entry and previous day. For longitudinal analyses, each daily measure will be aggregated on a weekly (7 days) basis during the weeks of measurement (weeks 4, 8, and/or 12) by taking the mean value of all available measurements during the week.</description>

    <time_frame>study entry and previous day (retrospectively), days 22-28, days 50-56, days 78-84</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline compared between aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate inhalation powder and Standard of Care bronchodilators. Baseline values for NiSCI will be averaged over the study entry and previous day. For longitudinal analyses, each daily measure will be aggregated on a weekly (7 days) basis during the weeks of measurement (weeks 4, 8, and/or 12) by taking the mean value of all available measurements during the week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in daily RS total Score of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate inhalation powder versus Standard of Care bronchodilators measured by the E-RS™COPD scale over 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry and previous day (retrospectively), days 22-28, days 50-56, days 78-84</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline values of the RS-Total Score will be collected and averaged at the study entry visit and previous day.
The secondary effectiveness variable will be estimated by the change from baseline in daily RS-Total Score over 12 weeks of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in health status of aclidinium bromide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate inhalation powder versus Standard of Care bronchodilatorsmeasured by the COPD assessment Test (CAT) over 12 weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>study entry, days 28, 56 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT measures the health status of patients with COPD. If the response to 1 of the 8 items is missing, the score will be considered missing. Change from baseline in health status over 12 weeks of follow-up (on the last day of weeks 4, 8, and 12) will be calculated. These change scores will be the CAT endpoint.</description>

    <description>The Total Time Index will be calculated at baseline and over 12 weeks of follow-up (on the last day of weeks 4, 8, and 12). Change from baseline will be calculated. These change scores will be the Total Time Index analysed.</description>

    <description>The Energy Expenditure Index will be calculated at baseline and over 12 weeks of follow-up (on the last day of weeks 4, 8, and 12). Change from baseline will be calculated. These change scores will be the Energy Expenditure Index analysed.</description>
