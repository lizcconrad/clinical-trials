  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DENACAPST programme represents an important initiative to provide near nation-wide
      roll-out of an important cancer surveillance program for childhood cancer survivors. The
      program is based on internationally recognized standards in cancer surveillance, which were
      developed by the International Guideline Harmonization Group (IGHG) with support of all
      relevant stakeholders in cancer survivorship research and clinical work in Europe, Canada and
      the United States and recognized French recommendations about breast screening for women at
      high risk of cancer.

      With this programme, French centers organized themselves to provide to childhood cancer
      survivors adequate medical attention, which includes close medical surveillance for
      breast/thyroid cancer where appropriate, based on adequate risk stratification.

      The aim of the study is to analyze if the recommendations about breast and thyroid cancer
      screening are followed in this population and secondly to provide more informations about
      these second cancers and about the screening.

      Every center which has patient at risk can participate. Main inclusion criteria : French
      childhood cancer survivor (5 years or more of delay with the treatment) - becoming adult -
      with a past history of radiotherapy at the age of 20 years or before, with a significant dose
      irradiation on the thyroid or the breast

      The inclusion of patients are validated by one team

      Thyroid screening programme is based on US each 2 years Breast screening programme is based
      mainly on MRI each year
