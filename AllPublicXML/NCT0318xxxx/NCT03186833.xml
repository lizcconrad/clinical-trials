  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study addresses the hypothesis that a gradual build-up in arterial resistance and
      microvascular endothelial dysfunction due to common comorbidities such as hypertension and
      diabetes mellitus, on top of age related vascular and cardiac changes (mainly fibrosis and
      hypertrophy), is responsible for HFpEF. The HFpEF syndrome is commonly seen in elderly
      subjects (often females) with hypertension and diabetes.

      The investigators will investigate the vascular function, cardiovascular performance and
      myocardial fibrosis in different cohorts of subjects to try and prove this hypothesis. There
      will be 5 groups of subjects, all ≥ 70 years of age, as follows:

      A) Normal healthy volunteers without major comorbidities including hypertension or diabetes
      B) Patients with hypertension only (without diabetes mellitus) C) Patients with hypertension
      AND diabetes mellitus D) Patients with HFpEF. E) A parallel group of patients with Heart
      Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) group.

      Arterial resistance measured by pulse wave velocity will be the primary measure and will be
      compared between groups A to D. A separate comparison will be made between groups D and E.
      Other secondary measures will focus on endothelial function (Laser Doppler measurements) and
      other cardiovascular performance measures (peak VO2 by CPEX, 6-minute walk distance). Bloods
      samples will be taken for NT-proBNP, high sensitivity Troponin T, Galectin 3 and also stored
      for testing later for vascular biomarkers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a pathophysiological, single-centre, observational study, in which all 4
      groups, including the parallel-group will be investigated in terms of qualitative-,
      echocardiographic-, arterial resistance, exercise testing (CPEX and 6-MWT), endothelial
      dysfunction assessment by Laser Doppler and vascular biomarker measurements. We intend to
      investigate if there is increasing arterial resistance from group &quot;A&quot; to group &quot;D&quot; and a
      significant difference in arterial resistance between groups &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot; by measuring the
      PWV.

      Primary Outcome Our primary outcome will be a difference in arterial resistance between the
      groups and the parallel group, as measured by aortic PWV.

      Secondary Outcomes

      The secondary outcomes are to assess and compare endothelial function and cardiovascular
      performance in all groups as measured by the following:

        -  Blood tests: NTproBNP, Galectin-3

        -  Urinalysis: Albumin, Creatinine and Metabolite profiles (&quot;metabolomics&quot;), related to
           cardiovascular risk and insulin resistance

        -  Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) indices of LV diastolic function, tissue Doppler
           imaging and strain rate imaging

        -  Exercise tolerance: 6-minute walk test and a Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPEX)

        -  Microvascular function: Laser Doppler
