  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the application status of MSCs as treatment modalities in IPF is still in its
      infancy and remains exploratory. Although a number of safety and efficacy clinical trials of
      MSCs as therapeutic options in immune-mediated and cardiac diseases have already been
      published with tantalizing results, to our disappointment, pulmonary and critical care
      medicine have traditionally lagged behind other therapeutic and research fields including
      hematology, gastroenterology and cardiology in translational studies of the use of reparative
      cells

          -  Age 18 to 75 years (both inclusive)

          -  high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan that is very suggestive or consistent
             with a probable diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia.
