  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial in which investigators will compare the antimicrobial
      effect and inducer of cicatrization as well as the degree of postoperative pain in patients
      who are extracted the lower third molars.

      After the surgery, different bioadhesive gels will be applied in the area of the surgical
      wound and we will evaluate the aforementioned parameters.

      Introduction: Surgical removal of the third molars is one of the most frequent procedures in
      oral surgery. Healing of the wound is initially sought by approximating the edges using a
      suturing technique. Adherence and microbiological accumulation of the suture during the
      period that it remains in the mouth, which can serve as a focus for odontogenic infections.
      The use of oral antiseptics before and after the surgery is an efficient method for microbial
      reduction. The purposes of this project were to evaluate the microbial growth in the suture
      thread on different culture means after the post-surgical application of the gels under
      study, while assessing the intensity of post-surgical pain and the degree of healing of the
      surgical wound.

      Material and methods: It is a randomized and blind clinical trial. 21 patients participated
      (42 wisdom teeth), who consulted the unit for a surgical tooth extraction for at least the
      two lower wisdom teeth. The evaluated bioadhesive gels were: Chlorhexidine gel at 0.2 %
      (Bexident Gel Gingival®), Chlorhexidine gel at 0.2% + Chitosan (Bexident Post®) and
      hyaluronic acid gel (ODDENT®). A neutral water-based gel without any active ingredients was
      also used HISPAGEL 200® (Acofarma, Madrid, Spain) as the control agent. An assessment of the
      post-surgical healing, the microbiological analysis of the suture thread and the
      post-surgical pain was developed.

    <description>The degree of healing at 7 days after surgery was measured using a visual healing scale consisting of four different levels of healing status:
- Erithymatous surgical zone and with signs of inflammation and infection.
- Erythematous surgical site without signs of infection.
-Surgical zone of normal color and beginning of epithelization.
-Surgical zone of normal color and advanced epithelization.</description>
