  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to test a novel head worn light device (Re-Timer®)
      as an intervention to improve glucose metabolism in people with prediabetes. The hypothesis
      is that morning light treatment will improve glucose metabolism. This is a pilot study and
      the data from this project will be used to develop a larger clinical trial.

    <measure>Glucose metabolism measured by performance on oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline laboratory session to last laboratory session, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of bright versus dim morning light treatment on glucose metabolism in participants with prediabetes via the OGTT. The OGTT is a 3-hour procedure measuring blood glucose levels after the patient has consumed a 75-gram dextrose solution at -15 min, 0 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 180 min intervals. This procedure will be conducted twice, once during the baseline laboratory session before any light treatment and again after 4 weeks of light treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in circadian phase measured by dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline laboratory session to last laboratory session, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The extent of which circadian phase advances in the DLMO are related to improvements in glucose metabolism in participants with prediabetes. DLMO is measured via saliva samples collected during laboratory sessions, a sample is collected every half hour until bedtime starting 6.5 hours before habitual bedtime, and conducted in dim light setting to identify the peak of melatonin release. This procedure will be conducted twice, once during the baseline laboratory session before any light treatment and again after 4 weeks of light treatment.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria: 34 subjects (50% female, age 40-65 y)

        Subjects will be:

          -  Prediabetic (HbA1c 5.7% to &lt;6.5%)

          -  obese (BMI&gt;30 kg/m2)

          -  have significant circadian misalignment (social jet lag ≥ 2 h, associated with higher
             BMI [2] and higher HbA1c [3])

          -  be free of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index&lt;15).

        The laboratory sessions will occur during women's follicular phase or women will be
        postmenopausal (≥6 months since last menses).

        Subjects will be scheduled to participate ≥ 1 month from travel outside the central time
        zone, and during a time with minimal special events.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant, or are breastfeeding.

          -  Women on oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy will be excluded (alters
             OGTT and melatonin).

          -  Men and women who have a child at home that does not sleep through the night will be
             excluded.

          -  Adults unable to consent, individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children,
             teenagers), pregnant women, and prisoners are also excluded.

          -  History of any form of diabetes, including use of diabetes medications

          -  Age outside 40-65 years (we will not enroll anyone older than 65 years because of a
             reduced response to light).

          -  Smokers

          -  Shift workers

          -  Failed urine drug test (drugs of abuse, nicotine)

          -  Eye disease/photosensitizing medications

          -  Sleep medications, diagnosed sleep disorders (history of treatment may affect glucose
             metabolism),

          -  Daily beta-blocker, NSAID or melatonin use (confounds DLMO)

          -  History of psychiatric disorders (confounds effect of light treatment, per relevant
             items from Mood Disorder, Psychotic Screening and Substance Use Disorders Modules of
             the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders - Non-Patient Edition
             (SCID-IV/NP) to screen for schizophrenia, bipolar depression, substance abuse,
             suicidal ideation, obsessive compulsive disorder, PTSD), depressive symptoms using the
             Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale

          -  Irregular menses

          -  History of cardiovascular disease (excluding hypertension), endocrine, kidney,
             gastrointestinal or liver disorder, seizures, and cancer.
