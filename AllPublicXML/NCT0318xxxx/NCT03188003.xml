  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar pain is one of the most common injuries being the cause of morbidity in the individual
      generating occupational disability with strong personal, social and economic impact. As one
      of the methods of treatment, Pilates is a method that has good results for the management of
      this dysfunction. However, it is not known exactly which approach Pilates can bring better
      results for this population. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the effects
      of two types of Pilates method interventions on non-specific chronic low back pain.

      A blinded randomized clinical trial, will be held. 28 patients divided randomly into two
      groups will be assessed, the Mobilization Pilates (MP) and the Stabilization Pilates (SP).
      Both groups will be formed by individuals of both sexes and aged 21 to 41 years with chronic
      low back pain. Both groups will receive 10 sessions of Pilates Methods twice a week, with
      each session taking an average of 50 minutes, therefore the MP will focus on a lumbo-pelvic
      mobilization exercises approach and the SP will focus on lumbo-pelvic stabilization exercises
      approach. At the beginning and end of the 5 weeks the individuals are evaluated to verify the
      presence of pain and disability with VAS of pain and Oswestry Questionnaire, and also with
      the Functional Movement Screen. Data will be analyzed statistically.

    <time_frame>At the first session and 5 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (also known as the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) is an extremely important tool that researchers and disability evaluators use to measure a patient's permanent functional disability. The test is considered the 'gold standard' of low back functional outcome tools.
The oswestry questionarie will be evaluated in the first session and after 5 weeks of Pilates training. So, the primary outcome is the change in the Oswestry score from baseline to 5 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the first session and 5 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be assessed using visual analog scale (VAS), which consists of a 10-cm horizontal line in which &quot;0&quot; means &quot;No pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; means &quot;The worst pain I can imagine&quot;. This visual analog scale for pain will be evaluated in the first session and after 5 weeks of Pilates training. So, this outcome is the change in VAS score from baseline to 5 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change in The Functional Movement Screen (FMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the first session and 5 weeks after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The FMS is a screening for individuals who participate in physical activities by identifying limitations and restrictions in completing 7 movement tasks: deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunch, shoulder mobility, active straight leg raise, trunk stability push-up, and rotatory stability.
Each one of these 7 movement tasks are scored on a 0-3 ordinal scale. The FMS output is a single result given by summing each movement's score. The maximum score is 21. The lower the score, the higher is the patient's risk for injury.
FMS will be evaluated before and after intervention. So, this outcome is the change in FMS score from baseline to 5 weeks.</description>
