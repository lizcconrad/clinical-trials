  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged wound drainage after total hip or knee arthroplasty is a very undesirable
      complication, both from medical as patients view. Wound drainage prolongs hospital admission
      and is associated with an increased risk of infection (1) post-operative wound drainage of
      more than 48 hours is associated with an increased infection risk of 42 percent a day in hip
      arthroplasty and 27 percent a day in knee arthroplasty. (2) Patient organizations report that
      wound drainage is considered as one of the most undesirable complications.

      In our hospital, patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty are treated according to a
      &quot;fast track&quot; protocol, in most cases resulting in a hospital admission of only two days. This
      increases the chance that patient's release from hospital will be delayed due to wound
      drainage. The fact that our department recently started to perform hip and knee arthroplasty
      in a daycare setting increases this chance substantially.

      In hemiarthroplasty of the knee, tissue adhesive was used in addition to conventional wound
      closure techniques with monocryl sutures. Resorbable monocryl sutures were used so that the
      usual visit to our outpatient department to remove the sutures was no longer necessary.
      However, we experienced an increase in wound drainage and complications using only monocryl.
      The addition of a tissue adhesive decreased the post-operative wound complication
      drastically. This in mind, we started to use tissue adhesive in regular hip and knee
      arthroplasty as well. With tissue adhesive in addition to conventional staples, we noticed
      good results. These results however, were subjective and not officially recorded.

      In a previous study, good results are reported in decreasing wound drainage with the use of a
      tissue adhesive in addition to staples. Clinical relevance was not reported and the study
      design lacked a cost-effectiveness analysis (3) The increase in cost for the use of the
      tissue adhesive involved was noted by our board of directors. Because lack of a clear medical
      of financial benefit, we were asked to minimize the use of tissue adhesive, resulting in
      usage of tissue adhesive solely in a day care setting, which comprises only 5 to 10 percent
      of our treated population. Previous study reported a decrease in post-operative wound
      drainage when tissue adhesive was used in addition to staples in knee arthroplasty. However,
      no financial benefit is known, therefore this treatment has not been accepted into daily
      practice. In our department, prolonged hospital admission due to wound drainage is not found
      to be uncommon. Our hypothesis is that the addition of tissue adhesive in wound closure after
      hip and knee arthroplasty will significantly decrease post-operative wound drainage, leading
      to a reduced number of admission days. In addition, we expect less patients to return to our
      outpatient clinic for non-regular visits due to wound complications. Expensive bandages are
      used in our standard treatment protocol. Less wound drainage would mean less bandages. All
      these things combined will lead to a reduction in overall health care costs
