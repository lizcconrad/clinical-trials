    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy or
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy in improving quality of life in patients with stage IIIC-IV
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. In hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy, the chemotherapy is warmed before being used and may help the drugs get into
      the cancer cells better, minimize the toxicity of the drugs on normal cells, and help to kill
      any cancer cells left over after surgery. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is delivered directly
      to the abdominal cavity to help treat cancer. It is not yet known whether hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy or intraperitoneal chemotherapy works better in improving
      quality of life in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative
      intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy at 6 weeks post-treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare quality of life in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy at 3
      and 6 months post-treatment.

      II. To compare neurotoxicity in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy III.
      To compare abdominal discomfort in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy IV.
      To compare toxicities in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC followed by
      CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy.

      V. To compare the response rate in patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with NAC
      followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP chemotherapy.

      VI. To compare progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced ovarian cancer
      treated with NAC followed by CRS with HIPEC versus NAC followed by CRS and postoperative IP
      chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15
      and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 4-8 weeks
      after 3 courses of chemotherapy, patients undergo CRS. Beginning 4-8 weeks after CRS,
      patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin
      intraperitoneally (IP) over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin
      IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 4-8 weeks after 6 courses
      of chemotherapy, patients undergo CRS. Patients then receive carboplatin IP over 120 minutes
      immediately following CRS.

      After completion of chemotherapy, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, and 3, 6, and 12
      months.

    <time_frame>At 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The longitudinal data of QOL will be displayed graphically with individual trajectories. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models will be used for the primary analysis. The baseline QOL visit (as a categorical variable), randomization assignment, and a randomization by visit interaction will be included in the model. The test for the randomization effect at the 6-week post-treatment will be performed using a contrast of the 6-week randomization means. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Abdominal discomfort will be compared between the two treatment arms. The data will be analyzed using Poisson model with GEEs to account for the dependency between repeated measures. This approach will be treated as a sensitivity analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of toxicities evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be compared between the two treatment arms. The toxicities will be measured by the number and severity of adverse events defined by CTCAE version 4.0. The count data will be compared assuming a Poisson distribution.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neurotoxicity assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neurotoxicity will be compared between the two treatment arms. The data will be analyzed using Poisson model with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to account for the dependency between repeated measures. This approach will be treated as a sensitivity analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival will be compared between the two treatment arms using survival analysis. The follow-up time will be calculated from the date of end of treatment. Survival will be measured up to the time until progression, date of last contact, or death, whichever comes first. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used to estimate the survival probabilities by treatment arms. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to calculate the hazards ratio and its confidence interval for the treatment effect.</description>
