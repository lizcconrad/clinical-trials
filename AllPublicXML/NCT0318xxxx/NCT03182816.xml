  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, one center clinical study, to determine the safety and
      efficacy of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to express immune checkpoint antibodies
      (CTLA-4 and PD-1) and chimeric antigen receptor targeting epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR-CAR) in adult patients with EGFR positive, advanced recurrent or refractory malignant
      solid tumors.

      This study will be conducted using a phase I/II trial design to assess the efficacy and
      safety of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing EGFR-CAR-T for patients with EGFR
      positive advanced recurrent or refractory malignant solid tumors. EGFR-CAR-T can specificly
      and effectively kill the EGFR positive cancer cells, CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies are secreted
      from the CAR-T cells could improve immunosuppression microenvironment, new CAR-T cells
      contain the advantages of CAR-T and immune checkpoint inhibitor, which is a promising
      therapeutic method for advanced solid tumors.

      The new CAR-T therapy is applied to clinical practice as bellow. T cells are prepared from
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by leukapheresis, then activated and engineered to
      express CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor targeting EGFR. Cells are
      proliferated in culture and returned to the patients by venous transfusion therapy. A total
      of 40 patients may be enrolled in the study. The total duration of the study is expected to
      be approximately 24 months.

    <description>Every cycle, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are collected on day 0, CAR-T cells are cultured in a GMP standard workshop. Patients are given a three-day regimen of chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide aimed to deplete the lymphocytes before cells infusion. Then the patients will receive an i.v.gtt infusion of CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies expressing EGFR-CAR-T cells at (2-5) ×10^7 cells/kg from day 18 to day 19 (±2 days). 2 cycles are regarded as a treatment period.</description>
