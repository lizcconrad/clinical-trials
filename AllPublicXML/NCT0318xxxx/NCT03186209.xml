    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed 30 mg dose of benralizumab administered
      subcutaneously for patients with a history of asthma exacerbations and uncontrolled asthma
      receiving medium to high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β2-agonist (ICS-LABA)
      with or without oral corticosteroids and additional asthma controllers.

      Approximately 834 patients will be randomised. Patients will be stratified by country/region,
      age group (adult or adolescent), and peripheral blood eosinophil count at time of Visit 1
      (&lt;300 or ≥300 cells/μL).All the patients will be randomised to either placebo or benralizumab
      (1:1 ratio) for a 48-weeks treatment, every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses and then every 8
      weeks thereafter.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 48 in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following the first administration of study drug through Study Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a 50-item PRO instrument developed to measure the HRQoL of patients with airway diseases. The questionnaire is divided into two parts: part 1 consists of 8 items pertaining to the severity of respiratory symptoms in the preceding 4 weeks; part 2 consists of 42 items related to the daily activity and psychosocial impacts of the individual's respiratory condition. The SGRQ yields a total score and three domain scores (symptoms, activity, and impacts). The total score indicates the impact of disease on overall HRQoL. This total score is expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, in which 100 represents the worst possible HRQoL and 0 indicates the best possible HRQoL. Likewise, the domain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of greater impairment.</description>

             patients, who are 17 on the day of Visit 1 but will turn 18 after this day, will be
             considered an adolescent for the purposes of this trial.

          3. History of physician-diagnosed asthma requiring treatment with medium-to-high dose ICS
             (&gt;250μg fluticasone dry powder formulation equivalents total daily dose) and a LABA,
             for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.

          4. Additional maintenance asthma controller medications that are locally approved in a
             country for the treatment of asthma (eg, leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs),
             tiotropium, chromone, theophylline, oral corticosteroid), and have been used for at
             least 30 days prior to Visit 1 are allowed.

          5. At least 2 documented asthma exacerbations in the 12 months prior to the date informed
             consent, and assent, at least 1 of the 2 exacerbations should occur during the
             treatment of medium-to-high dose ICS-LABA, when applicable is obtained that required
             use of a systemic corticosteroid or a temporary increase from the patient's usual
             maintenance dose of oral corticosteroid. For patients who are re-screened within 30

             cystic fibrosis, hypoventilation syndrome associated with obesity, lung cancer, alpha
             1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia) or ever been diagnosed with
             pulmonary or systemic disease, other than asthma, that are associated with elevated
             peripheral eosinophil counts (eg, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis,
             Churg-Strauss syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome).

          2. Any disorder, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,

             opinion of the Investigator and could:

               -  Affect the safety of the patient throughout the study

               -  Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations

               -  Impede the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of study.

             haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during screening period, which in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of his/her
             participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the
             patient's ability to complete entire duration of the study.
