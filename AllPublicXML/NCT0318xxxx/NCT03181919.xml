      The current study was conducted in private outpatient clinic after being approved by the
      medical ethics committee. The study is a prospective randomized study consisting of 90
      Egyptian patients diagnosed as having infertility with pcos .

      Sample size determination:

      Group sample sizes of 42 and 42 achieve 80% power based on study finding carried out by
      (Galal et al., 2014) to detect a difference of 0.7 between the null hypothesis that both
      group means are 2.2 and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of group 2 is 1.5 with known
      group standard deviations of 1.5 and 0.6 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05000
      using a two-sided Mann-Whitney test assuming that the actual distribution is uniform.

      Sample size was calculated by PASS 11 Computer program for sample size calculation.

      Taking into consideration 10% drop out rate, the sample size will be increased to 45 patients
      in group I and another 45 patients in group II.

      Patients were divided into two groups with randomization sheet:

      Group (I): includes 45 females taking Letrozole (old regimen).

      Group (II): includes 45 females taking Letrozole 5 mg tab in a step-up protocol (new
      regimen).
