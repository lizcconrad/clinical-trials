  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research program aims to comprehensively investigate the clinical, physiological,
      metabolic, and molecular effects of reducing sedentary behavior in rheumatoid arthritis. This
      4-month parallel-group randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the feasibility and
      efficacy of a newly developed personalized intervention focused on replacing sedentary time
      with light-(or very light-) intensity physical activity in rheumatoid arthritis. A multitude
      of gold-standard techniques will be applied to evaluate the effects of the intervention on
      several outcomes, including sedentary time (primary outcome), physical activity levels,
      clinical parameters specific to each condition, cardiometabolic risk factors, immune
      function, and health-related quality of life. In addition, skeletal muscle and blood samples
      will be collected and a variety of molecular analyses will be performed to gather knowledge
      on the potential mechanisms which underpin the response to this intervention.
