      EMASPOT assesses the prevalence and impact of mental health conditions in multimorbid
      emergency patients with cardiac ACSC on transsectoral utilisation of health care services.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of EMASPOT are primarily to determine the prevalence of mental health
      conditions (MHC) (i.e., symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatoform disorders, and alcohol
      abuse) in patients with multimorbidity and cardiac ACSC in a prospective cohort study.

      The study population comprises patients admitted to an ED in Berlin-Mitte during the study
      period from 01.06.2017 to 31.05.2018 with cardiac complaints who are admitted to the hospital
      or discharged from ED. The study focusses especially on older and multimorbid patients.
      Multimorbidity is defined as the presence of more than two chronic diagnoses.

      After having given informed consent patients are enrolled in the study and interviewed by a
      study nurse. Self-reported symptom burden for depression, anxiety disorders, somatoform
      disorders, alcohol abuse as well as frequency of utilization of health care services are
      assessed. Medical data will be abstracted from medical charts and include somatic
      comorbidities, medication and diagnostic procedures and interventions during hospitalization.

      Individual semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 30 patients to assess the
      treatment expectations and underlying motives for ED-visits, as well as with 30 health care
      professionals to investigate perceptions of challenges regarding identification and treatment
      of patients with MHC.

      All patients will have a 6-months follow-up after discharge from the ED. The follow-up is
      conducted either by telephone calls, e-mail or via mail. The follow-up data will include
      mental health conditions as assessed at baseline, frequency of utilization of health care
      services and health-related quality of life.
