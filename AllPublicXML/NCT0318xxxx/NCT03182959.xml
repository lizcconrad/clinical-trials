  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see whether Avmacol®, a dietary supplement made from broccoli
      sprout and seed extract powder, induces changes in inner cheek cells that may be protective
      against environmental toxins such as tobacco.

      There are three main goals of the study:

        1. To learn whether the dietary supplement, Avmacol®, can stimulate cheek cells to repair
           damage from environmental toxins;

        2. to learn how the body metabolizes Avmacol®, by measuring its byproducts in the
           participant's urine and blood;

        3. to learn whether the immune system can be stimulated by Avmacol®, by studying the
           natural killer cells and T cells in the participant's blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study hypothesizes that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway
      activation in oral epithelium can be induced by administering Avmacol® to patients curatively
      treated for a first tobacco-related HNSCC.

      The aim of this Phase 0 clinical study is to determine the oral bioavailability of
      sulforaphane in the commercially available dietary supplement, Avmacol®, and to determine the
      level of pharmacodynamic upregulation of NRF2 target gene transcripts that occurs in the oral
      epithelium of patients who have completed curative treatment for tobacco-related HNSCC,
      including high grade dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive carcinoma.
