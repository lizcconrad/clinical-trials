  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed intervention is focused on developing and implementing a psychological approach
      incorporated into a group-based outpatient intervention for pediatric autonomic dysfunction.
      The investigators hypothesize that their intervention will result in improvements in the
      transdiagnostic mechanisms specifically targeted by components of their intervention
      including sleep, information processing, and youth/parent experiential avoidance.

    <measure>Change in Transdiagnostic Youth/Parent Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Our team developed these comprehensive questionnaires to assess transdiagnostic mechanisms in the present study. These questionnaires comprise full measures and/or subscales drawn from several well-validated and psychometrically-sound measures that are available as part of the public domain and/or that were provided for open access by the developers of the measure, and that have been previously designed and validated to measure each of the mechanisms of interest. These mechanisms include emotion regulation, experiential avoidance, sleep, peer acceptance/rejection, parenting, and information processing.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Coping Questionnaire (caregiver and self-report)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>For the current study, this measure has been adapted to ask about &quot;physical illness symptoms&quot; rather than pain. The adapted measure asks adolescents/caregivers to indicate how often (1 = never to 5 = very often) they/their child used each of 39 coping strategies when responding to prompts such as, &quot;When I am experiencing autonomic symptoms for a few hours or days, Iâ€¦&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 8-item measure intended to assess satisfaction, perceived benefits, and likelihood of recommending the program. Items, which include &quot;How would you rate the quality of care you have received?&quot; are rated on a 1 to 4 Likert-scale.</description>

    <description>10 week 90-minute weekly therapy sessions including both the adolescent and caregiver. Treatment will consist of psychoeducation about dysautonomia, motivational interviewing techniques to promote readiness for change, support around lifestyle and behavioral changes, core CBT components (e.g., relaxation training, linking thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, minimizing catastrophizing thoughts, cognitive coping, and exposure), and components of ACT aiming to increase cognitive flexibility (e.g., mindfulness, experiential avoidance, values, cognitive defusion, committed action), and relapse prevention and maintenance. Most sessions will involve homework assigned to the adolescent and their parent/legal guardian(s) to encourage practice at home.</description>
