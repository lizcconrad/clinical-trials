  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The supraspinatus muscle tendinopathy show a big impact, however, there is a lack of
      awareness about the options of the physiotherapist treatment. It is necessary to do studies
      about effectiveness of therapeutic percutaneous electrolysis (EPTE®). This technique enables
      treatment of the tendinopathies and the broken muscle fibrilare. It is base on the
      application of galvanic current through a acupuncture needle. To analyze the effectiveness of
      therapeutic percutaneous electrolysis (EPTE®) in the treatment of supraspinatus muscle
      tendinopathy. Single center randomized controlled trial, parallel treatment design. A
      specialist physician will be diagnosed the supraspinatus muscle tendinopathy. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to receive treatmen for 4 weeks: EPTE® associated with eccentric
      exercises or dry needling with the same eccentric exercises. Both interventions were
      performed under ultrasound guidance with a portable ultrasound (General Electric LogicE).
      Data will be collected by a blinded evaluator.

      Eccentric exercises of the supraspinatus muscle were performed in 3 sets of 10 repetitions.
      Participants were asked to perform the exercise program on an individual basis twice every
      day for 4 weeks. The eccentric program consisted of 3 exercises, focusing on the
      supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and scapular muscles. Participants were asked to do a normal
      abduction (concentric phase) and a slow return to the initial position (eccentric phase)
      included first the concentric phase, and the eccentric phase was slowly conducted. The
      exercise program was taught by a physiotherapist in the first session and monitored in the
      subsequent sessions.
