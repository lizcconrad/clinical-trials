    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study evaluating the long term safety
      and tolerability of PBI-4050 in subjects with Alström Syndrome who have completed the
      end-of-treatment (EoT) visit in a preceding ProMetic-sponsored Alström Syndrome study with
      PBI-4050. This study will also evaluate the efficacy and pharmacological effects of PBI 4050
      in this multi faceted disorder. Approximately 20 to 30 subjects will be enrolled to receive
      800 mg PBI-4050 once daily for 96 weeks or until product licensing or study termination by
      the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject completed a preceding ProMetic-sponsored Alström syndrome study with PBI-4050.

          -  Subject has signed informed consent

          -  Subject has a documented diagnosis of Alström syndrome

          -  Subject receiving antidiabetic medications is able and willing to self-monitor blood
             glucose levels

          -  Subject must be willing to forego other forms of experimental drug treatment during
             the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and agree to use adequate birth control from screening throughout the study
             and for 30 days after the last Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) administration

          -  If a male subject has not been vasectomized at least 6 months before screening and
             partners with a woman of childbearing potential, he must be willing to use an
             acceptable contraceptive method throughout the study and for 30 days after the last
             IMP administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject discontinued PBI-4050 for safety reasons from any preceding ProMetic-sponsored
             Alström syndrome study with PBI-4050

          -  Subject has had a documented episode of severe hypoglycaemia within 12 months before
             screening and investigator judges that the subject is unable to adequately monitor
             their glucose levels.

          -  Subject has uncontrolled hypertension with BP &gt; 170/100 mmHg as determined at
             screening.

          -  Woman who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning a pregnancy during the course of
             the study as determined at screening

          -  Subject has any condition that, in the investigator's opinion, is likely to interfere
             with study conduct and compliance

          -  Subject has a history of an allergic reaction to PBI-4050 or any of its excipients.
