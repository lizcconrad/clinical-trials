  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of pancreatic
      beta-cells, resulting in absolute deficiency of insulin. Presently there is no known cure.

      Our proposed interventional trial is based on 'immunological reset' approach: T-depletion
      therapy and anti-inflammatory treatment will restore self-tolerance in T1DM; Autologous,
      peripheral-blood mobilized hematopoietic CD34+-enriched stem cells and a long-acting GLP-1
      analogue will promote pancreatic islet regeneration and repair.

      The short-term goals of this protocol is to demonstrate that subjects with new-onset T1DM
      undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and immunologic reset will have
      greater preservation of endogenous insulin secretion compared to controls, and foremost that
      this nonmyeloablative treatment is safe, without the need for chronic immune suppression.

             upper limit of normal (ULN) will exclude a patient without a re-test; a re test for
             any values between ULN and 1.5 times ULN should be made, and if the values remain
