  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3 randomized study is to confirm the efficacy of an intra-articular injection
      of Ampion™ in adults with pain due to severe osteoarthritis of the knee.

      There will be a 7-day screening period for each subject followed by a 12-week participation
      period.

      The primary trial objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of Ampion using the
      OMERACT-OARSI (using the WOMAC 3.1 Index and PGA as assessments).

      The secondary trial objectives are to evaluate the safety of a single intra-articular
      injection (4 mL) of Ampion.

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A patient in this study will be considered a responder for the purpose of efficacy analysis if the following criteria is met.
The patient has a percent improvement in pain (WOMAC A) of ≥50% and an absolute change in pain from baseline of ≥ 1 point on the 5-point Likert scale or the patient has a percent improvement in function (WOMAC C) ≥50% and an absolute change in function from baseline of ≥1 point on the 5-point Likert scale.
If the patient does not meet this criterion, then
The patient demonstrates improvement in at least 2 of the following:
Improvement in pain (WOMAC A) ≥20% and a 0.5 point absolute change in pain from Baseline on the 5-point Likert scale
Improvement in function (WOMAC C) ≥20% and a 0.5 point absolute change in function from Baseline on the 5-point Likert scale

          -  Must be ambulatory;

          -  Study knee must have a clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) supported by
             radiological evidence (Kellgren Lawrence Grade 4) which is assessed locally (x-rays
             within the past 6 months of screening are acceptable);
