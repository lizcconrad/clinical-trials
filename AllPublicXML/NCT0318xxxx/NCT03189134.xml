  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to translate confocal microscopy for use during open heart surgery.
      This tool will help discriminate between various types of tissues in the heart during
      surgery. One of the most feared complication after heart surgery is heart block. This
      flexible fiberoptic confocal microscope will help discriminate between the various types of
      tissues in the heart and thus help avoid injury to the conduction tissue during surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional pilot study that proposes to evaluate the safety, logistical
      feasibility, and technological feasibility of using Fluorescite with fiberoptic confocal
      microscopy during cardiac surgery to discriminate between cardiac tissue and conduction
      tissue. During surgery to repair atrial septal defect, diluted Fluorescite will be added to
      the surface of the heart. The fiberoptic confocal microscope (Cellvizio 100 Series System
      with Confocal Miniprobe) will be used to record images in several different locations of the
      heart. The image files will be provided to blinded raters who will attempt to identify
      whether they contain cardiac tissue or conduction tissue. All subjects will be monitored
      while they are inpatient after surgery for any adverse events.
