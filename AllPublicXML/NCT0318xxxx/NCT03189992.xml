    <textblock>
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome is a core foundation of disease knowledge,
      clinical diagnosis and treatment and curative effect evaluation in TCM. &quot;Same TCM Syndrome
      for Different Diseases&quot; and &quot;Same Treatment for Different Diseases&quot; is one of the
      characteristics of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment.

      This study is the &quot;TCM disease syndrome combination&quot; research baced on principles and methods
      of system biology, which is through acquisition of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and
      colorectal cancer patients with TCM syndrome information, detection of clinical indicators
      and genomic, proteomic, and metabolites changes, analyzing the correlation between TCM
      syndromes and biological information, and revealing its biological material characteristics
      and the molecular mechanisms of &quot;Same TCM Syndrome for Different Diseases&quot;;Developing and
      implementing the program of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment for HCC and colorectal
      cancer to evaluate the efficacy of TCM syndrome based-treatment of HCC and colorectal cancer
      with TCM syndrom scores, clinical and systems biological indicators, quality of life and
      survival rate, and to revealing the mechanism of the &quot;Same Treatment for Different Diseases&quot;.

      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome is a core foundation of disease knowledge,
      clinical diagnosis and treatment and curative effect evaluation in TCM. &quot;Same TCM Syndrome
      for Different Diseases&quot; and &quot;Same Treatment for Different Diseases&quot; is one of the
      characteristics of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment.

      In this study, the investigators adopted the transcriptome analysis, proteome analysis and
      metabolic diversity analysis of the patients with different syndromes of liver cancer and
      colorectal cancer, and integrate omics information, combining macro and micro methods to
      screen biomarkers of syndromes
