  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients who have been enrolled into study PLAT-02 and meet the entry
      criteria for study PLAT-03.

      Patients with relapsed or refractory CD 19+ leukemia who have achieved remission after CD19
      CAR-T cell treatment sometimes relapse because the CD 19 CAR-T cells decrease in number over
      time. Study PLAT-03 will test whether administering T cell antigen presenting cells (T-APCs)
      at intervals following treatment with CAR-T cells improves CD 19 CAR-T cell persistence and
      reduces the incidence of leukemia relapse.

      This pilot study seeks to examine the feasibility and safety of administering T cell antigen
      presenting cells (T-APCs) designed to reactivate and numerically expand CD19-specific CAR T
      cells. The underlying hypothesis to be examined is that after remission is achieved with CAR
      T cell treatment, the duration, magnitude, and activation state of persisting memory CAR T
      cells impact on the potential for durable leukemia eradication. This is of particular
      relevance in several groups of patients we have identified: those who are predicted to lose
      persistence of their CAR T cells before Day 63, or those who have definitively lost
      persistence of CAR T cells prior to 6 months. By providing these patients with episodic
      exposure to T-APCs capable of activating CD19-specific CAR T cells for proliferation and
      redistribution to tissue beds where tumor cells of ALL seed, ideally over several months
      following remission induction, it is posited that the incidence of disease relapse will be
      diminished.
