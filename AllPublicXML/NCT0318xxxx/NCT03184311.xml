  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of a 12-week high-intensity interval training (HIT) on
      exercise tolerance, functional status and quality of life in patients with chronic heart
      failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), in comparison to a control group continuing
      to undergo usual care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) occurs in about 50% of all HF
      patients. Remodeling and fibrosis stimulated by inflammation appear to be main factors for
      the progression of HFpEF. Furthermore, iron deficiency (ID) has been recognized to be a
      common comorbidity in HFpEF. The lack of prognostic treatment options in HFpEF urgently calls
      for new therapeutic approaches. While beneficial effects of exercise training and iron
      substitution have been demonstrated in HF with reduced ejection fraction, they have not yet
      been evaluated in HFpEF. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of
      high-intensity interval training (HIT) in HFpEF patients with optimally adjusted iron values.

      The proposed study will be a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial in a
      primary care setting including 98 patients with stable HFpEF. Patients will undergo 3 study
      visits (a screening visit, a baseline visit and a post-intervention visit) including
      measurements of disease-specific biomarkers (using blood samples), cardiac and arterial
      vessel structure and function (using electrocardiogram, echocardiography and pulse wave
      velocity), exercise tolerance (using spiroergometry), habitual physical activity (using
      accelerometry) and QoL. After the screening visit, patients with a functional or absolute ID
      will undergo iron substitution until sufficient iron levels are reached (up to max. 12
      weeks), in order to ensure comparable baseline conditions for the training intervention. The
      study examinations will be repeated after 12 weeks in both, initially iron deficient and
      non-iron deficient patients (baseline visit). Patients will then be randomized to either the
      intervention or control group, stratified by initial iron-deficiency status. The intervention
      group (n=49) will attend a supervised 12-week HIT on a bicycle ergometer, while the control
      group (n=49) will be advised to continue usual care and follow health recommendations for
      patients with chronic HF. After 12 weeks, the study measurements will be repeated in all
      patients (intervention and control group) in order to monitor the effects of the intervention
      (post-intervention visit). At 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years after the last study visit,
      telephone interviews will be performed to assess medical outcomes and QoL.

      Outlook: This study is expected to add important knowledge about the potential utility of a
      novel treatment strategy in HFpEF patients, which may help to improve both, QoL and
      functional status. Moreover, the analysed biomarkers might be able to provide further insight
      into prognosis and pathogenesis of HFpEF.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VO2peak will be measured by spiroergometry at the baseline and post-intervention visit: an incremental symptom-limited exercise test on an electronically operated bicycle ergometer (eBike, General Electric Company, Fairfield, Connecticut, USA) using a fixed ramp protocol (start at 10 watts, increase of 10 watts/minute) will be conducted. The test will be performed in an air-conditioned laboratory in the early afternoon under non-fasting conditions. After a 2-minute warm-up at 10 watts, patients will be instructed to pedal at a constant rate of 60 rpm to exhaustion or until signs of ischemia or serious cardiac arrhythmias appear. The exercise bout will be followed by a cool-down at 25 watts for 10 minutes or until HR is dropping down below 100 beats/minute. VO2peak will be defined as the highest value reached during exercise.</description>

    <description>A 12-week HIT will be performed 3 times per week on a bicycle ergometer according to the protocol of Wisløff et al. In the first 4 weeks of the program, all sessions will consist of moderate continuous training (MCT) at 60-80% of peak heart rate (HRpeak) for 40 minutes in order that patients get used to exercising. For weeks 4-12, the following HIT protocol is intended: Patients will warm up for 10 minutes at moderate intensity (60-70% of HRpeak, Borg 11-13) before cycling four 4-minute intervals at high intensity (85-95% of HRpeak, Borg 15-17). Each interval will be separated by a 3-minute active pause at 60-70% of HRpeak (Borg 11-13). The training session will end with a 5-minute cool-down at moderate intensity (60-70% of HRpeak). Total exercise time will be 40 minutes.</description>
