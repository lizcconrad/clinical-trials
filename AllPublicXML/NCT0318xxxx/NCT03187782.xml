      Background: Pulse diagnosis of the dysmenorrhea patients before and after acupuncture
      treatment on the acupoint San Yin Jiao (SP6) were performed so that the mechanism led to the
      pain can be understood more clearly and one may have a better idea to treat the disease in
      the future.

      Methods: Fifteen women participated in the study voluntarily. They have first to fill in the
      form of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain. Then the pulse of the subjects were measured by
      ANSWatch before and after acupuncture. All meridians can be assessed by analyzing the pulse
      spectra through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the original pulse data. The significant
      change of amplitude in certain harmonics which corresponds to a specific meridian after
      acupuncture treatment can be selected out.

        Fifteen patients suffering from dysmenorrhea who visited the traditional Chinese medicine
        outpatient department were recruited voluntarily in this study.

        All subjects live in the greater Taipei area.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criteria of the subjects were the presence of pain during menstruation
             or three days before it. It needed to recheck if the menstrual cycle appeared within
             three days after recruiting if dysmenorrhea attacked before menstruation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criterion was that subjects did not take pain killers in the 12 hours
             before measurement.
