  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      12-week single-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled, pilot clinical trial assessing The
      MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device in chronic wounds. This device guides clinicians to inspect,
      sample, debride or further evaluate areas within or around a wound where potentially harmful
      bacteria appear under violet light illumination resulting in better overall care and
      accelerated surface area reduction compared to current standard care. The study aims to
      determine if this device aids in the healing of chronic wounds by reduction in size of wound
      compared to current standard of care.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a prospective, 12-week, single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial has
      been designed with two primary objectives needed to inform more comprehensive studies at a
      later date. We propose to evaluate the following two primary outcomes: (1) the ability of the
      MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device to predict non healing wounds and wounds at risk or infection
      (control arm) and (2) whether utilization of the MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device in guiding
      clinicians to inspect, sample, debride or further evaluate areas within or around a wound
      where fluorescent bacteria are present (treatment arm) increases wound healing rates relative
      to standard care (control arm) for the treatment of chronic wounds.

      Both arms will receive standard procedures associated with wound care (e.g., sampling,
      debridement, preventative care, infection control, etc.) according to best practice
      guidelines. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the control or treatment arm and be
      followed as per the study protocol every time their wound is cared for over a 12-week period.
      The effectiveness of the MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device will be assessed with evaluation of
      wound surface area reduction rate and infection rates (incidence of infection and time to
      eradicate infection) compared to standard care.

      All subjects randomized will be evaluated for 12 weeks from the date of enrollment and
      treatment initiation. Subjects who may have wound closure within the 12-week study period
      will continue to have scheduled study evaluation visits up to the end of week 12.

    <description>Offers real-time detection of important biological and molecular information of a wound. The MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device is intended to assist clinicians during care and management of patients with chronic wounds by screening for the presence of potentially harmful bacteria levels. The device can capture and document either an image or video of the wound where the presence of fluorescent bacteria appears under violet light illumination. This information can be used to guide a clinician to inspect, sample, debride or further evaluate areas within or around a wound where fluorescent bacteria are present.</description>
