    <textblock>
      Background Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most serious conditions in newborns,
      affecting up to 10% of very low birth weight infants (VLBW). In the most premature population
      mortality rates can rise as high as 60%.

      Typical findings on abdominal radiography (AR) include pnuematosis intestinalis (PI), portal
      vein gas (PVG) and pneumoperitoneum, but are sometimes not present even in severe cases.
      Abdominal ultrasound (AUS) can depict PI, PVG and pnuemoperitoneum (in some cases a head of
      AR), but it also provides other crucial information such as bowel wall viability (thickness
      or thinning) and free abdominal fluid. These additional findings are helpful in expediting
      diagnosis and management of NEC.

      Methods and analysis The hypothesis being tested is that preforming an AUR in patients with
      clinical symptoms of NEC but inconclusive/normal AR will enhance detection rates, and
      expedite treatment in infants born at &lt;32 weeks.

      Discussion The use of AUS together with AR as an add-on test may increase the accuracy of
      diagnosing NEC, and precipitate treatment. Swift implementation of antibiotics and bowel rest
      is extremely important. To our best knowledge, our study will be the first to focus only on
      VLBW, who are most prone to NEC. It will also be the first multi-centre study evaluating the
      use of AUS as an add-on test, enabling us to recruit a significantly higher number of
      patients compared to published studies.
