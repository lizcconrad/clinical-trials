  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 90% of people undergoing bariatric surgery have NAFLD, which is a condition
      where fat accumulates in the liver and can lead to inflammation and scarring. It mostly
      causes no symptoms, however, in the most advanced cases there is an increased risk of liver
      cancer or liver failure.

      NAFLD is currently managed by weight loss and treating associated diseases such as diabetes.
      No medicines have been licensed to directly treat it but bariatric surgery has been shown to
      be usually beneficial, although it is unknown whether some operations are better than others.
      It is also unclear whether this is due to general weight loss or other factors.

      This study will be conducted in a hospital setting and aims to determine what changes in
      liver fat and fat processing occur after pre-operative low calorie diet and the two most
      common types of bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy.

      Participants will have ten study visits, four of which may be combined with NHS appointments.
      Participants will undergo investigations including MRI scans to measure changes in NAFLD and
      DEXA scans to measure changes in fat and fat-free mass (FFM). Participants will also undergo
      mixed meal testing to which stable isotopes (deuterated water and 13c-palmitate) will be
      added to allow changes in fat processing to be detected. In addition to samples taken as part
      of NHS care, blood, urine, liver and fat (visceral and subcutaneous (abdominal and gluteal))
      will be used for research. Visits will take place before and after low calorie diet and
      bariatric surgery.
