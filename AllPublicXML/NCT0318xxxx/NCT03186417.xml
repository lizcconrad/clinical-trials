  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled interventional study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in 20 patients
      with new onset Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The study is a single dose, phase I clinical trial
      and is the first time that this product will be infused in RA patients. The study duration is
      approximately fourteen months from time of screening to completion.

      Research hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that when administered therapeutically,
      MSCs will induce healthy immune responses and will reduce RA disease activity. This study is
      primarily focused on demonstrating the safety of this approach.

      This is a prospective, multicenter (with two performance sites under the auspices of Case
      Western Reserve University Clinical and Translational Science Award (CWRU CTSA) at University
      Hospitals and at MetroHealth Medical Center), double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) infusion in 20 new onset Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients with moderate to high
      disease activity despite adequate doses of methotrexate (MTX) for 12 weeks (at least 10 weeks
      of which has been at a dose of &gt;/=15 mg per week). The study is a single dose, phase I
      clinical trial, and this is the first time that this product will be infused in RA patients.
      After a screening period, the baseline visit will be conducted. Patients will halt their
      concomitant MTX 3 days prior to the MSC infusion and may resume their methotrexate at 7-10
      days following MSC infusion. This is a dose escalation study of a total of 20 patients with
      three groups of five patients each and five placebo patients. Patients will be randomized to
      receive MSC or placebo infusion using a computer-generated randomization scheme that takes
      into account that there are two sites. The first cohort will consist of a total of six
      patients. Of these six patients, five patients each will receive a single infusion of 2
      million/kg MSCs and one patient will receive placebo infusion. The second cohort will include
      a total of seven patients, of these seven patients; five patients will receive 4 million/kg
      MSCs and two patients who will receive placebo infusion. The final cohort consists of a total
      of seven patients. Of these seven patients, five patients will receive 6 million/kg
      allogeneic MSCs and two patients will receive placebo infusion. Infusion will occur on Day 0.
      Post-infusion study visits will occur on Days 1 (Visit 3), 7 (Visit 4), 14 (Visit 5), 28
      (Visit 6), 56 (Visit 7), and weeks 24 (Visit 8), 39 (Visit 9) and 52 (Visit 10). Phone calls
      will occur on Day 4, 21, and 72. Subject safety and tolerability of the single dose of MSCs
      will be evaluated at these study visits by reviewing interval histories, administering
      patient questionnaires (legacy [Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID 3) / Short
      Form 36 (SF36)] and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computer
      adaptive technology CAT), performing physical exams and spirometry, and obtaining safety
      laboratories. Special attention will be given to exacerbation of RA or &quot;flare&quot;. This study
      will also explore the efficacy measures: Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein
      (DAS28-CRP) and American College of Rheumatology20/50/70 (ACR20/50/70 will be calculated.
      Since the primary hypothesis is that infusion of MSCs will induce a state of immune
      tolerance, various assays to detect post-infusion changes in cells subsets, function or
      protein biomarker will be repeated at Day 7 and/or 14 and compared to baseline values
      (with-in subject comparison). Biomarkers to look at cell-subsets will be drawn. Selected
      patient samples will be stored for exploratory studies using Mass Cytometry (Cytof 2).
      Lastly, for those subjects who are agreeable to undergo the procedure, a bone marrow
      aspiration will be performed prior to infusion with allogeneic MSCs. MSCs from RA bone marrow
      will be expanded, banked, and used for future translational studies.
