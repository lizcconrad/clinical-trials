    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective research study is to determine the best way to manage
      post-operative pain after a total hip arthroplasty. Currently, there is no standard of care
      for managing post-operative pain in these patients. The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) first
      described by Blanco in 2007, is a promising technique in this indication: recently, there is
      a growing evidence for the use of the QLB as an alternative technique for pain management
      after hip surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample size of 100 patients (50 per group) was calculated based on 20% reduction in
      morphine consumption with 0.05% significance and a power of 0.8.

      After ethical committee approval, eligible patients scheduled to have a fast-track total hip
      arthroplasty are screened during preoperative evaluation clinic. Informed written consent
      will be obtained from all patients during pre-anesthesia visit the day before surgery (J-1).
      Consenting patients will be randomized the day of surgery (J0) to undergo QLB with
      ropivacaine (&quot;ropivacaine group&quot;) or normal saline (&quot;saline group&quot;).

      Before general anesthesia, all patients will have a needle-insertion posterior to the
      quadratus lumborum muscle avec injection of either ropivacaine in the &quot;ropivacaine group&quot; or
      normal saline in the &quot;saline group&quot;.

      After general anesthesia induction, dexamethasone and ketamine will be given to all patients.
