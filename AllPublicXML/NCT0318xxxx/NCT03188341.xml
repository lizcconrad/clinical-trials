    <textblock>
      The vascular surgery is a highest risk procedure when considering postoperative complications
      associated with the cardiovascular system. The leading clinical presentation is acute
      hemodynamic decompensation. However, one of the possible pathomechanisms might be
      repolarization disturbances. Many of perioperative risk factors of cardiac complications are
      modifiable. The identification may help in the global perioperative risk reduction.

      Aim: The aim of the study was an identification of the factors which may release clinically
      overt repolarization disturbances.

      Methods: The study group consisted of 100 patients, diagnosed with abdominal subrenal aortic
      aneurysms or peripheral arterial disease scheduled for an elective &quot;open&quot; vascular surgery
      procedure. The authors investigated whether age, gender, comorbidities or some perioperative
      factors (including hemodynamic, metabolic or genetic) were related to the occurrence of
      clinically concealed repolarization disturbances or clinically disclosed cardiac
      complications in postoperative time up to 30 day and one year after vascular surgery
      procedure.

      Vascular surgery is thought as the highest risk procedure in the context of cardiac
      complications. The range may include acute coronary syndrome, acute circulatory failure,
      severe arrhythmias, syncope and sudden cardiac death. The patient population is considered as
      a high risk, too. Popular calculators used for risk stratifications are based on preoperative
      patient's history and some general laboratory results. However, general status of the patient
      changes dynamically during vascular procedures leading to acquired increased risk. For this
      reason, sole preoperative risk prediction based on standard calculators is unsuitable and
      suboptimal. Advanced monitoring systems may record some temporary disturbances (e.g.
      ventricular repolarization disturbances), which may be asymptomatic. The clinical
      significance in postoperative risk prediction of such observations remains undefined. On the
      other hand, many of perioperative cardiac complications are caused by modifiable factors. The
      identification may help in the global perioperative risk reduction.

      Metabolic monitoring consisted of electrolytes and arterial blood gas analysis prior to
      anesthesia induction and at the end of the procedure.

      Blood was drawn into anticoagulant for genetic studies. Genomic DNA was isolated from
      peripheral blood leukocytes to investigate rs203462 AKAP10 polymorphism in the study
      population.
