  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CONTEXT: France is still one of the biggest consumers of antibiotics in Europe. An
      explanation for this increase in consumption would be aging. Thus, part of this aging
      population lives in nursing home, where the urinary tract infection is the second most
      suspected pathology. However, it can most often be bacteriuria requiring no antibiotic
      therapy. In nursing home, nurses who alert prescribers when an infection is suspected by
      describing clinical signs.However, his propensity to perform too rapidly and systematically
      an examination with dipsticks leads the physician to prescribe antibiotic. This is how a
      program called ATOUM is set up to reduce the prescription of antibiotics in nursing home. The
      present ATOUM 4 study builds on this program.

      OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of a nurse-centered multimodal intervention involving
      training and sensitization on urinary tract infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, antibiotic
      resistance and interprofessional communication on antibiotic therapy. METHODS: This will be a
      randomized double-arm interventional study in 40 nursing home. The intervention group of 20
      nursing home will receive a blended-learning intervention.

      nursing home will receive a blended-learning intervention.The primary outcome will be the
      percentage of reduction in antibiotic prescription at the end of the twelve months following
      the first visit to nursing home. This data, aggregated by nursing home, will be obtained from
      the structures concerned via their prescription registration system.

The tools of this intervention will consist on posters , quiz about bacteriuria and urinary tract infection (UTI) and algorithm to help nurse's reasoning when UTI is suspected.</description>
