    <textblock>
      Rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) is a technique to obtain flow arrest for short periods of time
      during dissection or rupture of the aneurysm. RVP results in an adequate fall in blood
      pressure which presents as an on-off phenomenon. However it is not clear whether repetitive
      periods of pacing are harmless for the patient. Silent cardiac and cerebral infarcts may be
      undetected. The investigators will study the safety of RVP, particularly for the heart and
      the brain.

    <textblock>
      Rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) is a technique to obtain flow arrest for short periods of time
      during dissection or rupture of the aneurysm. RVP results in an adequate fall in blood
      pressure which presents as an on-off phenomenon. The technique facilitates the dissection and
      manipulation of cerebral aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and can be
      lifesaving in the case of an intraoperative bleeding or rupture. In a former study blood
      pressure and clinical outcome were used as study parameters. However it is not clear whether
      repetitive periods of pacing are harmless for the patient. Silent cardiac and cerebral
      infarcts may be undetected if only clinical outcome is taken as a study parameter. The
      investigators will study the safety of RVP, particularly for the heart and the brain, using
      magnetic resonance imaging, brain oxygenation (Sct O₂) evaluated by near-infrared
      spectroscopy and troponin levels. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of
      repetitive periods of RVP on the oxygenation of the heart and brain using magnetic resonance
      imaging, Sct O2 (3) and troponin levels (4) both markers for ischemia damage.
