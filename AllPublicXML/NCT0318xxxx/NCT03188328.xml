  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local treatment of unresectable tumors is challenging, particularly with radioactivity.
      Current practice relies on external beam irradiation or on a variety of medical devices for
      brachytherapy. Both approaches proved useful in controlling tumor growth but are
      characterized by poor patient's compliance, significant side effects, high costs and
      technological complexity hampering wide-spread use. The use of AvidinOX for radionuclide
      therapy of inoperable cancer lesions will offer a number of advantages compared to current
      brachytherapy. In fact, the perfusion of a target tissue with AvidinOX, compared to current
      devices, will allow adapting the therapy to the tumor/organ shape, and it will also make it
      possible to delay the administration of radioactivity for several days which, according to
      pre-clinical studies, might be also divided up into repeated doses. AvidinOX linking stably
      to tissue proteins, does not exhibit the problem of seed migration which is associated with
      high morbidity. Based on previous findings with AvidinOX in combination with radionuclides in
      pre-clinical studies as well as data from the clinical use in liver metastases, it can be
      assumed that intralesional injections of AvidinOX followed by intravenous injections of
      177Lu-ST2210 could be a safe and efficacious method for treating inoperable tumor lesions.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. To identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of two consecutive repeated IV 177Lu-ST2210
           administration following a previous tumor intra-lesion/s injection of AvidinOX.

        2. To assess safety and tolerability of intra-lesionally injected AvidinOX + IV injected
           177Lu-ST2210

        3. To evaluate intra-lesional distribution and retention of {AvidinOX +
           177Lu-ST2210}-complex in tumor lesion/s

        4. To evaluate systemic biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 177Lu-ST2210 and {AvidinOX
           + 177Lu-ST2210}- complex

      Main secondary objectives are:

        1. To evaluate whole body dosimetry of IV 177Lu-ST2210 after prior AvidinOX injection
           (radiation safety dosimetry)

        2. To record individual tumor dosimetry

        3. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of {AvidinOX + 177Lu-ST2210}-complex in reducing tumor
           size and metabolic activity.

        4. To evaluate damage of tumor cells by radioactivity and immunogenic cell death

        5. To evaluate whole body safety dosimetry and dose linearity

        6. To evaluate pharmacokinetics of ST2210 in plasma and urine
