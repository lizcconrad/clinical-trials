  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimidation of medical students by health care professionals is a well-documented
      phenomenon. Raising awareness of what constitutes intimidation is a preferred method for
      preventing it through increased reporting. Simulation is a novel method of raising awareness
      of intimidation.

      This is a randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of simulation (involving
      actors), an educational video and no intervention, as adjuncts to group discussion, on
      students' ability to identify and report intimidation. Medical students from the University
      of Montreal in Montreal, Canada, will be recruited at the beginning of surgical clerkship.
      They will complete a standardized and validated pre-intervention questionnaire on their
      experience with intimidation consisting of multiple choice questions and short answers. They
      will be randomised to one of the three interventions lasting 70 minutes that will be followed
      by a 20-minute standardized discussion on intimidation with all students participating
      together. At the end of their surgical rotation, they will complete a similar
      post-intervention questionnaire with additional questions pertaining to the reporting of
      intimidation.

      Differences in intimidation reporting after the intervention as well as a before and after
      comparison of the &quot;Negative Acts Questionnaire&quot; score will be studied.

    <description>During a suturing class at the simulation center, the students enter a classroom. Although the students are not aware of this, among them is an actor playing the role of a student. One of the two professors is also an actor. As the activity progresses, the professor targets the student played by an actor. The intimidation intensifies until the end. At the end of the activity, there is a debriefing explaining to the students that the bullying professor and the victim were actors.</description>
