  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim was to evaluate the clinical performance of HEMA-containing and HEMA-free all-in-one
      self-etch adhesives with and without a surface sealing process with a nanohybrid composite in
      occlusal caries restorations. The hypothesis is that the HEMA-containing and HEMA-free
      all-in-one self-etch adhesive and the surface sealing process would significantly effect
      clinical performance of occlusal restorations.

    <measure>Number of failed restorations evaluated according to the modified USPSH criteria in patients with occlusal restorations.</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In restorations, retention rate, color match, wear or loss of anatomic form, marginal discoloration, caries, marginal adaptation, and surface texture were scored success or failure according to modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria. According to this criteria, success restorations received Alfa (A) or Bravo (B) scores. Alfa (A) represents the ideal clinical situation; Bravo (B) is the clinically acceptable. Failed restorations received Charlie (C) or Delta (D) scores. Charlie (C) is the clinically unacceptable situations where the restorations had to be replaced; Delta (D) is the situation where the restoration is fractured, mobile or missing and needed to be replaced immediately.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who received four direct Class I composite restorations, those with good oral
             hygiene with no active periodontal or pulpal diseases, whose permanent first or second
             molar required restorations for occlusal carious lesions with neighboring teeth and
             were in occlusion with antagonist teeth, and were willing to return for follow-up
             examinations as outlined by the investigators.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with uncontrolled parafunction, those presenting with poor oral hygiene and
             disinterested in or refused oral hygiene instructions, molars and premolars with
             carious lesions on a surface other than the occlusal surface and in continuity with
             the occlusal cavity, pulp exposure during caries removal procedure or cavities with
             the risk of pulp exposure, having spontaneous pain or sensitivity to percussion, and
             patients with periodontal or gingival disease.
