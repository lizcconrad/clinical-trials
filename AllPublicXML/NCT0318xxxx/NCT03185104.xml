  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study measures and compares the effect of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) on caries
      increment in removable partial denture wearers. Half of the participants will SDF and while
      the other half will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Removable partial dentures are commonly constructed to replace missing teeth. It is observed
      that removable partial denture wearers are susceptible to dental caries.

      The mode of action of silver diamine fluoride on caries prevention is dual: fluoride ions
      interact synergistically with silver to react with hydroxyapatite to form fluorapatite, and
      silver is bactericidal by reacting with the thiol groups of the amino and nucleic acids that
      halt the metabolic and reproductive functions of the cariogenic bacteria.

    <intervention_model_description>Removable partial denture wearers are randomized assigned to either the fluoride group or the placebo group. The fluoride group receives semi-annually professionally applied 38% SDF solution to all exposed tooth and root surfaces while the placebo group receives distilled water using the same application method.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>New and recurrent caries lesions are recorded according to the International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS). Molars and premolars are considered to have 5 coronal surfaces, whereas canines and incisors are considered to have 4. The cleaned and dried teeth are recorded as sound, sealed, restored, crowned, or missing. Each coronal tooth surface is classified using a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from sound to extensive cavitation using a WHO probe. The same procedure is repeated for all root surfaces. Coronal and root surface caries increments are calculated by comparing the baseline and follow-up observations for each tooth surface.</description>
