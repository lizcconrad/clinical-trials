  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of a mobile phone app linked to hospital
      electronic medical record (EMR) system on weight reduction and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
      Adults aged &gt; 20 years with witnessed snoring or sleep apnea from a sleep clinic of a
      tertiary center were prospectively enrolled, and the participats were randomized into app
      user and control groups. The mobile app was designed to collect daily lifestyle data by
      wearing a wrist activity tracker and reporting dietary intake. At the visit after 2 weeks of
      use, a summary of the lifestyle was displayed on the hospital EMR and reviewed by both
      physicians and app users. Further lifestyle modification was encouraged on the basis of the
      electronically collected data. In the control group, the lifestyle modification performed as
      the usual practice. All participants underwent Watch PAT and body mass index (BMI)
      measurement twice: on enrollment; and after 4-weeks follow up. Changes of BMI, and parameters
      of sleep related breathing were analyzed.
