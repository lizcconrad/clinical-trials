      This is an open-label follow up study to evaluate the safety for the subjects with
      ALLO-ASC-CD injection in phase 1 clinical trial (ALLO-ASC-CD-101) for 36 months.

      ALLO-ASC-CD is intravenous infusion containing allogenic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells. Adipose-derived stem cells are directed to injured tissue, and reduce inflammation.
      Furthermore their immunomodulatory effects are significant for treating immune-related
      disease, such as crohn's disease. Finally, ALLO-ASC-CD may provide a new option in treating a
      crohn's disease.
