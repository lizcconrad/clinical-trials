      Despite recommends that school-based interventions use a comprehensive approach for health
      promotions; most fitness programs exclusively emphasize physical activity. This study
      compared the comprehensive Translational Health in Nutrition and Kinesiology (THINK) program
      to a traditional YMCA program (The Sports, Play, and Active Recreation for Kids (SPARK)
      fitness curriculum) on measures of physical fitness, body composition, and executive
      cognitive function outcomes among 105 ethnic minority children (9±1.03 years old) following a
      10-week intervention period.

    <measure>Change in Lower Body Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lower body strength, specifically for the quadriceps muscle group, was assessed with the wall squat test. A vertical jump test utilizing a Vertec. was used to assess lower body power . The vertical jump test data were used to estimate average power (W) according to the Lewis formula Average Power (W) = √4.9 x mass (kg) x √VJ (m) x 9.81.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible for this study, subjects had to be between the ages of eight and 12,
             enrolled in a YMCA program, and able to participate in physical activity. Parents were
             provided with information packets regarding project details, a parental consent form,
             and a child assent form. Once the subjects assented and parents consented, a health
             questionnaire regarding child's age, gender, race/ethnicity, health history and SES
             was completed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with metabolic, cardiovascular, neuromuscular and psychological disorders and
             with medications that would interfere with testing results were excluded from the
             study.
