  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will test the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of an intervention
      protocol for one method of electric current stimulation, repetitive transorbital alternating
      current stimulation (rtACS), to treat visual impairment in people with glaucoma. We will
      evaluate a study protocol to use in future clinical trials to test the effectiveness of rtACS
      to ameliorate the progressive effects of vision loss both structurally and functionally in
      the eye, the visual pathway, and in regard to people's independence (i.e., functional
      ability). In this prospective, randomized controlled, double-masked pilot study, we will: 1)
      determine an effect of rtACS on ophthalmic structure and function (from retina to visual
      brain), 2) assess the methodology of procedures for assessment of people's functional ability
      and QoL to determine an effect of rtACS, and 3) assess the feasibility and implementation of
      the pilot study protocol for a larger multi-site, randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will engage in baseline, intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up visits
      over the span of approximately 8 weeks. The expected outcomes for this project are that (1)
      rtACS activates viable but poorly or non-functional retinal ganglion cells to improve their
      structural and functional capabilities, (2) measures of retinal, optic nerve, and visual
      brain structures and function will correspond with improvement in visual function, and (3)
      changes in visual function following rtACS will be associated with improvements in
      participants' functional ability and QoL. rtACS has successfully been used in the
      rehabilitation of visual impairments in people with optic neuropathies; however, we do not
      know the clinical value of rtACS specifically for people with glaucoma, including the effect
      of rtACS on people's functional ability and QoL.
