  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major and growing public health problem and poses economic
      burden on the society. There is a need for a safe, equipment-free, low-cost, and easily
      implemented exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program for CHF patients in China.
      Baduanjin exercise, translated as 'eight silken movements', is one of the most common forms
      of traditional Chinese exercise and it could have value to be integrated into a
      exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program for CHF patients, together with education,
      evaluation and consultancy. Accordingly, the BESMILE-HF program applying the Baduanjin
      exercise as the central component, has been developed in Guangdong Provincial Hospital of
      Chinese Medicine which is one of the largest hospitals of Chinese medicine in China. This
      project is to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of BESMILE-HF program in patients with
      CHF in China, and it will be based on a randomized controlled trial and a qualitative study.
