    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective non-interventional, multi-centre study of the Vascutek
      Fenestrated Anaconda™ system, and is essentially a post-market study. The Vascutek
      Fenestrated Anaconda™ system is a custom made device used for the treatment of Abdominal
      Aortic Aneurysm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a life threatening disease. Endovascular repair of
      infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (EVAR) has replaced open surgical repair as the
      standard of care treatment for most patients. Endovascular repair offers several benefits
      over open surgical repair, including: less invasive procedure, faster recovery, lower
      morbidity and lower early post-operative mortality. The configuration of vascular anatomy is
      important to the successful placement and subsequent performance of infrarenal EVAR devices.
      In particular aortic neck angulation and length are important for the success of EVAR.
      Challenging necks with an aortic diameter ≥28 mm, angulation ≥60°, length &lt;10mm,
      circumferential thrombus, reversed tapered configuration or neck with bulging, make it more
      difficult to oppose the endograft to the aortic wall and are related to an increased risk of
      type Ia endoleak and reinterventions. In order to overcome these issues, fenestrated and
      branched stent grafts have been developed. Fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm
      repair is now a routinely utilised procedure in the treatment of complex aortic aneurysm
      anatomy, especially in patients unsuitable for open surgical repair.

      The Fenestrated Anaconda™ device (Vascutek Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland, UK) has been commercially
      available since 2010. The Fenestrated Anaconda™ device has potential advantages over other
      FEVAR devices, since it can be repositioned after deployment, has a magnet-assisted limb
      cannulation, and the device contains less metal, allowing a better view of the radiological
      markers on the device during intra-operative imaging. Additionally, the potential to position
      fenestrations anywhere in the main body is unrestricted due to the absence of other stent
      structures.

      This prospective, real world study of the Fenestrated Anaconda™ device will provide insight
      into both the short and long term clinical outcomes of the device. An attempt will be made to
      identify predictors of success or failure, and this study will help to identify patients that
      are likely to benefit from repair and improve results. The effect of FEVAR on post-operative
      patient reported quality of life will be assessed. In addition, the study will provide
      insight into the potential decline in renal function after FEVAR, a well-known concern after
      both EVAR and FEVAR.

      <textblock>
        Patients with a juxtrarenal or suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, including those
        aneurysms with very short neck or no neck, who require endovascular repair of their
        aneurysm and whose aneurysm is suitable for treatment using a custom made Vascutek
        Fenestrated Anaconda™ device will be recruited. This is a non-interventional study and
        therefore only patients who would normally receive this device as part of standard
        treatment at the participating institute will be recruited.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the criteria below in order to be eligible for inclusion in the
        study -

          1. Patient is aged 18 years or over on the date of consent

          2. Patient is willing and able to comply with all study procedures and study follow-up
             visits

          3. Patient is willing and able to give written informed consent to participate in study

          4. Patient has a juxtrarenal or suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with maximum
             sac diameter ≥ 5.5cm, or an AAA ≥ 4.5 cm which has increased by &gt; 1.0 cm in the past
             year

          5. Patient is anatomically suitable for a bifurcated Fenestrated Anaconda™ device

        NOTE: Both the treating Investigator and the Manufacturer must agree that the proposed
        patient's anatomy is suitable for treatment using the Fenestrated Anaconda™ device. Where
        the Investigator proposes that the patient anatomy is suitable and the Manufacturer
        subsequently disagrees, the patient will be recorded as a screen failure and deemed not
        eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any patient who meets any of the criteria below will be excluded from participation in the
        study -

          1. Patient has a life expectancy &lt; 2 years, as judged by the Investigator

          2. Patient has psychiatric or other condition that in the opinion of the Investigator may
             limit their ability to comply with study procedures

          3. Patient is participating in another clinical study which in the opinion of the
             Investigator could influence the outcomes of this study

          4. Patient has a known allergy to any device component (polyester, nitinol, nickel)

          5. Patient has a coagulopathy or uncontrolled bleeding disorder

          6. Patient has a ruptured, leaking or mycotic aneurysm

          8. Patient has had CVA or MI within three months of enrolment or treatment

          9. Patient has a connective tissue disease (e.g. Marfan Syndrome)

         10. Patient has had a previously inserted endovascular stent in the abdominal aorta

         11. Patient is pregnant (female of childbearing potential only)
