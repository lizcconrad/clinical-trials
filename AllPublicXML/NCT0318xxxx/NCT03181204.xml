  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to to verify the feasibility of obtaining and
      comparing two epithelia in two populations based on the following experiments:

        -  Differentiation of an Induced Pluripotent Stem cell (iPS) clone derived from cutaneous
           biopsy in a population of heavy smokers (plus patients with chronic obstructive
           pulmonary disease) in order to obtain differentiated bronchial epithelia in vitro.

        -  For each of these same patients, generation of bronchial epithelium in vitro from
           bronchial biopsy using human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air-liquid interface
           (ALI) cultures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary objectives:

        -  Confrontation of the two models of in vitro generation of bronchial epithelium by iPS
           and ALI in order to validate our model of study of the human bronchial epithelium COPD
           generated by the iPS.

        -  Inducing a &quot;COPD-like&quot; epithelial phenotype by exposing the bronchial epithelia
           generated from the iPS to a source of in vitro toxin (tobacco) and studying its effects
           by transcriptomic analysis via high-throughput sequencing (NGS) at key steps during the
           model.

        -  Demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining iPS from peripheral blood sampling.

    <description>The bronchial biopsy is part of this study's inclusion criteria and is required during routine care for the patient. Bronchial fibroscopy is performed under general or local anesthesia. Biopsies are performed using forceps and according to current recommendations. One biopsy will be fixed immediately in RCL2 medium while the others (between 3 and 6) will be kept in isotonic saline and rapidly prepared for air-liquid-interface (ALI) cell culture.</description>
