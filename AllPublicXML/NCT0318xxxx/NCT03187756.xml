  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase II single arm study of peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
      and posttransplantation cyclophosphamide, using HLA full match or haploidentical related
      donors, in hematological malignancies including those difficult to engraft. The objective of
      this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility in nonmyeloablative, partially
      HLA-mismatched or HLA-matched PBSC transplant from haploidentical donors or fully matched
      donors with post-grafting immunosuppression that includes high-dose cyclophosphamide,
      tacrolimus, and Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

      Primary Objective Estimate event free survival (EFS) (relapse, progression, or death) rate
      one year after transplant.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Estimate the cumulative incidences of severe acute grade III or higher GVHD, chronic
           GVHD (overall and by extent)

        2. Estimate the cumulative incidence of systemic steroid initiation,

        3. Summarize the graft failure frequency,

        4. Summarize the kinetics of neutrophil and platelet recovery, and kinetics of donor
           chimerism in unsorted and CD3+ sorted peripheral blood.

        5. Summarize major toxicities and complications associated with the transplantation
           procedure selected toxicities.

      Exploratory Objectives:

      Explore the association between the amount of donor T cell chimerism at ~ Day 28 and
      patient/graft characteristics (e.g., prior therapies, graft cell dose) and transplantation
      outcomes (sustained engraftment, relapse or progression, GVHD).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following are eligibility for study entry and transplantation.

          -  Presence of a suitable related, HLA-haploidentical or HLA-matched stem cell donor

          -  The donor and recipient must be identical at least one allele of each of the following
             genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1. A minimum match of 5/10 is
             therefore required for related donors, and will be considered sufficient evidence that
             the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype.

          -  Eligible diagnoses:

          -  Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML] with
             at least one poor risk factor

          -  No active extramedullary leukemia or known active CNS involvement by malignancy. Such
             disease treated into remission is permitted.

          -  Any previous autologous HSCT must have occurred at least 3 months prior to start of
             conditioning

          -  No previous allogeneic HSCT

          -  Adequate end-organ function Note: Infection is permitted if there is evidence of
             response to medication. Eligibility of HIV infected patients will be determined on a
             case-by-case basis.

        Donor eligibility

          -  Donors must be either:

          -  HLA-haploidentical or HLA-identical relatives of the patient based on allele or allele
             group level typing as defined in Section 4.1.

          -  Medically fit to and willing to donate

          -  Lack of recipient anti-donor HLA antibody

          -  Has not donated blood products to patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any individual that does not meet the eligibility criteria for transplantation or
             donor eligibility will not be a part of this trial.
