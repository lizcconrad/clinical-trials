    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the amount of the study drug, LY3074828, that gets
      into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of LY3074828 when given as
      different formulations. The tolerability of LY3074828 will also be evaluated and information
      about any side effects experienced will be collected.

      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study. For each participant,
      the total duration of the clinical trial will be approximately 13 weeks, not including
      screening.
