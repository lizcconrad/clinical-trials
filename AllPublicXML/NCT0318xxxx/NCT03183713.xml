  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center prospective randomized investigation of patients undergoing surgical
      arthrodesis for single or multi-level cervical disease, resulting in cervical radiculopathy.
      Patients indicated for surgery for cervical degenerative disease (CDD) will be screened for
      yellow flags using validated tools to assess pain. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) will be
      used to modify yellow flags in spine patients. All patients at risk will be stratified by
      risk rating and randomly assigned to 2 groups; sham treatment (N=20) or CBT (N=20). The goal
      of this study is to unmask the relationship between psychological distress and clinical
      outcomes in patients undergoing surgical treatment for cervical degenerative disease
      resulting in combinations of neck pain and radiculopathy, and to determine the effectiveness
      of a brief psychological intervention on subset of patients who screen positive for
      psychological distress prior to their surgeries.

    <description>The DRAM assesses and profiles patients: those showing no psychological distress, those at risk of developing major psychological overlay, and those that are distressed.</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The pain catastrophizing scale quantifies an individual's pain experience, their tendency to magnify the threat value of pain, and their ability to prevent pain-related thoughts surrounding a painful event.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome Expectation question (OEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The OEQ will be a single item question: &quot;I strongly believe that I will recover quickly from my surgery. Responses are score on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Outcome expectations have been shown to be one of the strongest psychological predictors affecting recovery from musculoskeletal injuries.</description>

    <description>Psychologically symptomatic patients will then be randomized to 4-8 weeks of placebo phone calls (Group PS-PL-Sx) or 4-8 weeks of cognitive behavior therapy treatment (PS-CBT-Sx) based on a 1:1 randomization ratio. Subjects randomized to receive CBT before surgery will proceed to 6 sessions given within 4-8 weeks by a licensed psychologist specializing in pain. CBT sessions will be 30 minutes in length, and focus on empirically supported behavior management, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, and relaxation training. The first session will be performed in person, and the subsequent 5 sessions will be performed over the phone.</description>
