      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind, dose escalation, placebo-controlled,
      first-in-humans phase 1 study to investigate the safety and tolerability of single and
      multiple escalating doses of ICP-022 in healthy volunteers. 40 healthy male participants
      (aged between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive) will be enrolled into Part 1 (single
      escalating dose administration) of this study, and additional 24 male subjects will be
      enrolled in Part 2 (multiple escalating dose administration). Part 1a consists of 5 cohorts
      of 8 participants each, while Part 2 includes 3 cohorts of 8 participants each.

      Part 1a consists a treatment period with single oral dosing, and a safety follow-up to 7 days
      after dosing. Cohort 4 of Part 1a will return on Day 8 to repeat the study under fed
      condition in Part 1b.

      Part 2 consists a treatment period with multiple dosing (once per day for 14 consecutive
      days), and a safety follow-up until 28 days after dosing. All subjects will receive either
      ICP-022 or placebo.

    <description>There are 5 cohorts in the Part 1 phase of the trial. Three quarters of subjects will be randomized to receive ICP-022 in a double-blind fashion. Five dose levels will be evaluated; dose escalation steps may be modified based on the safety from the previous dose. Cohort 4 will return on Day 8 and receive a single dose of ICP-022 under fed conditions.
In Part 2 phase of the trial,three quarters of subjects will be randomized to receive the ICP-022 in a double-blind fashion in 3 cohorts. ICP-022 will be administered once a day for 14 consecutive days.</description>
