      This study involves the use of the Medtronic PC+S deep brain stimulation for the treatment of
      intractable OCD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to provide therapy to patients with severe, treatment-refractory
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by stimulating in two separate, but related, brain
      regions, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and the ventral anterior limb of the
      internal capsule and adjacent ventral striatum (VC/VS) with a novel Medtronic PC+S deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) system. While providing this DBS therapy, use of this new,
      recording-capable device will allow collection of data about brain activity in these two
      regions. This data will enable researchers to further elucidate the exact mechanisms of DBS
      therapy, as well as the neuropathophyisiology of OCD. This study aims to 1) gather evidence
      for corticostriatal changes in OCD in response to acute and chronic VC/VS DBS treatment and
      2) specifically disrupt or enhance synchrony in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC)
      circuit.

      Deep Brain stimulation involves bilateral stereotactic placement of stimulating &quot;leads&quot; into
      specific brain structures. Leads are attached to permanent subcutaneous wires and
      battery-powered implantable neurostimulators (INSs). Noninvasive INS programming can achieve
      a balance between maximal benefit (reduction in disabling OCD symptoms), while minimizing
      adverse effects (eg sensorimotor effects such as dysarthria or paresthesias; as well as
      behavioral side effects, e.g., hypomania, insomnia, or increased anxiety). HDE approval was
      granted in February 2009, and IDE approval was granted in February 2016. Multiple hospitals
      around the country have established HDE protocols to implant patients with intractable OCD
      who have failed conventional therapies, and some hospitals, like us, have obtained
      Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval to conduct pilot clinical trials. The
      existing model of DBS for OCD only addresses one aspect of the brain circuit implicated in
      the CSTC circuit, the VC/VS target. Therapy with this device, under this protocol, will also
      be able to provide stimulation to the cortical part of this circuit. Single-site VC/VS DBS
      may not adequately target the putative circuit. If OCD symptoms do arise from CSTC loop
      dysfunction, this implies that the problem is one of improper information flow between
      connected brain areas. Thus, modifying circuit activity may require coordinated intervention
      at multiple points to effectively synchronize or de-synchronize the full loop. Stimulation
      that specifically interrupts reverberant activity between prefrontal cortex and striatum will
      be superior to VC/VS DBS alone at relieving symptoms of OCD. We will test this by
      simultaneously implanting stimulating/recording electrodes at both VC/VS and a dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) target bilaterally.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. OCD, diagnosed by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5), judged of
             disabling severity with a Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score of at
             least 28.

          2. Persistence of severe symptoms and impairment for five or more years despite: i. at
             least three adequate (≥3 months at the maximum tolerated dose) serotonin transporter
             inhibitor trials (may use any serotonin or serotonin-norepinephrine inhibitors, but
             must include a trial of clomipramine) alone or in combination with ii. adequate
             behavior therapy (≥20 sessions of expert exposure and response prevention; At least 20
             sessions of behavioral therapy must be attempted), and iii. augmentation of one of the
             selective SRIs with a neuroleptic or clonazepam.

          3. Age between 21 and 64 years.

          4. Able to understand and comply with instructions.

          5. Able to give fully informed, written consent in the judgment of the site Consent
             Monitor.

          6. Either drug free or on a stable drug regimen for at least 6 weeks.

          7. Good general health.

          8. A family member or significant other, in contact with the patient every 1-3 days, is
             available and willing to communicate with the research team if the patient's clinical
             status worsens, and if necessary to accompany patients to study visits.

          9. The local referring psychiatrist is willing to provide ongoing care during and after
             the trial.

         10. Patient is aware of, able to adhere to, and willing to tolerate the frequency of
             visits associated with adjustment of the dual-stimulation configuration and/or
             collection of brain recordings. This will usually mean limitation to patients who live
             close to the study site.

         11. Platelet count greater than 125,000 per cubic millimeter and a PT and PTT within
             normal limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current or past psychotic disorder.

          2. Full-scale IQ below 75 on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WAIS) or
             cognitive impairment that would affect a participant's ability to give informed
             consent or provide interview or self-report data reliably, as determined by the
             consent monitor and the site psychiatrist. A questionnaire assessing consent
             comprehension will be used with all study subjects, to ensure that they understand the
             key procedures of the study, and its risks and benefits. An independent monitor will
             administer that questionnaire.

             mania or hypomania.

             In our prior studies, a history of induced hypomanic symptoms did not predict
             DBS-related hypomania.

             brain function, other than tic disorders or Tourette syndrome.
