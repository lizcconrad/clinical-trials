  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use technology to improve symptom status and ultimately
      improve patient centered outcomes in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). The primary purpose
      of the intervention (VIP-HANA) is to improve symptom status. The investigators hypothesize
      that VIP-HANA will improve symptom frequency and intensity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As PLWHA age, they are developing chronic illnesses and co-morbid conditions that are often
      seen in older HIV negative patients. HANA conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, liver
      disease, diabetes, and asthma) are becoming more common as PLWHA age.

      An individual's ability to identify and self-manage symptoms of HIV illness has been shown to
      improve patient outcomes and quality of life. The investigators will develop and pilot test
      the Video Information Provider (VIP), a web application (app) that delivered HIV-related
      symptom self-care strategies for PLWHA for 13 common (non-HANA) HIV/AIDS symptoms. There is a
      need to identify the symptom experience of PLWHA with HANA conditions.

      The aim is to compare the efficacy of VIP-HANA to a control arm for ameliorating symptom
      frequency and intensity and secondary health outcomes in 100 PLWHA with HANA conditions over
      6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in score on Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information SystemÂ® (PROMIS)-29</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Months &amp; Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-29 includes seven health related quality of life domains (Physical Functioning, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Social Functioning, and Pain), and the pain domain has two subdomains (interference and intensity). Each of the 7 domains has four 5-level items (i.e., 16 decrements each). In addition to these items, pain intensity is assessed using a single 11-point numeric rating scale anchored between no pain (0) and worse imaginable pain. Raw scores are transformed using the T-score metric based on the item response theory calibrations in which scores have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 for the general population in the US. T-scores can be estimated using the scoring tables listed in the PROMIS manuals. A higher PROMIS T-score implies more of the concept being measured; for instance, a higher PROMIS score on physical function indicates better functioning, whereas a higher score on depression indicates more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in score on Engagement with Health Care Provider Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Months &amp; Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement with Health Care Provide scale is a 13-item scale in which subjects rate their interactions with their health care providers on a four-point scale with 1=always true and 4=never true. A low score indicates greater provider engagement.</description>

    <measure>Change in score of the VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Months &amp; Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measures adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). VAS asks subjects to indicate a point on a line that shows their best guess about how much of each drug they have taken. 0% means they have taken no drug, 50% means they have taken half their drugs, and 100% means they have taken every single dose.</description>
