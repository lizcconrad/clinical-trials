      Aim: The aim of this split-mouth study was to compare conventional and adhesive
      flash-free-bracket systems in terms of plaque retention, white spot lesion formation,
      biomarker levels and select microbes in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF).

      Materials &amp; Methods: Thirty-seven systemically healthy patients (18 males, 19 females) with
      the age range of 13-18 years were involved in this split-mouth study. Clinical evaluations,
      quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) imaging, GCF and plaque samplings were
      performed at baseline and at 1-, 2-, 3-months. QLF was repeated following debonding, GCF
      samples were analyzed by immunoassay and real-time PCR for the biomarker and bacteria
      content. Data were analyzed by Wilcoxon on dependent samples.
