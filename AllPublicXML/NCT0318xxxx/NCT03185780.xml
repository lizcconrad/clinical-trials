  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly a quarter of a million patients are diagnosed each year with tumors of the central
      nervous system, a third of them malignant. The most common malignant tumor of the brain is
      the high grade glioma( HGG), whose treatment begins with surgical resection of the tumor,
      followed by a combined chemo-radiation regimen, with the drug Temodal (temozolomide). This
      treatment is often accompanied by toxic effects (e.g., nausea, headache, constipation,
      weakness/fatigue, and others), with treatment of these effects limited in their effectiveness
      and safety. Complementary medicine treatments such as acupuncture and touch therapies
      (reflexology, Shiatsu, etc.) have been researched and found to be both safe and effective for
      some of the toxic effects of oncology treatment regimens.

      The present pilot study is set to examine the impact of complementary medicine on the toxic
      effects of the conventional treatment for HGG. The study will include 40 patients and will
      last for two years, during which patients will be treated with acupuncture and/or touch
      therapies, this in parallel to their chemo-radiation regimen. The primary study outcome will
      be the scores on four Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs): the Measure Yourself
      Concerns and Wellbeing (MYCAW) study tool; the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Brain
      Cancer (FACT-Br) questionnaire; the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS); and the
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire
      (EORTC QLQ-c30). Secondary study outcomes will include the safety of the complementary
      medicine treatments, and adherence to the planned oncology treatment regimen, as measured by
      the Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) calculation.
