  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to measure the health impact of a dietary intervention known as time
      restricted feeding (TRF) on patients with metabolic syndrome (three or more of: increased
      waist circumference, abnormal cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, or elevated blood
      sugar). The investigators will enroll patients with metabolic syndrome who eat for ≥ 14 hours
      per day and will ask participants to reduce daily oral intake to 10 hours per day. The
      investigators will assess the impact of this dietary change using measures obtained before
      and after a 12 week intervention period, including body mass index, blood pressure, various
      lab parameters and blood sugar levels (assessed using a continuous glucose monitor). The
      investigators will assess for compliance with TRF using a Smart Phone application
      (myCircadianClock (mCC) app).
