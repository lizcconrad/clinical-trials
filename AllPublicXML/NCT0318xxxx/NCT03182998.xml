  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well decision aids work in improving knowledge in
      patients with prostate cancer. Decision aids may improve patients' knowledge of their
      condition and options for treatment, and may also help when talking with their doctor.

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A mixed effects regression model (also known as random effects model or multi-level model) will be utilized to examine the effects of the during-consultation Prostate Choice and the pre-consultation Knowing Your Options decision aids. Specifically, this model will contain a fixed intercept, a fixed effect for having received Prostate Choice, a fixed effect for having received Knowing Your Options. Baseline patient-level characteristics including race, ethnicity, severity of disease and site-level characteristics may be incorporated in this model if deemed appropriate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional quality as measured by Decisional Conflict Scale Decisional Regret</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be compared across DA types using linear mixed models. In particular, this model will include fixed effects for Prostate Choice and Knowing Your Options and a random, site-specific intercept to allow for subjects within the same site to be correlated. Will explore whether the overall effects of interventions on patient knowledge, quality of life, and treatment utilization differ by racial/ethnic subgroups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life assessed by questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be converted into continuous summary scores using standard algorithms. Will be compared across DA types using linear mixed models. In particular, this model will include fixed effects for Prostate Choice and Knowing Your Options and a random, site-specific intercept to allow for subjects within the same site to be correlated. Will explore whether the overall effects of interventions on patient knowledge, quality of life, and treatment utilization differ by racial/ethnic subgroups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Utilization as determined by chart review</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be categorized by the type of treatment the patient received. Will be compared across DA types using linear mixed models. In particular, this model will include fixed effects for Prostate Choice and Knowing Your Options and a random, site-specific intercept to allow for subjects within the same site to be correlated. Will explore whether the overall effects of interventions on patient knowledge, quality of life, and treatment utilization differ by racial/ethnic subgroups.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have prostate biopsy within 4 months prior to registration showing newly
             diagnosed prostate cancer, stage T1-3N0M0; in addition, patients must have: Gleason
             score 6-10

          -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &lt; 50 ng/mL

          -  Patients who have had a history of non-cutaneous malignancy in the previous 5 years
             are not eligible; exception: patients with history of non-melanoma skin cancer are
             eligible

          -  Scheduled prostate cancer consultation to be the first consultation after diagnosis
             (i.e. not a second-opinion or a consultation following previous discussions of
             treatment options)

          -  Patients may not be concurrently enrolled to another clinical trial for the treatment
             of cancer; co-enrollment to biospecimen studies is allowed

          -  Patients with impaired decision-making capacity (such as with a diagnosis of dementia
             or memory loss) are not eligible for this study

          -  Patients must be able to read and comprehend English; non-English-speaking patients
             may participate so long as an interpreter (e.g., family member, clinic staff, etc.) is
             present for consent, for the decision aid administration, and gathering of baseline
             and follow-up measures
