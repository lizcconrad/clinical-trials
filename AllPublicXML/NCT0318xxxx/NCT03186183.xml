  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GPS is a sexual health promotion and HIV prevention peer-delivered counselling program. The
      GPS program has 4 parts: information provision about HIV and sexually transmitted infections,
      motivational interviewing counselling, sexual health behavioural skills building, and linkage
      to care. The adaptation grant has three goals: 1) to establish a multi-region and
      multi-sectoral team that can deliver the revised program across a variety of settings, 2) to
      learn how best to deliver this program as individual counselling program and also how to
      adapt this program for HIV-negative MSM, and 3) to pilot the individual program in 5 settings
      across Ontario and British Columbia. The research team will evaluate the pilot adaptation
      through mixed methods, employing a quantitative questionnaire and one-on-one semi-structured
      interviews.

    <description>The individual GPS motivational interviewing counseling program has 4-6 sessions.
Week 1: information on sexually transmitted infections and HIV disclosure laws is reviewed. Participants are introduced to the sex diary, stress exercise, and stages of change model.
Week 2: a decisional balance exercise about the participant's current sexual behavior is completed and a behavioral goal is chosen.
Week 3: participants explore their greatest fears and hopes about the goal, and the importance of and their confidence in achieving it.
Week 4: the facilitator and participant identify triggers, automatic thoughts, counters, strategies, supports, and rewards pertaining to the pursuit of the goal and role play the new goal.
1-2 supplemental sessions may be added as needed.</description>

    <description>GPS is a sexual health promotion and HIV prevention program. It has 4 components: provision of information on HIV and sexually transmitted infections, motivational interviewing counselling, sexual health behavioural skills building, and linkage to care in the local community (e.g., referrals to medical, social service, social, mental health, and substance use programs). Among HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) GPS is associated with positive health outcomes including decreased likelihood of condomless anal sex (CAS), particularly CAS with serodiscordant partners. GPS is also associated with decreased fear of being rejected for insisting on condom use and increased condom use self-efficacy.</description>
