  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to determine whether adding a sleep extension and sleep hygiene
      intervention to an existing lifestyle improvement program improves its efficacy for weight
      loss in those at risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Half of the participants will
      receive the Centers for Disease Control's standard PreventT2 program and half of the
      participants will receive the same program with an additional sleep intervention.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to determine whether the efficacy of an existing lifestyle
      improvement program can be increased by adding a sleep extension and sleep hygiene
      intervention. Improved sleep can improve weight loss through two possible routes: lessening
      fatigue may potentiate physical activity (PA), and decreasing appetite may potentiate diet
      improvements. A sample of 24-30 women will be assigned to either the Centers for Disease
      Control's (CDC's) standard PreventT2 program or the same program with an additional
      integrated sleep intervention. Both programs will involve 8 group sessions administered over
      3 months, and all women will be followed for a total of 6 months. The primary outcome is
      weight loss, and secondary outcomes include sleep quality and duration, physical activity,
      caloric intake, and physiological indicators of cardiovascular and diabetes risk (HbA1c,
      HOMA-IR, lipids, blood pressure). The combined program has the potential to significantly
      improve weight loss in those at risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
