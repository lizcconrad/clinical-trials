  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a telemedicine follow-up visit at the NYU
      Langone Transplant Institute is a feasible and acceptable alternative to a traditional
      in-center follow-up visit.

      A six-month prospective randomized-controlled clinical pilot study to evaluate a new
      intervention for the transplant program: telemedicine (TM) visits. Researchers will target
      patients on the transplant waiting list who are currently undergoing dialysis. Currently,
      there are 234 patients on the transplant waiting list who receiving care at dialysis centers
      in the New York City area. Researchers will select the 10 dialysis centers having the highest
      number of patients on the transplant list in order to yield a target sample of 45.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 groups: (1) usual care (UC) which is the
      routine 6-month follow up appointment at the NYULMC transplant center or (2) TM visit
      conducted at the patient's dialysis unit as a replacement to usual 6 month routine f/u visit.
      Patients will be followed for 4 months post randomization to determine the number of days
      that elapse between randomization and routine transplant evaluation. As new clinic
      appointments are currently experiencing 80-day wait, a 4-month follow-up should be more than
      adequate to evaluate this primary outcome.

      The intervention will be evaluated primarily in terms of efficiency, and secondarily in terms
      of patient/physician experiences, changes in waiting list status, and referral for living
      donation.

    <measure>Missed visits</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Using the medical record, researchers will capture the frequency of no-shows, cancellations, and rescheduled visits. At the 4-month time point, researchers will interview patients to collect qualitative data regarding the reasons for missed or rescheduled appointments. They will also collect data regarding the frequency with which TM visits result in transplant coordinator requests for an additional in-person appointment in order to conduct a physical assessment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Researchers will estimate cost of UC and TM in terms of costs borne by the patient (transportation, childcare, missed employment time, missed leisure) using an investigator-developed instrument. They will estimate health care service delivery costs using standard accounting methods to estimate facility costs, wage and fringe rates for staff involved in care (including receptionist, nurse, TM staff), and technology costs (including the iPads, data plans, maintenance and replacement costs).</description>
