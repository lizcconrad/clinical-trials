  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled intervention to reduce sexual risk for HIV
      among HIV-negative concordant and HIV discordant gay couples. There are three arms of the
      study: 1) the in-person experimental condition, PRIDE, 2) the online adaptation of the
      experimental condition, ePRIDE, and 3) the time- and attention-matched in-person control
      condition, Men's Health. Participants (N = 300 couples) will be randomized equally into one
      of the three study conditions and assessed via surveys at baseline and at 3-, 6- and 9-months
      after completion of the intervention sessions.

    <textblock>
      Participants (N = 300 couples) will be randomized equally into one of the three study
      conditions and assessed via surveys at baseline and at 3-, 6- and 9-months after completion
      of the intervention sessions. All participants will complete a baseline survey, administered
      a fluid (swab) OraQuick HIV test, administered a viral load (VL) or PrEP adherence dry blood
      spot test using the HemaSpot collection device they will be randomized to one of three
      intervention arms, and then follow-up surveys will measure short and long term impact of the
      intervention at 3, 6, and 9 months.

      They will first be provided with a brief overview of the study focusing on the goals of the
      study, randomization, participation details and timeline, and if they wish to proceed, will
      then be screened for eligibility. Our goal will be to screen and baseline cohorts of 30
      couples (10 couples for each arm of the intervention) within a 6-week window (recruitment
      will be on-going).

      Eligible couples will be scheduled to come into the study offices to complete a baseline
      survey. On arrival, couples will be informed in detail about the study and what their
      participation entails. Study staff will answer any outstanding questions, informed consent
      will be obtained, the participants will be given a fluid (swab) OraQuick rapid HIV test in a
      private CREGS office with HIV counseling-certified staff, then will give a DBS specimen for
      testing either viral load for HIV-positive participants or PrEP levels for HIV-negative
      participants. For consented and eligible participants, the baseline survey will then be
      administered and the baseline online survey will be administered on study computers.

      On completion of the baseline survey and testing, couples will be randomized to one of the
      three arms of the study (PRIDE, ePRIDE, or Men's Health). Couples will be randomized in
      blocks with the block size randomly permuted via a SAS computer program based on a
      pseudo-random number generator. Each arm of the intervention will begin on the same date and
      run for two weeks. Couples randomized to ePRIDE will be sent a link on the same day that
      PRIDE and Men's Health sessions are scheduled and will have two weeks to complete the
      program. Access to ePRIDE will be deactivated at the end of two weeks.

      Participants who have a positive test result for HIV during the baseline visit will be given
      their results by HIV counseling-certified staff and referred for free confirmatory testing at
      our nearby partner, Alliance Health Project clinic, where they will also receive clinical
      care and support services. If the newly HIV-positive person is in a relationship with a
      confirmed HIV-positive partner, they will be considered ineligible. If the partner is
      HIV-negative, they will be eligible to participate in the study.

      Short and long term impact of the intervention will be measured at 3-, 6- and 9-months post
      completion of the intervention. Follow-up surveys for all three arms will be administered
      online in-person at the downtown CREGS offices. Couples will be sent a link to the survey
      with a unique identification number and password and will have 7 days to complete each
      survey; reminders will be sent every two days contacted and scheduled to come in together to
      complete follow-up surveys on provided computers. Couples who take fail to come in and
      complete follow-ups longer than 7 days will be flagged so differential outcomes can be
      assessed as needed and their link to the survey will be disabled after 14 days.

    <measure>Composite Risk for HIV (CR-HIV)</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months (baseline, 3, 6, and 9 month followups)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome variable will be a binary indicator of any HIV-risk (no vs. yes) in the past three months at baseline, 3, months, 6 months, and 9 months--based on a composite of self-reported sexual risk behavior (defined as CAS with a discordant or unknown HIV status partner as well as HIV-positive partner's ART interruption (defined as missing all ART doses over a 4-day period in the past three months 70) and suppressed viral load. We will rely on self-reports of viral load because sexual risk behavior is based on one's perception of one's own or the partners' viral load. Regular viral load tests will be emphasized in PRIDE and ePRIDE to encourage participants to be proactive about their lab work. Baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months will be assessed for change over time past the date of the intervention.</description>

    <description>The in-person experimental condition, PRIDE, consists of in-person intervention activities that are scheduled over two Saturdays, back to back, approximately 3 hours each (6 hours total). This intervention consists of relationship-focused activities for couples to take part in together, focusing on relationship communication, dynamics, and sexual agreements.</description>

    <description>ePRIDE is an online adaptation of the experimental condition, PRIDE, and consists of online intervention activities that are scheduled to be completed over two weeks, lasting approximately 6 hours total. This intervention consists of relationship-focused activities for couples to take part in together, focusing on relationship communication, dynamics, and sexual agreements, and is designed for couples to take together sitting side by side.</description>

    <description>Men's Health is the active comparator group. Participants in this group go through in-person intervention days, scheduled on Saturdays back to back, but differ from the PRIDE arm because this intervention does not focus on relationship dynamics. Instead, these two Saturday intervention days focus on general men's health, including heart health, cancer, and STDs.</description>
