  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, prospective randomized study. Consecutive patients presenting with
      intertrochanteric hip fractures will be treated with tranexamic acid. Treatment will be
      initiated in the emergency department according to a previously studied protocol for trauma
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of TXA in orthopedic trauma patients is an area of current research interest. A 2010
      prospective randomized, controlled trial of perioperative TXA demonstrated reduction in
      transfusion requirements for intertrochanteric hip fractures treated with short,
      cephalomedullary nails. This was clinically, though not statistically, significant.
      Investigators recently conducted a randomized, controlled trial at this institution to
      evaluated the use of TXA in patients with femoral neck fractures treated with
      hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty and found clinically, albeit not statistically,
      significant reduction in transfusion requirement (accepted for publication). Perhaps
      tempering the effect seen with perioperative administration of TXA is the blood loss that
      occurs prior to surgery, the so-called &quot;hidden&quot; blood loss that can be as substantial as 1/3
      of total blood loss from a hip fracture. This raises the question whether administration of
      tranexamic acid at the time of initial presentation after fracture could improve the
      perioperative care of these patients by decreasing the proportion of patients requiring
      transfusion and decreasing total blood loss.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized into one of two study groups: TXA administration (treatment) or placebo (control). In order to ensure balance on the subject demographics between the two study groups, the subjects will be stratified on gender, age group (&lt;75 vs. ≥75) and body mass index (&lt;30 vs. ≥30). Within each stratum, subjects will be assigned to either the treatment group or control group using an electronic dynamic allocation program housed in a computer application developed by personnel in the Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Using dynamic allocation will ensure that the study subjects will remain balanced on the stratification factors and the treatment group assignment throughout the entire subject accrual phase. This system will be utilized by Central pharmacy personnel to generate the treatment group assignments. Medications will then be delivered from the Central Pharmacy to the emergency department in packaging that does not delineate whether it contains placebo or tranexamic acid. Thus, the patient, treating surgeon, emergency department physician, residents, hospitalist group, anesthesiologist, and data collectors will remain blinded to the treatment assignment.</masking_description>
