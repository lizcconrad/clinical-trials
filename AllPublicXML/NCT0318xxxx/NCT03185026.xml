  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the recent World Health Organization report, highlighting that every 40 seconds a
      person dies from suicide somewhere in the world, are to increase awareness on the public
      health significance of suicide and make suicide prevention a greater priority within the
      global public health agenda. Across age groups, less than half of individuals at elevated
      suicide risk interface with some form of mental health services. Several barriers to
      help-seeking have been identified (maladaptive coping, lack of perceived need, beliefs about
      treatment effectiveness, fear of hospitalization or mistrust of providers, stigma...), which
      are key targets in knowledge-based interventions on suicide. Psychoeducational programs have
      shown effectiveness in prevention relapse for several mental disorders such as schizophrenia,
      bipolar disorder or recurrent depressive disorder, improving treatment adherence and
      self-confidence in coping with symptoms of the disease. They are highly recommended for
      addressing adherence problems in patients with serious and persistent mental illness. Only
      one team has published a study protocol for a controlled trial assessing a 10 group sessions
      psychoeducational program for prevention in patients having a suicide history, in a one-year
      follow-up. Interestingly, diagnosis-mixed group psychoeducation have shown superiority than
      an unspecific intervention add-on routine care, on the suicide prevention and compliance for
      severe psychiatric disorders. Those psychoeducational-specific elements are namely the
      interactive transfer of illness and treatment-related knowledge and management/coping -
      cognitive/behavioral - strategies, as defined by the National Institute for Health and Care
      Excellence)-Guidelines (NICE). Notably, as several psychiatric diagnoses are associated with
      suicidal behavior (SB), coping strategies have to target processes that overlap among these
      psychiatric disease, as well as suicidal vulnerability. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT), a &quot;third wave&quot; behavioral therapy, targets experiential avoidance and psychological
      flexibility, at the core of psychiatric disorders. Interestingly, in patients with a history
      of suicidal depression, training in mindfulness can help to weaken suicidal thinking
      associated with depressive symptoms , and thus reduce an important vulnerability for relapse
      to suicidal depression. ACT would also increase intrinsic motivation for daily life action
      (i.e. reasons for living and acting). Then, the functional analysis (matrix) used in ACT
      seems to be an useful tool to help patient in decision making, a neuropsychological factor
      impaired in suicidal patients. Finally, acceptance and commitment group therapy has suggested
      effectiveness in reducing intensity and frequency of suicidal thoughts, through improvement
      in acceptance, in high risk suicidal patients. As compared with ACT, Dialectical behavior
      therapy (DBT) teaches added distress tolerance in view of survive the crisis. DBT is the most
      validated therapy for borderline personality disorder, the mental disorder the most
      associated with SB . Notably, group skills training is the most effective component in DBT
      for preventing suicidal behavior in borderline patients with high suicidal risk. Furthermore,
      interventions based on positive psychology have suggested efficacy in reducing depressive
      symptoms and suicidal ideation. Notably, in a recent pilot study, positive psychology
      exercises delivered to suicidal inpatients were feasible and associated with short-term gains
      improvement in optimism and hopelessness. Finally, as altered social link and sense of
      belonging have been widely involved in SB, relationship skills are an interesting positive
      psychology area for suicide prevention program.

      Psychoeducational program integrating knowledge as well the last innovating
      cognitive-behavioral coping strategies for SB is of major interest in suicide prevention.

      Investigators developed the first French program of suicide psychoeducation called &quot;PEPSUI&quot;.
      The aim of this innovating program is to teach patients the more recent knowledge about
      suicidal behaviour (SB) and effective treatments, through didactic and interactive sessions.
      Thus, the objective is to conduct the patients to become experts and actors of their disease,
      increasing adherence to treatment. Besides, the patients will experiment the last innovating
      psychological skills to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (including suicidal
      thoughts), distress tolerance skills and crisis strategies, and identify personal purpose in
      life and learn positive psychological skills in order to anchor with meaningful and pleasant
      components in life. Thus, this program will include skills from ACT, DBT and positive
      psychology. Finally, this primary care research is about a program which aim at improving
      accessibility to mental health services, care adherence and continuity for suicidal patients.

      The project aims at to compare the effectiveness on suicide re-attempt rate reduction at
      2-years follow-up of add-on PEPSUI psychoeducational program versus relaxation program in
      patients having attempted suicide in the past year

      Secondary, the project aims to compare between add-on psychoeducational program and
      relaxation:

        -  Interrupted or aborted suicide attempt rate reduction during the follow-up

        -  Severity and intensity of suicide ideation: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24
           months after the intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention
           point)

        -  Intensity of suicidal intent: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after
           the intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention point)

        -  Adherence to treatment and perceived utility of mental health services: at
           post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the intervention (and the evolution
           between pre and each post-intervention point)

        -  Levels of depression, anxiety, psychological pain and hopelessness: at post-treatment,
           and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the intervention (and the evolution between pre and
           each post-intervention point)

        -  Global functioning and quality of life: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24
           months after the intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention
           point)

        -  Subjective social support: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the
           intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention point)

        -  The need to emergency psychiatric consultation and psychiatric hospitalisation for
           suicidal ideation: at post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the
           intervention (and the evolution between pre and each post-intervention point)

        -  Acceptance, contact with present moment and meaning in life: at post-treatment, and at
           6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the intervention (and the evolution between pre and each
           post-intervention point)

        -  Satisfaction and adherence to the intervention: at post-treatment (likert scale).

           500 patients suffering from current suicidal behavior disorder (according to the
           Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) will be recruited, i.e.
           having attempted to suicide in the past year. Eligible patients will be randomized in
           one of the two arms: add-on psychoeducation or add-on relaxation (computer-generated
           randomisation in a 1 :1 ratio).

      Sociodemographic data, psychiatric diagnoses using Mini-International Neuropsychiatric
      Interview (M.I.N.I.) and pharmacological treatment will be also recorded.

      An independent researcher not involved in the study will perform the allocation. Each patient
      will be evaluated at baseline (pre intervention V1) and followed-up during 24 months after
      treatment completion, with 5 visits: post intervention (V2) 6 months (V3), 12 months (V4), 18
      months (V5) and 24 months (V6) after the intervention. Blind trained evaluators will assess
      patients. Patients will be told to avoid saying their group of allocation to the evaluator.
