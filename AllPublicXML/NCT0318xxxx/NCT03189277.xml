      This cross-sectional study, utilizing two sets of questionaire designed for patients and
      physicians respectively, aims at the epidemiology, the clinical features, and the current
      status of evaluation and management of lung cancer related pain in 20 participating hospitals
      in Northern China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung malignancies have become the most common cause of mortality among patients with cancer
      in China. A significant proportion of lung cancer patients suffer from cancer related pain,
      however few studies have reported the prevalence and clinical features of such pain,
      especially in China.

      This study is a cross-sectional survey in 20 hospitals in Northern China. We designed two
      separate series of questions to be answered by patients and cancer management professionals.
      In the patient questionaire, we collect information on the prevalence, location, intensity,
      impact on life of lung cancer related pain. Questions on how doctors evaluate and manage the
      pain are included in both the patients' and physicians' surveys. In the doctors'
      questionaire, we also assess current situation of cancer pain educational programs attended
      in medical schools and post graduation through related questions.

        This is a cross-sectional study of clinical features (including prevalence, intensity and
        impact on life) of cancer-related pain in all lung cancer patients visiting the 20
        participating hospitals in northern China on the designated day in July 2017. Meanwhile,
        all physicians receiving lung cancer patients in these hospitals are also enrolled to
        evaluate current management of lung cancer related pain in northern China. The patients
        will be identified in both outpatient clinics and inpatient wards of the involved
        hospitals. Informed consent will be obtained from participating patients and those who are
        not willing to provide pain information of interest and refuse to sign the ICF will be
        excluded.
