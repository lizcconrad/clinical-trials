      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two
      HIV-1 pDNA vaccines: p24CE1/2 pDNA and p55^gag pDNA administered with IL-12 pDNA adjuvant,
      given by intramuscular (IM) injection with electroporation (EP), in healthy, HIV-uninfected
      adults.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of two HIV-1 pDNA
      vaccines: p24CE1/2 pDNA and p55^gag pDNA administered with IL-12 pDNA adjuvant, given by
      intramuscular (IM) injection with electroporation (EP), in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: Group 1 Treatment, Group 1
      Control, Group 2 Treatment, or Group 2 Control.

      Participants in Group 1 Treatment will receive p24CE1/2 pDNA and IL-12 pDNA at Day 0 and
      Month 1, then p24CE1/2 pDNA plus p55^gag pDNA and IL-12 pDNA at Months 3 and 6. Participants
      in Group 1 Control will receive placebo (sodium chloride for injection) at Day 0 and Months
      1, 3, and 6.

      Participants in Group 2 Treatment will receive p55^gag pDNA and IL-12 pDNA at Day 0 and
      Months 1, 3, and 6. Participants in Group 2 Control will receive placebo (sodium chloride for
      injection) at Day 0 and Months 1, 3, and 6.

      Study visits will occur at Day 0, Week 2, and Months 1, 1.25, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.25, 6.5, 9,
      and 12. Visits may include physical examinations and clinical assessments, blood and urine
      collection, optional stool collection, HIV testing, risk reduction counseling, and
      interviews/questionnaires. At Month 18, study staff will contact participants for follow-up
      health monitoring.
