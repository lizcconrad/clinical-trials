  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fracture of the proximal femur is a common traumatic pathology in patients aged over 70
      years, associated with a mortality of 20 to 30% a year. The care is delayed emergency. During
      this wait, the occurrence of heel pressure ulcers is regularly found, despite wearing
      antiescarres slippers. Mobilization, source of pain, is also problematic.
