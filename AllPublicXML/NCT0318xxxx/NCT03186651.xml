  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, two-armed multi-center pre-market trial.
      Nighty-six (96) subjects will be recruited at sites in Sweden. Patients with diagnosed stress
      urinary incontinence (SUI), will be considered as potential study participants. After written
      informed consent has been acquired, a medical and surgical history, a physical examination
      (including pelvic examination), and a confirmation of the diagnosis of SUI will be performed,
      followed by a confirmation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The study subjects fulfilling
      all the eligibility criteria will thereafter be randomized 3:1 into either the TVS group or
      the standard of care (SoC) group.
