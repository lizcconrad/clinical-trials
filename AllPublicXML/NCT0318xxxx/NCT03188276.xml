  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is easy to chronic and can progress to cirrhosis and liver
      cancer. Direct-acting antiviral treatment can significantly improve the prognosis of the
      disease and the efficacy is seemingly not affected by a variety of viral factors. In
      addition, direct-acting antiviral agents therapy may affect the transformation of the immune
      cells and ameliorate the host immune status consequently. This study mainly investigated the
      relationship between Direct Acting Antiviral Treatment effect and the functional activity of
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and natural killer cells (NK cells) in Chronic
      Hepatitis C.

      32 treatment-naive CHC patients and 20 healthy controls were recruited. Patients were
      examined before DAAs therapy (0w) and at weeks 4 (4w) and weeks 12 (12w) and weeks24 (24w) of
      the therapy. The percent age of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and NK cells of the
      peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. The investigators discuss the relationship
      between direct acting antiviral treatment effect and myeloid-derived suppressor cells and NK
      cells activity in chronic hepatitis C.
