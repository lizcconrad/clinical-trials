  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite availability of treatments and published guidelines, subjects may have asthma that is
      inadequately controlled. GlaxoSmithKline is currently developing a once-daily 'closed' triple
      therapy of an Inhaled Corticosteroids/Long-Acting Beta-2-Agonists/Long-Acting Muscarinic
      Antagonist (ICS/LAMA/LABA) combination (Fluticasone Furoate/Umeclidinium Bromide/Vilanterol
      Trifenatate [FF/UMEC/VI]) in a single device, with the aim of providing a new treatment
      option for the management of asthma by improving lung function, health-related quality of
      life (HRQoL) and symptom control over established combination therapies. This study has 3
      study periods: Run-in, Treatment period and a Follow-up period. Eligible subjects who meet
      the pre-defined criteria at screening (Visit 1) will enter into a 2-week run-in period.
      Subjects will continue their pre-screening inhaled medications for asthma (ICS+LABA or
      ICS+LABA+LAMA) without any change in regimen/dosage until day before Visit 2. At Visit 2
      subjects will be allocated to either FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 or FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25
      micrograms (mcg) treatment depending on the asthma control status for 52 weeks. Switching
      medication from FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 to FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25 will be permitted in
      accordance with the control status of the subject assessed by Asthma Control Questionnaire
      (ACQ)-7 at Week 24 of the treatment period. A follow-up visit will be conducted for
      approximately 1 week. Subjects will be provided with salbutamol as a rescue medication
      throughout the study.

             tobacco smoke); post- salbutamol Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced
             vital capacity (FVC) ratio of &lt;0.70 and a post- salbutamol FEV1 of less than or equal
             to 70% of predicted normal values (diagnosis prior to Visit 1 acceptable);Onset of
             disease greater than or equal to 40 years of age.

          -  Concurrent respiratory disorders: Subjects with current evidence of pneumonia, active
             tuberculosis, lung cancer, significant bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis,
             pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung diseases or other active pulmonary diseases
             or abnormalities other than asthma.

          -  Risk Factors for Pneumonia: Immune suppression (e.g., HIV, lupus) or other risk
             factors for pneumonia (e.g., neurological disorders affecting control of the upper
             airway, such as Parkinson's disease, myasthenia gravis). Patients at potentially high
             risk (e.g., very low body mass index (BMI), severely malnourished, or very low FEV1)

             disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

          -  Clinically significant ECG abnormality: Evidence of a clinically significant
             abnormality in the 12-lead ECG performed during screening. The Investigator will
             determine the clinical significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the
             subject's medical history and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by
             participating in the trial. An abnormal and clinically significant finding is defined
             as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following:

                  or equal to 500 milliseconds (msec) in patients with QRS &lt;120 msec and QTcF
                  greater than or equal to 530 msec in patients with QRS greater than or equal to
                  120 msec.

          -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac disease: subjects with any of the following at

               -  Unstable or life threatening cardiac arrhythmia requiring intervention in the
                  last 3 months

               -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure

          -  Antimuscarinic effects: Subjects with a medical condition such as narrow-angle
             glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction should
             only be included if in the opinion of the Investigator the benefit outweighs the risk
             and that the condition would not contraindicate study participation.

          -  Cancer: Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5
             years. Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma
             and basal cell carcinoma of the skin would not be excluded based on the 5 year waiting
             period if the subject has been considered cured by treatment.

          -  Questionable validity of consent: Subjects with a history of psychiatric disease,
             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable to withhold their
             salbutamol for the 6-hour period required prior to spirometry testing at each study
             visit.

             of greater than equal to 10 pack years (e.g., greater than equal to 20 cigarettes/day
             for 10 years).

          -  Non-compliance: Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study
             procedures. Any infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit
             compliance for scheduled visits.

          -  Affiliation with Investigator site: Study Investigators, sub-Investigators, study
             coordinators, employees of a participating Investigator or study site, or immediate

             run-in period. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6 at screening and ACQ-7 at the end
             of the run-in period) will be used for the assessment of control status of asthma,
             i.e., 0.75 points shows controlled and &gt;0.75 shows not well controlled.

             the run-in period that led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's
             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Severe asthma exacerbation: Evidence of a severe exacerbation during screening or the
             run-in period, defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic
             corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or an
             in-patient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required
             systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Laboratory test abnormalities: Evidence of clinically significant abnormal laboratory
             tests during screening or the run-in period which are still abnormal upon repeat
