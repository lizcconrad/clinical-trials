    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe whether the transplantation of autologous stromal
      vascular fraction (SVF) in adipose tissue is safe and its effect on improving skin
      regeneration.

      This is a randomized controlled single blind clinal trial that designed to observe whether
      the transplantation of autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) in adipose tissue is safe
      and its effect on improving skin regeneration.

      The clinical trial will concentrate on the therapeutic effect of SVF after facial injection.
      After 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, a comprehensive examination of the facial
      skin was performed to assess the effect of the SVF. Skin texture, thickness and colour will
      be observed to evaluate the effect of SVF on skin regeneration

    <description>The adipose tissue(no less than 40ml) in abdomen will be harvested and digested at 37 °C for (45-60) min with (0.125-1.5)mg/ml collagenase . After filtration and centrifugation at the speed of (700-1500)g, mature adipocytes are separated from the cell pellet. The pellet then is treated with saline twice to remove cell fragment and rudimental collagenase . The harvested pellet is stromal vascular fraction (SVF) The SVF was resuspended in 1 ml saline and transplanted for 3 area including the forehead、palpebra inferior and crow's-feet.</description>
