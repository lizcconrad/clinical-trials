  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn about the safety and tolerance of autologous TSA-DC cell
      and evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the cell therapy compared to the patients' past
      standard regimen. 20 gastrointestinal solid tumors subjects failed from at least one systemic
      therapy will be enrolled into the trial and receive a succession of treatment of TSA-DC
      vaccine.

      20 gastrointestinal solid tumor subjects failed from at least one systemic therapy will be
      enrolled into the trial .Subjects will be given subcutaneous injection of 5.0x10^6-1.0x10^7
      TSA-DC on week 1, 3, 5, 11,17,23,35,47. Before the first cell infusion, the subjects should
      undergo a non-myeloablative chemotherapy regimen of Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 iv. Radiologic
      tumor assessment will be repeated every 8 weeks during treatment, until time of progression.
      Treatment will continue until disease progression, intolerance of toxic , withdrawal from the
      study, study completion, or study termination.
