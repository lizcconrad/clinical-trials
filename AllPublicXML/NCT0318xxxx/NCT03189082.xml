  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of the intradermal injection of
      botulinum toxin in lower face rejuvenation. The study will also compare this intervention
      with the &quot;Nefertiti Lift&quot; intramuscular injection technique.

    <textblock>
      The abobotulinumtoxinA will be used for the intervention. The abobotulinumtoxinA will be
      prepared by adding 2.5 cc of normal saline to a 500-unit DysportÂ© (Ipsen Ltd, Berks, UK)
      vial. Further dilution to the appropriate Microbotox concentration will be done in the
      syringe itself. Each 1mL syringe of Microbotox solution will contain 20-28 units of
      onabotulinumtoxinA per mL of solution.

      Preinjection frontal, oblique and lateral patient pictures will be taken (at rest and with
      contraction)

      Injection points:

      A series of 100-150 intradermal microdroplets injection points 1 cm apart will be delivered
      in the lower face. The area to be injected is bounded by a line 3 fingerbreadths above and
      parallel to the lower border of the mandible, 1 fingerbreadth posterior to the depressor
      anguli oris, and all the way down over the cervicomental angle and anterior neck to the upper
      border of the clavicle, and posteriorly to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid.

      In the average patient, 2 syringes of 28 units per mL of microbotox will be used to cover the
      entire area.

      In heavier necks, 3 syringes of 28 units per mL will be used. In thinner necks, 2 syringes of
      20 units per mL will be used.

      Follow up will be done at 15 days for post injection pictures. A total of 15 patients will be
      recruited
