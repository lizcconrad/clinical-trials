  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The novel introduction of various chest wall blocks such as the Pecs I and II/modified Pecs
      blocks as well as the Serratus Anterior Plane Block have extended the application of
      perioperative regional anesthesia to provide analgesia for breast surgery. However, to our
      knowledge, there are no large studies that truly delineate the optimal injection site for the
      Serratus Anterior Plane Block.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analgesia for reconstructive breast surgery can be a challenging undertaking; these women
      have often been through painful mastectomy procedures coupled with the mental and physical
      discomfort of chemotherapy and its attendant side effects. Additionally, the surgery itself
      can provoke significant pain; often requiring extensive dissection of soft tissue and muscle
      to provide flap coverage as well the real discomfort of tissue expansion. The literature has
      described 2 possible injection sites for the Serratus Anterior Block, however, no study has
      defined optimal location based on analgesia and duration. Patients will be randomized to
      receive a &quot;deep&quot; Serratus Anterior Block (DSAB) where local anesthetic is deposited deep to
      the serratus or a &quot;superficial&quot; Serratus Anterior Block (SSAB) where the local anesthetic is
      placed between serratus and latissimus dorsi. The investigator will then evaluate the
      difference based on pain scores, opiate consumption, length of hospital stay, as well as
      nausea and vomiting.
