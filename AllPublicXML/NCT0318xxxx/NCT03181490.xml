  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current state-of-the-art lung cancer early screening utilizes low-dose CT scan to identify
      lung nodules smaller than 3 cm in diameter. However, it's still a clinical challenge to
      differentiate between malignant and benign nodules.

      In previous studies, we had taken the approach of methylation profiling by high throughput
      bisulfite DNA sequencing in tissue samples to identify specific methylation signatures. We
      had learned methylation patterns that differentiate malignant vs. benign lesions from tissue
      samples by in-depth data mining, and then used pattern matching to classify plasma samples.

      In this study, we are going to validate the efficacy of ctDNA methylation test for diagnosing
      early lung cancer by comparing results of the pre-surgery ctDNA methylation test with the
      post-surgery pathology.
