        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of episodic or chronic migraine with or without aura meeting the diagnostic
             criteria listed in ICHD-III (International Classification of Headache Disorders) beta
             (2013) section 1, migraine, with the exception of ''complicated migraine'' (i.e.,
             hemiplegic migraine, basilar-type migraine, ophthalmoplegic migraine, migrainous
             infarction).

          -  Capable of cooperating with the study protocol and to sign an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having received Botox treatment in the head region in the prior 4 months.

          -  Patients having received supraorbital or occipital nerve blocks in the prior 4 months.

          -  History of Medication Overuse Headache.

          -  Patients using opioid medication.

          -  Allodynia: intolerance to supraorbital and/or occipital neurostimulation (allodynia)
             that makes the treatment not applicable (the patients will be excluded if they are
             unable to tolerate the first 3 minutes of neurostimulation).

          -  Implanted metal or electrical devices in the head (not including dental implants).

          -  Patient having had a previous experience with the Relievion™ device.

          -  Patients who have concomitant epilepsy.

          -  History of neurosurgical interventions.

          -  Patients with implanted neurostimulators, surgical clips (above the shoulder line) or
             any medical pumps.

          -  History of drug abuse or alcoholism.

          -  Participation in current clinical study or participated in a clinical study within 3
             months prior to this study.

          -  Skin lesion or inflammation at the region of the stimulating electrodes.

          -  Personality or somatoform disorder.

          -  Pregnancy or Lactation.

          -  Women of reproductive age not using efficient contraceptive method.

          -  History of cerebrovascular event.

          -  Subjects with recent brain or facial trauma (occurred less than 3 months prior to this
             study).
