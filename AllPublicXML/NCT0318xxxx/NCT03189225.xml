  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate accuracy between product platforms in the hands of users, comparing
      capillary to venous response vs YSI reference instrument as well as the local hospital
      analyser.

      This study will gather data to:

        -  Determine if extreme bias can be observed between 3 candidate products for user
           accuracy.

        -  Assess the offset between venous blood samples versus capillary blood samples.

        -  Determine if there are measurable donor factors which influence the product bias.

        -  Assess any offset between YSI 2300 reference instruments and hospital laboratory
           analyser and impact on bias difference between BGM product types.
