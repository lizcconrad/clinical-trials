        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply, with the
             requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up
             visits).

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to performing any study
             specific procedure.

          -  Healthy male or female subjects as established by medical history and history-directed
             physical examination before entering into the study.

          -  Having completed the vaccination in study MenACWY-TT-036 (109069) as per protocol.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

          -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, hysterectomy, bilateral
             ovariectomy or post-menopause.

        Please refer to the GLOSSARY OF TERMS for the definitions of menarche and post-menopause.

          -  Male subjects able to father children and female subjects of childbearing potential
             (including females who have had tubal ligation) and at risk for pregnancy may be
             enrolled in the study, if the subject:

          -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

          -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination (for females only), and

          -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period and
             for 2 months after completion of the vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use
             during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the vaccine dose. For
             corticosteroids, this will be 10 mg/day prednisone, or equivalent. Inhaled, topical,
             and intra-articular steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within the period
             starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after the study vaccine dose, with the
             exception of a licensed inactivated influenza vaccine which can be administered at any
             time during the study according to the local recommendations.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the study vaccination or planned administration during the booster
             vaccination phase of the study (i.e. between Visit 1 and Visit 2).

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  Previous vaccination with meningococcal vaccine except the meningococcal vaccination
             received in the MenACWY-TT-036 study.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition (congenital
             or secondary), including human immunodeficiency virus infection, based on medical
             history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine, and history of serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) following the
             administration of vaccine(s).

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures, including GBS. History of a simple,
             single febrile seizure is permitted.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccination.

          -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥
             38.0°C for rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in this study
             will be oral.

          -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory
             infection) without fever may be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Subjects who are investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct
             of the study and their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the
