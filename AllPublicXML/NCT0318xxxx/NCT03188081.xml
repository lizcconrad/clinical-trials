    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether an Educational Supported
      Program (ESP), including tight control procedures implemented through patient home care, has
      positive impact in terms of better adherence to the therapy with abatacept SC at 12 months
      after treatment start (1st injection). In the scope of this objective the adherence is
      measured by the Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ).
