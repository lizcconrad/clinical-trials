  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies highlight the participation of gut microbes in the pathogenesis of both
      atherosclerotic heart disease and its adverse thrombotic events. Trimethylamine N-oxide
      (TMAO) is a plasma metabolite shown to be formed through a metaorganismal pathway involving
      nutrient precursors abundant in a Western diet and the sequential action of gut microbiota.
      Numerous studies reveal an association between systemic TMAO levels and cardiovascular risks
      in a variety of stable cohorts. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      traditional Chinese Medicine formular (Compound pseudo-ginseng granules ) on the level of
      TMAO for the patient with acute coronary syndrome(ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention. 80 patients with ACS would be randomly allocated into interventional group(IG)
      and control group(CG). The patients in the IG would be administered by oral Compound
      pseudo-ginseng granules (twice per day ) for 90 days and those in the CG would receive the
      placebo twice per day during the same period. All of subjects would be administered with
      standard therapy in accordance with AHA/ACC guideline for ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction(STEMI) and Non ST-elevation myocardial infarction(NSTEMI).The primary endpoint is
      the plasma level of TMAO at 90-day follow-up. The second endpoint is the level of lipid,
      score of The Seattle Angina, fecal DNA extraction and pyrosequencing.
