      Evaluation of the effect of nivolumab and daratumumab with or without
      lenalidomide-dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myeloma patients who develop bortezomib and lenalidomide-resistant disease have a very poor
      survival of only a median of 9 months, indicating that new agents are urgently needed. Recent
      studies have shown that daratumumab as a single agent is effective and well tolerated in
      these heavily pretreated MM patients. However, approximately 60% of patients do not achieve a
      partial response, and ultimately all patients will develop progressive disease during
      daratumumab therapy. In less pretreated patients daratumumab-based combinations (daratumumab
      plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone or daratumumab plus bortezomib-dexamethasone) were very
      effective and well tolerated. Therefore, in this study, the investigators will combine
      daratumumab with other agents to improve survival of heavily pretreated MM patients.

      The PD-1 blocker nivolumab, as single agent, does not induce objective responses but induces
      stable disease in approximately 67% of relapsed/refractory MM patients. We have recently
      shown that daratumumab treatment results in increased T cell frequencies by eliminating
      CD38-positive immune suppressor cells, which probably contributes to the durable responses
      observed with daratumumab.

      Importantly, lenalidomide markedly improves the activity of monoclonal antibodies such as
      CD38-targeting antibodies and PD-1 blocking antibodies even in the setting of
      lenalidomide-refractory disease via its immunostimulating activities.

      In this study, the investigators will combine two or three immune modulating agents with
      different mechanisms of action in order to improve the outcome of relapsed/refractory MM
      patients.

      The investigators will evaluate in Part A, nivolumab combined with daratumumab with or
      without lenalidomide-dexamethasone (total 40 patients). Based on efficacy and tolerability,
      the investigators will treat in Part B 20 additional patients with nivolumab combined with
      daratumumab either with or without lenalidomide-dexamethasone based on tolerability and
      efficacy data obtained in Part A.
