      To assess the efficacy of Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) reduction and 24-hour blood
      pressure control of Valsartan 80mg or Nebivolol/Valsartan 5/80mg once daily as replacement
      therapy for currently treated or untreated hypertensive patients with LVH not at BP goal.

    <textblock>
      The potential benefits of blood pressure reduction have been demonstrated in numerous large
      clinical trials. The most recent is the SPRINT Trial demonstrating that lower blood pressure
      goals can be achieved and are associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and
      mortality. The latest NHANES 2012 data reveal that less than 50% of patients that are aware
      of the elevated blood pressure and are being treated achieve blood pressure control.
      Treatment of hypertension in many patients (&gt;70%) require treatment with more than one drug,
      increasing the likelihood of non-compliance and not achieving blood pressure goal. JNC 8
      recommends the utilizing of combination therapy both for Stage I and Stage II Hypertensive
      patients.

      Objectives of the study to assess the efficacy of LVH reduction and 24-hour blood pressure
      control of Valsartan 80mg and Nebivolol/Valsartan 5/80mg, once daily for the treatment of
      currently treated hypertensive patients with LVH.

      The study will evaluate LVH reduction at 4 and 8 weeks as well as change from baseline in
      mean 24 hour ABPM SBP after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment with valsartan 80mg or
      nebivolol/valsartan 5/80mg
