      Eligible subjects will wear 4 consecutive external monitoring devices for a total of 28 days
      of monitoring.

      Eligible subjects will be monitored with a SEEQ device. The SEEQ device is a patch-like
      device that is worn externally on the chest and continuously monitors heart rhythm. Each
      device is worn for seven days and replaced with additional devices for a total of 28 days of
      monitoring. Subjects will return the SEEQ equipment at the end of the monitoring period.
      Subjects will be contacted by telephone or seen at the clinic approximately 60 days from the
      first day of monitoring. Information will be gathered about medications and any cardiac
      interventions the subject may have had.

      Subjects will again be contacted by telephone or seen in the clinic approximately 1 year from
      study start. Information will be gathered about general health, changes in medications, and
      cardiac interventions or events. Cardiac testing results will be reviewed.

    <description>We aim to determine if longer term monitoring (28 days) with the Medtronic SEEQ MCT device identifies a greater burden of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) compared to conventional shorter monitoring periods (48 hours), and thereby potentially identify a subset of HCM patients who may be at higher risk of SD and benefit from a primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) .</description>
