      Trial Design This is an open label, single-arm, phase IB/II trial to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and anti-tumor efficacy of epacadostat (INCB024360) in combination with
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) plus azacitidine in patients with chemo-refractory MSS mCRC.

      The phase 1B portion of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and RP2D of
      epacadostat (INCB024360) in combination with pembrolizumab plus azacitidine in subjects with
      chemo-refractory MSS mCRC without any further standard treatment options.

      The phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat
      (INCB024360) in combination with pembrolizumab plus azacitidine in subjects with
      chemo-refractory MSS mCRC without any further standard treatment options.

      In both phase IB and phase 2 portions, patients will receive the combination of azacitidine,
      pembrolizumab and epacadostat (INCB024360) for the first 18 cycles (Cycles 1-18). Beginning
      with Cycle 19 through Cycle 35, patients will receive the combination of pembrolizumab and
      epacadostat (INCB024360).

      Phase lB Portion:

        -  The phase 1 portion of this study will be a standard &quot;3+3&quot; design.

        -  Pembrolizumab will be administered at 200 mg intravenously (IV) on day 1 of each cycle,
           every 21 days.

        -  Azacitidine will be administered at 100 mg subcutaneous injection (SQ) daily on days 1-5
           of each cycle, every 21 days

        -  Three dose levels of epacadostat (INCB024360) will be explored: dose levels -1, 1 and 2.

        -  The dose level 1 will be the starting dose level.

        -  If the dose level 2 is tolerable without dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose level
           2 will be considered the RP2D, and the phase II part will be initiated.

        -  DLT will be monitored during the first 21 days (cycles 1) and will be used for purposes
           of dose escalation and determination of RP2D.

        -  Definition of DLT:

      Hematologic Toxicities:

        -  Any Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia lasting &gt; 7 days

        -  Any Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with severe bleeding

      Nonhematologic Toxicities:

      o Any Grade 4 toxicity EXCLUDING: Grade 4 abnormal laboratory values with a clear alternative
      explanation or transient (≤ 72 hours), or without associated clinically significant signs or
      symptoms based on investigator determination.

        -  Any Grade 3 or 4 AST, ALT, or total bilirubin elevation

        -  Any other Grade 3 toxicity EXCLUDING:

             -  Nausea/vomiting controlled by medical intervention within 72 hours

             -  Grade 3 rash in the absence of desquamation, no mucosal involvement, does not
                require systemic steroids, and resolves to Grade 1 within 14 days.

             -  Grade 3 abnormal laboratory values with a clear alternative explanation or
                transient (≤ 72 hours), or without associated clinically significant signs or
                symptoms based on investigator determination.

      Phase ll portion:

      The phase 2 portion of this study is a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm phase II study.
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) using
      RECIST1.1.

      Study Procedure

        -  One cycle of therapy is defined as 21 days.

        -  Subjects may continue treatment up to 35 cycles of the study therapy (the combination of
           azacitidine, pembrolizumab and epacadostat [INCB024360] for the first 18 cycles [Cycle 1
           to Cycle 18], and the combination of pembrolizumab and epacadostat (INCB024360) for the
           remaining 17 cycles [Cycle 19 to Cycle 35]) until evidence of progression of disease
           (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed during the first 21 days (cycle 1).

        -  Tumor response will be determined by radiologic measurements by CT and by using RECIST.
           Assessment of tumor response will be performed every 3 cycles (approximately 9 weeks).

        -  All patients will be evaluated and graded for adverse events according to the NCI Common
           Terminology for Adverse Events, version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE).

      Study Treatment

        -  Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered intravenously over 30 minutes on days 1 of
           each cycle every 21 days.

        -  Azacitidine 100 mg will be administered as subcutaneous injection on days 1-5 of each
           cycle every 21 days.

        -  Epacadostat (INCB024360) will be administered orally twice a day continuously on days
           1-21 of each cycle every 21 days. Two dose levels of epacadostat (INCB024360) will be
           explored: 100 mg BID and 300 mg BID.
