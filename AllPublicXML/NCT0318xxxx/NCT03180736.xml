      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the addition of daratumumab to
      pomalidomide and dexamethasone in terms of progression-free survival in subjects with
      relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 3, randomized, open-label study comparing daratumumab,
      pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (DaraPomDex) with pomalidomide and low-dose
      dexamethasone (PomDex) in subjects with relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma who have
      received at least 1 prior treatment regimen with both lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor
      and have demonstrated disease progression. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either DaraPomDex or PomDex. The original design of this study was to treat subjects
      with daratumumab for intravenous (IV) infusion (Dara IV); however, as of Amendment 1, all new
      subjects will be dosed subcutaneously with daratumumab co-formulated with recombinant human
      hyaluronidase rHuPH20 (hereafter referred to as Dara SC). Subjects who already began
      treatment with Dara IV (ie, prior to Amendment 1) will have the option to switch to Dara SC
      on Day 1 of any cycle starting with Cycle 3 or later for the remainder of their participation
      in the study, and they will be counted toward the total of 302 subjects. Subjects will
      receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Drug administration and
      follow-up visits will occur more frequently for early cycles (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly).
      Disease evaluations will occur every cycle and consist mainly of measurements of myeloma
      proteins. Subject safety will be assessed throughout the study. The primary endpoint will be
      progression-free survival (PFS). Study end is anticipated at approximately 5 years after the
      last subject is randomized.

                  potential if they have been in natural menopause for at least 24 consecutive

                  methods of contraception for 4 weeks before the start of study treatment, for the
