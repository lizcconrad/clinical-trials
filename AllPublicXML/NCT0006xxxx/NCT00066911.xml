  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some voice disorders are caused by uncontrolled muscle actions that affect the larynx or
      voice box.

      The purpose of this study is to understand 1) how the brain controls voice production; 2) how
      changes in sensation within the voice box affect brain control of the voice box; 3) how the
      central nervous system is affected when people have motor or sensory abnormalities that
      affect the voice box; and 4) whether patients with voice disorders differ from people without
      voice disorders in the way the brain controls the voice box. By better understanding these
      concepts, researchers hope to develop improved treatments for patients with voice disorders.

      Forty-five healthy adult volunteers and 90 patients with voice disorders will participate in
      this study. Participants must be between the ages of 20 and 70. The study will involve two
      visits to the Clinical Center. During the first visit, participants will undergo a medical
      history and physical exam. During the second visit, investigators will perform the following
      procedures on study participants: 1) look at the voice box with a nasolaryngoscope, a fine
      tube through the nose; 2) use MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] to record brain activity while
      participants use their voice to speak; 3) changing sensation in the voice box by dripping a
      topical anesthetic onto the vocal folds; and 4) using MRI to again record brain activity
      during speech immediately after applying the topical anesthetic.

      Participants will receive up to $700 in compensation for their involvement in this study.

      The neural organization of laryngeal motor and somatosensory function will be investigated in
      adults with idiopathic voice disorders using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Brain
      activation will be compared in normal volunteers and patients with spasmodic dysphonia (SD),
      muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) and vocal tremor. While each voice disorder is characterized
      by strained vocalization, the disorders are distinguished by other differences in voice
      symptoms. Accordingly, the brain correlates of vocalization in these disorders may both
      differ from each other and that of normal vocal function. Because sensory feedback has been
      identified as a factor in SD, the role of afferent input in vocalization will be investigated
      by comparing brain activation before and after topical anesthesia of the laryngeal mucosa.
      The afferent blockade is expected to significantly suppress dysphonic symptoms in SD patients
      for the duration of the block. The change in symptomatology may be associated with a
      temporary but significant change in central sensorimotor patterns in these patients. The
      block is not expected to alter MTD, vocal tremor or normal vocal function. The brain
      activation changes that accompany symptom relief in SD patients will determine alterations in
      central neural control that have a role in symptom generation in SD. Identifying these
      differences in central sensorimotor control between the disorders will provide insight into
      their differences in pathophysiology.

      Objectives:

        1. To determine if emotional vocalization and linguistic vocalization involve different
           cortical and sub-cortical functional networks in normal adults.

        2. To determine if only the brain activation network active for linguistic vocalization
           network differs between normal controls and dysphonia patients during equivalent voice
           production effort.

        3. To determine if patients with dysphonia differ from controls during the performance of
           non-vocal laryngeal gestures when patients are asymptomatic.

        4. To determine if a reduction in sensation during topical anesthesia alters linguistic
           vocalization in dysphonia but not in controls.

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The inclusion criteria for normal volunteers are normal vocal function and average health
        as determined by the staff otolaryngologist. Normal vocal function refers to normal voice
        quality, a negative history for voice or laryngeal disorders. Persons with significant
        pulmonary, neurological and psychiatric function will not be recruited. The primary
        inclusion criteria for the voice disordered groups are a current diagnosis of spasmodic
        dysphonia (abductor or adductor type), muscular tension dysphonia or voice tremor. These
        persons will not have pulmonary, neurological or psychiatric disorders or exclusion
        criteria.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - for Patients with Spasmodic Dysphonia:

        Intermittent strained hoarseness, uncontrolled voice breaks or changes in pitch are present
        during vowels, liquids (r &amp; l) and semi-vowels (w &amp; y), during speech for adductor SD or
        prolonged voiceless consonants producing breathy breaks for abductor SD;

        Less prominent symptoms during whisper, singing or falsetto,

        Normal voice and vocal fold movement for protective and emotional laryngeal function, such
        as cough, laugh or cry;

        A diagnosis of adductor or adductor spasmodic dysphonia based on voice testing and
        fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy by a board certified otolaryngologist and Speech-Language
        Pathologist during the initial interview;

        Exclusion of other laryngeal pathologies based on a fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopic
        examination conducted during the initial interview by the staff otolaryngologist.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - for Patients with Muscular Tension Dysphonia:

        Increased phonatory muscle tension in the paralaryngeal and suprahyoid muscles on
        palpation;

        A consistent hypertonic laryngeal posture for phonation, such as either an
        anterior-posterior squeeze (pin-hole posture) or ventricular hyper adduction and an absence
        of SD or vocal tremor as determined by a Speech-Language Pathologist and the staff
        otolaryngologist;

        Exclusion of other laryngeal pathologies based on a fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopic
        examination conducted during the initial interview by the staff otolaryngologist.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA - for Patients with Vocal Tremor:

        Vocal tremor during vocalization that primarily involves laryngeal structures;

        Exclusion of other laryngeal pathologies based on a fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopic
        examination conducted during the initial interview by the staff otolaryngologist.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any individual with a history of one or more of the following contraindications will be
        excluded from the study:

        Airway obstruction, smoking or tobacco use;

        Pulmonary, or neurological disease;

        Examples of psychiatric disorders to be excluded are: somatoform disorders, conversion
        disorders, major depression, schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder. A history of a previous
        episode of minor reactive depression would not exclude a person from participation;

        Speech or hearing problems as determined by medical history and examination by the
        otolaryngologist. A 30 dB HL hearing screening between 500 and 3000 Hz will be conducted if

        suggesting either paralysis or paresis, joint abnormality or neoplasm as determined by
        videolaryngoscopic examination by the staff otolaryngologist;

        Complete aphonia, a history of airway obstruction or structural abnormalities affect the
        larynx such as vocal fold nodules, polyps, carcinoma, cysts, contact ulcers, chronic
        laryngitis as determined by videolaryngoscopic examination by the staff otolaryngologist;

        Individuals having any condition that would present unnecessary risk to them, e.g.,
        claustrophobia.

        Specific contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging include: i) Any implant or
        surgical clip - implanted neural stimulator, implanted cardiac pacemaker or
