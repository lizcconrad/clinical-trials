  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether donor stem cells administered via hepatic
      artery infusion can produce liver cells in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction post stem
      cell transplantation (SCT) and the safety of this procedure. The secondary objective is to
      improve liver function and improve survival.

      Participants in this study have received stem cell transplantation. As a result of this
      procedure, participants have developed severe liver dysfunction. Researchers have recently
      discovered that cells circulating in the blood and bone marrow are capable of forming liver
      cells. Before taking part in this study, women able to have children must have a negative
      blood pregnancy test.

      Participants in this study will have donor's cells infused directly into their liver through
      a catheter that will be inserted through the groin. This will be done after liver disease has
      been diagnosed by liver biopsy. The catheter will stay in the groin for no more than 3 days.
      During that time, participants will be exposed to repeated x-ray exams to ensure that the
      catheter stays in place.

      During the time that the catheter is in place, the infusion will be repeated as long as
      donor's cells are available. Participants will receive different drugs by vein to decrease
      the risk of transfusion reaction. After completing donor cell infusion, the catheter will be
      removed.

      After participants are released from the hospital, they will have periodic evaluation of
      liver size. About 1 teaspoon of blood will be drawn for standard blood tests to evaluate
      liver function. Around Days 28 and 90, participants will have liver biopsy.

      This is an investigational study. A total of 10 patients will take part in this study. All
      will be enrolled at UTMDACC.
