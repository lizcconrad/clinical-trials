      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes
      necessary for tumor cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating
      patients with recurrent Ewing's family of tumors or desmoplastic small round-cell tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the effectiveness of imatinib mesylate in patients with recurrent Ewing's
           family of tumors or desmoplastic small round-cell tumor.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of disease-free and overall survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
