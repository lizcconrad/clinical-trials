      BACKGROUND:

      Throughout their lifetime, men are at higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) than women,
      however, after menopause this difference is attenuated. This observation suggests that
      endogenous sex hormones could be associated with CHD risk. There is some evidence indicating
      that the effect of sex hormones on CHD risk could be mediated, in part, by alterations in
      lipid levels or other CHD risk factors. However, other evidence supports an independent
      relationship of circulating hormone levels with CHD risk.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study, which is ancillary to MESA, will examine the associations of serum sex hormone
      concentrations with the presence and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in 3,259 male
      and 2,802 postmenopausal female participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis
      (MESA). Subclinical atherosclerosis will be identified using both coronary artery calcium
      (CAC) and carotid intimal-medial wall thickness (IMT). Progression will be identified by the
      change in CAC over 3.5 years. Circulating concentrations of total (and free) testosterone
      (T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and sex hormone binding globulin
      (SHBG) in stored serum samples collected at the MESA baseline exam will be assessed.
      Laboratory results will be merged with existing demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, CHD
      risk factor, and subclinical disease data collected in MESA. Cross-sectional and prospective
      methods of statistical analysis will be used to assess the proposed associations. MESA is
      particularly well suited for disentangling the effects of hormonal factors and CHD risk
      factors on subclinical atherosclerosis because of the availability of high-quality data,
      serum samples, and CAC and IMT measurements in a large multi-ethnic population of men and
      women.
