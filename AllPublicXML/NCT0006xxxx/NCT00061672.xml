        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for study participation if all of the following criteria are
        met:

          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age.

          -  The subject has histologically confirmed non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) (excluding
             Burkitt's, Burkitt's type or HIV associated lymphoma) or Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) that
             is refractory to or has relapsed after standard therapy or for which there is no known
             effective treatment.

          -  The subject must have measurable disease by the CHESON Criteria for Tumor Response.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Score of 0-2.

          -  The subject is able to self-administer or has a caregiver who can reliably administer
             subcutaneous injections.

          -  The subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function as follows:

               -  Bone marrow: *White blood cell count (WBC) greater than or equal to 3,000/mm3;
                  *Platelets greater than or equal to 75,000/mm3 unless subject has received a
                  prior transplant or bone marrow involvement with lymphoma has been documented,
                  then platelets of equal to or greater than 50,000 is acceptable. *Hemoglobin
                  greater than or equal to 8.5 g/dL; *ANC greater than or equal to 1000/mm3

               -  Renal function: *Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL

               -  Hepatic function: *AST and ALT less than or equal to 3.0 X ULN

          -  The subject must not be pregnant or lactating and all subjects (male and female) must
             use a contraceptive method deemed appropriate by the investigator while in the study

          -  The subject has voluntarily signed and dated an Institutional Review Board

             CNS metastases.

          -  The subject is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. Low dose anticoagulation
             (e.g., low dose Coumadin) for catheter prophylaxis is permitted; PT/PTT must be within
             normal limits.

          -  The subject has a history of or currently exhibits clinically significant cancer
             related events of bleeding (e.g., hemoptysis). The subject has a recent history of
             (within 4 weeks of Study Day 1) or currently exhibits other clinically significant
             events of bleeding.

          -  The subject has received any therapy for lymphoma including chemotherapy, antibody

             treatment or procedures.

          -  The subject has history of other previous malignancies within 5 years, with the
             exception of: Adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix; Basal or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin.
