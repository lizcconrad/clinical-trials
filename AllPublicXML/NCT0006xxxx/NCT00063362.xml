      This study will compare triple and double drug regimens in the treatment of patients with
      depression, hypomania, or mania.

      Early studies have shown lithium to produce a high percentage of satisfactory clinical
      response in patients with bipolar disorders. These studies, however, do not include
      lithium-refractory subgroups, such as bipolar II disorder patients. When the wide spectrum of
      bipolar disorders is considered, the lithium response rate decreases significantly. More
      broadly effective regimens are needed.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either lithium plus
      divalproex or lithium, divalproex, and lamotrigine for 7 months. Symptoms of depression and
      mania will be assessed with scales and patient questionnaires.

    <measure>The Proportion of Patients Who Experience a Marked and Persistent Bimodal Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>A marked bimodal response is defined by the following three conditions over four consecutive weeks while on triple therapy and after three weeks of ltg:
Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of &lt;= 19
Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score of &lt;= 12.5
Global Assessment Scale (GAS) score &gt;= 51
The MADRS measures the severity of a subject's depression symptoms with a possible total score ranging from 0 - 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.
The YMRS measures the severity of a subject's manic symptoms with a possible total score ranging from 0 - 60, with higher scores indicating more severe mania.
The GAS measures a used to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of a subject and ranges in score from 0-100, with a higher score indicating better social, occupational, and psychological functioning.</description>

          <title>Bipolar Subtype</title>
          <description>Bipolar I Disorder is mainly defined by manic or mixed episodes that last at least seven days, or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs immediate hospital care.
Bipolar II Disorder is defined by a pattern of depressive episodes shifting back and forth with hypomanic episodes, but no full manic or mixed episodes</description>

        <title>The Proportion of Patients Who Experience a Marked and Persistent Bimodal Response</title>
        <description>A marked bimodal response is defined by the following three conditions over four consecutive weeks while on triple therapy and after three weeks of ltg:
Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of &lt;= 19
Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score of &lt;= 12.5
Global Assessment Scale (GAS) score &gt;= 51
The MADRS measures the severity of a subject's depression symptoms with a possible total score ranging from 0 - 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.
The YMRS measures the severity of a subject's manic symptoms with a possible total score ranging from 0 - 60, with higher scores indicating more severe mania.
The GAS measures a used to rate subjectively the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of a subject and ranges in score from 0-100, with a higher score indicating better social, occupational, and psychological functioning.</description>

Lamotrigine : Patients were assigned in a one to one ratio to adjunctive lamotrigine versus placebo after stratification for illness type (bipolar I versus bipolar II), historical response to lithium (response versus non-response), and length of current exposure to combination treatment with lithium and divalproex (&lt; 2 months versus ≥ 2 months). During Phase 2, patients were continued on the same doses of lithium and divalproex as during the open-label treatment phase and equal capsules of double-blind lamotrigine or matching placebo were gradually added per a structured dosing schedule up to a minimum dose of 150 mg and a maximum.
