  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many overweight patients are able to lose weight successfully, but then regain their weight.
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test the efficacy of 2 interventions to prevent
      weight regain in individuals who have recently lost weight. The two interventions being
      tested are a face-to-face group maintenance program and an Internet intervention. These
      interventions will be compared to a no-contact control group that receives quarterly
      newsletters. The primary outcome measure is weight regain from baseline to 18-months.
