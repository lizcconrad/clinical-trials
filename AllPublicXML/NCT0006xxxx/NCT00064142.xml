    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well halofuginone hydrobromide works in treating patients
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Halofuginone hydrobromide
      ointment may stop the growth of Kaposi's sarcoma by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tumor response rate of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related
      Kaposi's sarcoma to topical halofuginone (halofuginone hydrobromide) versus vehicle control.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of topical halofuginone and vehicle in patients
      with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the ability of topical halofuginone to inhibit expression of matrix
      metallopeptidase 2 (MMP-2) and Collagen type I in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

      II. To explore the relationship between baseline cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 and CD8
      counts, HIV viral load and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) viral load and response to
      halofuginone.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of halofuginone.

      OUTLINE: Twelve treatable Kaposi's sarcoma lesions are selected on each patient, and these 12
      lesions are randomized equally to 1 of 2 treatment arms (6 lesions receive study treatment
      and 6 lesions receive placebo); each patient serves as his/her own control.

      ARM I: Patients apply topical halofuginone hydrobromide ointment to each of 6 lesions twice a
      day for 12 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients apply topical placebo ointment to each of 6 lesions twice a day for 12
      weeks.

      Patients with stable or responding disease in either or both groups of treated lesions
      (halofuginone hydrobromide ointment or placebo ointment) may receive open-label treatment
      with topical halofuginone hydrobromide ointment to all 12 lesions for an additional 12 weeks
      as above in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 1 month.

          -  Total bilirubin should be =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); if, however, the
             elevated bilirubin is felt to be secondary to indinavir therapy, patients will be
             allowed to enroll on protocol if the total bilirubin is =&lt; 3.5 mg/dl provided that the
             direct bilirubin is normal

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT]) and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 3 x
             the upper limit of normal

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months

          -  Ability and willingness to give informed consent; patients who are younger than 18
             years of age will require the consent of a parent or guardian.

          -  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum b human chorionic
             gonadotropin (HCG) within 72 hours prior to study entry and must practice adequate
             birth control to prevent pregnancy while receiving treatment and for three months
             after treatment is discontinued

          -  Patients must, in the opinion of the investigator, be capable of complying with the
             protocol

          -  Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy must be on a stable regimen for at least 12
             weeks prior to study entry without showing evidence of ongoing Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)
             regression (ie, less than 25% decrease in the size, number or nodularity of KS lesions
             in the opinion of the investigator); patients may receive any FDA approved
             antiretroviral therapy or agents available through a treatment IND; concurrent
             treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy should be strongly encouraged, in
             accordance with DHHS guidelines (http://www.aids-ed.org/pdfs/adult_2-4-02.pdf) but
             will not be required for participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent, acute, active, untreated opportunistic infection other than oral thrush or
             genital herpes within 14 days of enrollment

          -  Known active visceral Kaposi's sarcoma or symptomatic Kaposi's sarcoma-related edema
             that interferes with function or requires cytotoxic therapy

          -  Concurrent neoplasia requiring cytotoxic therapy

          -  Acute treatment for an infection (other than oral thrush or genital herpes) or other
             serious medical illness within 14 days of study entry

          -  Anti-neoplastic treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma (including chemotherapy, radiation
             therapy, local therapy, biological therapy, or investigational therapy) within four
             weeks of study entry

          -  Previous local therapy of any KS-indicator lesion within 60 days unless the lesion has
             clearly progressed since treatment

          -  Corticosteroid treatment, other than replacement doses

          -  Use of investigational agents other than antiretroviral drugs available under expanded
             access or compassionate use protocols

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females are excluded from participation in this study since
             the effects of halofuginone on an unborn or young child are unknown and may
