      RATIONALE: 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy delivers a high dose of radiation
      directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of 3-dimensional conformal radiation
      therapy in treating women who have undergone lumpectomy and axillary node dissection for
      stage I or stage II breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the technical feasibility and reproducibility of three-dimensional conformal
           radiotherapy confined to the region of the lumpectomy cavity in women with stage I or II
           breast cancer.

        -  Determine the cosmetic results in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the complication rates in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the local control rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy twice daily for 5 days beginning
      within 8 weeks after surgery.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 6.3 to
      15.3 months.
