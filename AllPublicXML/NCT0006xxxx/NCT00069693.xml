      This study will conduct tests with patients with primary chronic orthostatic intolerance
      (COI) to learn more about this disorder of the autonomic nervous system.

      Healthy normal volunteers and patients 18 years of age and older with COI may be eligible for
      this study. Participants undergo one or more of the following tests and procedures:

        -  Blood studies, including arterial catheter insertion to measure blood pressure and
           collect arterial blood samples, blood flow studies using sensors applied to the skin and
           a pressure cuff around a limb, blood volume studies using injection of radioactively
           labeled human serum albumin and gene studies to look for genetic abnormalities
           associated with certain proteins.

        -  Imaging studies, including CT scan of the adrenal glands, heart ultrasound, and PET
           scanning.

        -  Electrocardiogram

        -  Microdialysis to measures levels of chemicals in the body fluid of certain tissues. A
           thin tube is inserted into the skin and a solution is passed through it. Chemicals in
           the body tissues enter the solution in the tube. The solution is collected and the
           chemical levels are measured.

        -  Neck suction. Neck suction is applied to test a reflex the brain uses to regulate blood
           pressure.

        -  Perometry. Limb volume is measured using an infrared light that moves up the limb.

        -  Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test to evaluate an aspect of autonomic nervous
           system function. A small amount of a brain chemical (acetylcholine) is applied to the
           skin with a tiny amount of electricity, and the sweat in a nearby patch of skin is
           measured.

        -  Skin electrical conduction test using sensors on the skin to measure sweat production.

        -  Skin and core temperature measurements using sensors on the skin and in the ear canal.

        -  Tilt table test. The subject lies on a table, secured with straps around the chest and
           legs. Sensors are placed on the arms and chest to monitor blood pressure, pulse rate,
           and heart rhythm. A catheter is placed in a vein in each arm to collect blood samples
           and give drugs. Another catheter is placed in an artery to draw blood and monitor blood
           pressure. The subject is given an infusion of norepinephrine and epinephrine, and
           baseline measures and blood samples are taken. The table is tilted upright and more
           measurements and blood samples are taken at intervals for up to 30 minutes. The table is
           returned to a horizontal position and additional measurements and samples may be taken.

      Drugs may be administered during the tests, including acetylcholine, epinephrine, and
      norepinephrine, radioactive chemicals used in imaging studies, and drugs that affect blood
      vessels, heart rate, and force of heart contractions.

      This protocol is to identify and characterize distinct types of chronic orthostatic
      intolerance (COI). COI can be a manifestation of primary chronic autonomic failure, which is
      covered under a separate protocol. The present protocol concerns patients with COI who under
      resting conditions have intact sympathetic neurocirculatory function. COI can reflect
      different pathophysiologic mechanisms; until now, few studies have attempted to distinguish
      these mechanisms in individual patients. We hypothesize that results of clinical assessment
      and physiologic, chemical, pharmacologic, and imaging tests will reveal internally consistent
      patterns that distinguish particular forms of COI. We wish to determine the relative
      frequencies of these forms in a referral population. The first phase of testing is to
      identify sympathetic neurocirculatory failure, baroreflex failure, and secondary causes of
      COI (hypovolemia, excessive orthostatic venous pooling, or excessive orthostatic
      extravasation). In a subsequent inpatient phase, tilt table testing is done, with concurrent
      hemodynamic and chemical measurements, to confirm subtypes of postural tachycardia syndrome
      and neurocardiogenic syncope. The results of these evaluations will be used for
      stratification of specific, pathophysiologically defined diagnostic groups for therapeutic
      protocols. In an off-site study, we will evaluate members of a large family where COI seems
      to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The subjects are patients with COI and adult healthy volunteers of similar age, gender, and
        body mass.

        Participation in this protocol is offered to people 18 years old or older, independently of
        gender, race, age, ethnicity, religion, or any other demographic or sociopolitical
        classifications.

        The subjects in the second off-site study are family members of the identified proband.
        Participation in this protocol is offered to people 18 years old or older, independently of
        gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other demographic or sociopolitical
        classifications.

        In the second off-site study, participation is also offered to subjects 10 to 17 years old,
        provided that appropriate informed consent/assent has been given by the subject and his/her
        parent or guardian.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: Minors younger than 18 years old are excluded, except for the off-site study. Advanced
        age does not constitute an exclusion criterion. For subjects more than 55 years old,
        carotid Doppler studies are done, and subjects with significant carotid disease (stenosis
        by atherosclerosis) are excluded. In the off-site study, minors younger than 10 years old
        are excluded. For the second off-site study, minors younger than 10 years old are excluded.
        Advanced age does not constitute an exclusion criterion. Except for the second off-site
        study, people less than 18 years old are excluded.

        Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator or
        Clinical Director, protocol participation would place the subject at substantially
        increased acute medical risk. This includes the risks associated with air travel to the
        NIH. A candidate subject is excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or
        Clinical Director, the medical risk outweighs the potential scientific benefit.

        Disqualifying Conditions: A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying
        condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are hepatic or renal failure, a history of
        tachyarrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure, severe anemia, psychosis,
        refractory ventricular arrhythmias, symptomatic coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus,
        hyperthyroidism, and allergy or sensitivity to iodinated contrast media or any of the
        planned drugs. A positive HIV rest result does not necessarily exclude a patient from
        participating.

        Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the
        patient continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results.
        Examples are tricyclic antidepressants, anticoagulants, beta-adrenoceptor blockers,
        phenothiazines, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, acetaminophen, and
        alpha-adrenoceptor agonists or antagonists. Patients on one or more of these drugs are not
        excluded, if the drugs are tapered and discontinued before undergoing the clinical
        laboratory testing. Patients are not to discontinue any medications before the patient or
        the patient's doctor discusses this with the Principal Investigator. If it is decided that
        discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the patient is excluded from the study.
        Patients with known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to any test drug are excluded.
        Patients unable to discontinue nicotine or alcohol for 24 hours prior to evaluation are
        excluded.

        Patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance often take several medications that could
        interfere with the scientific results of this protocol. Temporary discontinuation of
        medications as outpatients, even with the approval of the referring physician, introduces
        some risk. To maximize patient safety, we may admit patients for monitoring as inpatients
        while medications are tapered or stopped.

        In the second off-site study, subjects are tested while on their usual medications.

        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal
        medicines or dietary supplements must be discontinued before enrollment in the study. In
        cases where the subjects wish to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements
        while on study, and search of the available medical literature fails to identify effects
        that are known or expected to interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects
        may participate. Subjects in the off-site study may continue their herbal medicines or
        dietary supplements.

        Practical Limitations: Patients in whom we feel it would be difficult to insert a catheter
        into a vein are excluded. Subjects who are not expected clinically to tolerate lying still
        during the procedures are excluded. In the second off-site study, if an i.v. cannot be
        placed, or the subject refuses to have an i.v. placed then a DNA sample may be obtained by
        buccal smear or obtaining saliva.

        Pregnancy: Pregnant or lactating women are excluded. In the second off-site study,
        pregnancy is not an exclusion criterion.

        The Investigators may also exclude a subject from further participation, such as in the
        event of known or suspect falsification of medical history information or refusal to
        undergo planned tests or procedures, without loss of benefits to which the subject was
        previously entitled.
