      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of an investigational drug used
      intravenously and placebo administered every three months for one year, on bone loss
      associated with initial androgen deprivation) in men with prostate cancer without metastasis.
      In order to participate in this trial male patients must be 18 years of age or older and have
      been diagnosed with prostate cancer without metastasis and within one year of starting their
      androgen deprivation therapy at the day of randomization onto this trial. In addition,
      patients who have undergone a recent orchiectomy (or&quot;ke-ek'te-me) (removal of one or two
      testes) are eligible to participate.

      Patients who received any prior bisphosphonate therapy or prior treatment with systemic
      corticosteroids within in the past 12 months are not eligible to participate. Also patients
      who are receiving treatment for osteoporosis are not eligible to participate.

      Inclusion into this clinical trial with this investigational drug is based on the protocol
      entry criteria and evaluation from a participating trial investigator.

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate

          -  No distant metastases (stage TNMO) (ie. prostate cancer without metastases)

          -  Patients within one year at the day of randomization from initiation of androgen
             deprivation therapy with a LHRH agonist (with or without an antiandrogen) and with the
             intended duration of androgen deprivation therapy of at least 12 months. Patients may
             also enter if they have received an orchiectomy (or&quot;ke-ek'te-me) within two weeks of
             visit 1

          -  Patients who received any prior bisphosphonate therapy in the past 12 months will be
             excluded

          -  Patients who are currently receiving diethylstilbesterol (DES) or PC-SPES (treatment
             for osteoporosis) will be excluded

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with systemic corticosteroids within the
             past 12 months will be excluded (short term corticosteroid therapy, e.g. to
             prevent/treat chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting or for acute illness like asthma
             exacerbation, is acceptable)
