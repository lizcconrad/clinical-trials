  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-surgical periodontal (gum) treatment can
      reduce the incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight babies in mothers with
      periodontitis (gum disease).

    <textblock>
      Eight hundred sixteen women who are between 13 and 16 weeks pregnant will be enrolled in this
      trial. Volunteers will be recruited from Hennepin County Medical Center (MN), the Jackson
      Medical Mall (MS), the University of Kentucky, and Harlem (NY) Hospital. The incidence of
      preterm birth is higher at these sites than the national average. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive non-surgical mechanical periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing)
      either prior to 20 weeks of their pregnancy or soon after delivery. All subjects will be
      monitored for progressive periodontitis and will be treated immediately regardless of their
      group assignment. All women will also receive essential dental care to restore caries and
      treat abscessed teeth. The primary birth outcome is gestational age at birth and the
      secondary outcome is birthweight. Maternal risk factors for preterm birth and/or intrauterine
      growth restriction will be used as covariates in the data analysis. The study will also
      document the effect of periodontal therapy on immune response, systemic markers of
      inflammation, periodontal infection and clinical periodontal measure.
