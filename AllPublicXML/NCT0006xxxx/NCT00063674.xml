      Purpose: To evaluate two approaches to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes in young girls.

      The Need: We are experiencing an epidemic of childhood obesity. Rates of obesity have doubled
      to tripled in the past two decades, with the highest rates among poor and ethnic minority
      girls. Type 2 diabetes (what used to be called adult-onset diabetes) is now showing up in
      overweight children, and more children are manifesting precursors of heart disease and
      stroke.

      Our Two Approaches:

        1. A state-of-the-art nutrition education program with monthly newsletters mailed to girls
           and their parents and quarterly evening lectures/educational events at school sites,
           including cooking demonstrations and games to improve nutrition and increase physical
           activity.

        2. After-school dance classes held five days per week all year long at school sites from
           the time school lets out until 6PM. Dance classes will include a 1-1.5 hour supervised
           homework study hall each day, and emphasize both traditional ethnic dances and popular
           dance.

      Participants: Second, third and fourth grade girls and their families will be eligible to
      participate. All activities are free of charge. To be able to perform a valid evaluation, to
      be able to accommodate all girls at their own school, and to be fair about which girls
      receive which program, families who wish to participate will be randomly selected to
      participate in either one program or the other (nutrition education or dance classes). Each
      family will participate for two years.

      Evaluation: Trained Stanford staff will perform all evaluation procedures with participating
      families in their own homes at the beginning and every six months. Families will be
      compensated for their participation.

      <textblock>
        Second-, third- and fourth-grade girls, aged 7-10 years of age enrolled in one of the
        participating schools will be eligible. Our goal is to be as inclusive as possible.
        However, girls will not be eligible to participate if they:

          -  have been diagnosed with a chronic illness that affects their growth and/or weight
             (e.g., type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism, inflammatory bowel disease)

          -  are taking medications potentially affecting their growth and/or weight (e.g.,
             methylphenidate HCl, systemic steroids)

          -  have Asthma (not exclusionary alone) but have taken systemic steroids (oral,
             intravenous, or intramuscular) for a period of more than 21 days in the past year

          -  have a condition that limits their participation in physical activity enough that they
             are not able to participate in Physical Education at school (e.g., significant
             structural heart disease)

          -  are pregnant

          -  are unable to complete the informed consent process.
