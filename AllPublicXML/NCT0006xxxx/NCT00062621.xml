  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combined bone marrow and kidney
      transplant will be effective in treating stage II or greater multiple myeloma and associated
      kidney failure. This study will determine whether transplant rejection and the need for
      immunosuppressive drugs are decreased with this combined transplant approach.

    <textblock>
      In very limited human testing, a combined kidney and bone marrow transplant appears to be
      safe and effective in treating multiple myeloma and associated kidney failure. This study
      will evaluate this approach in 10 patients with kidney failure due to or in association with
      stage II or greater multiple myeloma. Treatment prior to transplant will include
      cyclophosphamide, ATGAM (a lymphocyte-specific immunosuppressant), local radiation to the
      thymus, and cyclosporine (an immunosuppressive drug).

      An infusion of donor bone marrow and a kidney graft from a closely matched, related donor
      will be transplanted simultaneously. An additional infusion of donor white blood cells may be
      administered between day 45 and 74 after transplant in an effort to eliminate any remaining
      cancer cells. Patients will remain on cyclosporine for a defined period of time. The
      cyclosporine doses will be slowly decreased and stopped if graft rejection and
      graft-versus-host disease do not occur.

      Each participant will be involved in the study for 3 years; this includes the intervention
      phase (time from initial screening at approximately 7 days before transplant through 100 days
      after the transplant) and continued follow-up visits for at least 2 years following the
      transplant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  End-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to or in association with stage II or greater
             multiple myeloma

          -  Participants in whom the development of ESRD is not due to the underlying myeloma will
             be included if they have evidence of active myeloma despite past treatment with
             standard therapies (e.g., prednisone, melphalan, high-dose radiation therapy with
             autologous stem cell transplantation)

          -  On dialysis or have a creatinine clearance greater than 20 ml/min

          -  HLA-matched or one of six HLA antigen-mismatched related donor

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Compromised pulmonary, cardiac, or liver function

          -  Active infection
