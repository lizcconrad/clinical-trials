    <textblock>
      Measurement of the quality of life (QoL) of children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD) has had little attention, despite the importance of understanding key factors
      affecting QoL, especially for measuring the effects of clinical trials to improve IBD
      outcomes. The main purpose of this pilot study is to examine the impact of clinical severity
      and treatment social factors on the quality of life (QoL) of a diverse population of children
      and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Secondary purposes include determining
      the effects of sociodemographic factors on QoL and exploring the concordance of views of
      parents and children of QoL. The study aims are to 1) determine the associations of of
      clinical characteristics (condition type, activity/severity, and treatment) with specific
      components of general health-related quality of life and IBD-specific QoL; 2) describe the
      effects of sociodemographic characteristics (SES, age, and gender) on these measures; and 3)
      compare the views of different observers (parent and child with IBD) of the child's QoL. The
      study will apply both general and condition-specific QoL measures among a random sample of
      250 children and adolescents with IBD, ages 5-18 years, in six clinical sites. We will obtain
      measures of QoL from both the child and a parent in each case. The study will obtain
      additional data regarding the subjects' clinical condition (condition type,
      severity/activity, treatment [including surgery], age of onset) and socioeconomic status
      (household structure and income). Main analyses will compare general and specific measures of
      QoL and examine the influence of clinical and sociodemographic variables on QoL, through
      multivariate regression techniques. We will also examine the differences in child and parent
      assessments of QoL. The information from this study will provide a stronger base for future
      studies of treatment and natural history of IBD. It will help to clarify the life domains
      that are affected by IBD and will inform interventions to improve QoL for children with IBD.
