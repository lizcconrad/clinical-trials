      This study will investigate the relationship between susceptibility to hypnosis and
      regulation of the autonomic nervous system (nerves that control involuntary body functions,
      such as heart rate and sweating).

      Hypnosis is a state of mind in which the individual is highly focused, relatively unaware of
      his or her surroundings, and possibly more able to accept and use therapeutic suggestions.
      People vary in their responsiveness, or susceptibility, while in hypnosis. People with
      certain conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), chronic pain, posttraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have altered hypnotic
      susceptibility. Patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance (COI) often have symptoms
      similar to those of individuals with CFS, chronic pain, PTSD, and GAD, and this study will
      examine how patients with COI respond to hypnosis as compared with healthy normal volunteers.
      COI is a group of disorders characterized by intolerance to prolonged standing. Among them
      are neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), in which patients have recurrent episodes of sudden loss
      of consciousness, and postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), in which patients have a
      sustained increase in heart rate after standing.

      In addition to the comparison of COI and normal volunteer responses to hypnosis, the study
      will examine how hypnotic susceptibility is related to the ability to control autonomic
      functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and sweating. The autonomic nervous system is
      activated when the body is stressed, not only from physical stimuli such as cold temperature,
      but also from mental stimuli, such as seeing a rattlesnake up close. Hypnosis may, therefore,
      be a useful tool to understand how the mind controls the autonomic nervous system.

      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with NCS or POTS who are 18 years of age or older may
      be eligible for this two-part study. In part 1, participants complete a questionnaire and are
      then tested for hypnotic susceptibility. For this test, a professionally trained physician
      guides the subject through a procedure to achieve a hypnotic state. The subject is asked to
      perform several simple tasks and is then guided back to a normal state of being. In part 2,
      the subject undergoes hypnosis again, during which the physician offers various suggestions
      while monitoring activity of the subject's autonomic nervous system. The subject is connected
      to various sensors that continuously monitor blood pressure, heart rate, blood flow, sweat
      response, skin electrical conduction, and brain wave activity. An intravenous catheter is
      inserted into an arm vein to collect blood samples. At the end, the subject is guided back to
      a normal state of being.

      The hypnosis session in part 1 is videotaped in order to: 1) permit review by a scientist who
      is unaware of the subject's condition and whose judgment will not, therefore, be biased; and
      2) have a record of the experimental data. Only qualified investigators will view the
      videotape.

      This protocol describes a study to investigate the relationship between susceptibility to
      hypnosis and regulation of the autonomic nervous system. Several studies have demonstrated
      that individuals with particular conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS),
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic pain, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD),
      have altered hypnotic susceptibility. Patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance (COI), a
      general category of autonomic dysfunction that includes neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) and
      postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), often present with symptoms that are similar to those
      seen in CFS, PTSD, chronic pain, or GAD. These observations led to the hypothesis tested in
      this protocol that patients with COI may also have altered hypnotic susceptibility. We also
      hypothesize that increased hypnotic susceptibility will correlate with increased ability to
      modulate autonomic function appropriately in response to suggestions during hypnosis.

      The study population includes normal volunteers and patients with NCS or POTS. The design is
      blinded and correlative. Primary outcome measures are hypnotic susceptibility as measured by
      standardized scales; self-report inventory scores of psychobehavioral variables; physiologic
      parameters such as hemodynamics, sweating, skin electrical conductance, body temperature,
      respiratory rate, and bispectral analysis; and plasma catechol levels. The results of this
      study may lead to novel therapeutic strategies using hypnosis for COI.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects are patients with COI (POTS or NCS) identified in existing diagnostic protocols of
        the Clinical Neurocardiology Section (CNCS) and age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers.
        Patients with COI must be evaluated first through these diagnostic protocols prior to being
        offered enrollment in this protocol. Participation in this protocol is offered to subjects
        independently of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or creed.

        The studies in this protocol can be performed on an outpatient basis. Inpatients may also
        participate as long as participation does not interfere with the protocol(s) under which
        they have been admitted.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects are excluded based on: age less than 18 years, unwillingness to be hypnotized or
        videotaped; religious or other beliefs that would prevent engagement in hypnosis; psychosis
        or psychotic depression; non-fluency in spoken English; and inability to participate
        adequately in the tasks of the hypnotic susceptibility scale. In addition, patients are
        excluded if they are being treated with, and cannot discontinue, a drug likely to interfere
        with the scientific results. An example would be treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor
        blocker. Patients unable to discontinue nicotine or alcohol temporarily are excluded.
        Patients are not to discontinue any medications before the patient or the patient's doctor
        discusses this with the Principal Investigator, or the Research Nurse. If it is decided
        that discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the patient is excluded from the
        study. Finally, subjects are excluded if there are technical limitations in placing an i.v.
        or monitoring devices.
