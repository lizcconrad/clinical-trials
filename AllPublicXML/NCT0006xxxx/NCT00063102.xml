      The purpose of the study is to determine if ABT-751 will decrease tumors, and determine how
      long the tumor shrinkage can be maintained in patients with breast cancer after having had
      taxol or taxotere. Patients will receive ABT-751 by mouth daily for 21 days. Patients will be
      off drug for 7 days before starting the next cycle of drug.
