  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the efficacy and
      safety of three treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): transurethral needle
      ablation (TUNA), transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT), and medical therapy with alfuzosin
      and finasteride.
