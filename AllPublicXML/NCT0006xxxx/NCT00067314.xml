  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This international study will study how metastatic breast cancer responds to the
      investigational drug treatment, what are the side effects of the investigational drug when
      given to women with metastatic breast cancer and how often do these side effects occur. The
      study will also analyze how fast investigational drug and its breakdown products are cleared
      from the blood in these patients.
