  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effect on the body of combining oxaliplatin with bortezomib in
      treating patients who have metastatic or unresectable cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy such
      as oxaliplatin use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      tumor cell growth. Combining oxaliplatin with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of oxaliplatin and
      bortezomib in patients with advanced malignancy.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine
      the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the antitumor activity
      of this regimen in these patients. V. Determine the pattern of neurotoxicity and its
      reversibility in patients responding to prolonged administration of this treatment regimen.

      VI. Determine whether the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxaliplatin or bortezomib
      are altered by the administration of the other agent in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and bortezomib IV over 3-5
      seconds on days 1, 4, 15, and 18. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and bortezomib until the
      maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) are determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-15
      months.
