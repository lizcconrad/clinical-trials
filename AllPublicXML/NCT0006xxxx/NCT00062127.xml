  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy such as irinotecan use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they
      stop growing or die. Combining thalidomide with irinotecan may kill more tumor cells. This
      randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best way to give irinotecan and
      thalidomide in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether thalidomide alters the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan in patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine whether irinotecan alters the pharmacokinetics of thalidomide in these
      patients.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the observed
      antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 22 and oral thalidomide
      once daily on days 15-28.

      Arm II: Patients receive irinotecan as in arm I and oral thalidomide once daily on days -6 to
      7.

      All patients undergo disease re-evaluation at 6 weeks. Patients with stable or responsive
      disease may receive additional courses comprising irinotecan IV on day 1 and oral thalidomide
      once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
