  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from cognitive and other brain problems. This
      study will examine the effectiveness of the drug donepezil and of sugar water for enhancing
      memory in individuals with MS. Donepezil (also known as Aricept) has been FDA approved for
      improving memory and learning in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

    <textblock>
      Cognitive dysfunction is one of the leading causes of disability in people with MS. Memory
      involving specific words (verbal memory) is particularly affected in individuals with MS.
      Attempts to rehabilitate cognitive dysfunction in MS have had only limited success.

      This study will determine the efficacy of donepezil therapy and glucose administration for
      enhancing verbal memory functioning in individuals with MS. The study will also measure
      secondary outcomes assessing other areas of cognitive dysfunction (i.e., nonverbal memory,
      conceptual thinking, processing speed) which may improve with intervention.

      Forty participants with MS will be randomly assigned to receive either donepezil or placebo
      for 24 weeks. Participants will complete memory and cognitive tests at the beginning and end
      of the 24 week period.

      Twenty participants with MS will be randomly assigned to drink a beverage sweetened with
      either glucose or saccharin (placebo). Participants will then complete memory and other
      cognitive tests. Two weeks later, participants will drink a beverage sweetened with the
      alternative sweetener and again complete the memory and cognitive tests.
