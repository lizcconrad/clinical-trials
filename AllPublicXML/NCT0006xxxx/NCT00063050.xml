      The purpose of this study is to determine whether educating parents about health and behavior
      management techniques will increase physical activity, calcium intake, fitness, and bone
      density in their children.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, osteoporosis has become a major public health problem in the United States.
      Osteoporosis can best be prevented by optimizing bone mineral gain and reducing bone loss.
      Because the rate of bone development reaches its peak during adolescence, fostering bone
      health in childhood is of critical importance. Although there have been many studies of
      exercise and nutritional factors that influence bone mass in adults, few randomized,
      prospective studies have been conducted in children. This study will determine whether parent
      training is effective in increasing children's calcium intake, strength, and frequency of
      aerobic exercise.

      Families will be randomly assigned to either the physical activity and nutrition intervention
      group or to the injury prevention control group. Families in both groups will undergo
      training during 9 weekly classes. The intervention training will emphasize health topics,
      principles of behavior, and contingency management techniques. Post-training coaching
      procedures will be provided periodically for 9 months. Coaching procedures will assist
      parents with problem solving and help them refine and maintain parenting skills. All families
      will be assessed prior to training and at Months 3, 9, and 12. Outcome measures will include
      24-hour recall estimates of change in diet and change in physical activity. Total bone
      calcium, bone density, body composition, and skeletal age will also be assessed.
