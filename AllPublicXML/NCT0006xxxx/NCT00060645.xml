      Phase 1 trial to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      AP23573 in patients with refractory or recurrent malignancies, including myeloma and
      lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD of
      AP23573, when administered once daily for 5 days to be repeated every 2 weeks (two 2-week
      courses equals 1 cycle). The secondary objectives of the study are to characterize the
      pharmacokinetic profile of AP23573, to evaluate potential pharmacodynamic markers of AP23573,
      and to obtain preliminary information on the antineoplastic activity of AP23573.

      Protocol Outline: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive AP23573 over 30 minutes
      by intravenous infusion once daily for 5 days to be repeated every 2 weeks. If tolerated, a
      total of at least 2 cycles will be administered (8-week treatment period). Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             therapy.

          -  Patients with disease that is currently not amenable to surgical intervention.

          -  Patients with Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 70% (ECOG performance status of 0 or
             1) and an anticipated life expectancy of ≥ 3 months.

             effective method of contraception.

          -  Patients with the ability to understand and give written informed consent.

          -  Patients with primary CNS malignancies. Patients with leukemia, any form.

          -  Patients with certain hematologic abnormalities.

          -  Patients with certain serum chemistry abnormalities at baseline.

          -  Patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to either drugs formulated with
