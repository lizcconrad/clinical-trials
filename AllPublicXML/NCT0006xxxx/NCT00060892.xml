  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to assess the overall safety of different dose regimens
      of AMG0001 (HGF transferred via plasmid vector) as well as evaluate the improvement of blood
      perfusion in subjects with critical limb ischemia (CLI). This study also evaluated the
      improvement in wound healing without adverse effects on the quality of life, as well as the
      potential reduction of amputation, mortality and rest pain in the CLI population.

      The primary goal of this study was to assess the safety of AMG0001, detect potential
      angiogenesis response to AMG0001 treatment and to correlate these changes to clinical
      endpoints dependent upon improvement in tissue perfusion for relief of CLI complications. The
      objectives of this study were to:

        -  Assess the overall safety of different exposure regimens of AMG0001 in the CLI subject
           population.

        -  Evaluate the potential effect of angiogenesis associated with different doses and dose
           regimens of AMG0001 as measured by improvement in tissue perfusion.

        -  Evaluate the activity of different exposure regimens of AMG0001 to benefit clinical
           outcomes of reduction of amputation and mortality, wound healing, rest-pain reduction
           and improvement in subject's ability to function without adverse consequences on quality
           of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will have one or more clinical indications diagnostic of CLI such as: distal
             extremity pain at rest that requires the subject to use analgesics for &gt;2 weeks; or
             peripheral ischemic ulcer(s); or areas of gangrene.

          -  The subject will have a TcPO2 of &lt;/= 40 mmHg.

          -  Subjects will have one or both of the following hemodynamic indicators of severe
             peripheral arterial occlusive disease: (a) Ankle systolic pressure of &lt;/= 70 mmHg;
             (b)Toe systolic pressure &lt;/= 50 mmHg.

          -  The subject is a poor candidate for standard revascularization treatment options for
             peripheral arterial disease, based on inadequate bypass conduit, unfavorable anatomy,
             or poor operative risk.

          -  Subject has signed an informed consent form either directly or through a legally
             authorized representative

          -  If female, the subject must be (a) at least one year post-menopausal, or (b)

          -  Subjects with a clinically significant liver enzyme abnormality (i.e., AST or ALT more
             than two times the upper limit of normal and/or bilirubin more than 50% the upper
             limit of normal).
