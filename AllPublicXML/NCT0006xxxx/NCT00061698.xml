  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depressive disorders during childhood are virulent, long-lasting disorders that are a risk
      factor for the development of future depressive episodes and other psychiatric difficulties.
      A dysfunctional family environment is a possible pathway to the development of depression in
      adolescents. The family environment is an especially salient context for the development of
      depression in preadolescent girls.

      Depression is expressed differently between male and female adolescents; girls may not
      benefit as much as boys from treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) because
      the treatments may not target disturbances and skills that are specific to preadolescent
      girls. This study will identify effective treatments for depression in preadolescent girls.

      Depressed participants are randomly assigned to receive CBT, CBT plus parent training (PT),
      or a minimal contact control (MCC). The CBT group receives treatment twice a week for 10
      weeks. Participants in the CBT plus PT group receive therapy sessions and group treatment for
      10 weeks. Participants in the MCC group meet with a research associate once a week for 10
      weeks. During the control visits, the child's depressive symptoms are assessed, but no advice
      or treatment is given. Participants are assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and at yearly
      follow-up visits for up to 4 years. School performance, home environment, and the impact of
      the interventions on parent adjustment are evaluated.
