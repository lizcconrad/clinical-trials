        Inclusion Criteria

          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age.

          -  The subject has histologically or cytology documented Stage IIIB with pleural effusion
             or Stage IV NSCLC. The subject must have measurable disease (RECIST Criteria for Tumor
             Response).

          -  The subject has not received first line therapy for treatment of NSCLC.

          -  The subject must not be pregnant or lactating and all subjects (male and female) must
             use a contraceptive method deemed acceptable by the investigator while in the study
             and for up to two months following completion of therapy.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-1.

          -  The subject is able to self-administer or has a caregiver who can reliably administer
             SC injections.

          -  The subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function as follows:

               -  Bone marrow: White blood cell count (WBC) &gt;= 3,000/mm3; Platelets; &gt;=
                  100,000/mm3; Hemoglobin &gt;= 9.0 g/dL;

               -  Renal function: Serum creatinine &lt;= 2.0 mg/dL;

               -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL; AST and ALT &lt;= 1.5 X the upper normal
                  limit (ULN); unless liver metastases are present, then AST and ALT &lt;= 5.0 x ULN.

          -  The subject has voluntarily signed and dated an Institutional Review Board
             (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved consent prior to any study specific
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The subject has a history of or currently exhibits Central Nervous System (CNS)
             metastasis. Brain MRI within 28 days of enrollment is required to confirm absence of
             CNS metastases.

          -  The subject is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. Low dose anticoagulation
             for catheter prophylaxis will be permitted; PT/PTT must be within normal limits.

          -  The subject has a history of or currently exhibits clinically significant cancer
             related events of bleeding (e.g., hemoptysis). The subject has a recent history of
             (within 4 weeks from Study Day 1) or currently exhibits other clinically significant
             events of bleeding.

          -  The subject has received investigational therapy within four weeks prior to study drug
             administration.

          -  The subject exhibits evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s)
             and/or is considered by the investigator to be unable to tolerate the proposed
             treatment or procedures.

          -  The subject has previous or current malignancies at other sites, with the exception
             of: Adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri; Basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin; Previous nonpulmonary malignancy confined and surgically
             resected with no evidence of active malignancy.
