  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease patients usually have difficulty making automatic movements. Automatic
      movements are movements people often make without conscious thought.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate regions of the brain that affect automatic
      movements and to understand the movements of Parkinson's patients. Investigators hope this
      knowledge will lead to better treatment for the disease.

      Thirty participants will be enrolled in this study. Each will give a medical history and
      undergo a brief physical exam. Participants will have two MRI scans, each lasting
      approximately 1.5 hours. During these scans, they may be asked to move their right or left
      hands or to remember some letters that they have been shown. Before undergoing the second
      scan, participants will be asked to practice the tasks until they can perform them correctly.

      Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are deficient in making automatic movements. The
      underlying neural correlates of the problem are not understood. In the present study, to
      investigate the brain activity contributing to this disorder, we will use specially designed
      dual-task paradigm and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. Thirty
      patients with PD will be asked to perform sequential finger-tapping movement with the right
      hand; results will be analyzed from 20 patients who achieve automaticity as defined in the
      study. In addition, we will use a dual-task paradigm to evaluate automaticity by having
      subjects perform either a distraction task (involving visual memory) or an interference task
      (tapping with the left hand) simultaneously with the sequential movements. Patients will
      practice to achieve automaticity. fMRI will be obtained before and after achieving
      automaticity. By analyzing fMRI results, we will explore the brain regions associated with
      deficiency of automatic movements in PD patients.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Thirty patients with PD will be included in the study.

        The diagnosis of PD is based on medical history, physical and neurological examinations,
        response to levodopa or dopaminergic drugs, and laboratory tests and MRI scans to exclude
        other diseases.

        Patients will be assessed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and
        Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Only patients with mild to moderate motor disability (UDRS
        less than or equal to 40) and without cognitive impairment (MMT score greater than or equal
        to 25) will be investigated.

        Patients will be studied only after their medication has been withdrawn for at least 12
        hours.

        All subjects participating in the study should have a valid Clinical Center Medical Record
        Number.

        The fMRI experiment will follow the standard operating procedures of the HMCS Neuroimaging
        Group.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects with psychiatric disorders or severe motor disabilities will be excluded.

        Subjects with pacemakers, cardiac or neural defibrillators, intracranial aneurysm clips,
        intraorbital metallic structures, insulin pumps, cochlear implants, and other metallic
        objects will not be scanned.

        Women who are pregnant are excluded from MRI because the safety of the fetus in the
        presence of high magnetic fields is not established. Therefore, all women of childbearing
        potential will have a pregnancy test performed, which must be negative, before proceeding.

        Subjects under age 18 will be excluded.
