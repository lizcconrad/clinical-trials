    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gain initial information on the tolerability and feasibility
      of high-concentration capsaicin patches for the treatment of painful HIV-associated
      neuropathy, whether resulting from HIV disease and/or antiretroviral drug exposure. The study
      will also provide preliminary safety and efficacy information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 18 and 75 years of age.

          -  Documented evidence of HIV-1 infection.

          -  Painful HIV-associated neuropathy, whether resulting from HIV disease and/or
             antiretroviral drug exposure, with primary symptoms of pain, burning or dysesthetic
             discomfort in both feet for at least 2 months prior to Screening Visit.

        AND:

          -  Diminished ankle reflexes (compared to the knee) or absent ankle reflexes,

        AND/OR

          -  Distal diminution of either vibration sensation or pain or temperature sensation in
             the legs.

          -  Either no neurotoxic antiretroviral (i.e., didanosine [ddI], zalcitabine [ddC], or
             stavudine [d4T]) exposure for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit,

        OR

          -  Currently on stable dose(s) of any of the neurotoxic antiretrovirals listed above for
             at least 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit, without a foreseeable need to change doses
             or medications for duration of study.

          -  Screening Pain Sum Score of 12 to 36.

          -  Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area(s) to be treated.

          -  If taking chronic pain medications, be on a stable (not PRN) regimen for at least 7
             days prior to Treatment Visit (Day 0) and willing to maintain medications at same
             stable dose(s) and schedule throughout the study.

          -  Be willing and able to use Roxicodone® (oxycodone) oral solution, if needed, to
             relieve treatment-associated discomfort.

          -  Female subjects with child-bearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test, to be performed at the Screening Visit.

          -  All subjects must be willing to use effective methods of birth control and/or refrain
             from participating in a conception process during the study and for 30 days following
             experimental drug exposure.

          -  Be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements for the duration of study
             participation. (Such requirements include, but are not limited to: completing a daily
             pain diary, attending all study visits, and refraining from extensive travel during
             study participation.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of acute, active opportunistic infection, except oral thrush; oral, genital,
             or rectal herpes; and Mycobacterium avium bacteremia within 2 weeks prior to Screening
             Visit.

          -  Significant pain of an etiology other than painful HIV-associated neuropathy, for
             example, compression-related neuropathies, e.g., spinal stenosis, or fibromyalgia or
             arthritis. Subjects must not have significant ongoing pain from other cause(s) that
             may interfere with judging HIV-associated neuropathy pain.

          -  Evidence of another contributing cause for peripheral neuropathy, e.g., diabetes
             mellitus, hereditary neuropathy, vitamin B12 deficiency (B12 level less than or equal
             to 200 pg/mL) or less than 3 months of B12 supplementation prior to Screening Visit,
             or treatment within 90 days prior to Screening Visit with any drug that may have
             contributed to the sensory neuropathy.

          -  Any implanted medical device (spinal cord stimulator, intrathecal pump or peripheral
             nerve stimulator) for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

          -  Recent use (within 21 days preceding the Treatment Visit [Day 0]) of any topically
             applied pain medication, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, menthol,
             methyl salicylate, local anesthetics (including Lidoderm®), steroids or capsaicin
             products on the painful areas.

          -  Treatment for acute opportunistic infections within 14 days before Treatment Visit
             (Day 0). Maintenance treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, Mycobacterium avium
             bacteremia, or cryptococcal meningitis is permitted.

          -  Current use of any investigational drug, or Class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs (such as
             tocainide and mexiletine).

          -  Hypersensitivity to capsaicin (i.e., chili peppers or OTC capsaicin products), local
             anesthetics, Roxicodone or adhesives.

          -  Significant ongoing or untreated abnormalities in cardiac, renal, hepatic, or
             pulmonary function that may interfere either with the ability to complete the study or
             the evaluation of adverse events.

          -  Currently have active malignant disease. Malignancies in remission that do not require
             further treatment or Kaposi's sarcoma requiring local treatment only are allowed.

          -  High tolerance to opioids that precludes the ability to relieve treatment-associated
             discomfort with Roxicodone® if needed, as judged by investigator.

          -  History or current problem with prescription drug, illicit substance, or alcohol abuse
             from self report or as judged by investigator.
