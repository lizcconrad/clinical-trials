      This study will examine how West Nile virus (WNV) infection affects the body. Some people
      infected with WNV have no symptoms. In others, symptoms may vary from fever and headache to a
      polio-like syndrome with paralysis, to coma and brain changes like those of a stroke. Many
      patients recover with no lasting effects, while a few can have long-lasting neurological
      damage or may die. This study will collect clinical, laboratory, diagnostic, and radiographic
      information on people thought to have WNV to better understand the disease.

      Patients 18 years of age and older diagnosed with or suspected of having West Nile virus
      infection may be eligible for this study. Patients will be hospitalized until they are well
      enough to go home and will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination: A thorough history and physical examination
           will be done on the first day of the study. Then, brief physical exams, including
           measures of blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature, will be done
           during each day of hospitalization and at every follow-up clinic visit (at 2 weeks and
           at 1, 3, and 6 months).

        -  Blood tests: Blood samples will be collected on the first day of the study, at day 7, at
           hospital discharge, and at follow-up visits to determine if virus remains in the blood
           and how it is affecting the body.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI scans will be done within 72 hours of beginning
           the study and 1 month after that. This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves
           to produce images of the brain that might show abnormalities in the brains of patients
           with WNV and reveal whether the abnormalities can predict how an individual will
           recover. For the procedure, the patient lies on a table that is moved into the narrow
           tunnel-like scanner. During the procedure, a contrast agent that brightens the images is
           injected through a catheter placed in an arm vein.

        -  Neurological examination and neurological function tests: Participants will be tested to
           see if the West Nile virus has affected their thinking and ability to perform normal
           daily activities. These tests will be done at the start of the study, on days 3 and 7
           (also days 2, 4, 5, and 6 if patients are still in the hospital), at discharge, and at
           follow-up visits. The tests involve answering a number of questions and performing
           simple tasks, such as squeezing a hand or lifting a foot.

        -  Patients who develop weakness in their arms or legs will also have the following
           studies:

             1. Electromyography (EMG) to study the electrical activity of the muscle. For this
                test, needles are placed into a muscle to record the electrical activity at that
                site.

             2. Nerve conduction studies to measure how well the nerves are working. A small charge
                of electricity is delivered to a nerve in the affected limb, triggering a muscle to
                tighten or bend. Small wire electrodes are attached to the skin to measure the time
                is takes for the nerve to move the electrical current from one part of the limb to
                another.

             3. Spinal MRI to see if the virus is affecting the spinal cord.

      Results of other tests done by the patient's local doctor (such as lumbar puncture,
      electroencephalogram, x-rays, etc.) will be requested. If a lumbar puncture is done, a small
      amount of cerebrospinal fluid will be requested for testing for WNV.

      Investigation of the Natural History of West Nile Virus Infection in Patients with Recently
      Acquired West Nile Fever or Neuroinvasive Disease is a descriptive natural history study.
      Since the first reports of WNV disease in North America in 1999, geographic range has
      expanded, a trend that is expected to continue for the near future. There are few
      sequentially collected clinical, radiologic and laboratory data from patients with WNV
      disease. Standardized data collection tools to measure neurologic outcome have not been
      developed. Prospectively collected data on laboratory and clinical events associated with WNV
      infection are needed to bridge gaps in current knowledge of this disease and to assist with
      the design of better treatments. The objectives of this study are to identify and describe
      the mortality and morbidity, specifically the neurologic and functional outcomes of patients
      with confirmed WNV disease in order to characterize the clinical course and diverse
      manifestations, and to assess kinetics of humoral immune responses to WNV infection,
      correlating these responses with clinical outcomes. Eligible patients fall into two
      categories: those with neuroinvasive disease caused by WNV infection, and those with WNV
      fever who received medical attention for their illness. All subjects must have had illness
      onset within four months prior to enrollment and must have laboratory confirmation of the
      diagnosis. There will be study visits at Days 1, 14, 30, 90, 180, and 365. Evaluations will
      include serum and cerebrospinal fluid for determination of WNV IgM/IgG levels and PCR for
      WNV, urine PCR for WNV, physical examination, serial neurologic examinations, a baseline MRI
      scan, and four functional and cognitive assessments that have been validated in neurologic
      illness in adults: the Barthel Index (BI), the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS), the Glasgow
      Outcome Score (GOS) and the modified Mini-Mental Status Examination (3MS). The subset of
      study participants who develop motor weakness of an extremity (ies) will have
      electromyograms, nerve conduction studies and spinal MRI performed. Results from selected
      clinically indicated tests (done by study participants' physicians, not mandated for the
      study) will be recorded in the Case Record Forms (CRFs).

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients, regardless of race or gender, who consent and meet entry criteria will be
        enrolled, according to the following criteria. Note: Due to the low case incidence and the
        lack of validation of the neurologic scoring systems in children, enrollment will be
        restricted to adults. Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled: Neuroinvasive Disease and
        West Nile Fever.

        Greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

        Documented WNV infection (fever or neuroinvasive disease) that began within four months
        prior to study entry. Illnesss onset is defined as the first visit to a medical care
        provider where compatible symptoms (see cohort A or B below) are documented.

        Local laboratory documentation of WNV infection as defined by positive IgM and/or PCR for
        WNV in serum or CSF concurrent with or following illness onset.

        Qualification for Cohort A or B:

        A. Neuroinvasive Disease Cohort:

        absence of a more likely clinical explanation:

          -  Acutely altered mental status (e.g., disorientation, obtundation, stupor, or coma),

          -  Other acute signs of central or peripheral neurologic dysfunction (e.g., paresis or
             paralysis, nerve palsies, sensory deficits, abnormal reflexes, generalized

          -  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (white blood cell count greater than or equal to
             4 per mm(3) corrected for red blood cell contamination in CSF) associated with illness
             clinically compatible with meningitis (e.g., headache or stiff neck)

        B. West Nile Fever Cohort:

        - Temperature greater than 38 C as documented by a health care provider.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Unable to obtain valid informed consent.
