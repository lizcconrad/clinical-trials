    <textblock>
      This study will examine the ways in which schizophrenia-related symptoms affect response to a
      rehabilitation program for people with schizophrenia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia often suffer neurocognitive impairment and psychosocial and
      vocational difficulties. This study will help identify those patients most likely to benefit
      from existing behavioral treatments and provide clues for how to modify treatments for those
      who do not benefit.

      Two studies will be conducted. The first will investigate the relationship of symptoms and
      neurocognitive variables at study entry to psychosocial and vocational status 2 years later.
      The second study will investigate the relationship of symptoms and neurocognitive variables
      at study entry to treatment response in patients assigned to either a cognitive remediation
      track or a computer skills track as part of their rehabilitation treatment.

      Both the cognitive remediation and computer skills training programs will last 4 to 6 months.
      Participants will be assessed pre- and post-treatment. Neuropsychological, psychosocial and
      vocational status will be measured.
