      COX-2 is an enzyme that is found in several different tissues in the body. COX-2 appears to
      produce a substance called prostaglandins, mainly at sites of inflammation. Several drugs
      have been approved by the FDA that inhibit COX-2 such as celecoxib, or brand name CelebrexÂ®.
      These drugs are primarily used in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis to
      decrease inflammation and pain. COX-2 inhibitors have been developed because they are more
      selective in treatment of inflammation and pain and tend to have fewer gastrointestinal side
      effects than NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen,
      naproxen, etc.

      The normal adult kidney expresses COX-2 in various regions. Prostaglandins, which are
      produced in the kidney by COX-2, may contribute to glomerular and tubulointerstitial
      inflammatory diseases (types of kidney diseases due to inflammation). In some animal studies,
      COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to be potentially beneficial in reducing the amount of
      protein spilled in the urine and preserving kidney function with these inflammatory kidney
      diseases. This study will compare the effects of COX-2 inhibitor to placebo (an inactive
      substance) in patients with diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease due to diabetes) and
      proteinuria (spilling protein in the urine) on 24-hour urinary protein excretion.

      This study is designed to see whether COX-2 inhibitors are useful in treating diabetic
      patients with kidney disease. The purpose of this study is a short-term pilot study that will
      allow the gathering of important data such as the ability to carry out the study and carry it
      out safely. Subjects with proteinuria and diabetic kidney disease already on ACE
      (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) inhibitor or ARB (Angiotensin Receptor Blocker) therapy
      (types of blood pressure medicines) will be randomized to a type of study in which each
      subject will serve as their own control. The study is set up so that each subject will
      receive either the COX-2 inhibitor or placebo for a period followed by a period of no drug
      and then followed by a period of receiving either the COX-2 inhibitor or placebo (whichever
      they did not receive the first period).

      The study is designed with a screening period, a baseline period and a treatment period. The
      purpose of screening is to identify eligible subjects and to exclude ineligible subjects. A
      careful history and physical examination will be conducted to ensure that the subject meets
      all the inclusion criteria and does not meet any of the exclusion criteria. The screening
      period lasts from 2 days to 2 months in duration.

      The baseline period is from 2 - 3 months in duration. During the first baseline visit, there
      is withdrawal of previously used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin
      receptor antagonists (if any) and the initiation of quinapril 20 mg daily therapy (or
      irbesartan --150 - 300 mg daily). The subject will then be seen as frequently as determined
      by the investigator for subject's safety. The purpose of the second baseline visit is to
      determine safety after the initiation of therapy quinapril 20 mg po per day (or irbesartan
      150 - 300 mg per day). The purpose of third baseline visit is to insure that the subject
      meets all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria prior to randomization. In
      addition, it will be assured that the subject's blood pressure is at a safe level to proceed
      with randomization and the laboratory and urinary collections will be made.

      Only those subjects who fulfill all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will proceed
      to randomization. Also, in order to proceed to the randomization phase of the study, the
      subject must have a blood pressure of less than or equal to 135/85mmHg.

      The treatment phase will consist of 18 weeks. During the treatment phase, the subject will be
      followed for safety and efficacy. The subjects will be randomly assigned to COX-2 inhibitor
      for 6 weeks (1st 6 week cycle), washout 3 weeks, placebo 6 weeks (2nd 6 week cycle), washout
      3 weeks or to placebo 6 weeks (1st 6 week cycle), washout 3 weeks, COX-2 inhibitor 6 weeks
      (2nd 6 week cycle), washout 3 weeks.

      During baseline and treatment periods, interim visits will be held in order to address blood
      pressure control or other problems that the patient or the PI deems necessary for protocol
      adherence.
