      This study will examine whether the drug pyrimethamine can shrink lymph nodes and spleen in
      patients with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). In this disease, lymphocytes
      (white blood cells) do not die as they normally would. As a result, patients have enlarged
      lymph glands, spleen, or liver, and other problems that may involve blood cell counts and
      autoimmune disease (overactivity of the immune system). Pyrimethamine is an orally
      administered antibiotic that has been used to treat or prevent malaria and toxoplasma, and
      may be effective in shrinking lymph nodes and spleen.

      Patients with ALPS who are between 2 and 70 years of age and have had lymph gland enlargement
      for at least 1 year may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a
      medical history and physical examination, blood tests, and possibly a bone marrow test.
      Females of reproductive age will be screened with a urine pregnancy test. Women who are
      capable of becoming pregnant must use an effective method of birth control during the entire
      study period, because, taken during early months of pregnancy, pyrimethamine can cause birth
      defects in the fetus. Women who are pregnant or nursing are excluded from the study.

      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  CT scan: For this test, the patient lies still in the CT scanner while images are taken
           of the neck, chest, and stomach area. A contrast dye is injected into a vein to brighten
           the CT images. Very young children will be evaluated on a case by case basis to
           determine whether a CT scan will be performed.

        -  Bone marrow biopsy: Participants undergo this test to rule out underlying bone marrow
           disease if they have not had a bone marrow test done in the last six months prior to
           enrolling in pyrimethamine study, as pyrimethamine can affect bone marrow function.
           Under local anesthesia, a needle is inserted into the back part of the hipbone and a
           small amount of marrow is removed. (Children are sedated for this test.)

        -  Leukapheresis: This is a procedure for collecting a small proportion of circulating
           white blood cells while conserving the majority of blood cells. Specifically, blood is
           drawn from a needle placed in an arm vein and is directed into a cell separator machine,
           which separates the blood cells by spinning. A small proportion of circulating white
           cells are removed, and the red cells, platelets, plasma and majority of white cells are
           returned to the patient's blood circulation. Only patients who are 7 years of age or
           older and weigh at least 55 pounds undergo this procedure. Other participants who choose
           not to have apheresis will have about 3 tablespoons of blood drawn instead.

        -  Pyrimethamine administration: When the above tests are completed, participants begin
           taking pyrimethamine. The dose is determined according to the individual's weight and is
           gradually increased during the study period. Patients take the drug twice a week for a
           total of 12 weeks.

        -  Blood tests: Blood samples are collected during weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 after beginning
           treatment, and 2 weeks after the last dose of pyrimethamine. The purpose of these blood
           tests is to check for possible drug-related side effects. Patients who develop a skin
           rash, mouth sores or other side effects may have one or more doses of the treatment drug
           withheld. When indicated, the patient will be directed to stop taking the study drug. If
           needed, drug side effects will be treated with a vitamin supplement, folinic acid, taken
           by mouth, 3 times weekly.

        -  Evaluations at the NIH Clinical Center will comprise of a pretreatment visit, one end of
           treatment visit at the end of 12 weeks and an optional post-treatment visit 3months
           after stopping pyrimethamine therapy.

      Patients who respond well to treatment may be asked to return to NIH for additional visits at
      3, 6, and 12 months after the treatment has ended for repeat evaluations. If their lymph
      glands or spleen become much larger after stopping pyrimethamine, they will be offered
      treatment for another 12 weeks. If they respond to the second course of treatment, they will
      return to NIH again after 3, 6, and 12 months. If the symptoms return again, patients will be
      asked to resume treatment for an additional 6 months or more. They will have blood drawn
      periodically by their private physician and will return to NIH for evaluation every 12 weeks.

      The Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome (ALPS) is an inherited disease associated with a
      defect of lymphocyte apoptosis that leads to lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. Although,
      there are treatments for many of its complications, there currently is no safe and effective
      therapy for this syndrome itself. Recently investigators in Europe serendipitously observed
      that some children with ALPS showed reductions in spleen and lymph node size while in
      pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (Fansidar) for Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis. Our own subsequent
      pilot clinical trial of Fansidar (Protocol #01-I-0132) was terminated after failure to
      recruit well-defined ALPS patients who lacked histories suspicious for allergies to sulfa
      drugs. Our own in vitro studies, however revealed that pyrimethamine and not sulfadoxine
      induces lymphocyte apoptosis and this observation has suggested to us that pyrimethamine may
      be beneficial alone, thus avoiding the added risks of allergy and hypersensitivity associated
      with the sulfa drugs. However, potential bone marrow toxicity that may result from an
      escalating dose schedule of pyrimethamine should respond to the addition of folinic acid
      (Leucovorin) to the regimen.

      We propose to conduct a pilot study on the safety and efficacy of the drug, pyrimethamine for
      the treatment of ALPS. Six to 8 individuals, with ALPS will be treated for up to 3 months,
      initially, with twice-weekly pyrimethamine (Daraprim) at escalating doses adjusted by weight,
      with the addition of folinic acid when needed to aid management of marrow toxicity. The
      effects of pyrimethamine treatment on lymph node and/or spleen size will be assessed by CT
      scan. The effect of treatment on other laboratory features of ALPS will also be assessed.
      Evaluating the effects of pyrimethamine on these clinical and laboratory parameters will
      allow us to determine if this drug demonstrates sufficient activity to warrant study in a
      larger randomized controlled trial.
