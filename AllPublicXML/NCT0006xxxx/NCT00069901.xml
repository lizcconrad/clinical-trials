  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT-2103
      (poly(L)glutamate-paclitaxel) in combination with carboplatin for the treatment of patients
      with Stage III or IV ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT-2103 is a pharmaceutical that links paclitaxel, the active ingredient in Taxol(R), to a
      biodegradable polyglutamate polymer. The objective of this trial is to evaluate the toxicity,
      estimate the response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with
      newly diagnosed stage III or IV ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma treated with CT-2103
      in combination with carboplatin.
