  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of interpersonal psychotherapy,
      behavioral weight loss interventions, and guided self help treatments in treating binge
      eating disorder (BED).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BED is a serious condition that is associated with psychiatric comorbidity, psychosocial
      impairment, and obesity. Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), behavioral weight loss (BWL)
      interventions, and guided self help (GSH) treatments for BED have been evaluated, but the
      safest and most effective treatment has not yet been identified. This study will determine
      which of these three treatments is most effective in treating BED.

      Participants are stratified by negative affect subtype and are randomly assigned for 6 months
      to one of three treatment groups: IPT, BWL, or GSH. IPT focuses on current interpersonal
      problems which are hypothesized to increase negative affect and lead to binge eating. BWL
      interventions involve the adoption of weight loss inducing behaviors. GSH is a shortened
      version of cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses directly on eating behavior. IPT and BWL
      patients have 20 treatment sessions; those receiving GSH have 10 sessions. Assessments are
      made pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment is
      complete.
