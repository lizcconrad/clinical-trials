  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 clinical trial is a multi-center, open-label study with three main objectives.
      The first (Phase 1A) is to determine the maximum-tolerated dose of DN-101 when administered
      in combination with Taxotere (docetaxel) every three weeks (closed). The second is to
      determine the maximum-tolerated dose of DN-101 when administered weekly in combination with
      Taxotere(docetaxel)devery three weeks (open). The third is to evaluate the safety and
      objective tumor response rate of the combination in NSCLC. DN-101 doses will be escalated at
      three dosing levels. Patients will receive oral DN-101 on day one, followed by intravenous
      docetaxel on day two of a 21-day cycle. Treatment cycles will be repeated at the same dose
      level each 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      DN-101 is an oral anti-cancer therapy for solid tumors and various hematologic malignancies.
      DN-101 is a unique formulation of calcitriol specifically designed for use in cancer.
      Calcitriol is a naturally occurring hormone and the most potent biologically active form of
      vitamin D. In high doses, calcitriol is active in many laboratory and animal models of cancer
      and synergistic with many commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Until recently, the clinical
      use of calcitriol as an anti-cancer therapy was limited by hypercalcemia at doses required
      for anti-tumor activity. Based upon clinical results to date, Novacea believes it has
      successfully developed a solution to this problem through development of DN-101.

      Chemotherapy for NSCLC, while not curative, has been shown to prolong survival in patients
      with unresectable disease. A number of different chemotherapy agents have been shown to have
      single-agent activity in NSCLC. These include cisplatin, carboplatin, vinorelbine,
      gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel. For first-line therapy of Stage IIIB or Stage IV
      NSCLC, these agents are generally used in combination. In most cases, first-line chemotherapy
      consists of a platinum-based agent, either cisplatin or carboplatin, and another
      chemotherapeutic.

      Only one agent, Taxotere®, has been approved in the United States by the Food and Drug
      Administration for use as second-line chemotherapy in NSCLC.
