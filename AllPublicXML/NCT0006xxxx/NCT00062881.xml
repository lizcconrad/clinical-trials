      This research study is an investigational treatment with the experimental drug Mafosfamide.
      This treatment is only for children with cancer that has spread to the meninges (tissues that
      cover the spinal column and brain) and has continued to grow despite treatment with standard
      therapy.

      Mafosfamide is a drug reported to have antitumor effects in animals and that has been given
      safely into the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid within and surrounding the brain) in a small
      number of children and adults. Since there is limited experience in adults and children in
      giving mafosfamide in this way, the main purpose of this study is to determine the
      appropriate safe dose of mafosfamide when given intrathecally, that is directly into the
      cerebrospinal fluid.

      The purposes for this study are to (a) determine what dose of mafosfamide can be safely given
      into the cerebrospinal fluid through an Ommaya reservoir (surgically implanted catheters used
      to sample cerebrospinal fluid and to instill medication into the cerebrospinal fluid) and
      lumbar puncture (spinal tap) or lumbar reservoir; (b) look for side effects of drug
      treatment; (c) to study the pharmacology (how the human body handles the drug) when given
      directly into the spinal fluid; and (d) see if this drug is beneficial to the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mafosfamide is given directly into the cerebrospinal fluid twice a week for six successive
      weeks. If after six weeks the disease has not shown any evidence of progression (tumor
      growth) patients will continue to receive intrathecal (I.T.) mafosfamide once a week for one
      month, followed by twice monthly (every other week) for four months, followed by once a
      month. Patients may continue to receive mafosfamide as long as unacceptable side effects do
      not occur and there is no growth of the tumor.

      Patients will have a weekly physical exam and blood tests. The cerebrospinal fluid will be
      tested each time they receive drug for the presence of cancer cells. If the patient has an
      Ommaya reservoir (a surgically implanted catheter that is used to sample cerebrospinal fluid
      from the fluid chambers in the head and to install medication into the cerebrospinal fluid)
      then the doctor may recommend that they receive one dose of mafosfamide through the Ommaya
      reservoir and the next dose via lumbar puncture (spinal tap) or lumbar reservoir. A lumbar
      reservoir is a catheter that is surgically implanted into the lower back. This catheter is
      used to sample cerebrospinal fluid and to install medication into the cerebrospinal fluid.

      All patients must be observed for a minimum of eight hours after the first dose of
      intrathecal mafosfamide. If the first dose is well tolerated (there are no major side
      effects), further doses of mafosfamide will be administered with close observation for at
      least two hours after administration during the first six weeks of drug administration.
      Administration of the mafosfamide and sampling of the cerebrospinal fluid from the Ommaya
      reservoir, lumbar reservoir, or spinal tap takes about 30 minutes. In addition, after
      mafosfamide has been given by lumbar puncture, patients must remain lying down on their
      stomach for one hour.

      In patients who have Ommaya reservoirs or lumbar catheters, samples of spinal fluid will be
      taken from the reservoirs following the first two doses of mafosfamide. For each series of
      tests, a total of eight spinal fluid samples will be taken with a needle from the Ommaya
      reservoir over a period of 24 hours after the dose. A spinal tap will be also be performed
      two hours after the dose on these two days. If you have a lumbar reservoir, eight spinal
      fluid samples will be taken with a needle from the Ommaya reservoir, over a period of 24
      hours after the dose. These samples of cerebrospinal fluid will be used to measure the amount
      of mafosfamide found in the cerebrospinal fluid at the time they are drawn. This will help us
      understand how the body handles mafosfamide.

      For patients with leukemia, a bone marrow aspiration (taking some bone marrow out of the
      pelvis bone) is necessary before receiving intrathecal mafosfamide. This is to make sure that
      there is no cancer in the bone marrow.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Over 3 years of age with meningeal malignancies that are progressive or refractory to
             conventional therapy. Patients with meningeal malignancies secondary to an underlying
             solid tumor are eligible at initial diagnosis if there is no conventional therapy.

          -  Patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or other solid tumor who also have overt meningeal
             involvement by their tumor.

          -  Must have a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks and an ECOG performance status of 2 or
             better.

          -  Must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational
             nature of this study.

          -  Patients must have recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior intrathecal
             chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy, prior to entering this study and must be
             without significant systemic illness (e.g. infection). Patients must not have received
             any CNS therapy within 1 week prior to starting treatment on this study or
             craniospinal irradiation within 8 weeks prior to starting treatment on this study.
             Patients must not have received intrathecal chemotherapy within 1 week (2 weeks if
             prior DTC101).

          -  Must not have clinically significant abnormalities with regard to liver function,
             renal function or metabolic parameters (electrolytes, calcium and phosphorus).

          -  Durable Power of Attorney (DPA): A DPA must be offered to all patients â‰¥ 18 years of
             age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving other therapy (either intrathecal or systemic) designed specifically to
             treat their meningeal malignancy are not eligible for this study. However, patients
             receiving concomitant chemotherapy to control systemic or bulk CNS disease will be
             eligible, provided the systemic chemotherapy is not a phase I agent, an agent which
             significantly penetrates the CNS (e.g., high dose methotrexate, (&gt; 1 gm/m2), thiotepa,
             high dose cytarabine, (&gt; 2 gm/m2 per day), 5-fluorouracil, intravenous
             6-mercaptopurine or topotecan), or an agent known to have serious unpredictable CNS
             side effects.

          -  Clinical evidence of obstructive hydrocephalus or compartmentalization of the CSF flow
             as documented by a radioisotope Indium111 or Technitium99-DTPA flow study are not
             eligible for this protocol. If a CSF flow block or compartmentalization is
             demonstrated, focal radiotherapy to the site of block to restore flow and a repeat CSF
             flow study showing clearing of the blockage is required for the patient to be eligible
             for the study.

          -  Patients who have leukemia or lymphoma and a concomitant bone marrow relapse.

          -  Women of childbearing age must not be pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients must not have received any other systemic investigational agent within 14
             days prior to, or during, study treatment. The 14 day period should be extended if the
             patient received any investigational agent which is known to have delayed toxicities
             after 14 days. Patients must not have received any other intrathecal investigational
             within 7 days prior to, or during, study treatment. The 7 day period should be
             extended if the patient received any investigational agent which is known to have
             delayed toxicities after 7 days or a prolonged half-life.
