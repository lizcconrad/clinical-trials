    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational
      chemotherapy agent in patients with types of advanced cancer referred to as liposarcoma or
      leiomyosarcoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (patients will know the names of the study drugs they receive),
      randomized (patients will be assigned by chance to receive 1 of 2 treatment schedules with
      trabectidin) study designed to examine the the survival, safety, and pharmacokinetics (blood
      levels) trabectedin when administered to patients with 2 types of cancer (Liposarcoma or
      Leiomyosarcoma) who have received treatment with other anti-cancer therapy (Anthracycline
      and/or Ifosfamide). Trabectedin (also referred to as Yondelis) is a drug being developed to
      treat patients with cancer. Yondelis will be administered intravenously (i.v.) via a central
      catheter (tube) into a central vein once a week (0.58 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion on Days 1,
      8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle) or once every 3 weeks (1.5 mg/m2 administered as a
      24-hour infusion on Day 1 of every 21-day treatment cycle) until disease progression.
      Patients in each arm will be pretreated with 20 mg of dexamethasone i.v. 30 minutes prior to
      each infusion.

      <recruitment_details>This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of of trabectedin in participants with locally advanced or metastatic L-sarcoma whose disease had relapsed or become refractory after treatment with an anthracycline and ifosfamide. The study was conducted between 12 May 2003 and 23 April 2008 and recruited participants from 9 countries worldwide.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>In this study 271 participants were enrolled of which 270 participants (134 in the Trabectedin 1.5 mg/m2 group and 136 in the Trabectedin 0.58 mg/m2 group) were randomized as 1 participant was enrolled twice. Of these, 260 participants were treated with trabectedin including 130 participants in each treatment group.</pre_assignment_details>
