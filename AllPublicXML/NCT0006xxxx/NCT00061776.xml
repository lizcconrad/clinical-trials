      The purpose of the study is determine if an investigational drug, NGX-4010
      (high-concentration capsaicin dermal patches) is effective in treating pain associated with
      post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive initial treatment according to one of three
      doses (application durations), and will receive either NGX-4010 patch (high-concentration
      capsaicin) or matching control (low-concentration capsaicin).

      Participants who complete the study evaluations for 12 weeks will have the option of
      receiving up to 3 additional open-label re-treatments over 1 year.
