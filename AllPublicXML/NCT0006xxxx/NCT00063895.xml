  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of erlotinib and to see how well it works
      in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian
      cancer, or squamous cell carcinoma (cancer) of the head and neck. Erlotinib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if a significant correlation exists between the length of the CA dinucleotide
      repeat polymorphism in the EGFR gene and observed toxicity in patients treated with OSI-774.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the pharmacodynamic effects of OSI-774 on EGFR activity and MAP kinase signaling
      using skin as a surrogate tissue.

      II. To determine if interindividual variation of OSI-774 pharmacokinetics is related to a
      previously described CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism.

      III. To evaluate whether toxicity or inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation correlates with
      OSI-774 AUC in patients treated with OSI-774.

      IV. To describe the observed anti-tumor response and toxicities in patients with advanced
      solid tumors treated with single agent fixed dose of OSI-774.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to length of CA
      dinucleotide repeat polymorphism (short vs medium vs long).

      Patients receive oral erlotinib on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The relationship between toxicity and AUC evaluated by fitting ordinal (proportional odds) logistic regression models in which the grade of toxicity is the dependent variable and AUC is the independent or predictor variable. If the proportional odds model does not provide a good fit to the data then the toxicity grade will be dichotomized and analyzed using and analyzed using ordinary logistic regression.</description>

          -  Eligible patients must have been off previous anticancer therapy including
             chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological therapy, or other investigational therapy for
             at least 4 weeks before study entry (6 weeks if prior therapy included nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C)

          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/ul

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/ul

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/ul

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73
             m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Patients must have measurable or assessable disease

          -  The effects of OSI-774 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier;
             patients with prior treatment with small molecule inhibitors of EGFR, including
             erlotinib and gefitinib, are not eligible for this study

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with uncontrolled brain metastasis; patients with brain metastases must have
             stable neurologic status following local therapy (surgery or radiation) for at least 4
             weeks, and must be without neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation
             of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to OSI-774

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because OSI-774 is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with OSI-774, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with either agent

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with OSI-774 or other
             agents administered during the study; appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients with significant ophthalmologic abnormalities, including: severe dry eye
             syndrome, kerato-conjunctivitis sicca, Sjogren's syndrome, severe exposure
             keratopathy, disorders that might increase the risk for epithelium-related
             complications (e.g. bullous keratopathy, aniridia, severe chemical burns, neutrophilic
             keratitis); patients with mild forms of any of the above, an asymptomatic history, or
             a normal ophthalmologic examination may be considered for inclusion at the discretion
             of the investigator; an ophthalmologic exam is not needed prior to this study unless
             clinically indicated; patients with treatable conditions (e.g. infectious
             keratitis/conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis) may be reevaluated for study
             eligibility after treatment or resolution of the condition; use of contact lenses
             during the course of this trial may increase the risk of corneal complications and
             will be strongly discouraged

          -  Serious, non-healing wound ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 14 days
             prior to Day 1; following such procedures or injuries, wound healing should be evident
             prior to initiation of therapy
