    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase researchers understanding of the biological basis of
      generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder. They will investigate how the brain
      activity associated with specific thoughts and feelings may play a role in these anxiety
      disorders. This knowledge will be used to design interventions to help those with these
      illnesses.

      To qualify for this study, participants must be evaluated via an initial telephone screening
      interview and material sent through the mail.

      Participants will then be required to make three visits to NIH. During the first visit, they
      will be asked questions about their general mood, degree of nervousness, thinking skills, and
      behavior. They will undergo a thorough physical exam, including an EKG, blood work,
      urinalysis, and a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. During the second
      visit, participants will spend about 2.5 hours doing various tasks while sitting and looking
      at a computer screen. These tasks will guide them to experience specific kinds of thoughts
      and emotions. Researchers will attach electrodes to the participants hands to monitor the
      amount of electricity conducted by the skin. The third visit will be similar to the second
      visit, but participants will perform the tasks while lying in a MRI scanner.

      Participants will be compensated up to $400 for their involvement in this study.

      There have been suggestions that the threshold for amygdala activity is lower in individuals
      with anxiety disorders than in healthy individuals. However, despite it's immediate
      plausibility, there have been relatively few tests of this hypothesis. Specifically, there
      have been very few explorations of the performance of patients with anxiety disorders on
      measures known to implicate the amygdala.

      Although the high co-morbidity of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Social Anxiety
      Disorder (SAD) complicates the issue, the fact that the disorders doubly dissociate suggests
      that they are due to dysfunctional activity in separable neurocognitive systems. We would
      suggest that the hyper-responsive amygdala hypothesis is more likely to be linked to the
      explanation of GAD. In contrast, SAD may be due to reduced activation thresholds for units in
      a system that responds to social threat and which recruits lateral orbital frontal cortex.
      Thus, the current project will determine the performance of patients with GAD and SAD on
      measures in which the amygdala is known to play a role and also measures that recruit lateral
      orbital frontal cortex and the system for social response reversal. In addition, two proposed
      neuro-imaging studies will directly assess neural responses in these two systems in both
      patient populations. The project should provide clear data that will constrain future
      theorizing on the pathology implicated in these two disorders.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: Participants will be males and females, 18-50 years of age.

        IQ: IQ, as measured by 4 subscales from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised
        (WAIS-R), must be &gt; 80.

        Medication status: No regular use of psychotropic medication within 2 weeks of the study
        (or fluoxetine within 8 weeks of the study). No regular use of any benzodiazepine. We
        intend to identify patients whose GAD/SAD is currently untreated.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Because factors such as psychiatric disease, or CNS disease, can influence functional brain
        activity, and pregnancy precludes participation in fMRI studies, these factors are
        exclusionary.

          1. Psychiatric history: Participants will be assessed using DSM-IV criteria via
             standardized psychiatric interviews conducted by trained examiners (i.e., SCID). Any
             current suicidal ideation will be exclusionary.

               1. Healthy comparison individuals (Group 1): All participants will be free of any
                  current psychiatric disorder as well as lifetime history of psychosis, pervasive
                  developmental disorder, major affective disorder, panic disorder, obsessive
                  compulsive disorder, conduct disorder, ADHD, anorexia.

               2. Patients with GAD (Group 2): Any history of an axis I diagnosis excluding SAD but
                  not including adjustment disorder, simple phobia or dysthymia is exclusionary.
                  There must be no current mood disoder (MD) though patients with past MD, which
                  occurred after the onset of GAD, will be admitted to the study. We recognize the
                  difficulty of recruiting patients with GAD without co-morbid SAD and will
                  therefore allow patients who are comorbid into the study in this group. We have
                  faced difficulties with our studies of children with psychopathic tendencies
                  where, although it is possible to identify populations who only meet criteria for
                  ADHD most children who meet criteria for psychopathic tendencies are co-morbid
                  for ADHD. We will adopt a similar strategy to our work with children; i.e., in
                  contrasts of patients with GAD with comparison individuals, we will use SAD
                  symptomatology as a covariate to reduce, and evaluate, the impact of pathology
                  associated with SAD on the data.

               3. Patients with SAD (Group 3): Any current history of an axis I diagnosis including
                  GAD, but excluding adjustment disorder, simple phobia or dysthymia is
                  exclusionary. There must be no current mood disorder (MD) though patients with
                  past MD, which occurred after the onset of SAD, will be admitted to the study.

          2. History of Drug Abuse: Axis I diagnoses of substance use disorders will be
             exclusionary.

          3. Severe acute and chronic medical illnesses.

          4. CNS disease: History of brain abnormalities (e.g., neoplasms, subarachnoid cysts),
             cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g., abscess), or other neurological
             disease, or history of head trauma (defined as loss of consciousness &gt; 3 min).

          5. Metal or electronic objects: Metal plates, certain types of dental braces, cardiac
             pacemakers, etc., that are sensitive to electromagnetic fields contraindicate MRI
             scans.

          6. Claustrophobia: Participants will be questioned about potential discomfort in being in
             an enclosed space, such as an MRI scanner.

          7. Pregnancy status: Because of the potential effects of hormonal changes on brain
             function as well as the unknown effects of electromagnetic field on the fetus, known
             pregnancy is an exclusion criterion.
