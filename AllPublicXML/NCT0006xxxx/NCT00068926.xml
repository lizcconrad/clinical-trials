      This protocol will screen healthy normal volunteers for participation in studies of vaccines
      under development at NIAID's Vaccine Research Center. Of interest are vaccines for:

        -  Newly identified infectious diseases such as SARS.

        -  Infectious diseases of concern as possible bioweapons, such as smallpox and Ebola virus

        -  Emerging infectious diseases that are more widespread geographically than in the past,
           such as West Nile virus

        -  For preventing diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 70 years of age may be eligible for this protocol.
      Screening begins about 1 to 6 months before the start of the vaccine study. Participants will
      have a physical examination and health history, including questions about sexual activity and
      drug use. Over the course of the screening visits, participants will be asked to give urine
      and blood samples to test for various infections and other medical problems. Women capable of
      getting pregnant will be given a pregnancy test. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding will
      not be enrolled in the study.

      At the end of the screening, participants will be informed about which vaccines are currently
      being tested in clinical trials for which they may be eligible. Once participants enroll in a
      vaccine study, their participation in the screening protocol ends.

      STUDY DESIGN: The purpose of the study is to screen potential study volunteers to determine
      if they are eligible for infectious disease vaccine clinical trials being sponsored by the
      Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the NIH Clinical Center. All work will be conducted by the
      VRC Clinic of the National Institutes of Health or IRB-approved extramural sites that are
      collaborating with the VRC Clinic. Educational materials on vaccines will be reviewed with
      and provided to subjects before enrollment into the study.

      SUBJECTS: Approximately 3,000 healthy adults; age 18-70 years.

      STUDY DURATION: Duration of participation is variable, and may last from a few weeks to
      several months for each subject. Study participation is complete when the subject enrolls in
      a vaccine study, is found to be ineligible for all vaccine studies or declines to participate
      in any vaccine studies.

      STUDY EVALUATIONS: Evaluations usually include history, physical examinations and laboratory
      tests. Only those evaluations needed to determine eligibility for a particular study will be
      done. Evaluations other than those described in this protocol may be done if necessary for
      eligibility for a study. Blood will also be collected for storage.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: 18 to 70 years of age

        Available to participate for the planned duration of the investigational vaccine study for
        which the screening is being done (vaccine studies may require 6 months to 18 months of
        clinic visits).

        Able and willing to complete the informed consent process.

        Agree to have blood stored for future studies of the vaccine, the immune system, and/or
        other medical conditions.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Known to be infected with HIV, syphilis, tuberculosis, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

        A condition in which repeated blood draws or injections pose more than minimal risk for the
        subject such as hemophilia, other severe coagulation disorders or significantly impaired
        venous access.

        A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert serious danger
        to the participant's health or well-being.

        Known to be pregnant or breast-feeding.
