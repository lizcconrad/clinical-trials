      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      their growth. It is not yet known whether the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating
      glioblastoma multiforme is decreased in patients who are receiving anticonvulsant drugs and
      undergoing radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating patients who are
      receiving anticonvulsant drugs and undergoing radiation therapy for newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effects of hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs, such as anticonvulsants, on the
           pharmacokinetics of celecoxib in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme
           undergoing radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the effects of steroids on the pharmacokinetics of celecoxib in these
           patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of celecoxib in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on anticonvulsant therapy.

        -  Group A: Patients treated with any of the following anticonvulsant drugs that induce
           hepatic metabolic enzymes:

             -  Phenytoin

             -  Carbamazepine

             -  Phenobarbital

             -  Primidone

             -  Oxcarbazepine

        -  Group B: Patients treated with any of the following anticonvulsant drugs that cause
           modest or no induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes OR no anticonvulsant drug:

             -  Gabapentin

             -  Lamotrigine

             -  Valproic acid

             -  Levetiracetam

             -  Tiagabine

             -  Topiramate

             -  Zonisamide

             -  Felbamate

        -  Induction therapy: Patients in both groups receive oral celecoxib twice* daily on weeks
           1-11 and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week on weeks 2-7.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily. Courses repeat every 4
           weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients receive only 1 dose on the first day of celecoxib administration.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients (22 per group) will be accrued for this study
      within approximately 8 months.

          <title>Mini Mental State Exam Score</title>
          <description>The mini–mental state examination (MMSE) is a 30-point questionnaire test used to screen for cognitive impairment. Commonly used to screen for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time. The MMSE test includes simple questions and problems in a number of areas: the time and place of the test, repeating lists of words, arithmetic such as the serial sevens, language use and comprehension, and basic motor skills. The Higher your score, the higher your function.</description>
