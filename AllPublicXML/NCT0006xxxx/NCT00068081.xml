        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Be in good health.

          -  Diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) made by the primary treating physician or
             Investigator, and at least 3 months post-vesicle crusting.

          -  Screening Pain Sum Score of 12 to 36.

          -  Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area(s) to be treated.

          -  If taking chronic pain medications, be on a stable (not PRN) regimen for at least 21
             days prior to Treatment Visit (Day 0) and willing to maintain medications at same
             stable dose(s) and schedule throughout the study.

          -  Female subjects with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum beta hCG
             pregnancy test, to be performed at the Screening Visit.

          -  All subjects must be willing to use effective methods of birth control and/or refrain
             from participating in a conception process during the study and for 30 days following
             experimental drug exposure.

          -  Be willing and able to comply with protocol requirements for the duration of study
             participation. (Such requirements include, but are not limited to: completing a daily
             pain diary, attending all study visits, and refraining from elective surgery and
             extensive travel during study participation.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant opioid medication, unless orally or transdermally administered and not
             exceeding a total daily dose of morphine 60 mg/day, or equivalent. Parenteral opioid
             use is excluded, regardless of dose.

          -  Unavailability of an effective rescue medication strategy for the subject, such as
             unwillingness to use opioid analgesics during treatment, or high tolerance to opioids
             precluding the ability to relieve treatment-associated discomfort with Roxicodone®, as
             judged by the Investigator.

          -  Active substance abuse or history of chronic substance abuse within the past year, or
             prior chronic substance abuse judged likely to recur during the study period by the
             investigator.

          -  Recent use (within 21 days preceding the Treatment Visit [Day 0]) of any topically
             applied pain medication, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, menthol,
             methyl salicylate, local anesthetics (including Lidoderm®), steroids or capsaicin
             products on the painful areas.

          -  Current use of any investigational agent, or Class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs (such as
             tocainide and mexiletine).

          -  Significant pain of an etiology other than PHN, for example, compression-related
             neuropathies (e.g., spinal stenosis) or fibromyalgia or arthritis. Subjects must not
             have significant ongoing pain from other cause(s) that may interfere with judging
             PHN-related pain.

          -  Painful PHN areas located only on the face, above the hairline of the scalp, and/or in
             proximity to mucous membranes. (Investigational treatment with NGX-4010 is not allowed
             in these areas.)

          -  Any implanted medical device (spinal cord stimulator, intrathecal pump or peripheral
             nerve stimulator) for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

          -  Hypersensitivity to capsaicin (i.e., chili peppers or Over-the-Counter (OTC) capsaicin
             products), local anesthetics, Roxicodone® or adhesives.

          -  Significant ongoing or untreated abnormalities in cardiac, renal, hepatic, or
             pulmonary function that may interfere either with the ability to complete the study or
             the evaluation of adverse events.
