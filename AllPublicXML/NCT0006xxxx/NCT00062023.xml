      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. It is not yet known whether sulindac, aspirin, or
      ursodiol is more effective in preventing colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well sulindac works compared to
      aspirin or ursodiol in preventing colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the percentage change in colorectal aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in patients with
           a history of colorectal cancer or at high risk for colorectal cancer when treated with
           sulindac vs aspirin vs ursodiol.

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of these drugs, in terms of ability to cause
           regression of existing colorectal ACF and prevent new ACF development, in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a partially blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to colorectal neoplasia (adenoma vs carcinoma). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sulindac twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral aspirin once daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral ursodiol three times daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral sulindac placebo twice daily. In all arms, treatment
           continues for 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo a colonoscopy at baseline and at the end of treatment.

      Patients are followed at 2 months after the end of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 172 patients (43 per treatment arm) with a history of
      colorectal cancer or adenomas will be accrued for this study. A total of 20 additional
      patients with no elevated risk of colorectal neoplasia will be accrued, but not randomized,
      for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, age 40-80 years

             carcinoma within 5 years of entry or any stage of colorectal cancer if at least 5
             years post surgical resection (86 subjects)

             following laboratory criteria are met on baseline evaluation: Hgb &gt; 10.0 g/dl,
             platelet count &gt; 100,000/ul; WBC &gt; 3,000/ul; ALT &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal; AST &lt; 2
             x upper limit of normal, and total bilirubin &lt;1.5mg/100ml.

          9. Patients requiring use of hormone modulators such as Tamoxifen or Arimidex will be
             permitted to enroll providing they meet all of the eligibility criteria noted above

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known diagnosis of FAP, hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), or inflammatory
