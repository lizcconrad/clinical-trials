      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitomycin, fluorouracil, and cisplatin, use
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining
      radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether
      radiation therapy and mitomycin are more effective when combined with fluorouracil or with
      cisplatin in treating anal cancer .

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy and
      mitomycin together with fluorouracil works compared to radiation therapy, mitomycin, and
      cisplatin in treating patients with locally advanced anal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Phase II

        -  Primary

             -  Compare the early clinical response (tumor response at 8 weeks) of patients with
                locally advanced anal cancer treated with radiotherapy with mitomycin and cisplatin
                vs mitomycin and fluorouracil.

        -  Secondary

             -  Compare the feasibility of these regimens in these patients.

             -  Compare the acute toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

             -  Compare patient compliance to these regimens.

      Phase III

        -  Primary

             -  Compare the event-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Secondary

             -  Compare colostomy-free, disease-free, and overall survival of patients treated with
                these regimens.

             -  Compare locoregional control in patients treated with these regimens.

             -  Compare the late toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

             -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, T stage (T2 vs T3 vs T4), and nodal status (N0 vs N+). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week on weeks 1-4, 7-8, and 3
           days of week 9 (total of 33 fractions). Patients concurrently receive fluorouracil IV
           continuously on days 1-26 and 43-59 and mitomycin IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 43.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive radiotherapy and mitomycin as in arm I and cisplatin IV over 1
           hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 43, 50, and 57.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at weeks 12 and 26, and then every 6 months for 2
      years.

      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 8 weeks, at week 26, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 678 patients (80 [40 per treatment arm] for phase II and 598
      [299 per treatment arm] for phase III) will be accrued for this study within 2-5 years.
