  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to deterimine if the new orally active iron chelator, ICL670, is
      as effective and as safe as deferoxamine in preventing accumulation of iron in the body while
      a patient is undergoing repeated blood transfusions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who require repeated blood transfusions to live accumulate iron in the body as blood
      cells contain iron and there is no natural body mechanism to eliminate it. After a while the
      iron levels get high enough to be toxic to the body. The current therapy of choice is
      deferoxamine, which does a good job of removing excess iron, but is difficult to administer.
      Deferoxamine requires subcutaneous (under the skin) infusions over 4 to 8 hours nightly 3 to
      7 nights per week. In addition to the need to wear an infusion pump nightly, adverse
      reactions around the site of the injection are frequent.
