  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether dietary nitrates and nitrites can produce nitric oxide in
      the body and dilate blood vessels in patients with coronary artery disease. Nitric oxide is
      normally made by endothelial cells that line blood vessels. It plays an important role in
      maintaining the normal function of arteries by keeping them open and preventing damage from
      substances such as cholesterol in the blood stream. Coronary artery disease is caused by
      atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries or build-up of cholesterol and scar tissue within
      the walls of the arteries). Once arteries become clogged, the ability of the endothelium to
      produce nitric oxide diminishes considerably and may speed up the disease process, leading to
      shortness of breath, chest pain, and an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.

      Patients 21 years of age and older with coronary artery disease may be eligible for this
      study. Participants will have a medical history and physical examination, electrocardiogram
      (recording of the electrical activity of the heart), echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the
      heart), treadmill exercise stress test (see below), and will meet with a dietitian. They will
      be hospitalized at the NIH Clinical Center on two occasions. For 1 week before each
      admission, they will follow a diet prescribed by an NIH nutritionist. The diet before one
      admission will be high in nitrates and nitrites, and the diet before the other admission will
      be low in nitrates and nitrites. Each admission will last 4 days, during which participants
      will undergo the following tests:

        -  Forearm blood flow study: Small tubes are placed in the artery and vein at the inside of
           the elbow of the dominant arm (right- or left-handed) and a small tube is placed in a
           vein of the other arm. The tubes are used for infusing saline (salt water) and for
           drawing blood samples. A pressure cuff is placed around the upper part of the dominant
           arm, and a rubber band device called a strain gauge is also placed around the arm to
           measure blood flow. When the cuff is inflated, blood flows into the arm, stretching the
           strain gauge at a rate proportional to the flow. Maximum grip-strength of the dominant
           arm is measured with a dynamometer. Forearm blood flow is measured and blood samples are
           drawn at the following times: 20 minutes after the tubes are placed; during a hand-grip
           exercise; and 4 minutes after the exercise is completed.

    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is a soluable gas continuously synthesized by the endothelium that
      contributes importantly to vasodilator tone of the coronary and systemic circulations by
      activating guanylyl cyclase in vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation. Patients with
      coronary artery disease, however, have deficient synthesis or increased degradation of NO due
      to endothelial damage or dysfunction. Reduced NO could contribute to symptoms and progression
      of coronary artery disease through vasoconstriction, platelet activation, inflammatory cell
      attachment to the arterial wall, and increased growth of cellular elements of the vessel
      wall. We have recently determined that nitrite, formed by the auto-oxidation of NO, can be
      converted to bioactive NO, in part through reactions with deoxyheme proteins that exist not
      only in red blood cells, but also within the vessel wall. An alternative source of bioactive
      NO may be via the diet, as nitrates reductases present in oral bacteria. Nitrite may then be
      converted to NO within the acidic environment in the stomach and absorbed into the
      bloodstream, or absorbed directly and converted to NO in the bloodstream via reaction with
      deoxyheme proteins. This study is designed to determine the contribution of daily
      nitrate/nitrite to NO adducts in blood and to vascular dilator tone assessed directly in the
      forearm and indirectly through treadmill exercise testing. Findings in this study may have
      important clinical implications not only in coronary artery disease, but also in other
      conditions associated with regional endothelial dysfunction and reduced endothelial NO
      bioactivity (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking,
      estrogen deficiency), and possibly account for the cardiovascular benefit of diets rich in
      vegetables shown in epidemiological survey studies.
