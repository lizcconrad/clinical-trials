    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing
      or die. Combining bevacizumab with docetaxel may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying bevacizumab and docetaxel to see how well
      they work compared to bevacizumab alone in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients with previously treated metastatic
           pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with bevacizumab with or without docetaxel.

        -  Determine the objective response rate and overall survival of patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Determine the incidence of thromboembolic events in patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and docetaxel
           IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab as in arm I. In both arms, courses repeat every 28
           days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients (23 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
