  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent oral Xeloda plus
      Eloxatin (oxaliplatin) with that of fluorouracil/leucovorin in patients who have had surgery
      for colon cancer and no previous chemotherapy. Patients will be randomized to receive either
      1) XELOX (Xeloda 1000mg/m2 po bid on days 1-15 + oxaliplatin) in 3 week cycles or
      2)5-fluorouracil + leucovorin in 4 or 8 week cycles. The anticipated time on study treatment
      is until disease progression and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.

    <description>Determination of an event was based on tumor assessments and survival follow-up assessments. Any recurrence of the original colon cancer or appearance of a new colon or rectal cancer was to be proven by cytology or histology, when possible. An isolated event of increased CEA, or unexplained clinical deterioration were not considered to be evidence of relapse without support of other objective measurements. The date of relapse was defined as the date of the definitive assessment by objective measurements.</description>

    <description>Adverse events were presented in individual listings and summarized by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)System Organ Classes, intensity, and relation to trial treatment. Laboratory data are summarized in two ways: Summary of laboratory abnormalities (regardless of the baseline values), with particular attention to the more clinically relevant Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities. Summary of laboratory abnormalities as a shift from baseline.
