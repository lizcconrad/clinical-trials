  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to lay the groundwork for a proposed clinical trial to compare
      the effectiveness of two approaches to gastroesophageal reflux disease: treatment with
      medications and treatment with anti-reflux surgery. This project includes a
      non-interventional pilot study to test ways of measuring outcomes of treatment, and to gauge
      potential participants' willingness to enroll in the proposed clinical trial.
