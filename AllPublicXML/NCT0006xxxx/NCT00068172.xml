      The purpose of this study is to determine whether PI-88 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of advanced melanoma.

      PI-88 is an investigational drug that works by a novel mechanism which may reduce the rate of
      growth of tumors, and also the spread of cancer cells around the body. It also has an effect
      upon blood clotting. The purpose of this study is to assess if PI-88 has any benefit to
      patients with advanced melanoma, as well as to gain further information on the safety of the
      drug. All patients in the study will receive the study drug at the same dose level. The dose
      of PI-88 that will be given is based on the dose that was found to be the best in the phase I
      portion of this study. The drug will be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily
      for 4 days every week. Patients will be treated with PI-88 for up to 6 months, but if the
      drug is well tolerated and effective, patients may be offered further treatment with the
      drug.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Current diagnosis of metastatic melanoma, where other effective therapy is not
             available or has failed.

          -  Measurable disease. Metastatic lesions must be measurable by MRI or CT, and cutaneous
             lesions by physical examination.

          -  Aged at least 18 years.

          -  Have voluntarily given written informed consent to participate in this study.

          -  Performance status: ECOG 0 - 2 (Karnofsky 70 -100%)

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Neutrophil count greater than 1.5 x 109/L (1,500/mm3)

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance, using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, greater than 60
             mL/min. If just below 60 mL/min, then GFR greater than 60 mL/min as determined by EDTA
             or DTPA scan.

          -  Platelet count at least 100 x 109/L (100,000/mm3)

          -  Bilirubin less than 1.5 x ULN

          -  AST and ALT up to 2 x ULN, except in the presence of liver metastases; up to 5 x ULN.

          -  Prothrombin time less than 1.5 x ULN

          -  APTT normal (20 - 34 sec)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergy and/or hypersensitivity to anti-coagulants/thrombolytic agents,
             especially heparin.

          -  Chemotherapy, investigational or hormonal therapy in the previous 4 weeks.

          -  Radiotherapy to a major bone marrow bearing area such as pelvis, femoral heads,
             lumbar-sacral spine, within the previous 4 weeks. Radiotherapy to other sites within
             the past 2 weeks.

          -  Uncontrolled infection or serious infection within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Clinically significant non-malignant disease.

          -  Known HIV infection or AIDS-related illness.

          -  Myocardial infarction, stroke or congestive heart failure within the past 3 months.

          -  Current symptomatic central nervous system involvement, or active brain or meningeal
             metastases.

          -  Pregnancy, breast feeding, or women of childbearing potential in whom pregnancy cannot

             inflammatory bowel disease, any other abnormal bleeding tendency, or patients at risk
             of bleeding due to open wounds or planned surgery.

          -  Concomitant use of aspirin (more than 100 mg/day), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             drugs (except COX-2 Inhibitors), heparin, low molecular weight heparin or warfarin

          -  Heparin or low molecular weight heparin within the previous 2 weeks.

          -  Not recovered from major surgery if conducted prior to the study.
