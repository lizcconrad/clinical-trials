      This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug propranolol in preventing fainting in
      patients with sympathoadrenal imbalance (SAI). SAI is a particular pattern of nervous system
      and chemical responses in which the blood vessels in skeletal muscles do not remain
      constricted appropriately during standing for a long time. This can lower blood pressure and
      cause fainting. Propranolol Inderal (registered trademark) is a Food and Drug
      Administration-approved drug that belongs to a class of drugs called beta-blockers. These
      drugs slow the heart rate and maintain blood pressure in certain situations.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with SAI may be eligible for this study. Screening
      includes a tilt table test, described below, to determine if the patient has a particular
      chemical pattern in the blood.

      Patients enrolled in the study take propranolol pills in increasing doses during the first
      week of the study to determine the proper dose for the individual. Then, the drug is stopped
      until the experimental phase of the study begins. In this phase, patients are randomly
      assigned to take either propranolol or placebo (look-alike pill with no active ingredient)
      for 4 days. On the fourth day, the patient undergoes a tilt table test to determine whether
      the treatment affects the patient's ability to tolerate tilt. For this test, the patient lies
      on a padded table with a motorized tilt mechanism that can move the patient from a flat
      position to an upright position in about 10 seconds. The patient remains upright for up to 45
      minutes while the following measurements are taken:

        -  Arterial blood pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. A catheter (thin,
           plastic tube) is inserted into an artery in the elbow crease area of the arm or the
           wrist. This catheter allows continuous blood pressure monitoring and sampling of
           arterial (oxygenated) blood during the tilt test.

        -  Venous blood sampling and measurement of epinephrine and norepinephrine release. A
           catheter is inserted into a vein in each arm, one to collect venous (deoxygenated) blood
           samples, and the other to inject radioactive epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine
           (noradrenaline). These radioactive drugs, or ,tracers, allow measurement of the rate of
           release of the body's own norepinephrine and epinephrine into the bloodstream.

        -  Physiologic measurements. Blood pressure, heart rate, and EKG are measured continuously
           during the tilt test session, and blood flows and skin electrical conduction are
           measured intermittently. Blood flow is measured using sensors applied to the skin and a
           blood pressure cuff around the limb. For skin blood flow measurements, a laser beam
           scans the skin surface. The skin electrical conduction test measures how well the skin
           conducts electricity. This is measured through sensors placed on the fingers or other
           sites.

      The effects of the test drug are allowed to wear off for 1 week, after which the entire tilt
      test procedure is repeated. Patients who were given propranolol for the first test session
      take placebo for the repeat session, and those who were given placebo take propranolol.

      This protocol is to evaluate treatment with oral propranolol for a particular form of
      neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), characterized by a neuroendocrine pattern called,
      sympathoadrenal imbalance, (SAI). In SAI, plasma epinephrine levels increase progressively
      and to a greater extent than do plasma norepinephrine levels, before development of NCS. The
      SAI pattern is associated with skeletal muscle vasodilation, which also precedes NCS. We
      hypothesize that increased occupation of beta-2 adrenoceptors in skeletal muscle by high
      circulating epinephrine levels precipitates a neurocirculatory positive feedback loop leading
      to NCS. In this protocol we test this hypothesis using the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor
      blocker, propranolol. We predict that in patients with previously documented SAI and
      tilt-evoked NCS, propranolol treatment will improve orthostatic tolerance during follow-up
      tilt table testing, in a randomized, crossover-design, placebo-controlled, double-blind
      trial. The main department measures are occurrence of tilt-induced NCS, duration of tilt
      tolerance, hemodynamic and neurochemical indices of SAL, and patient questionnaire reports.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects are patients referred for evaluation of chronic orthostatic intolerance. Patients
        enter into the therapeutic trial after they are determined to have NCS with SAI in a
        screening evaluation. Participation in this protocol is offered to individuals 18 years old
        or older, independently of gender, race, advanced age, ethnicity, religion, or any
        demographic or sociopolitical classifications.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: Minors younger than 18 years old are excluded. Advanced age does not constitute an
        exclusion criterion.

        Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgement of the Principal Investigator or
        Clinical Director, protocol participation would place the subject at subject at
        substantially increased acute medical risk. This includes the risks associated with air
        travel to the NIH. A candidate subject is excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal
        Investigator or Clinical Director, the medical risk outweighs the potential scientific
        benefit.

        Disqualifying Conditions: A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying
        condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are history of asthma or chronic
        obstructive pulmonary disease requiring bronchodilators, hepatic or renal failure,
        atrioventricular block of any degree, bradycardia, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
        severe anemia, psychosis, refractory ventricular arrhythmias, symptomatic coronary heart
        disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and
        peripheral vascular disease. Patients with known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity
        to propranolol are excluded from this study. A positive HIV test result does not
        necessarily exclude a patient from participating.

        Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the
        patient continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results.
        Patients who must take medications daily in the following categories are excluded:
        anticoagulants, tricyclic, antidepressants, barbiturates, aspirin, acetaminophen, insulin,
        bronchodilators. Patients unable to discontinue nicotine, caffeine, or alcohol temporarily
        are excluded. Patients with chronic alcohol intake are excluded. Patients are not to
        discontinue any medications before the patient or the patient's doctor discusses this with
        the Principal Investigator, an Associate Investigator, or Research Nurse. If it is decided
        that discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the patient is excluded from the
        study.

        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal
        medicines or dietary supplements must be discontinued before enrollment in the study. For
        many herbal medicines or dietary supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the
        possible effects on the experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish
        to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements while on study, and search of the
        available medical literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to
        interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects may participate.

        Practical Limitations: Patients in whom we feel it would be difficult to technically to
        carry out the testing procedures are excluded.

        Pregnancy: Pregnant or lactating women are excluded. A blood test for pregnancy will be
        conducted on women of childbearing potential, before intake evaluation and also before each
        drug treatment phase. During the course of the protocol, subjects who are women of
        childbearing potential will be advised to practice adequate contraception.

        Termination of Participation: Subjects may refuse certain tests or procedures, or may
        terminate participation early, without loss of benefits to which they were previously
        entitled. The Investigators may also exclude a subject from further participation, such as
        in the event of known or suspect falsification of medical history information or refusal to
        undergo planned tests or procedures, without loss of benefits to which the subject was
        previously entitled.
