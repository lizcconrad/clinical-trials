  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis affects nearly half of all American women over age 50. During the teenage years,
      girls can increase bone growth to decrease their risk of osteoporosis later in life. This
      study will test whether girls can change their food intake and physical activity patterns in
      ways that will increase their bone growth during the mid-teen years.

      Osteoporosis-related fractures incur an annual cost in the United States of more than $8
      billion. Peak bone mass is achieved in the late teens and early 20s. An important component
      of a lifelong osteoporosis prevention strategy is to maximize bone mineral content during the
      teen years and establish lifestyle patterns that will help maintain bone mineral content
      through menopause. This trial will test the efficacy of a comprehensive lifestyle
      intervention to build bone and prevent bone loss among adolescent women 14 to 16 years of
      age.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to either an intervention group or an attention
      control group. The intervention program includes a physical activity component involving high
      impact and spinal motion activities and a diet component rich in fruits, vegetables, and
      calcium. Participants will take part in group and individual meetings and activities and
      receive coaching telephone calls. Participants will be assessed at study entry and two annual
      follow-up visits. Primary outcome measures include objective measures (serum folate and
      carotenoids urinary sodium, lean body mass, accelerometer measure of physical activity) and
      self-reports.
