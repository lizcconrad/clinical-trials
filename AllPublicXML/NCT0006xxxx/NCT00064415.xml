  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open-label, randomized, active controlled, parallel group chronic
      safety study of arformoterol 50 mcg once daily over a period of 12 months in subjects with
      COPD. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was
      acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed
      to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.

          -  Male or female &gt;35 years of age

          -  Female subjects &lt;65 years of age must have a serum pregnancy test conducted at Visit 1

          -  Have a chest x-ray that is consistent with the diagnosis of COPD and taken &lt;3 months
             prior to Visit 1. If there is no chest x-ray taken 3 months prior to Visit 1, a chest
             x-ray will be performed prior to Visit 2.

             successful completion of this protocol

          -  History of cancer except non-melanomatous skin cancer

          -  History of lung resection of more than one full lobe
