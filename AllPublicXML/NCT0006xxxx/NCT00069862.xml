        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Beta-thalassemia patients, 18 years of age or older, currently undergoing chronic
             blood transfusion therapy and iron chelation therapy who weigh more than 40 kg.

          -  No clinically significant findings on physical exam, medical history, or screening
             laboratories.

          -  Serum ferritin greater than 500 ng/mL, serum creatine creatinine within the normal
             range and platelet count greater than 100,000/mm3.

          -  Willing and able to discontinue DFO or L1 for the period of study.

          -  Woman of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and use a medically acceptable form of birth control during the study and
             for 1 month afterward. Male patients must also use barrier contraceptives during the
             study and for 1 month afterward.

          -  Have a level of understanding and willingness to cooperate with the confinement and
             all procedures. Able to provide voluntary signed/dated written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical condition unrelated to Beta-Thalassemia.

          -  Participation in a previous investigational drug study within 30 days preceding
             screening.

          -  Patients with a known allergy to DFO that prevents chronic administration.
