  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, open-label clinical trial is designed to determine safety and clinical
      activity of a new chemotherapeutic agent, MAC-321, when given intravenously to patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer. Clinical activity will be evaluated by determining the percentage
      of patients with an objective tumor response after treatment with MAC-321. Patients must have
      been previously treated with a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen.

      A total of 96 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Eligible patients will receive MAC-321
      intravenously every 3 weeks for up to a total of 6 courses of treatment. All patients will
      receive MAC-321 at the same dose. MAC-321 is an experimental drug, and is not offered outside
      of this research trial.
