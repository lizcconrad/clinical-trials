      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as soblidotin use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of soblidotin in treating patients who
      have advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with advanced or metastatic soft
           tissue sarcoma with prior exposure to anthracycline-based chemotherapy when treated with
           soblidotin.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the median survival time and 12-month survival rate of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive soblidotin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
