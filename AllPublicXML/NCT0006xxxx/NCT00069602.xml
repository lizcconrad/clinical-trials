  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous glucose monitors may be useful in the treatment of children with Type 1 diabetes
      mellitus. The purpose of this study was to determine whether two FDA-approved continuous
      glucose monitors, the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) and the GlucoWatch G2TM
      Biographer (GW2B), are sufficiently accurate to use in future studies to characterize glucose
      levels in children.

      The characterization of glucose levels in healthy children during day and nighttime is
      critical to the interpretation of glucose levels in diseases such as diabetes. This study was
      conducted by the DirecNet Study Group to determine whether two FDA-approved continuous
      glucose monitors are sufficiently accurate.

      The study was conducted at five clinical centers and enrolled approximately 20 healthy
      children (ages 7 to 17 years old) who did not have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes nor a history of
      the disease in their immediate families. Each participant was hospitalized for approximately
      26 hours to assess the accuracy of the continuous glucose monitors compared with serum
      glucose determinations.
