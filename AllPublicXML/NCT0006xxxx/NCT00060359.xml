      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of polyglutamate paclitaxel
      when given together with carboplatin in treating patients with ovarian epithelial,
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as polyglutamate
      paclitaxel and carboplatin use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Polyglutamate paclitaxel may be able to deliver the drug directly to tumor
      cells while leaving normal cells undamaged. Combining polyglutamate paclitaxel with
      carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of polyglutamate paclitaxel in combination with
      carboplatin in patients with chemotherapy-na√Øve ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube carcinoma.

      II. Determine the feasibility of this regimen at the MTD in an expanded cohort of patients.

      III. Determine the response rate and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
      regimen in the expanded cohort.

      IV. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. V. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug combination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of polyglutamate
      paclitaxel (CT-2103) followed by a feasibility, multicenter study.

      DOSE-ESCALATION PHASE: Patients receive CT-2103 IV over 10 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CT-2103 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first course of treatment.

      FEASIBILITY PHASE: Once the MTD of CT-2103 is determined, an additional 20-40 patients
      receive treatment at that dose level combined with carboplatin as above.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.
