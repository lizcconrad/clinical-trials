  <brief_summary>

      This clinical trial is designed to study whether docetaxel (Taxotere) helps reduce the risk
      of relapse in patients with prostate cancer who have had their prostate removed by surgery,
      but are at high risk of their cancer recurring. During the trial, doctors will also closely
      monitor patients for side effects of the chemotherapy.

      Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug that prevents tumor cells from dividing, so they stop
      growing or die. Doctors use docetaxel to treat lung and breast cancer, and studies show it
      can help shrink tumors in some patients with prostate cancer that has spread to other parts
      of their bodies. The researchers conducting this study want to determine if docetaxel also
      helps reduce the likelihood of prostate cancer returning after surgery has removed the
      original tumor.

      All of the study participants will receive up to 18 doses of docetaxel, each administered
      through a needle inserted into a vein. Each round of treatment will consist of 30-minute,
      weekly infusions for three consecutive weeks, followed by one week with no chemotherapy.
      Before and after the chemotherapy, patients will take dexamethasone, an oral steroid that
      reduces the risk of an allergic reaction to the medication. If the side effects of the
      treatment become too intense, doctors may modify, delay, or even stop chemotherapy during the
      trial.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  patients with prostate cancer who have just undergone prostatectomy,

          -  high risk of their cancer recurring (High risk is defined as at least a 50 percent
             chance the cancer will return within three years after surgery.)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Prior systemic treatment for prostate cancer with hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or
             any other anticancer therapy.

          -  Prior radiation therapy

          -  Patients receiving any concurrent therapy for cancer. This includes alternative
             therapies

          -  Patients requiring concurrent treatment with corticosteroids, with the exception of
             inhaled and topical corticosteroids.

          -  History of a malignancy other than prostate cancer

          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt;/= Grade 2

          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions which do not permit
             treatment and/or medical follow-up required to comply with the study protocol

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to products containing
             Polysorbate 80 (Tween 80).
