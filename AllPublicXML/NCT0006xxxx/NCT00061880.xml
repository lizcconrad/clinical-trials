      RATIONALE: BCX-1777 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      cancer cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness BCX-1777 in treating patients who have
      refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of BCX-1777 in patients with refractory cutaneous
           T-cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate plasma concentration of deoxyguanosine with clinical response and toxicity in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the provisional optimal biological dose of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive BCX-1777 IV over 30 minutes every 12 hours on days 1-5 (a
           total of 9 doses). Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BCX-1777 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive treatment as in phase I at the MTD of BCX-1777. Patients
           (including those who respond to treatment) are followed at 14 and 30 days, monthly for 6
           months, every 2 months for 6 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-64 patients (3-24 for phase I and 40 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study.
