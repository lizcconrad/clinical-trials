      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other sources of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. It is not yet known which radiation therapy regimen is more effective in
      treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two different regimens of radiation
      therapy to see how well they work in treating patients with stage II or stage III prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) vs
           hypofractionated IMRT, in terms of freedom from biochemical failure in men with
           intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer.

        -  Compare the local control, freedom from distant metastasis, and overall survival of
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine local failure, using biopsy of the prostate, when objective tests
           (prostate-specific antigen, ultrasound, and digital rectal exam) suggest relapse in
           these patients.

        -  Compare the extent of disease eradication using biopsy of the prostate at 2 years after
           therapy in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the impact of these regimens on patient preferences and utilities.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to pretreatment
      prostate-specific antigen (no greater than 10 ng/mL vs greater than 10 to 20 ng/mL vs greater
      than 20 ng/mL), Gleason score (5-7 vs 8-10), and risk status (high risk vs intermediate
      risk). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo conventional intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) 5 days a
           week for 7.5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo hypofractionated IMRT 5 days a week for 5 weeks in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with high-risk disease also undergo androgen deprivation therapy for 2 years.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 4
      years.

      Patients are followed at 3 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
