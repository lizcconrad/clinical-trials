  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects of gefitinib in treating patients with
      metastatic or unresectable head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer. Gefitinib may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of enrolling patients ages 75 years or older and 50 years and
      younger with metastatic or unresectable head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer,
      to a structured pilot study that includes pharmacokinetic sampling in a special patient
      population.

      II. To preliminarily compare the ZD-1839 peak concentration level, elimination half-life and
      steady state level between the two patient age groups.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (75
      years and over vs 50 years and under)

      Patients receive oral gefitinib on day 1 and then daily beginning on day 8. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 30 days and then for up to 3 years after study registration.

             or non-small cell lung cancer which is metastatic or unresectable for which standard
             curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective or are likely
             to be as effective as ZD1839; patients with known brain metastases are only eligible
             if their brain metastases have been treated and if in the opinion of the treating
             physician they are stable

          -  Patients must be 75 years or older, or 50 years of age or younger

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; the institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; the institutional upper limit of normal

          -  SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal; SGOT and SGPT could be
             =&lt; 5 x the upper limit of normal if the patient has liver metastases as long as the
             bilirubin is normal

          -  AGC of &gt;= 1,500/ul

          -  Platelet count of &gt;= 100,000/ul

          -  Patients requiring agents that induce CYP3A4 are excluded from the study, at the
             present time, agents known to induce CYP3A4 include the antibiotics nafcillin and
             rifampin, the anticonvulsants carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, oxcarbazepine,
             fosphenytoin and primidone as well as St. John's Wort, rifabutin, rifapentine and
             modafinil

          -  Patients may or may not have received prior chemotherapy; patients must not have a
             curative option and in the opinion of the treating physician there is no other
             treatment option likely to provide greater benefit; patients must not have received
             prior treatment with EGFR inhibitors; patients must have recovered from the effects of
             prior therapy; all prior therapies must be documented

          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0-2 by Zubrod standards

          -  Patients must not be planning to receive concurrent radiation therapy, hormone
             therapy, chemotherapy or immune therapy for malignancy while receiving protocol
             treatment

          -  Patients must agree to undergo pharmacokinetic sampling and sample submission

          -  Patients known to be HIV positive and receiving retroviral therapies are not eligible

          -  Patients with any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (e.g., unstable
             or uncompensated respiratory, cardiac or infection) are not eligible

          -  Patients must be able to swallow oral medication in pill form; patients may not
             receive study medication through a feeding tube

          -  A baseline slit lamp examination is NOT required; however, patients with eye symptoms
             (eye pain, tearing, redness, vision problems) or known eye disorders should be
             evaluated by an ophthalmologist/optometrist prior to registration and the results
             documented on the toxicity form in the notes section

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing; patients of reproductive potential must have
             agreed to use an effective contraceptive method

          -  If day 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the next
             working day

          -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is done
             is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday four weeks
             later would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient patient scheduling without
             exceeding guidelines

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study
             has been entered into the data base
