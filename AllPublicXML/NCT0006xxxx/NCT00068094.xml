  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether probiotics, bacteria that may improve liver
      health, can effectively treat a chronic condition in diabetics that increases fat in the
      liver.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in
      the United States and is also common in diabetics; unfortunately, research on NAFLD has been
      limited. Safe, inexpensive, and well-tolerated treatments for NAFLD are needed. Recent
      studies indicate that probiotics help to improve fat breakdown in mice. This study will
      evaluate the efficacy of probiotic therapy to reduce fat accumulation in the livers of people
      with NAFLD and diabetes.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either a probiotic-containing
      mixture or placebo once daily for 6 months. Blood tests, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy
      will be used to assess participants at study start and at study completion.
