      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as sirolimus use different ways to stop cancer
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sirolimus in
      treating young patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of sirolimus in pediatric patients with refractory
           or relapsed acute leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the trough levels produced by this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-leukemia/lymphoma activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral sirolimus once daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sirolimus until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
