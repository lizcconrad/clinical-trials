      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as soblidotin use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of soblidotin in treating patients who
      have progressive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate and duration of response in patients with
           progressive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated with
           soblidotin as second-line therapy after receiving prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the median survival time and 12-month survival rate of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive soblidotin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Plasma sampling for
      pharmacokinetics is done on day 1 of course 1.

      Patients are followed for survival every 3 months after discontinuing study treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
