  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergency contraception is a method of birth control that can be used up to three days after
      sexual intercourse. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) can be given to a woman before she
      needs them (advance provision) or when she needs them (emergency provision). This study will
      compare these two methods of providing ECPs.

      ECPs can give women a “second chance” to prevent an unintended pregnancy that might arise
      because of lack or improper/defective use of contraceptives. By using ECP, a woman can reduce
      her risk of pregnancy by at least 75%; however, there is little information on what
      distribution patterns and other factors are most likely to encourage ECP use. This study will
      compare the use and cost of two ECP distribution patterns: advance provision and emergency
      provision. It will also identify environmental, situational, and behavioral factors
      associated with ECP acceptance and use.

      Participants in this study will be recruited from four family planning clinics in the
      Philadelphia area and five family planning clinics in the Pittsburgh area. Participants from
      the Philadelphia clinics will be given ECPs as part of a regular clinic visit (advance
      provision); participants from the Pittsburgh clinics will be given ECPs on an emergency basis
      (emergent provision). Each participant will complete a short intake form and will be issued a
      pager. Participants will be paged every month over an 18-month period as a reminder to
      respond to a short automated telephone survey on ECP, contraceptives, and pregnancy status.
      Approximately half of the participants will be randomly selected to participate in in-depth
      interviews at study entry and Months 9 and 18. Clinic visit data will augment the surveys to
      verify use of the clinic and contraceptive method and to develop cost data.
