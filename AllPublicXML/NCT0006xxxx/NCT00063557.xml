      BACKGROUND:

      Recent epidemiologic studies have found that living in socioeconomically disadvantaged
      neighborhoods is associated with increased prevalence and incidence of coronary heart
      disease, even after controlling for measures of personal income, education, and occupation.
      Although this suggests that features of neighborhoods may be relevant to cardiovascular risk,
      important questions remain regarding whether the associations observed reflect causal
      processes. Two important unresolved issues are the role of selection factors in generating
      these associations and the need to identify the specific characteristics of neighborhoods
      that are relevant.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study uses publicly available and newly collected neighborhood data linked to the
      Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to: (1) examine the relationship between
      neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and the prevalence and progression of subclinical
      atherosclerosis; (2) examine associations of neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics with
      specific individual-level factors which may mediate neighborhood differences in disease risk;
      (3) develop measures of specific characteristics of neighborhood environments (such as
      measures of resource availability, neighborhood social cohesion and neighborhood stress) and
      examine their relation to selected individual-level risk factors; (4) determine if these
      specific neighborhood characteristics explain differences in cardiovascular risk between
      socioeconomically advantaged and socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods; and (5)
      examine if neighborhood characteristics contribute to race/ethnic differences in
      cardiovascular risk. Measures of neighborhood attributes will be based on Year 2000 Census
      data, surveys of area residents, and the use of GIS methods to link data on area resources to
      MESA neighborhoods. The examination of subclinical disease as outcomes avoids problems
      related to selection of persons into neighborhoods based on their health status. The project
      will use two innovative approaches (residential surveys and ecometric techniques and
      GIS-based methods) to develop direct measures of specific neighborhood attributes in order to
      test their relationship to disease risk. Confirming that specific features of neighborhoods
      are causally related to disease would have important implications for prevention.
