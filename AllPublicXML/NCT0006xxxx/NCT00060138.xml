      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Zoledronate may prevent bone
      loss and stop the growth of tumor cells in bone. It is not yet known whether monoclonal
      antibody is more effective than zoledronate in treating women who have breast cancer and bone
      metastases.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I/II trial to compare the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody with
      that of zoledronate in treating women who have breast cancer and bone metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody CAL vs zoledronate in women
           with breast cancer and bone metastases.

        -  Compare, preliminarily, the potential effects of these drugs on skeletal
           events/manifestations related to bone metastases, including hypercalcemia, bone pain,
           bone metastatic lesions, complications (e.g., pathologic fracture and spinal cord
           compression), and interventions (e.g., surgery and radiotherapy) in these patients.

        -  Compare changes in ECOG performance status in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibody CAL in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to average prestudy pain score on question 3 of a daily electronic telephone pain
      diary (less than 3 vs 3 or more) and prior bisphosphonate therapy (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody CAL IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a lower dose of monoclonal antibody CAL as in arm I.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive a lower dose (lower than arm II) of monoclonal antibody CAL as
           in arm I.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive zoledronate IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment in all
           arms repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients keep a pain diary throughout study participation.

      Patients are followed at 24 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients (18 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
