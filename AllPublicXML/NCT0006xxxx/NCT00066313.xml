      RATIONALE: ZD6474 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. ZD6474 may also stop the growth of small cell lung cancer by blocking blood
      flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well ZD6474 works compared to placebo
      in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has responded to previous chemotherapy
      with or without radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients with previously treated small cell
           lung cancer (SCLC) treated with ZD6474 vs placebo.

        -  Compare the response rate of patients treated with these regimens (only patients who had
           measurable disease outside a prior radiation field at study entry).

        -  Compare the toxicity and tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the pharmacokinetics of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Correlate outcome and response with vascular endothelial growth factor expression and
           microvessel density in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Provide a comprehensive tumor, plasma, and urine bank linked to a clinical database for
           further study of molecular markers in SCLC.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center, timing of prior radiotherapy (early [before
      day 1, course 4 of chemotherapy] vs late vs no prior radiotherapy), stage of disease at
      diagnosis (limited vs extensive), and response at study entry (complete vs partial). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral ZD6474 daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily. In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days
           for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 4 weeks while on therapy, and then every 8
      weeks until disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
