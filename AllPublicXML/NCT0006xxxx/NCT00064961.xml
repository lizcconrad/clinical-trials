    <textblock>
      This study addresses the high risk of weight gain associated with smoking cessation in women.
      The obesity prevention pilot study is designed for the primary prevention of weight gain that
      can lead to overweight in normal-weight women, that can progress to obesity in women who are
      already overweight, and for the prevention of additional weight gain in obese women with BMI
      greater than or equal to 30.0. Fat and other macronutrient intake, specifically, sugar,
      complex carbohydrates, and protein, are analyzed as a target for individually tailored,
      weight control intervention following smoking cessation in Caucasian and African American
      women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Middle-aged women, especially African Americans, who quit smoking are at high risk for weight
      gain, overweight, and obesity. Postcessation weight gain has been attributed to increased
      food intake, which in turn, has been ascribed to a selective increase in high-sugar and other
      high-carbohydrate foods with a high-fat content. This study compares the relative
      effectiveness, for postmenopausal Caucasian and African American women, of following an
      empirically validated smoking cessation program with either 1) a group cessation maintenance
      program with standard exercise advice and food pyramid instructions for healthy eating or 2)
      an individually tailored, dietary-control, exercise, weight-management and
      cessation-maintenance program. Effectiveness is assessed by weight change from baseline to
      postcessation months 6, 12, and 20.

      The second aim is to assess overall fat and other specific macronutrient intake (sugar,
      complex carbohydrates, and protein) and total caloric intake with the use of a novel
      macronutrient self-selection paradigm in Caucasian and African-American postmenopausal women
      at baseline prior to smoking cessation, after being abstinent for one week, and again at 6,
      12, and 20 months postcessation.

      The third aim is to assess whether there is differential responsiveness on the above measures
      in postmenopausal Caucasian vs. African-American women.
