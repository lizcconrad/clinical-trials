      No universally successful therapy exists that promotes recovery of motor function after a
      stroke, the main cause of long-term disability among adults.

      The purpose of this study is to develop strategies to improve recovery of lost motor
      function. It will combine motor skills training with a brain-stimulating technique called
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).

      Healthy adult volunteers and adult stroke patients will be enrolled in this study.
      Participants will come to NIH for a clinical and neurological exam, and, if necessary, an MRI
      [magnetic resonance imaging] examination. Participants will return for 4 sessions; each
      lasting approximately 3 hours. The first will be a practice session during which participants
      will become familiar with the motor skills required of them in this study, such as performing
      finger movements on a keyboard, pinching, tapping, making wrist movements, and lifting small
      items. In sessions 2 and 3, participants will perform the motor skills they practiced in
      session 1 while receiving tDCS. During session 4, they will receive tDCS only, with no
      performance of motor skills.

      During tDCS, investigators will place electrodes with a gel on participants' heads and pass
      the tDCS current between these two electrodes. tDCS is a painless procedure.

      Participants will receive up to $420 in compensation for their involvement in this study.

      There is no universally accepted strategy to promote recovery of motor function after chronic
      stroke, the main cause of long-term disability among adults. It is desirable to develop
      strategies to accelerate motor learning in this patient group. Previous studies in healthy
      volunteers demonstrated that cortical stimulation in association with training leads to
      improvements of motor learning and use-dependent plasticity. The purpose of this protocol is
      to apply a painless stimulation technique to the motor cortex of the affected hemisphere of
      patients with subcortical stroke (transcranial DC stimulation, tDCS) to test the hypothesis
      that tDCS of the motor cortex of the affected hemisphere in association with motor training
      will improve motor learning of a finger sequence in the paretic hand.

      Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that the unaffected hemisphere exerts
      abnormally high inhibitory influence over the affected hemisphere. This abnormality might
      adversely influence motor recovery. Therefore a further purpose of the study is to apply tDCS
      to the unaffected hemisphere to test the hypothesis that reduction of the inhibitory
      influence of the unaffected hemisphere over the affected in association with motor training
      will improve motor learning.

      This technique has been so far applied in several hundred subjects worldwide in the absence
      of undesirable side effects reported to date.

      We plan to study patients with chronic strokes and healthy age- and gender matched normal
      volunteers. Primary outcome measure will be the number of correct keyboard piano sequences
      played in a specific time-period (30 seconds). Secondary outcome measures are speed of
      tapping with only one finger; simple reaction times; pinch force; and a functional measure of
      activities of daily life (ADL): Jebsen-Tailor-Test. To better understand the mechanisms
      underlying the proposed behavioral gains, we will use TMS to identify changes in corticomotor
      excitability.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        We will include patients with thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic hemispheric lesions at least 3
        months after the stroke.

        We will choose Patients who initially had a severe motor paresis (below MRC grade 2), which
        subsequently recovered to the point that they have a residual motor deficit but can perform
        the required tasks. Assessment of the initial functional state will be taken either from
        patient report or medical records.

        As the control group, we will include age- and gender matched Normal Volunteers with
        matched non-dominant/dominant hand (to the affected hand of the stroke patients).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with more than one stroke in the medical cerebral artery territory.

        Patients with bilateral motor impairment.

        Patients with cerebellar or brainstem lesions.

        Patients or Normal Volunteers unable to perform the task (wrist or elbow flexion at least
        MRC grade 2).

        Patients or Normal Volunteers with severe alcohol or drug abuse, psychiatric illness like
        severe depression, poor motivational capacity, or severe language disturbances,
        particularly of receptive nature or with serious cognitive deficits (defined as equivalent
        to a mini-mental state exam score of 23 or less).

        Patients or Normal Volunteers with history of severe uncontrolled medical problems (e.g.
        cardiovascular disease, severe rheumatoid arthritis, active joint deformity of arthritic
        origin, active cancer or renal disease, any kind of end-stage pulmonary or cardiovascular
        disease, or a deteriorated condition due to age, uncontrolled epilepsy or others).

        Patients or Normal Volunteers with increased intracranial pressure as evaluated by clinical
        means.

        Patients or Normal Volunteers with unstable cardiac arrhythmia.

        Patients or Normal Volunteers with h/o hyperthyroidism or individuals receiving drugs
        acting primarily on the central nervous system.

        Patients and Normal Volunteers with more than moderate to severe microangiopathy,
        polyneuropathy, diabetes mellitus, or ischemic peripheral disease.

        Patients or Normal Volunteers which are or which have been professional piano players.
