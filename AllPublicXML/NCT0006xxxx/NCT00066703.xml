      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      triptorelin, exemestane, and tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of
      estrogen. It is not yet known whether giving triptorelin together with exemestane is more
      effective than triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating hormone-responsive breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying triptorelin and exemestane to see how
      well they work compared to triptorelin and tamoxifen in treating premenopausal women with
      hormone-responsive breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the disease-free survival, breast cancer-free interval, distant recurrence-free
           interval and overall survival of premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast
           cancer when treated with triptorelin and exemestane vs triptorelin and tamoxifen.

        -  Compare the quality of life, including late side effects of early menopause, of patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, international, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to planned use of concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs no), and number of
      positive lymph nodes (0 vs 1 or more). Treatment duration is 5 years. Patients are followed
      every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter. Quality
      of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 2 years, and annually for 3 years.

          <title>Tumor grade</title>
          <description>Tumor grade is the histologic grade according to the BRE method. The method involves assessment of tumor morphology, including tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism and frequency of mitoses. Grades are recorded according to criteria as 1,2 or 3. Grade 3 is associated with poor prognosis. Units in this baseline measure reflect the percentage of total participants, rather than number of participants. The total provided does not equal the total number of participants and should not be interpreted as an accurate total of participants.</description>
