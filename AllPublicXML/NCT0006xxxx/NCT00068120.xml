      This project is the clinical project of a Specialized Center of Research (SCOR) proposal
      which is designed to further our understanding of urinary tract infection (UTI) in women.
      Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) occur in an estimated 7-11 million women
      each year, and the annual costs of caring for these women are thought to approach $1.6
      billion. Approximately 20-30% of women suffer from frequent recurrent infections. UTIs in
      young women result in substantial symptoms, time lost from work, and medical costs. An
      improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying UTIs could result in new approaches to
      their prevention and reduced numbers of women with infections and the amount of antibiotics
      use.

      In this project we seek a better understanding of the causes of UTI. Most experts believe
      that vaginal colonization with UTI-causing bacteria from the rectal flora precedes
      colonization of the urethra (the tube from the bladder for urination) and bladder and
      subsequent UTI, but the relationships between these events has not been established.
      Moreover, recent information from studies in mice strongly suggest that persistent bladder
      infection follows an initial bladder infection.

      In this project, we will prospectively follow a large group of women with recurrent UTI to
      determine: 1) the relationships in time between vaginal colonization with a UTI-causing
      bacteriuria, asymptomatic bacteriuria (bacteria in the bladder but without any UTI symptoms)
      and symptomatic UTI, and 2) the presence of persistent bacteria in the bladder following the
      symptomatic UTI at entry into the study and whether such bacteria are related to later UTIs
      that are caused by the same bacteria that caused the UTI at entry into the study. We will
      thus be able to determine the relative importance of vaginal colonization vs. persistent
      infection of the bladder as the origin of the bacteria causing recurrent UTI.

      UTI-causing bacteria cultured from women with symptomatic UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria
      will undergo studies by Dr. Scott Hultgren's group at Washington University in Project 1 to
      identify unique genes that may help us understand why some bacteria cause symptoms and others
      do not. The effect of bacteria causing UTI in these women on host response will also be
      determined by studies by Dr. Jeff Gordon's laboratory at Washington University in Project 3.

      A better understanding of the molecular and epidemiologic basis of UTI is critical in
      developing the best possible prevention and management strategies.
