  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The projects funded by this grant, primarily focus on environmental factors that promote
      weight-gain in the general human population, and how to modify these factors, to prevent
      further weight-gain in the future. In the coming years, the researchers at the University of
      Colorado-HSC hope to gain an understanding as to how small changes in diet and physical
      activity can be achieved and sustained to prevent weight-gain.
