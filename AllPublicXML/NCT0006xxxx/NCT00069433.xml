      This study will determine the effectiveness of skills training in people with schizophrenia
      and the applicability of the acquired skills in the &quot;real world.&quot;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with schizophrenia have a large number of social and symptom management training
      programs available to them. Studies suggest that these training programs are effective, but
      their generalizability and effectiveness in outpatient settings has not been thoroughly
      examined. This study will examine the treatment outcomes of a skills training approach in
      schizophrenic individuals taking antipsychotic medication.

      Participants taking stable doses of risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine will be randomly
      assigned to receive either intensive symptom management and social skills training or group
      therapy for 12 months. A verbal memory test will be used to stratify the randomization
      procedure and to control for neurocognitive functioning.
