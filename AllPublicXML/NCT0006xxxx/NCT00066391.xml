      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as irinotecan and cisplatin use different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining irinotecan with
      cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining irinotecan with cisplatin in
      treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic penile cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the anticancer activity of irinotecan and cisplatin in patients with locally
           advanced or metastatic penile cancer.

        -  Determine the objective response rate and duration of response in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the acute side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 1-3
      hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients not undergoing local treatment receive up to 8 courses.
      Patients planning to undergo surgery receive up to 4 courses.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-28 patients will be accrued for this study.
