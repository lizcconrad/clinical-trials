  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      These studies will provide us with enormous insight regarding how obese patients adapt
      energetically during negative energy balance. We will gain fundamental information regarding
      the metabolic implications of combining food restriction with a walking program compatible to
      that advocated by statutory agencies. These studies will lead to improved understanding of
      the energetic adaptation that occurs during negative energy balance and how best to treat
      patients with obesity.

    <description>Participants will undergo 1000 kcal/day caloric restriction (relative to experimentally determined weight-maintenance caloric needs) for 8 weeks during one phase of study. Additional 11 week period consists of 8 weeks of caloric restriction with an additional daily walking program.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Ninety sedentary subjects, aged 25-55, who live &lt;10 miles from Rochester will be recruited.
        This age range has been selected to enable us to study individuals at the peak age-range of
        obesity and over-weight prevalence and to avoid issues of menopause. Subjects will not be
        eligible for consideration if they take two or more bouts of exercise/week or participate
        in sports for more than 2 hours/week. Subjects with predicted weight maintenance energy
        requirements of &lt;2000 kcal/day will have been excluded at screening. This is because when
        we come to underfeeding by 1000 kcal/day, we want to avoid feeding any volunteer &lt;1000
        kcal/day, for safety &amp; compliance reasons.

        (A) LEAN: 30 (15F,15M) lean subjects; BMI &lt;25 kg/m2. Each lean subject will be individually
        matched for height (+3cm) and age (+3 years) to an obese subject so as to establish
        comparable groupings for body size. Subjects will have been weight-stable for six months
        (B) OBESE: 30 (15F,15M) obese subjects; BMI 30-35 kg/m2. Subjects will have been
        weight-stable for six months (C) POST-OBESE: 30 (15F,15M) patients will have had a previous
        BMI &gt;30 kg/m2 and a weight loss sufficient to achieve a BMI of &lt;26 kg/m2 maintained for at
        least 2 months (with weight fluctuation during this period of &lt;1 kg) (94). We will attempt
        to match these subjects to the obese subjects as described above.
