  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether bright light improves the sleep, mood, and
      behavior of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD) who live in long-term
      care settings and, if so, to determine the best timing for the light therapy. The light
      levels being used in the study have been shown to improve depression in persons with seasonal
      affective disorder (SAD) and to relieve sleep problems in persons with jet lag and other body
      rhythm disturbances. Because persons with AD often will not remain still in front of a
      fluorescent panel, this project has involved renovations in the study units that provide for
      even, regulated, high-intensity light in all public areas of the study settings.
