  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if an investigational drug, NGX-4010
      (high-concentration capsaicin patch), is effective in treating painful HIV-associated
      neuropathy.

    <textblock>
      The C107 study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled dose finding study of NGX-4010 for
      the treatment of painful symptoms of HIV-associated neuropathy. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive initial treatment according to one of three doses (application
      durations), and to receive double-blind NGX-4010 patch (high-concentration capsaicin) or
      matching control (low-concentration capsaicin).

      Participants who complete study evaluations through Week 12 will have the option of receiving
      up to 3 additional open-label treatments.

          -  Documented diagnosis of painful HIV-associated distal symmetrical polyneuropathy
             established by a neurologist resulting from HIV disease and/or antiretroviral drug
             exposure, with primary symptoms of pain, burning or dysesthetic discomfort in both
             feet for at least 2 months prior to Screening Visit, and absent or diminished ankle
             reflexes, and at least one of the following: distal diminution of vibration sensation
             or pain or temperature sensation in the legs

          -  Either no neurotoxic antiretroviral (didanosine, zalcitabine or stavudine) exposure
             for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit, or currently on stable dose(s) of any
             neurotoxic antiretroviral(s) for at least 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit

          -  Screening Pain Sum Score of 12 to 36

          -  Karnofsky Performance Score of greater than or equal to 60

          -  Intact, unbroken skin over the painful area(s) to be treated

          -  If taking chronic pain medications, be on a stable (not PRN) regimen for at least 21
             days prior to Treatment Visit and willing to maintain these medications at the same
             stable dose(s) and schedule throughout the study

          -  Female subjects with child-bearing potential: negative serum pregnancy test performed
             at Screening Visit

          -  Willing to use effective methods of birth control and/or refrain from participating in
             a conception process during study and for 30 days following experimental drug exposure

             neuropathy; vitamin B12 deficiency (B12 level ≤ 200 pg/mL) or less than 3 months of
             B12 supplementation prior to Screening Visit; or treatment within 90 days prior to

          -  Any implanted medical device (spinal cord stimulator, intrathecal pump or peripheral
             nerve stimulator) for the treatment of neuropathic pain

          -  Treatment for acute opportunistic infections within 14 days before Treatment Visit

          -  Presence of acute, active opportunistic infection, except oral thrush; oral, genital,
