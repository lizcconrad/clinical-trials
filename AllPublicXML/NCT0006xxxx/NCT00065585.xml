      This is a 4-arm multi-site randomized controlled trial to clarify the extent to which various
      types of acupuncture needling can diminish the effect of chronic low back pain on patient
      functioning and symptoms. Reviews have noted the poor quality of research in this area and
      urged that scientifically rigorous studies be conducted. Recent higher quality trials suggest
      acupuncture is a promising treatment for back pain. This study directly addresses
      methodological shortcomings that have plagued previous studies. A total of 640 subjects (160
      per arm) with low back pain lasting at least 3 months will be recruited from group model HMOs
      in Seattle, WA and Oakland, CA. They will be randomized to one of three different methods of
      stimulation of acupuncture or to continue usual medical care. Ten treatments will be provided
      over 7 weeks. The primary outcomes, dysfunction and bothersomeness of low back pain, will be
      measured at baseline, and after 8, 26, and 52 weeks by telephone interviewers masked to
      treatment. Analysis of covariance within an intention-to-treat context will be used to
      analyze the data. Because chronic back pain is a major public health problem and the top
      reason patients seek acupuncture treatment, a clear, unambiguous assessment is critical for
      making informed decisions about whether acupuncture should be included as part of
      conventional care for back pain or covered by insurance. Results of this study will provide
      the clearest evidence to date about the value of acupuncture needling as a treatment for
      chronic low back pain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of low back pain including lumbago, unspecified backache, sprains and

          -  Back pain must be of at least 3 months duration and rated at least 3 on a symptom
             bothersomeness scale

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  non-mechanical causes or potential causes of low back pain (i.e. sciatica, underlying
             systemic or visceral disease, pregnancy, spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, cancer or
             unexplained weight loss, recent vertebral fracture)

          -  previous treatment with acupuncture

          -  inappropriate candidate for acupuncture (i.e. severe clotting disorders or on
             anticoagulant medication, heart pacemakers)

          -  characteristics complicating the interpretation of the findings (severe or progressive
             neurologic deficits, back surgery within the prior three years, planning to seek other
             treatment for back pain)

          -  characteristics related to ability to complete the study protocol (unable to speak
