  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with
      metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell cancer. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of a Southwest Oncology Group Phase II trial or oral
      STI-571/imatinib (Gleevec) administered to patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel
      cell carcinoma.

      II. To evaluate the objective response probability (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and
      partial responses) of oral STI-571/imatinib (Gleevec) administered to patients with
      metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma.

      III. To assess qualitative and quantitative toxicities of oral STI-581/imatinib (Gleevec)
      administered to patients with metastatic or unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma.

      IV. To analyze tumor samples for activating mutations of STI-571/imatinib-sensitive kinases
      (KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB) by denaturing HPLC and direct DNA sequencing.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or symptomatic deterioration.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a biopsy-proven diagnosis of Merkel Cell Carcinoma (Cutaneous
             Neuroendocrine Carcinoma) that is distantly metastatic or unresectable

               -  Tumors must beet BOTH of the following criteria:

                    -  The primary must be of skin origin; (patients with unknown primary are not
                       eligible)

                    -  All patients must have immunohistochemical staining with c-kit (CD117)
                       expression by tumor documented by DAKO, Benchmark, or similar staining kit

          -  The institution must plan to submit materials for pathology review

               -  NOTE: Submission of additional specimens is strongly encouraged

          -  Patients must have measurable disease; all measurable lesions must be assessed (by
             physical examination, CT or MRI scan or plain X-ray) within 28 days prior to
             registration; tests to assess non-measurable disease must be performed within 42 days
             prior to registration

          -  Patients with symptomatic, unstable or untreated brain metastases are not eligible;
             previous treatment must have been completed at least 28 days prior to registration

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2

          -  Patients must not have received radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy or any
             other investigational drug for any reason within 28 days prior to registration; all
             toxicities from prior treatment must have been resolved (in the opinion of the
             treating investigator); patients whose only disease is within a previous radiation
             therapy port must demonstrate clearly progressive disease prior to registration;
             patients must have resolution of all toxicities from any prior therapy to =&lt; grade 1
             (CTCAE version 3.0); patients must not have had a major surgery (e.g., large chest and
             abdominal incisions, major soft tissue resections) within 14 days prior to
             registration

          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; 3 x the institutional upper limit of normal (including those with
             hepatic metastases)

          -  SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal (or =&lt; 5 x the
             institutional upper limit of normal if hepatic metastases is present)

          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal

          -  ANC &gt;= 1,000/ul

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/ul

          -  Patient must not have class 3/4 cardiac problems as defined by the New York Heart
             Association criteria (e.g., congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 2
             months of study)

          -  Patient must not have a sever and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease (e.g.,
             uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled chronic renal or liver disease, or active
             uncontrolled infection, e.g., HIV)

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing; for women of reproductive potential, a
             negative serum pregnancy test must be done within 7 days prior to registration;
             post-menopausal women who have not had their ovaries removed must be amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential; patients of
             reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method of birth
             control throughout the study and for up to 3 months following discontinuation of study
             drug

               -  NOTE: oral contraceptives may interact with the study drug and should be used
                  with caution

          -  Patients must not be taking therapeutic doses of Coumadin (warfarin) as
             anticoagulation at the time of registration; patients requiring therapeutic
             anticoagulation may use low molecular weight heparin (e.g., Lovenox) or other agents,
             and mini-dose Coumadin (1 mg po QD) as prophylaxis is allowed

          -  If day 7, 14, or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the
             next working day

               -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is
                  dose is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday
                  two weeks later would be considered day 14; this allows for efficient patient
                  scheduling without exceeding the guidelines

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study
             has been entered into the data base
