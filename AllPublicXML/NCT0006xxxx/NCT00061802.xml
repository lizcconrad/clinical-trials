      A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two atypical antipsychotics vs. placebo in
      patients with an acute exacerbation of either schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was intended to compare the efficacy and safety of risperidone, quetiapine, and
      placebo in the treatment of patients with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. The primary tested hypothesis was a comparison of the efficacy of
      risperidone and quetiapine (active combined group) to placebo. Other a priori hypotheses
      tested included comparison of the onset of antipsychotic effect of risperidone to quetiapine
      and placebo, and to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost of risperidone compared with
      quetiapine in the treatment of subjects with an acute exacerbation of schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder.

      During the first phase of the study (15 days), patients randomized to risperidone were
      titrated from 1 mg to 4 mg or from 1 mg to 6 mg per day, depending on body weight. Patients
      randomized to quetiapine were titrated from 50 mg to 400 mg or from 50 mg to 600 mg per day,
      depending on body weight. Based on investigators determination of patient clinical response,
      patients in the quetiapine group could be titrated to a maximum of 600 mg or 800 mg per day
      depending on body weight.

      During the second phase of the study (days 15 - 42), patients continue to take the dose of
      study medication taken in the first phase, but additional psychotropic medication could be
      added as clinically necessary to control symptoms in patients who remained sufficiently
      symptomatic (defined as a certain minimum value on a clinical global severity scale.)
