      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as epirubicin use different ways to stop cancer
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can
      locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without
      harming normal cells. Combining epirubicin with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining epirubicin with rituximab in
      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate, time to progression, and overall survival of patients with
           refractory or relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia
           treated with epirubicin and rituximab.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive epirubicin IV over 3-5 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks. Patients also
      receive rituximab IV on weeks 2 and 5 during course 1 and then on weeks 1 and 4 for all
      remaining courses. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for a maximum of 3 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5-3
      years.
