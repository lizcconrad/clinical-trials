  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if clofarabine, when given in
      combination with ara-C (cytarabine), can help to improve the disease's response to therapy
      and to increase the duration of response in patients who are 50 years or older with leukemia.
      The safety of this combination treatment will also be studied.

    <textblock>
      The treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in older patients has not improved
      significantly in recent years when compared with the considerable progress that has been made
      in younger patients. Hence, new drugs and approaches are needed in this poor-prognosis group
      of patients with AML.

      Nucleoside analogs are among the most active antileukemic agents available. Clofarabine was
      synthesized as a rational extension of the experience with other deoxyadenosine analogs.
      Clofarabine is converted to the monophosphate form by the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase which
      represents the major metabolite of clofarabine. Phosphorylation of clofarabine is
      substantially more efficient than that of other nucleosides such as fludarabine and so is
      intracellular retention of the triphosphate form of clofarabine. Mechanisms of action include
      inhibition of DNA synthesis, inhibition of DNA polymerases, and potent inhibition of
      ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) resulting in depletion of normal nucleotides and increased DNA
      uptake of the analog. Single agent clofarabine has shown activity in phase I studies in AML
      and ALL. As a potent inhibitor of RNR, however, clofarabine is ideal to be incorporated into
      biochemical modulation strategies such as have been tested and validated with fludarabine and
      ara-C in AML. By combining clofarabine with ara-C, inhibition of RNR by clofarabine will
      result in a drop of deoxynucleotides causing a decrease in the feedback inhibition of
      deoxycytidine kinase which is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of ara-CTP leading to
      increased retention of ara-CTP. Therefore, the activity of clofarabine and ara-C in leukemic
      cells would be complemented by a biochemical synergism between these agents that should
      result in better clinical efficacy. We have established the safety of the combination in
      salvage patients with acute leukemias.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic
             syndrome (MDS) (&gt; 10% blasts). Prior therapy with hydroxyurea, single agent
             chemotherapy (e.g. decitabine), hematopoietic growth factors, biological or &quot;targeted&quot;
             therapies are allowed.

          -  Age &gt; 50 years to &lt; 74 years (diploid cytogenetics) and &lt; 69 years (abnormal
             cytogenetics).

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;/= 2.

          -  Sign a written informed consent form.

          -  Adequate liver function (total bilirubin &lt; 2mg/dL, SGPT or SGOT &lt; x 4 ULN) and renal
             function (serum creatinine &lt; 2mg/dL).

          -  Male and female patients who are fertile agree to use an effective barrier method of
             birth control (ie, latex condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, etc) to avoid pregnancy.
             Female patients need a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days of study
             enrollment (applies only if patient is of childbearing potential. Non-childbearing is
             defined as &gt;= 1 year postmenopausal or surgically sterilized).

          -  Patients who are considered to require immediate induction (rapidly rising WBC &gt;/=
             50,000 and/or organ involvement as per the assessment of the treating physician) can
             be treated without final cytogenetic results and pretreatment assessment of cardiac
             ejection fraction (MUGA or echocardiogram) if by history and physical examination
             patients have &lt;/= NYHA class II disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  AML with the following cytogenetic abnormalities: t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16).
             Cytogenetic results do not need to be available if immediate induction is required
             (see inclusion #7).

          -  Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 30%. Pretreatment assessment of ejection fraction is not
             necessary if immediate induction is required as long as by history and physical
             examination patients have &lt;/= NYHA class II disease (see inclusion #7).

          -  Active and uncontrolled infection or any other severe concurrent disease considered
             life-threatening, or which, in the judgement of the investigator and after discussion
             with the Principal Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into
             the study.
