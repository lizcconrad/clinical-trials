      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab can
      locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver radioactive cancer-killing substances to
      them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in
      treating patients who have Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients
           with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the response of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
      (IDEC-Y2B8).

      Patients receive rituximab IV and indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (IDEC-In2B8) IV over 10
      minutes on day 1. Patients then undergo gamma camera scans within 2-24 hours. Approximately
      7-14 days after IDEC-In2B8, patients receive rituximab IV and IDEC-Y2B8 IV over 10 minutes.
      Treatment with IDEC-Y2B8 may repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      the achievement of a maximum cumulative dose.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IDEC-Y2B8 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
