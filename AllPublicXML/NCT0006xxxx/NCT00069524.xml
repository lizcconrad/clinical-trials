  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the short-term safety and potential efficacy of
      oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) for treatment of hyperlipidemia in HIV-infected
      patients who are taking Kaletra, a protease inhibitor (PI) that is commonly used in highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, 8-week &quot;proof of concept&quot; pilot study in 20 subjects to
      determine if there are detectable lipid-lowering effects of oyster mushrooms in patients with
      HIV and hyperlipidemia who are taking Kaletra (a ritonavir-containing HAART regimen). The
      study will also assess whether the concurrent administration of oyster mushrooms and such
      regimens is safe, and investigate the mechanism of action whereby oyster mushrooms may exert
      their antihyperlipidemic effect.
