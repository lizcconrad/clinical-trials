  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have recently validated a new device for measurement of physical activity and found it to
      detect type, duration and intensity of many types of physical activity at better than 98%
      accuracy. After further validating this device to determine if it can also accurately assess
      energy expenditure, we will use it to collect cross-sectional data on free-living physical
      activity and energy expenditure in adolescent girls.
