      The study will be conducted in four Catholic schools with children enrolled in Grades 2
      through 6. Girls and boys and children of all racial types are eligible for participation in
      the study. We anticipate that approximately 1,000 to 1200 children will volunteer for the
      study. We request enrollment of 1200 children. To participate, parents must grant written
      consent and the child must assent by signing a consent form that is attached. Two of the four
      schools that volunteer for participation in the study and are approved by the research team,
      will be randomly assigned to a health promotion program called &quot;Wise Mind for Diet and
      Physical Activity. The other two schools will be randomly assigned to a program called &quot;Wise
      Mind for Avoidance of Alcohol, Drugs, and Tobacco.&quot; Students will receive the program in the
      school that they attend. They will not be allowed to select one of the programs and will
      receive only one program, i.e., the program in their school. Both health promotion programs
      will last for two academic years. Each year, every child that is a research participant will
      be tested on two occasions, once during the first two months of school (Sept and Oct), and
      once during the last two months of school (March and April). Testing will not be conducted
      during May in order to avoid interference with school activities at the end of the academic
      year. All children (in all four schools) will have the same testing. The testing will involve
      confidential measurement of eating habits, food intake, physical activity habits, attitudes
      about alcohol, drugs, and tobacco, body weight and height, body fatness, body image, mood,
      and self-esteem. The measurement techniques that will be used for this measurement will
      include: questionnaires, weighing, measurement of height, and photography of foods before and
      after eating. All measurements will be confidential and will not be released to anyone that
      is not involved in the management of the study, including school personnel. The total time
      requirement for each testing period is expected to be approximately three hours, spread over
      four testing periods during a two-week period. The testing periods will be conducted in
      conjunction with school administrators and will not be scheduled to conflict with important
      school activities, classes, or academic tests. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will
      be organized to provide oversight for the conduct of the study.
