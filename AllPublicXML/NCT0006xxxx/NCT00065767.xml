      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with raloxifene, an
      estrogen-like medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
      osteoporosis, in improving memory and the ability to live independently in postmenopausal
      women with Alzheimer's disease.

      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of treatment with raloxifene, an
      estrogen-like medication (classified as Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SER's))
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of osteoporosis, in improving
      memory and the ability to live independently in postmenopausal women with Alzheimer's
      disease. Patients who volunteer for this study will need to visit the clinic 7 times
      (participate) over a period of five months and will receive either raloxifene or a harmless,
      inactive pill called a placebo. Neither the volunteers nor the study staff will know which
      type of pill a patient receives. Patients must be generally healthy and have mild-to-moderate
      dementia. There must be a patient caregiver who can watch for side effects and ensure that
      the patient takes the study pills on schedule over a period of three months.

      Patients will undergo neuropsychological tests and an evaluation of the ability to live
      independently at each visit as well as laboratory evaluations, such as the taking of blood.
      Each visit will last approximately 3 hours. A total of 20 patients is being recruited to
      participate in this study at the University of Wisconsin.
