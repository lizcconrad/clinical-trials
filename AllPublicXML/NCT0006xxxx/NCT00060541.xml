      This study offers evaluation and treatment of patients with a variety of neurological
      disorders that may require surgery. The protocol is not designed to test new treatments;
      rather, patients will receive standard care. The study is designed to: 1) allow NINDS s
      Surgical Neurology Branch staff to learn more about changes that cause nervous system
      disorders, 2) train physicians in the evaluation and treatment of these disorders; and 3)
      establish a pool of patients who may be eligible for other NINDS protocols. (Participants in
      this protocol will not be required to join another study; the decision will be voluntary.)

      Patients of all ages with a disorder of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or
      pituitary gland that may require surgery for diagnosis or treatment may be eligible for this
      study. In some cases surgery will not be needed. Candidates will be screened with a medical
      history and physical examination.

      Participants may undergo tests, medial treatment, or surgical treatment to help diagnose or
      treat their condition. In most cases, care provided at the NIH will be limited to evaluation
      and surgery. Procedures may include laboratory tests, imaging tests, such as magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans, angiograms, and other procedures to
      confirm the patient s diagnosis or help guide treatment. Patients who require surgery will be
      offered standard surgical care at NIH. Those whose procedure includes removal of tissues or
      fluids for diagnostic studies will be asked to allow a portion of the tissue to be used for
      research purposes, including analysis for gene and protein abnormalities that may be involved
      in causing the disorder or in influencing the patient s response to treatment. Blood samples
      will also be drawn for research.

      Objective: This protocol is designed to allow evaluation of patients with a variety of
      neurosurgical disorders for purposes of providing standard expert care and physician
      training.

      Study Population: Patients 4 years of age and older with neurosurgical-related conditions are
      eligible for this protocol. The investigators will select patients based on the most
      appropriate needs for purposes of SNB and NINDS training.

      Study Design: This is an observational study for training. Patients will receive standard
      evaluation and treatment for their condition. A physician, physician assistant, or nurse
      practitioner will obtain a medical history and perform a physical and neurological
      examination. Clinical evaluation may include laboratory and radiological studies designed to
      aid in diagnosis or differential diagnosis of the patient s condition or to facilitate
      treatment. The evaluations may take place in the outpatient clinic areas or in the inpatient
      units. Some patients will receive standard-of-care medical or surgical treatment for their
      disorder. Tissue or blood samples removed during standard treatment, if not needed for care
      of the patient, may be used for research. Genetic testing may be performed on subjects and
      their blood relatives if a genetic mechanism underlying the neurological disorder is
      suspected.

      Outcome Measures: No additional research outcome measures will be tracked in this study. All
      outcomes will be those of standard clinical evaluation and treatment.
