  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, open-label, outpatient clinical trial is designed to assess the safety
      and efficacy of daily orally administered EKB-569 in subjects with advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer. Patients must have been previously treated with a platinum- and docetaxel-based
      therapy either given concurrently or as separate regimens.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the clinical activity of EKB-569 administered
      orally as a second-line or later stage treatment in subjects with advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer. Secondary objectives include:

        -  To further evaluate the safety of EKB-569

        -  To explore additional clinical activity parameters

        -  To explore subject survival

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of EKB-569

        -  To assess subject reported outcomes

      EKB-569 will be administered orally as a single-agent. Eligible subjects will take EKB-569
      daily as long as they do not have progressive disease and are tolerating treatment.
