      RATIONALE: Lycopene, a substance found in tomatoes, may lower prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      levels and slow or prevent the development of prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of lycopene in treating patients who have
      asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer and a rising PSA level.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the percentage of patients with asymptomatic androgen-independent metastatic
           prostate cancer and an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level who sustain a
           decline in PSA after 4 months of treatment with lycopene.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response duration of PSA decline in patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Determine the time to the first consistent PSA increase in patients treated with this
           therapy.

        -  Determine whether a decline in PSA coincides with evidence of disease regression on
           physical examination or radiographic assessment in patients treated with this therapy.

        -  Determine the adverse event profile of this therapy in these patients.

        -  Determine the factors that motivate prostate cancer patients to enroll in a
           nutritional-based therapy study.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lycopene twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days for at
      least 4 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up
      to 5 years.
