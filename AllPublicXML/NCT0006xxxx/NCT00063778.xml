  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if different doses of an experimental HIV vaccine are
      safe and to study how the immune system responds to the vaccine. The vaccine will be tested
      in healthy, HIV uninfected volunteers. AVX101 contains only one of the many substances that
      HIV needs to make more copies of itself; therefore, the vaccine cannot cause HIV or AIDS.

      This study was designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an alphavirus replicon
      HIV subtype C gag vaccine. This vaccine utilizes a propagation-defective replicon vector
      system derived from an attenuated strain of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) virus. The
      vaccine replicon expresses the gag gene from a South African subtype C isolate of HIV-1.

      This study evaluated the AVX101 vaccine in healthy, HIV uninfected volunteers in both the
      United States and South Africa. Participants will be randomized to receive either vaccine or
      placebo at study entry and again at Months 1 and 3. The study was originally designed to
      enroll four groups of participants in both the US and South Africa, with successive groups
      receiving increasing doses of the vaccine, but was later amended to enroll only two groups.
      Twelve US participants (US Group 1) were randomized to receive either vaccine or placebo.
      After a review of initial safety data from this group, 12 South African participants (SA
      Group 1) were randomized to receive the same vaccine dose as US Group 1 or placebo, while 12
      US participants (US Group 2) were randomized to receive the next higher vaccine dose or
      placebo. Review of safety data from SA Group 1 and US Group 2 was used to inform the decision
      to begin enrollment into SA Group 2 .

      Participants had nine study visits over 12 months. Study visits included clinical evaluation,
      urine and blood tests, and HIV tests. After each injection, participants were asked to record
      their temperature and any symptoms each day for 7 days and report them to the clinic staff.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The sample size at each vaccine dose level was selected such that the stopping rule for not escalating the dose (2 or more vaccine-related Grade IV adverse experiences) would be met with high probability if the true toxicity rate was above 15-20%, and such that dose escalation would occur with high probability if the true toxicity rate was less than 5%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local and systemic adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after each dose</time_frame>
    <description>Reactogenicity assessments were performed for all participants before and after each injection, beginning 25 to 45 minutes post injection and continuing daily for 7 days. Assessments performed included systemic reactogenicity (body temperature, malaise and/or fatigue, myalgia, headache, chills, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting) and local reactogenicity (injection site pain, tenderness, erythema or induration, and axillary lymph node tenderness or enlargement).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binding antibodies by ELISA</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Binding antibodies to commercially available Gag protein (P55 Gag; Quality Biologicals) were assessed by ELISA using single serum dilutions (1/50 or 1/100) on samples taken at baseline, two weeks after the second and third vaccinations and at the final visit. Samples that were positive in the initial ELISA were tested by endpoint titration ELISA using six 2- to 7-fold serial dilutions of serum beginning at a 1/50 or 1/100 dilution. Magnitude of responses is reported as the difference in optical density (OD) in antigen-containing and non-antigen containing wells at the 1:50 dilution.</description>

    <description>Any participant who reported a fever greater than 38oC, or other moderate symptoms consistent with a viral illness (e.g. headache or malaise) during the 7 days following vaccination, or neurological symptoms (e.g. nuchal rigidity, ataxia, convulsions, coma, paralysis) within the window of the 2-week post vaccination visit, provided a serum sample to confirm the absence of replication-competent VEE viremia.</description>
