      Recent studies suggest that when patients learn a new motor movement, it may cause a change
      in the way the nerves act in the area of the brain that controls that movement. This change
      is called use-dependent plasticity.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the direction and extent of the changes that take
      place in the brain areas that control movement in the untrained finger after the training of
      the opposite finger. The study outcomes may help researchers to develop rehabilitation
      strategies for people who have suffered brain injuries.

      Eighteen healthy adults age 18 years or older will be enrolled in this study. Participants
      will undergo a clinical exam and then come back to the Clinical Center three times for
      sessions that will last approximately 2 hours each. For each session, participants' forearms
      will be immobilized and a small electronic device will be attached to each index finger so
      that researchers can measure their movements. Participants will be asked to move either index
      finger and to observe and concentrate on its movement. Investigators will perform
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after these motor exercises. For TMS, a
      wire coil is held over the scalp and a brief electrical current passes through the coil,
      creating a magnetic pulse that electrically stimulates the brain.

      Motor training consisting of repetition of unilateral finger movements leads to use-dependent
      plasticity (UDP) in the contralateral primary motor cortex, M1, in normal volunteers. It is
      conceivable that motor training in one hand, in addition to changes in the contralateral M1,
      could elicit plastic changes in the ipsilateral M1. The purpose of this study is to test this
      hypothesis: Training consisting of repetition of a unilateral finger movement elicits plastic
      changes in the cortical representation of the homonymous untrained finger in the ipsilateral
      M1. The study will be performed on normal volunteers and will consist of three to five
      separate training sessions. The endpoint measure will be, for each session, the change in the
      direction of the movements evoked by TMS in the untrained index finger as a function of the
      opposite index finger.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Only healthy volunteers 18 years or older will be included in this protocol. Handedness
        will be assessed by the Edinburgh Inventory Scale. All experimental sessions will be
        studied on outpatient basis. Normal Volunteers with right-handedness will be eligible to
        participate.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects with the history of epilepsy, surgery with metallic implants or known history of
        metallic particles in the eye, cardiac pacemaker, neural stimulators, cochlear implants,
        history of drug abuse, psychiatric illness (depression), hypertension or use of medications
        that influence synaptic plasticity, will be excluded as evaluated by the investigator.
