      Despite advances in medical and gene therapy, orthotopic liver transplantation remains the
      only definitive therapeutic option for children with end-stage liver disease. Recent advances
      in pre-, intra-, and early post-transplant care have resulted in a dramatic improvement in
      survival of the pediatric liver transplant patient. The broad long-range goal of our research
      program is directed at enhancing the patient's long-term survival. Our primary focus relates
      to obligate life-long immunosuppression, with its inherent complications including severe
      infection and development of cancer. These two complications come together in a single
      disease, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)- associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder
      (PTLD). EBV, a latent human lymphotrophic herpes virus infects and immortalizes B cells.
      Primary infection usually occurs via salivary exchange and results in a mild, self-limited
      illness followed by life-long EBV-specific T cell controlled EBV latency. T cell-based
      immunosuppression prevents allograft rejection, however, it also suppresses cytotoxic T
      lymphocyte (CTL) function, generating an environment in which EBV-infected cells can
      proliferate. Patients receiving life-long T cell-based immunosuppression have an increased
      risk of developing PTLD due to their inability to produce normal immunoregulatory responses.
      This disease is particularly devastating to the pediatric patient as its incidence is at
      least 4-fold greater than in the adult liver transplant patient population. In fact, PTLD is
      the number one cause of death following pediatric liver transplantation. At this time, there
      is no definitive method of prospectively detecting, diagnosing, or treating PTLD, and current
      treatment protocols place the liver allograft and patient at risk. Therefore, a diagnostic
      tool that is both sensitive and specific, and a treatment strategy with low toxicity are
      greatly needed to decrease the morbidity and mortality suffered by the pediatric liver
      transplant patient with PTLD. Our proposed studies will support our hypothesis that the
      combination of a persistently elevated EBV load in the setting of a diminished immune
      response to EBV will be an early risk indicator associated with PTLD development, and that
      pre-emptive treatment utilizing autologous adoptive EBV-specific CTL immunotherapy will
      provide a low toxicity treatment option.
