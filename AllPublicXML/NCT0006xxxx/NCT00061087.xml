      This project is a three armed double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial comparing
      the efficacy of MPH and BPR, relative to each other and to placebo, for treating persistent
      ADHD in methadone-maintained patients. One hundred and twenty subjects, will be randomized to
      receive either MPH, BPR, or placebo with equal probability. Randomization will be stratified
      by site, and whether or not cocaine is also being used. Efficacy will be measured by
      treatment retention, reduction in illicit drug use and drug craving, improvement of ADHD
      symptoms and overall functional status.
