      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel and carboplatin use different ways
      to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Celecoxib may increase the
      effectiveness of a chemotherapy drug by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug, may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor, and/or may block the
      enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth. Giving combination chemotherapy with celecoxib
      before surgery may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with
      carboplatin followed by surgery works compared to giving paclitaxel together with carboplatin
      and celecoxib followed by surgery in treating patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the complete pathological response rate and/or minimal residual microscopic
           disease in patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer treated with preoperative
           paclitaxel and carboplatin with vs without celecoxib.

        -  Compare the clinical response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare chemotherapy-related toxicity in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the time to progression, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to use of aspirin for prior cardiovascular disease (yes vs no). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on
           days 1, 22, and 43. Patients also receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 1
           and continuing until the morning of surgical resection.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I and an oral placebo
           twice daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until the morning of surgical resection.

      In both arms, patients undergo surgical resection and complete mediastinal lymph node
      dissection within 3-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy. Patients resume oral celecoxib
      or placebo twice daily within 28-42 days after surgery and continue until 3 years from the
      date of randomization in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3-6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 110 patients (55 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
