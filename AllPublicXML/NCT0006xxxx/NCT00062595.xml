    <textblock>
      This one year study of the K vitamers phylloquinone (K1) and menatetranone (MK4) will study
      supplementation effects on bone turnover and bone density. Women at least 5 years
      postmenopause with normal bone density who do not use estrogen therapy or the following
      medications may be eligible:

      alendronate (Fosamax), risedronate (Actonel), pamidronate (Aredia), etidronate (Didronel),
      zoledronate (Zometa), teriparatide (Forteo), raloxifene (Evista), tamoxifene, warfarin
      (Coumadin), anti-seizure medications, prednisone, or oral steroids. Eligible subjects will
      take calcium and vitamin D (Citracal) twice a day for the first two months and through-out
      the study. After the first two months, subjects are randomized to the K1, MK4 or placebo
      groups. Return visits occur at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Fasting blood and urine is collected at
      each visit and bone density is performed at 3 study visits.
