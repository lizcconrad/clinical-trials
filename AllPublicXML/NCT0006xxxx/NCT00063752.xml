  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune disease affecting approximately 40,000 people
      worldwide. People with PV produce antibodies that attack the cells of the skin, resulting in
      blisters which, if left untreated, can lead to devastating infections and discomfort.
      Currently, most doctors who treat patients with PV will prescribe high-dose steroids and
      drugs that suppress the immune system in an effort to decrease the production of these
      antibodies. Unfortunately these medications are associated with serious and difficult side
      effects that often result in the discontinuation of their use. Peptimmune, Inc. has developed
      a new therapy for the treatment of PV, PI-0824. The goal of this therapy is to reduce the
      production of antibodies that cause PV blisters by acting only on the disease causing
      components of the immune system. It is hoped that use of PI-0824 will reduce or potentially
      eliminate the need for high dose steroids and drugs that suppress the immune system.
