  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) is caused by injury to the nerve to the affected vocal
      fold. The injury to the vocal fold makes the affected person's voice sound &quot;breathy&quot;. Voice
      therapy is usually tried first, and, if unsuccessful, surgical treatment is considered. The
      standard surgical treatment is called vocal fold medialization and aims to bring the injured
      cord to the midline. An alternative surgical treatment, vocal fold reinnervation, aims to
      bring a new nerve supply to the injured vocal fold. The reinnervation operation, which has
      some potential advantages over the medialization operation also requires several months for
      final results to be gained. The goal of this multicenter, randomized clinical trial is to see
      which of the two surgical treatments produces a better outcome.

      In order to participate in this study patients with UVFP must meet all entry criteria and
      must be released from voice therapy by a speech-language pathologist. Information collected
      for the study (pre-surgery, and at 6 and 12 months after surgery) includes voice recordings,
      movies made of vocal fold function, airflow and pressure measurements of the voicebox, and an
      outcomes questionnaire.

      Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) is caused by injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
      Patients with UVFP may have significant impairment of vocal fold function, including a
      breathy paralytic dysphonia. There are several available approaches for the treatment of this
      condition. Vocal fold medialization is currently used by most otolaryngologists and is
      probably the standard of care for treating UVFP. An alternative approach is laryngeal
      reinnervation, which has a number of potential advantages over medialization but which
      requires several months before a final result is achieved. The primary goal of this
      multicenter, randomized clinical trial is to determine which approach produces a better
      outcome.

      Patients with UVFP meeting all inclusion criteria and released from therapy by a
      speech-language pathologist will be randomized into either the medialization arm or the
      reinnervation arm. The data collection protocol consists of voice recordings, aerodynamic
      measurements, electroglottography, videostroboscopy, and a clinical outcomes questionnaire
      collected pre-treatment and at 6 and 12 months post-treatment.
