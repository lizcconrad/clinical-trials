  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a woman becomes pregnant, the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus
      (endometrium). The endometrium is constantly changing throughout a woman’s menstrual cycle in
      response to the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. The endometrium must have certain
      characteristics (be at a specific phase in its cycle) in order for the fertilized egg to
      successfully attach. Infertility may be caused by an &quot;out of phase&quot; endometrium (i.e., the
      endometrium doesn’t have the right characteristics when the fertilized egg reaches it). The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the endometrial biopsy is useful in predicting
      the potential for becoming pregnant and bearing a child.

      This study will evaluate the utility of the endometrial biopsy as a tool for the routine
      evaluation of the luteal phase of women presenting for infertility evaluation. The study will
      establish whether the mid-luteal or late-luteal phase is the most appropriate time to perform
      an endometrial biopsy. The study will be conducted through the multi-center Reproductive
      Medicine Network.

      Women with a history of infertility will be age matched to fertile women (controls). Women
      will be randomized either to the mid-luteal phase (7 to 8 days post-ovulation) endometrial
      biopsy group or to the late-luteal phase (12 to 13 days post-ovulation) endometrial biopsy
      group. Endometrial specimens will be evaluated histologically by a &quot;blinded&quot; pathologist.
