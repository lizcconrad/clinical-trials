  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to give patients who have had 4 or more prior lines of therapy
      for multiple myeloma access to VELCADE. The study is for patients who are not eligible for
      other clinical trials with VELCADE and for who VELCADE would otherwise not be available.

          -  Patient meets pretreatment laboratory criteria at and within 14 to 21 days before
             Baseline (Day 1 of Cycle 1, before study drug administration).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient progressed while receiving VELCADE previously in a clinical trial.

          -  Patient has been treated in Millennium Study M34101-039.
