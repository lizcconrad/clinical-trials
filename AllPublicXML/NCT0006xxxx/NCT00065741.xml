  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A series of clinical studies will be conducted in normal, healthy adult volunteers to
      evaluate the potential for alterations in the pharmacokinetics of anti HIV drugs when
      botanicals/nutriceuticals are given concurrently via the oral route. Both the drugs and
      botanicals are known to rely upon or to modulate, respectively, metabolism via
      glucuronidation.
