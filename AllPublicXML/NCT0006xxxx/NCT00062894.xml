    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the blood pharmacokinetics in patients with previously
      untreated or relapsed follicular or transformed follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who have
      received a dosimetric dose of fission-derived iodine I 131 tositumomab.

      This is a multi-center study in which 12 patients with previously untreated or relapsed
      follicular or transformed follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will receive a dosimetric dose of
      fission-derived Iodine I 131 Tositumomab followed by a therapeutic dose of tellurium-derived
      Iodine I 131 Tositumomab. Blood Pharmacokinetics, total body clearance, tumor and organ
      dosimetry, and biodistribution will be assessed following administration of the dosimetric
      dose.
