    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of two concentration ranges
      of valproate using Depakote Sprinkle Capsules as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of
      partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in children 3-10 years.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subject has diagnosis of partial seizures with/without secondary generalization, supported
        by:

          -  Observed ictal events consistent with partial seizures: With/ without secondary
             generalization; Documented by reliable observers

          -  1 of following 2: EEG at some time in past demonstrating focal abnormalities
             consistent with partial seizures; OR, in absence of demonstrable EEG abnormality:
             MRI/CT scan evidence of a focal CNS lesion consistent with partial seizures

          -  On stable dose of 1 or 2 antiepileptic drug(s) (AED) other than valproate, for at
             least 1 month

          -  Not taking valproate or is currently receiving valproate resulting in a trough
             concentration of less than 40 mcg/mL

          -  History of at least 4 partial seizures/month in 2 months prior to screening

          -  Parent/caregiver is able to keep an accurate seizure diary

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  History of any of following: Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; Primary generalized seizures;
             Infantile spasms; Mixed seizure disorders including atypical absence; Myoclonic or
             atonic seizures; Pseudoseizures or Epilepsia Partialis Continuans (EPC)

          -  Has had status epilepticus in the past 6 months

          -  Has significant history of any of following that would confound study results: Cardiac
             (including clinically important abnormality on ECG); Renal; Psychiatric (including
             psychosurgery); Oncologic; Endocrine; Metabolic; Pancreatic; Hepatic disease
             (including clinical/serological history of hepatitis); Urea cycle disorder

          -  Has: Expanding CNS neoplasm; Active CNS infection; Demyelinating disease; Degenerative
             neurological disease; Progressive encephalopathy; or any Progressive CNS disease

          -  Has platelet count less than or equal to 100,000/mcL

          -  Has blood chemistry ALT/AST value(s) greater than or equal to 2 times upper limit of
             normal at screening

          -  Requires anticoagulant drug therapy

          -  Not expected to be able to maintain same dose of all pre-study AEDs, excluding
             valproate, throughout study

          -  Receiving systemic chemotherapy

          -  Has taken lamotrigine, felbamate, or pemoline, within past 3 months prior to screening

          -  Has been on ketogenic diet within 30 days prior to screening

          -  Considered by investigator to be non-responder to valproate for treatment of epilepsy
             (e.g., Despite adequate trial with serum concentrations of 60 mcg/mL or greater,
             subject continues to have inadequate seizure control)
