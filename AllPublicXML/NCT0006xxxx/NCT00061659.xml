        Inclusion Criteria

        A subject will be eligible for study participation if all of the following criteria are
        met:

          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age.

          -  The subject has histologically confirmed high grade locally advanced or metastatic
             soft tissue sarcoma (excluding Ewings sarcoma and chondrosarcoma) not amenable to
             surgery, radiotherapy or combined modality therapy with curative intent.

          -  The subject must have at least one lesion with measurable disease by RECIST criteria
             using CT or MRI.

          -  The subject has received no more than two cytotoxic treatment regimens, not including
             adjuvant therapy for sarcoma.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-1.

          -  The subject is able to self-administer or has a caregiver who can reliably administer
             subcutaneous injections.

          -  The subject must have adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function as follows:

               -  Bone marrow: White blood cell count (WBC) greater than or equal to 3,000/mm3;
                  Platelets; greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3; Hemoglobin greater than or equal
                  to 9.0 g/dL;

               -  Renal function: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL;

               -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL; AST and ALT less
                  than or equal to 1.5 X the upper normal limit (ULN) unless liver metastases are
                  present, then AST and ALT less than or equal to 5.0 x ULN.

          -  The subject must not be pregnant or lactating and all subjects (male and female) must
             use a contraceptive method deemed acceptable by the investigator while in the study
             and for up to two months following completion of therapy.

          -  The subject has voluntarily signed and dated an Institutional Review Board
             (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved consent prior to any study specific
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria

        A subject will be ineligible for study participation if any of the following criteria are
        met:

          -  The subject has a history of or currently exhibits Central Nervous System (CNS)
             metastasis. Brain MRI within 28 days of enrollment is required to confirm absence of
             CNS metastases

          -  The subjects is receiving therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. Low dose
             anticoagulation (e.g. low dose Coumadin) for catheter prophylaxis will be permitted;
             PT/PTT must be within normal limits.

          -  The subject has a history of or currently exhibits clinically significant cancer
             related events of bleeding (e.g. hemoptysis). The subject has a recent history (within
             4 weeks of Study Day 1) or currently exhibits other clinically significant signs of
             bleeding.

          -  The subject has received any therapy for sarcoma including chemotherapy, radiotherapy
             or any investigational therapy.

          -  The subject exhibits evidence of clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s)
             and/or is considered by the investigator to be unable to tolerate the proposed
             treatment or procedures.

          -  The subject has history of other previous malignancies within five years, with the
             exception of:Adequately treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri; Basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  The subject's life expectancy is less than 12 weeks.
