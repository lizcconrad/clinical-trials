  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spina bifida (myelomeningocele) is a complex birth defect in which a portion of the spinal
      cord is not fully developed. The overlying bones and skin are incompletely formed and the
      underdeveloped area of the spinal cord is exposed on the surface of the back. Spina bifida
      defects are closed soon after birth to prevent further damage to the spinal cord and nerves.
      The Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) is a research study comparing two approaches
      to the treatment of babies with spina bifida: surgery before birth (prenatal surgery) and the
      standard closure, surgery after birth (postnatal surgery).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since 1997, more than 200 fetuses have had in utero closure of myelomeningocele by open
      maternal-fetal surgery. Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that this procedure reduces
      the incidence of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and restores the cerebellum and brainstem to
      more normal configuration. However, clinical results of prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele
      are based on comparisons with historical controls and examine only efficacy, not safety. MOMS
      will determine if intrauterine repair of fetal myelomeningocele at 19 to 25 weeks of
      gestation improves outcomes as compared to standard postnatal repair. Outcomes assessed
      include death, the need for ventricular decompressive shunting by one year of life and
      neurologic function at 30 months of age.

      Two hundred women, whose fetuses have spina bifida, will be enrolled in the study and
      randomized to have either prenatal surgery or postnatal surgery. After a central screening
      process which includes a medical record review, all women will have an extensive baseline
      evaluation that will include ultrasound, MRI, physical exam, social work evaluation,
      psychological screening, and education about spina bifida and prenatal surgery.

      For women who are eligible following the central screening process, all screening, surgery
      and follow-up visits will be performed at one of three MOMS Centers. The mother, if eligible,
      and her support person will travel (at the expense of the study) to the MOMS Center for
      screening and randomization.

      Women assigned to have prenatal surgery will be scheduled for surgery within 1 to 3 days
      after they are randomized. They will stay near the MOMS Center until they deliver. Women in
      the postnatal group will travel back to their assigned MOMS Center to deliver. Both groups
      will deliver their babies by C-section around the 37th week of their pregnancies. Babies born
      to women in the postnatal surgery group will have their spina bifida defects closed when they
      are medically stable, usually within 48 hours of birth.

      Children and their parents will return to their assigned MOMS Center at 1 year and 2 Â½ years
      of age for follow-up evaluation. Motor function, developmental progress, and bladder, kidney,
      and brain development will be assessed.

      The children will be asked to return for an additional follow-up visit (MOMS2) between the
      ages of 6-10 years. This follow-up is to determine whether children who received the surgery
      before birth have better health and mental outcomes and live more independently and function
      more safely and appropriately in daily life than those who received the surgery after birth.
