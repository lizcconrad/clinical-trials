    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of low-dose radiation therapy to the abdomen
      combined with docetaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or persistent advanced
      ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to
      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with
      radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel in combination with low-dose abdominal
      radiotherapy in patients with recurrent or persistent advanced ovarian, peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer.

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes once daily on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 35.
      Within 3 hours after beginning docetaxel, patients also receive low-dose abdominal
      radiotherapy twice daily (at least 4 hours apart) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 24, 29, 30,
      35, and 36. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
