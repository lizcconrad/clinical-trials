  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Encopresis, also known as fecal incontinence, is the voluntary or involuntary passage of
      stools causing soiling of clothes by a child over 4 years of age. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate an Internet intervention for the treatment of encopresis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 2.3% of children suffer from encopresis. Enhanced Toilet Training (ETT) is one
      of the most effective ways of treating this disorder. When delivered by skilled and
      knowledgeable clinicians, ETT is twice as effective as intensive medical management alone.
      Although ETT is effective in treating encopretic children, there are six major barriers to
      its implementation: 1) availability of a knowledgeable and skilled clinician; 2) parental
      acceptance of referral to a mental health professional; 3) expense of service; 4) burden of
      time and distance to access such specialty services; 5) child resistance to disclosure of
      embarrassing material; and 6) willingness of the child and parent to follow treatment
      recommendations. This project will circumvent these barriers by developing an interactive
      Internet-based ETT program. The study will then assess the feasibility of the program by
      determining the acceptance, function, and effectiveness of the intervention.

      This project will have four phases. Phase 1 will identify optimal Internet and treatment
      elements as well as issues in need of experimental investigation. Phase 2 will investigate
      how to enhance Internet interventions. Phase 3 will evaluate the relative benefit of adding
      the Internet treatment to clinical services provided by clinicians in the fields of medicine
      and mental health. Phase 4 will investigate the relative long-term benefits of adding such an
      Internet-based intervention to professional care to determine its impact on symptom
      improvement, relapse prevention, quality of life, and its cost-effectiveness. Phase 4 will
      also assess to what extent the program is disseminated worldwide when made available on the
      Internet.
