  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well tipifarnib works in treating patients with
      metastatic malignant melanoma. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the clinical response rate in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma
      treated with R115777 (tipifarnib).

      II. To evaluate the safety of R115777 in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess RhoC expression in tumor samples pre- and post- therapy with R115777.

      II. To evaluate Ftase levels in peripheral blood and tumor samples pre- and post-therapy with
      R115777.

      III. To assess the effect of R115777 treatment on T lymphocyte cytokine production, pre- and
      post- therapy with R115777.

      IV. Estimate time to treatment failure (TTF). Time to treatment failure is defined as time to
      withdrawal for unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease.

      OUTLINE Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for at least 2 courses and for a maximum of 2 years in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) receive 2
      additional courses beyond CR.

      Patients who discontinue therapy due to toxicity or complete response are followed every 3
      months for 2 years after study entry. Patients who discontinue therapy due to disease
      progression are followed every 6 months for 2 years after study entry. Patients with stable
      or partially responding disease who complete treatment are followed at 2 years after study
      entry.

          -  Patients must have at least 2 cutaneous lesions amenable to excisional biopsy for
