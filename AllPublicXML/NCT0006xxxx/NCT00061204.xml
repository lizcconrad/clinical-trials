  <brief_summary>

      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify brain regions involved in
      performing certain tasks, especially those involving emotions. MRI is a diagnostic tool that
      uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of structural and chemical
      changes in the brain. The study will also examine which MRI techniques are best to use when
      scanning brain areas involved in different emotions.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age who are right-handed and are native
      English speakers may be eligible for this study. Individuals with a history of neurological
      disease, post-traumatic stress disorder or other psychiatric disorder, or who have a history
      of physical or sexual abuse may not participate. Candidates will be screened with a written
      questionnaire and a medical history, including psychiatric and neurological information.

      Participants will perform tasks involving emotions while undergoing MRI scanning. For this
      procedure, the subject lies on a table in a narrow metal cylinder (the scanner) containing a
      magnetic field. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting
      between 45 and 90 minutes. The subject is asked to lie still for up to 10 minutes at a time.
      During the scan, the subject performs simple tasks involving the viewing of pictures on a
      screen. Other tasks involve viewing pictures and responding to them by pressing buttons. Some
      pictures are violent or pornographic, while others are pleasant to view. Of a total of 162
      pictures, 30 percent are categorized as graphic and possibly disturbing.

      The purpose of the protocol is to localize the neural regions and systems mediating the forms
      of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the
      human prefrontal cortex. Utilizing experimental neuropsychological tasks during functional
      MRI on healthy adult volunteers, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing as opposed to the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, involved in nonsocial-events (planning, problem solving,
      economic exchange and reasoning). We will also attempt to determine the relationship between
      non-frontal neural structures involved in emotional expression, such as the amygdala, and
      those frontal neural structures involved in executive functions that may modulate emotion.
      Another goal of our study is to test different fMRI sequences to determine which one gives us
      the best quality of signal in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (affected by signal
      drop-out due to magnetic susceptibility artifacts). The data that we collect in this protocol
      will be of value in (1) identifying a set of neural regions and distributed networks
      mediating the forms of knowledge representation stored in the prefrontal cortex, and (2)
      contributing to optimization of functional imaging of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex
      at high field strength (3 Tesla). We will also use the data obtained in these studies to
      constrain theories of frontal lobe function and to provide evidence for the role of specific
      frontal cortex sectors in specific cognitive functions.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The study population will consist of young healthy volunteers.

        Age range: 18 to 40

        Right-handedness (some left-handed subjects may be recruited for preliminary behavioral
        studies)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals with a neurological or psychiatric history or medical condition that would
        compromise our interpretation of the fMRI results will be excluded.

        Individuals with a current or past history of post-traumatic stress disorder or other
        psychiatric disorder or individuals with a history of physical or sexual abuse will be
        excluded as they may be disturbed by viewing graphic pictures.

        Subjects with contraindications to exposure to high magnetic field.
