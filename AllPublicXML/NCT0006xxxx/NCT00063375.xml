  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop an interactive computer-based version of cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT) and compare its effectiveness to book-based CBT for the treatment of panic disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Panic disorder (PD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating condition. Unfortunately, many
      people with PD go untreated because of the high cost and low availability of treatment.
      Research shows that CBT is an effective treatment for PD. When administered as a self-help,
      computer based treatment, CBT may provide a less expensive, more engaging treatment for PD.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive computer based treatment,
      book based treatment, or no treatment for 10 weeks. After these 10 weeks, symptoms of anxiety
      and depression will be measured with patient interviews, scales, and questionnaires.
