      RATIONALE: The herb ginger may help to reduce or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients
      receiving chemotherapy for cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well ginger works in reducing or
      preventing nausea and vomiting in patients who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the prevalence and severity of delayed nausea and vomiting in patients with
           cancer undergoing chemotherapy treated with lower-dose ginger vs higher-dose ginger vs
           placebo.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the prevalence and severity of acute nausea and vomiting in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine whether patients can determine if they are receiving placebo or study drug,
           and by which variable (e.g., taste, smell, or decrease in nausea and vomiting).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Patients are stratified according to concurrent
      antiemetic type (5-HT_3 antagonist vs NK1 antagonist).

        -  Arm I: Patients receive lower-dose oral ginger twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive higher-dose oral ginger twice daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. In all arms, treatment begins
           immediately after the chemotherapy treatment and continues for 3 days.

      Patients are followed at 1 week.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
