  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess the clinical activity of MAC-321 administered IV as a second-line or third-line
      antineoplastic agent to subjects with advanced colorectal cancer. Clinical activity will be
      assessed by determining the percentage of subjects exhibiting an objective response (complete
      plus partial responses). Tumor response will be assessed following modified Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.
