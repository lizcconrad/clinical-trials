      Prospective memory (PM) is memory to complete future tasks, such as recalling to give a note
      to someone when you next see them, pick up milk on the way home, or remembering to keep an
      appointment. This study will evaluate PM in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI).

      While much has been learned about how children with TBIs learn and recall stories, word
      lists, and pictures, little is known about how they perform PM tasks. Impairment in PM could
      have serious implications for academic and vocational pursuits. This study will investigate
      PM in children with mild or severe TBI. The study will focus on three major themes: 1)
      strategies that may help children with TBI overcome or minimize their PM deficits; 2) how
      specific areas of cognition can be impaired following TBI and in turn impair PM; and 3) the
      impact of PM deficits on a child's daily functioning, both at school and at home. The study
      will also evaluate children without TBI (control group).

      Each child will participate in one study evaluation. The evaluation will last approximately 4
      hours, with a lunch break and other rest breaks as necessary. Assessments will include
      neuropsychological tests of attention, memory, and general intellectual functioning.
      Experimental tasks will include measures of metacognition for prospective memory, elucidation
      of strategic versus automatic processes involved in PM, and the effect of motivation
      manipulations in overcoming PM deficits with varying working memory loads. The child's parent
      or guardian will also be asked to complete some tests to measure the impact of PM deficits on
      the child's daily home life.
