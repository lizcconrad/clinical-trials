      This is a Phase I, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that will enroll
      approximately 50 adult subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic, diabetic
      foot ulcers. The study will be conducted at approximately 12 investigational sites in the
      United States.
