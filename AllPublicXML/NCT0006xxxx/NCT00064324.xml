    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of perifosine in treating patients who have
      advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as perifosine use different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the 6-month progression-free rate in patients treated with perifosine and
      having advanced soft tissue sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate survival and time to progression. II. To evaluate objective tumor response
      status and duration. III. To evaluate adverse event rates. IV. To evaluate patterns of
      treatment failure. V. To evaluate pharmacokinetics.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive a loading dose of oral perifosine every 6 hours for a total of 4 doses on
      day 1 and once daily on days 2-28 of course 1 only. For all subsequent courses, patients
      receive oral perifosine once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed advanced soft tissue sarcoma

          -  Measurable disease; measurable disease lesions that are being monitored for response
             and have been previously irradiated must have progressed &gt; 25% since completion of
             radiation therapy

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  PLT &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; upper normal limit (UNL)

          -  AST =&lt; 2.5 x UNL

          -  Creatinine =&lt; UNL or calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min (i.e. using the
             Cockcroft-Gault or Jeliffe methods)

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks

          -  ECOG performance status (PS) 0 or 1

          -  Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of
             the study and able to provide valid informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any of the following as this regimen may be harmful to a developing fetus or nursing
             child:

               -  Pregnant women

               -  Breastfeeding women

               -  Men or women of childbearing potential or their sexual partners who are unwilling
                  to employ adequate contraception (condoms, diaphragm, birth control pills,
                  injections, intrauterine device [IUD], surgical sterilization, subcutaneous
                  implants, or abstinence, etc.)

               -  NOTE: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because perifosine is an
                  alkylphospholipid with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects;
                  because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
                  infants secondary to treatment of the mother with perifosine, breastfeeding
                  should be discontinued if the mother is treated with perifosine

          -  Any of the following:

               -  &gt;= 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for metastatic sarcoma

               -  Chemotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Nitrosoureas or mitomycin C =&lt; 6 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Radiotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Immunotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Biologic therapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Failure to recover from acute, reversible effects of prior therapy regardless of
                  interval since last treatment

          -  Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy
             considered investigational (utilized for a non-FDA-approved indication and in the
             context of a research investigation)

          -  Uncontrolled brain metastases; NOTE: these patients are excluded because of the poor
             prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; however, if brain
             metastasis are treated and controlled for &gt; 8 weeks, the patient would be eligible for
             this study

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to perifosine

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, symptomatic
             cardiac arrhythmia despite appropriate therapy, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy; NOTE: these
             patients are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions
             with perifosine; appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Prior malignancy, except for the following:

               -  Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer

               -  Adequately treated noninvasive carcinoma

               -  Other invasive cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years
