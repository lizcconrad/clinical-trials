      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as talampanel use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well talampanel works in treating patients with
      recurrent, progressive high-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of talampanel, in terms of 6-month progression-free survival, in
           patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in patients who are and who are not
           receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma vs
      glioblastoma multiforme). Patients in each stratum are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups
      according to concurrent enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug use (yes, no, or valproic acid).

      Patients in each group receive different doses of oral talampanel 3 times daily on days 1-42.
      Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 3 weeks during the first course, every 6 weeks
      before all subsequent courses, and then within 2 weeks of study completion.

      Patients are followed within 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 91 patients (50 with anaplastic astrocytoma and 41 with
      glioblastoma multiforme) will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
