  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Good control of blood glucose levels is important in preventing complications from diabetes.
      This study assessed the accuracy and reliability of two FDA-approved continuous glucose
      monitors, the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) and the GlucoWatch G2 Biographer
      (GW2B), in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive control of blood glucose levels has been shown to substantially prevent or delay
      complications of T1DM in adolescents and adults. The major limitation to implementation of
      intensive glycemic control is hypoglycemia. Younger children may be at increased risk for
      hypoglycemia and the risk/benefit ratio of intensive glycemic control may be less favorable
      in this population. Intensive therapy has not been systematically evaluated in children less
      than 13 years of age. This study was conducted by the Diabetes Research in Children Network
      (DirecNet) to assess the accuracy of the CGMS and the GW2B glucose monitors in comparison
      with standard blood glucose measurements in an inpatient setting.

      During 24-hour clinical research center stays at five clinical centers, approximately 90
      children and adolescents with T1DM (1 to 17 years of age) wore two FDA-approved continuous
      glucose monitors, CGMS and GW2B, and had frequent serum glucose determinations during the day
      and night. To assess glucose monitor function during periods of rising and falling blood
      glucose, insulin-induced hypoglycemia and meal-induced hyperglycemia tests were also
      performed.
