      The purpose of the protocol is to localize the neural regions and systems mediating the forms
      of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the
      human prefrontal cortex. Utilizing a variety of experimental neuropsychological tasks during
      functional MRI, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral and
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will
      ascertain the relationship between so-called cold cognition such as event knowledge and &quot;hot&quot;
      social cognition such as attitude formation and specific brain regions within the prefrontal
      cortex. We will also attempt to determine the relationship between non-frontal neural
      structures involved in emotional expressions, such as amygdala, and those frontal neural
      structures involved in executive functions that may modulate emotion. The data that we
      collect in this protocol will be of value in (1) identifying a set of neural regions and
      distributed networks mediating the forms of knowledge representation stored in the prefrontal
      cortex and (2) developing functional MRI screening measures for subjects at-risk for
      developing a neurological disorder. We will also use the data obtained in these studies with
      healthy adult volunteers to constrain theories of frontal lobe function based on the study of
      patients with focal or diffuse frontal lobe lesions and to provide convergent evidence for
      the role of specific frontal cortex sectors in specific cognitive functions.

      Objective

      The purpose of the protocol is to localize the neural regions and systems mediating the forms
      of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the
      human prefrontal cortex. We suspect that political attitudes can also be viewed as a type of
      stored knowledge. Religious attitudinal and event knowledge are also expected to be similarly
      represented and stored. Utilizing a variety of experimental neuropsychological tasks during
      functional MRI, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral and
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will
      ascertain the relationship between so-called &quot;cold&quot; cognition such as event knowledge and
      &quot;hot&quot; social cognition such as attitude formation and specific brain regions within the
      prefrontal cortex.

      Study Population

      Normal adult volunteers will participate in experiments dealing with processing of event
      knowledge, general attitudes, political stereotypes and attitudes, and religious attitudes,
      using fMRI.

      Design

      All the experiments will employ within-subject event-related fMRI design to determine whether
      activations of different cortical areas correspond to different kind of stored knowledge.

      Outcome Measures

      The data that we collect in this protocol will consist of fMRI activation images
      corresponding to varying neuropsychological tasks. The will be of value in (1) identifying a
      set of neural regions and distributed networks mediating the forms of knowledge
      representation stored in the prefrontal cortex and (2) developing functional MRI screening
      measures for subjects at-risk for developing a neurological disorder.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The healthy normal controls recruited into these studies will be determined by Section
        staff phone and in-person interviews to be free of psychiatric, neurological, or other
        medical disorders that would constrain interpretation of their performance during
        functional neuroimaging studies. In addition, all normal volunteers must undergo a
        neuroexam performed by the medically responsible investigator, an NINDS physician, once a
        year before undergoing MRI scanning. The neurological exam will be done in the neurology
        outpatient clinic.

        All subjects will be native English-speakers and right-handed, as measured by the Edinburgh
        Handedness Inventory, due to the association between language lateralization and
        handedness.

        In addition, all subjects in Study 3 (that addresses political stereotypes) will be
        American and will be screened for political affiliation using several measures prior to
        participation in the study.

        Political affiliation will be assessed by obtaining (1) self-reported political orientation
        of the subject on a scale of 1 to 7 (where 1 is extremely liberal and 7 is extremely
        conservative, Wyer et al., 1991), (2) political party preference of the subject on a scale
        of 1 to 7 (where 1 is strongly Democratic and 7 is strongly Republican, Wyer et al., 1991),
        and (3) scores on the Conservatism-Liberalism Scale (Mehrabian, 1996). Subjects rating
        their orientation and preference (measures 1 and 2) as 3 or lower or 5 or higher and also
        scoring higher than 20 or lower than -20 (maximum scores are plus or minus 28) on the
        Conservatism-Liberalism Scale will be included in the study. American citizenship and the
        political screening is necessary to enable the classification of conditions as
        stereotype-congruent and - incongruent (as this is determined by their status as 'Democrat'
        or 'Republican'). Subjects in Study 4 (that addresses political psychological structures)
        will be screened to be American citizens prior to participating to the study. Party
        affiliation, political orientation and adjunctive demographical data will be collected at
        the end of the fMRI scan to be eventually considered as a potential source of variability
        in the statistical analysis.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals with a neurological or psychiatric history or medical condition that would
        compromise our interpretation of the fMRI results will be excluded.

        Exclusion criteria are: medical contraindications to MRI procedures (e.g. pacemakers,
        cochlear devices, surgical clips); technical contraindications to MRI procedures (e.g. no
        braces); CNS active medications; and claustrophobia.

        Pregnant women will also be excluded from participation due to the unknown effects of the
        high magnetic field on a developing fetus; to ensure compliance with this criterion, all
        women will undergo a pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to the scan. The results of the
        pregnancy test must be negative in order for the women to be scanned.
