    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that cells in the bone marrow-endothelial precursor cells (EPCs)-can
      provide a blood supply to cancerous tumors.

      The purpose of this study is to collect brain tumor and blood samples to look for these EPCs
      in the samples and analyze the growth signals that may help blood vessels to grow in tumors.
      Researchers will study the following in the samples: 1) the number of blood vessels in the
      tumor; 2) the levels of growth factors in the tumor and blood; 3) the levels of circulating
      EPCs in the blood; and 4) the changes in the genes and proteins in the blood and tumor that
      influence growth factor levels.

      Participants will be 18 years of age or older and have evidence of a brain tumor that
      requires surgery. From this surgery they will donate blood and tumor samples. Participants
      will have follow-up visits 4 to 8 weeks after surgery, then at 3-month intervals for
      two-and-one-half years, then at 6-month intervals thereafter. At these visits, participants
      will undergo a physical exam, a brain scan, and blood work.

      Angiogenesis, or the development of new blood vessels, appears to be one of the keys to tumor
      survival. Areas of new blood vessel growth, or neovascularization, such as with trauma or
      tissue ischemia, appear to release factors that stimulate production of endothelial cells
      from progenitor stem cells located in the bone marrow. Endothelial cells for the inside
      lining of blood vessels are important in the formation of viable and functional blood vessel
      conduits. Recent work suggests that tumors-including primary brain tumors-secrete many of the
      same stimulatory growth factors as normally incite endothelial cells to be produced and
      turned out into the circulation. Initial evidence suggests that these circulating endothelial
      progenitor cells (EPCs) play a role in the impressive neovascularization seen with tumors. In
      this study, we wish to investigate the interaction of gliomas and EPCs to elucidate a
      potential role for EPCs in tumor formation, response to therapy, progression, and overall
      survival, as well, to identify potential new targets for anti-tumor and/or anti-angiogenic
      therapies using genomic and proteomic techniques.

      Patients suspected of having, or with prior biopsy proof of, a WHO grade II-IV central
      nervous system (CNS) glial tumor(s) seen in the Surgical Neurology Branch, NINDS, will be
      considered for entry into this study. Tissue samples of tumor resected as part of standard
      care will be collected at surgery and preserved for research. Blood samples will also be
      collected. Blood will also be collected from anonymous normal volunteers who donate blood at
      the NIH Blood Bank; these anonymous donors will serve as controls.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Radiographic evidence of a primary glial neoplasm of the CNS (WHO grade II-IV) or any
             patient with a known primary neoplasm of the CNS.

          2. Medically indicated (diagnostic and/or therapeutic) tumor resection.

          3. Informed consent from patient, age 18 or older to 75 years of age.

          4. No racial or ethnic group or gender is excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Inability to provide informed consent prior to surgery.

          2. Medical conditions that cannot be corrected prior to surgery that would be standard
             contraindications for neurosurgery.

          3. Pregnant Women: Women of child-bearing age will be tested before surgery for
             pregnancy.
