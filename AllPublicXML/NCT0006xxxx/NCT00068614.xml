      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of HER-2 protein vaccine in treating women
      who have breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of HER-2 protein AutoVac™ in women with breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the ability of this drug to bypass the tolerance to the HER-2 self-protein by
           raising HER-2 antibodies in these patients.

        -  Determine the kinetics of the immune response to HER-2/neu in patients treated with this
           drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive HER-2 protein AutoVac™ intramuscularly at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 10 in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for up to 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 months.
