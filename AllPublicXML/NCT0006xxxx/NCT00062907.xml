  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine the safety and immunogenicity of a therapeutic
      vaccine regimen with recombinant DNA and adenovirus expressing L523S protein in patients with
      early stage non-small cell lung cancer. The vaccine regimen will consist of two fixed doses
      of recombinant DNA (pVAX/L523S) followed by two doses of recombinant adenovirus (Ad/L523S).
      The trial will evaluate the dose escalation of Ad/L523S through three cohorts of patients.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of the vaccine regimen
      administered as two doses of pVAX/L523S and two doses of Ad/L523S.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To provide initial evidence as to whether CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses specific for
           L523S protein can be elicited by two doses of pVAX/L523S followed by two doses of
           Ad/L523S

        -  To provide initial evidence as to whether antibody responses specific for L523S protein
           can be elicited by two doses of pVAX/L523S followed by two doses of Ad/L523S

        -  To investigate the extent to which dose escalation of Ad/L523S affects the elicited
           immune response
