  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of intermittent oral Xeloda, or iv
      fluorouracil/leucovorin, in combination with intravenous Eloxatin (oxaliplatin) in patients
      previously treated for metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients will be randomized to receive
      either 1)XELOX (Xeloda 1000mg/m2 po bid on days 1-15 + oxaliplatin) in 3 week cycles or 2)
      FOLFOX-4 (oxaliplatin + leucovorin + 5-FU in 2 week cycles. The anticipated time on study
      treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is 500+ individuals.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the day of documented disease progression or death from any cause. It was based on tumor assessments made according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, wherein progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions (TLs), taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Participants with neither disease progression nor death were censored at the last date of the last tumor assessment confirming that they had not progressed. Participants with no tumor assessments after baseline but who were still alive at the time of the clinical cut-off were censored at date of randomization</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Response, Investigators' Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response is best response recorded from start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence where responses include complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD). CR was defined as disappearance of all TLs, non-TLs along with normalization of tumor marker level. PR is at least 30% decrease in sum of the LD of TLs, taking as reference baseline sum LD. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking reference of smallest sum LD since treatment started. It was dependent on achievement of measurement and confirmation criteria. BOR .i.e. CR or PR was confirmed by repeat assessments performed within 4 weeks. For SD, follow-up assessments had to meet the SD criteria at least once after study entry within 6 to 8 weeks.</description>

        <title>Progression Free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the day of documented disease progression or death from any cause. It was based on tumor assessments made according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, wherein progressive disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of the target lesions (TLs), taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Participants with neither disease progression nor death were censored at the last date of the last tumor assessment confirming that they had not progressed. Participants with no tumor assessments after baseline but who were still alive at the time of the clinical cut-off were censored at date of randomization</description>

Participants with neither disease progression nor death were censored at the last date of the last tumor assessment confirming that they had not progressed. Participants with no tumor assessments after baseline but who were still alive at the time of the clinical cut-off were censored at date of randomization. PFS was analyzed using an on-treatment approach included only disease progression and death that occurred no later than 28 days after the last confirmed intake of study medication in the primary study treatment phase.</description>

          <title>XELOX</title>
          <description>Participants received XELOX (oxaliplatin and capecitabine). Oxaliplatin was administered 130 mg/m^2 intravenous (IV) infusion over 2 hours (every 3 weeks [Day 1]) before the first dose of capecitabine. Capecitabine was administered orally within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner) at a dose of 1000 mg/m^2 twice-daily (equivalent to a total daily dose of 2000 mg/m^2), with first dose the evening of Day 1 and last dose the morning of Day 15, given as intermittent treatment (3-week cycles consisting of 2 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week without treatment) for up to 8 cycles (24-weeks).</description>

          <title>FOLFOX-4</title>
          <description>Participants received FOLFOX-4 (combination of oxaliplatin, leucovorin [LV] and 5-fluorouracil [5-FU] combination). Oxaliplatin was administered as an 85 mg/m^2 IV infusion over 2 hours (on Day 1 only); with LV infusion as 200mg/m^2 over 2 hours followed by 5-FU, given as 400mg/m^2 bolus injection over 2-4 minutes, and then as a 600 mg/m^2 continuous infusion over 22 hours. On Day 2, Leucovorin 200 mg/m^2 (alone), followed by 5-FU 400 mg/m^2 bolus injection over 2-4 minutes, and 5-FU 600 mg/m^2 continuous infusion was repeated over 22 hours. It was (2-week cycles comprising 48 hours of infusion and 12 days of rest) for up to 12 cycles (24- weeks).</description>
