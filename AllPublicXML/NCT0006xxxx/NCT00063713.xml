  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with VELCADE will increase the
      time it takes for lymphoma to get worse.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VELCADE is approved in multiple myeloma for patients who have received two prior therapies
      and their disease came back or got worse while on their second therapy. VELCADE is currently
