      To compare, as a preliminary analysis, the effects of subcutaneously administered MEDI-522
      versus placebo at 6 months on disease activity and progression of structural joint damage in
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who have active disease despite ongoing treatment
      with methotrexate (MTX) with or without hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and/or sulfasalazine (SSZ).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to 18 (reached 18th birthday or later) at the time of the
             first dose of study drug

          2. Written informed consent obtained from the patient

          3. Sexually active females, unless surgically sterile or at least one year
             post-menopausal, must use an effective method of avoiding pregnancy (including oral,
             transdermal, injectable, or implanted contraceptives, IUD, female condom, diaphragm
             with spermicide, cervical cap, abstinence, use of a condom by the sexual partner or
             sterile sexual partner) for 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug, and must
             agree to continue using such precautions through 3 months after their last dose of
             study drug. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a
             responsible physician.

          4. A diagnosis of RA as defined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, which
             is currently active, as defined by the presence of at least 6 swollen and 6 tender
             joints involving the hands, wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, or feet and a CRP and/or
             ESR&gt;Upper Limits of Normal (ULN).

          5. Treatment with a stable dose level and frequency of methotrexate for at least 8 weeks
             prior to study randomization. The patients may also be taking hydroxychloroquine
             and/or sulfasalazine concurrently with methotrexate. These drugs must also be at
             stable dose levels and frequencies for at least 8 weeks prior to randomization.
             Patients currently receiving treatment with stable doses of nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including COX-2 inhibitors, or prednisone (less than
             or equal to 10 mg/day) will be permitted to continue these medications. Analgesics,
             including acetaminophen, talwin, propoxyphene, tramadol hydrochloride, codeine or
             codeine with acetaminophen, hydrocodone, oxycontin, and related medications, will also
             be permitted. All of these drugs must be at stable dose levels and frequencies for at
             least 4 weeks prior to study randomization.

          6. Prior to randomization (must be within 21 days of the first administration of the
             study drug), all of the following: WBC ≥ 3,800/mm³; platelet count ≥140,000/mm³; AST,
             ALT, BUN, or creatinine&lt;1.5 x ULN; stool negative for occult blood; and thyroxine (T4)
             within normal limits. (Patients with an elevated T4 but with both free T4 and TSH
             levels within normal limits may be eligible after review by the MedImmune medical
             monitor.)

          7. Willing to forego other forms of experimental treatment during study through Study Day
             364

          8. Able and willing to complete assessment questionnaires.

          9. Willing to participate in study through Study Day 413.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients must have none of the following:

          1. Severe active RA, which in the opinion of the investigator currently requires an
             alternative form of therapy

          2. Acute illness at the start of the study

          3. Evidence of significant active infection, such as fever greater than or equal to
             38.0°C (100.5°F)

          4. Known or suspected infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other evidence
             of clinically significant immune deficiencies

          5. Evidence of active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, such
             as positive HBsAg or positive anti-hepatitis C antibody

          6. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that is recent-onset or unstable

          7. Evidence of active or latent tuberculosis, which may include a positive PPD skin test
             result (greater than or equal to 10 mm induration), unless appropriate INH prophylaxis
             for tuberculosis previously given; a chest X-ray possibly consistent with
             tuberculosis; or household contact with a patient with active tuberculosis

          8. A medical history or evidence of clinically important chronic infection, recurrent (3
             or more) infections in the past 6 months requiring antibiotics, or an infection in the
             past month requiring systemic antibiotics

          9. Receipt of any investigational drug therapy, except MEDI-522, within 3 months prior to
             study randomization (use of licensed agents for indications not listed in the package
             insert is permitted)

         10. Current or any past therapy with anti-TNF biologic antagonists including etanercept,

             randomization. Intraarticular, periarticular, or other forms of parenteral injection
             of corticosteroids are also not permitted in the 8 weeks prior to study randomization.

         13. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             MEDI-522

         14. History of gastrointestinal bleeding (i.e., stool positive for occult blood or overt
             bleeding) within the previous 6 months

         15. Known bleeding disorder or significant risk of clinically important abnormal bleeding
             due to anticoagulant therapy with warfarin or heparin

         16. Elective surgery planned during the study period through Study Day 413

         17. Cardiovascular disease that is unstable, such as recent-onset angina, or angina with
             increasing frequency or severity, or recent myocardial infarction (within past 1 year
             without definitive corrective surgery such as coronary bypass graft or angioplasty)

             or clinically severe

         20. Pregnancy (all females, unless surgically sterile or at least one year
             post-menopausal, must have a negative urine pregnancy test on Study Day 0, prior to
