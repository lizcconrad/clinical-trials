    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety of a 90Y-radiolabeled, humanized
      (CDR-grafted) form of the LL2 monoclonal antibody in patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL) at different dose levels.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma, and has failed at least one
             regimen of standard chemotherapy. (All histological grades of NHL will be eligible for
             this trial.)

          -  Measureable via CT, with at least one lesion &gt; or = 1.5cm in one or both dimensions.
             (Splenic tumors in absence of other tumors will not qualify.)

          -  Radiological studies (ie - CT) must be performed within 4 weeks prior to study start.

          -  Acceptable tumor burden that will allow adequate follow-up and evaluation.

          -  Less that 25% bone marrow involvement, determined by bone marrow biopsy.

          -  Must observe the following washout periods:

        At least 4 weeks beyond any major surgery. At least 4 weeks beyond any radiation therapy to
        the index lesion, and has recovered from radiation-induced toxicity.

        At least 4 weeks beyond chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. At least 2 weeks beyond
        corticosteriod(s) use and blood counts are with laboratory criteria.

          -  Must have Karnofsky score &gt;70% (or equivalent, ECOG 0-2) with expected survival of at
             least 6 months.

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; or = 1.5mg/dl or creatinine clearance &gt; or = 50ml/min.

          -  Serum bilirubin &lt; or = 2mg/dl.

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; or = 10 g/dl; WBC &gt; or = 3000/mm3; granulocyte count &gt; or = 150/mm3;
             platelet count &gt; or = 100,000/mm3 with out transfusions or cytokines for at least 30
             days prior to study.

          -  Immunomedics ELISA assay of HahLL2 &lt; 100ng/ml for those with prior history of
             monoclonal antibody infusions.

          -  Cognizant informed consent.
