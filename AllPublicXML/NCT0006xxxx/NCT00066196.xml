      The primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To explore the antitumor activity of MEDI-522 ± DTIC in patients with metastatic
           melanoma.

        -  To determine the safety of MEDI-522 ± DTIC in this patient population.

             with at least one measurable lesion defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ³
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as ³ 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT)
             scan;

          -  Adult men and women of at least 18 years of age at the time of randomization;

          -  Women of reproductive potential (defined as being &lt;1 year post-menopausal) must have a

             practice an effective method of avoiding pregnancy (including oral or implanted
             contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), condom, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical
             cap, abstinence, or sterile sexual partner) at the time the informed consent is
             signed, and must agree to continue using such precautions while receiving MEDI-522 and

          -  Received an investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to randomization;
