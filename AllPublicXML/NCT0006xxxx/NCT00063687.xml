    <textblock>
      The OPT-CHF (OxyPurinol Therapy for CHF) study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and
      safety of oral oxypurinol vs. placebo in a randomized, double-blind, twenty-four week trial
      in 400 patients in up to 50 centers. Measures of clinical efficacy (NYHA class and Patient
      Global Assessment) as well as clinical outcomes (e.g., death, worsening heart failure, and
      hospitalization) will be assessed as a composite endpoint in this trial.
