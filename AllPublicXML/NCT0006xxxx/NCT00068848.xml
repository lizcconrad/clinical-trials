  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who choose to take birth control pills are currently instructed to begin taking the
      pills at the end of a menstrual cycle. This creates a window of time between when the woman
      is given the pills and when she begins taking them. Some women fail to begin taking the
      pills, placing them at increased risk of pregnancy. This study will evaluate a new approach
      to beginning birth control pills. Women will take the first pill in the doctorâ€™s office
      rather than waiting until the next menstrual cycle.

      Despite the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, pregnancy rates are high among women who
      choose this method of birth control. These pregnancies occur due to incorrect use, premature
      discontinuation, and failure to begin taking oral contraceptives after they have been
      prescribed. As many as 25% of adolescents who seek oral contraceptives from family planning
      clinics never take the first pill. Failure to begin oral contraceptives may occur due to
      ambivalence, confusion about starting instructions, or intervening pregnancy. Conventional
      starting instructions for oral contraceptives require waiting until the next menstrual
      period; this may leave the woman at high risk of pregnancy. This trial will evaluate a &quot;quick
      start&quot; approach in which the woman swallows the first pill during the clinic visit under
      direct observation and then continues daily pill use without waiting for her next menses. The
      trial will determine whether immediate oral contraceptive initiation offers benefits compared
      to conventional starting approaches.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive either the quick start or the
      standard starting approach. Participants will complete a questionnaire at study entry and
      Months 3 and 6. The main outcomes are 6-month oral contraceptive continuation rates and
      pregnancy rates.
