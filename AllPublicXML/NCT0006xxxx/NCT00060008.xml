      RATIONALE: New imaging procedures such as fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography
      (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging may improve the ability to detect
      disease progression, help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment, and help plan
      the most effective treatment.

      PURPOSE: This diagnostic trial is studying how well FDG-PET and MR perfusion imaging work in
      finding disease progression and determining response to treatment in patients with
      neurofibromatosis 1 and plexiform neurofibroma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and MR
           perfusion studies can predict plexiform neurofibroma growth rates in patients with
           neurofibromatosis 1.

        -  Determine whether FDG-PET and MR perfusion studies can predict the likelihood of
           response in patients who are undergoing investigational treatment for plexiform
           neurofibromas.

        -  Identify neuroimaging characteristics that distinguish patients who have responded to
           therapy from those who have not after completion of treatment.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Stratum 1: Patients undergo MR perfusion scan with gadopentetate dimeglumine and
           fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) at baseline and quantitative
           MRI evaluation at baseline and 1 year.

        -  Stratum 2: Patients undergo quantitative MRI, MR perfusion scan with gadopentetate
           dimeglumine, and FDG-PET at baseline and 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients (32 for stratum 1 and 16 for stratum 2) will be
      accrued for this study.

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The sample size was modest. It is possible that with increased sample size, if the correlation estimate holds, it will become statistically significant.</limitations_and_caveats>
