      RATIONALE: Antidepressants such as sertraline and the herb hypericum perforatum (St. John's
      wort) may be effective in treating mild to moderate depression. It is not yet known which
      treatment is more effective in improving depression in patients who have cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying how well sertraline works compared to
      St. John's wort in treating mild to moderate depression in patients with solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the change in depression severity in cancer patients with mild to moderate
           depression treated with sertraline vs Hypericum perforatum.

        -  Compare the severity of somnolence, nausea, and insomnia in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the impact of these regimens on fatigue in these patients.

        -  Correlate hyperforin concentrations with change in depression severity in patients
           treated with Hypericum perforatum.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified according to level
      of depression (mild vs moderate), concurrent radiotherapy (yes vs no), and TNM stage (I, II,
      or III vs IV). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral sertraline daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral Hypericum perforatum daily. In both arms, treatment
           continues for 4 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Measurements of depression, somnolence, nausea, insomnia, fatigue, and hyperforin
      concentration are assessed at baseline, and at 1, 2, and 4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 250 patients will be accrued for this study.

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Mild or moderate depression as determined by the following criteria (see Section 7.1
             and 8.0)

          -  Mild : HRSD score 10-14; moderate: HRSD score 15-19 (Appendix IV)

          -  At least 2 of nine symptoms of depression on the PHQ (Appendix V)

          -  At least one of the nine PHQ symptoms must be either depressed/irritable mood or
             anhedonia

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented solid tumor, lymphoma, or primary or
             metastatic brain tumor &gt; 6 months from radiation with stable disease or no evidence of
             disease.

          -  Concurrent cancer chemotherapy with sertraline or St. John's wort is not allowed,
             therefore patients must have no plan for chemotherapy for 4 months

          -  Prior chemotherapy is allowed, but patients must be &gt;4 weeks from prior chemotherapy
             except &gt;6 weeks from prior mitomycin-C or nitrosourea

             this study while under treatment.

          -  Prior or concurrent radiation is allowed except brain irradiation for brain metastases
             or primary brain tumor. Must be &gt; 6 months from radiation with stable disease or no
             evidence of disease.

             research PI or designee including clinic physician, resident, research nurse or
             research assistant will review medical information to determine or verify protocol
             eligibility either at the time the patient is being seen in the clinic for a routine
             visit/consult or prior to the patient's clinic visit.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  A patient will be excluded if he/she is (a) judged to be severely depressed using the
             following criteria: HRSD score 20 or more or a positive score on PHQ item i (suicidal
             ideation) or (b) judged not to be depressed by a score of 9 or less on the HRSD or
             fewer than two PHQ items scored positively. A patient who is found to be severely
             depressed or suicidal, either on initial screening or during the trial will be
