  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is important for good health. Women, particularly women with low
      incomes, have many personal barriers to regular physical activity. The purpose of this study
      is to reduce environmental barriers to physical activity for women in two specific low-income
      neighborhoods (in Louisville, KY) by providing opportunities for safe physical activity and
      addressing barriers such as lack of child care. Two groups of women will have pretest
      information (cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, percent body fat, height, weight,
      waist and hip measurements) collected and the same information 6 months later at post-test.
      One group will have access to multiple physical activity opportunities in their neighborhood
      and at the neighborhood community center. An advanced registered nurse practitioner will
      facilitate the activity opportunities. The groups will be compared on their pretest and
      post-test information to see if the group with the physical activity opportunities has
      increased physical activity as measured by pedometer and self-report questionnaire, and to
      see if there are changes in the measures tested at pre and post (measures that may be
      improved by regular physical activity).
