      BACKGROUND:

      Coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) are the leading causes of death
      in the Western world. Numerous epidemiological studies have demonstrated the impact of
      various risk factors, such as arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes
      mellitus. While these risk factors are partly under genetic control, a positive family
      history remains an additional independent predictor of CAD, suggesting the presence of as yet
      unidentified susceptibility loci. Given the enormous public health burden of CAD, there is
      significant interest in identifying its specific genetic foundations. As intensive
      experimental investigations continue, the inflammatory component of the disease process
      leading to atherosclerosis evolves as a key aspect in the disease process. Recent evidence
      demonstrates that systemic markers of inflammation such as C reactive protein (CRP) can
      predict those at high risk of coronary events. CRP emerges with much attention as both a
      diagnostic marker and therapeutic target with serum levels determined to a significant extent
      by genetic factors.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      To elucidate the genetic basis of the inflammatory component of myocardial infarction and the
      regulation of C reactive protein, a gene function oriented evaluation of candidate genes will
      be conducted. Therefore the specific aims are as follows, 1. Identify positional candidate
      genes within regions identified for MI and CRP which are functionally related to inflammation
      and inflammatory processes. Sequence variation in selected candidate genes will be
      identified. 2. Evaluate the effect of these variants with regard to MI and CRP in two
      different ethnic populations: a family set of European Caucasians and a population-based,
      Hispanic family dataset. The role of CRP will be evaluated as a predictor of cardiovascular
      events in the study populations. Since clinical follow up data are available on both study
      populations, the extent to which CRP contributes to an increased risk for cardiovascular
      events will be analyzed.

    <description>In conjunction with collaborators in Germany, we have established one of the largest collections of families with MI, comprising 1,406 individuals in 513 Western-European families. Based on this collection, our total genome scan and linkage analysis has identified a region on chromosome 14 with a significant linkage signal for myocardial infarction (LOD = 3.9, pointwise P = 0.00015, genome-wide P &lt; 0.05)5. Preliminary results from an association study in a subset of these families has identified a small set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within candidate genes in this region as being suggestively associated with MI.

      i.) Blood: A blood sample (30 cc, ~2 tablespoons) will be drawn. This will take place in the
      catheterization lab at the end of the catheterization procedure or by using standard
      venipuncture technique during a clinic visit or at community outreach events when feasible.

      ii.) Buccal Swab: The participant uses specially prepared cotton swabs (called buccal swabs)
      to rub in a circular motion on the inside of both cheeks. The swabs collect cheek cells that
      can be processed to obtain DNA.

      iii.) Saliva: A saliva sample is obtained by having the participant spit in a special vial
      specifically designed for genetic testing. The participant will continue to spit into the
      vial until it contains 2 ml (about 1 teaspoon) of saliva.
