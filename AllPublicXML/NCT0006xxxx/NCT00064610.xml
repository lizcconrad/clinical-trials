    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe PS-341(VELCADE) is when given with
      Docetaxel (Taxotere) to patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer, and also to see
      what effects (good and bad) it has on you and on your cancer.

      This is a dose escalation study, which means that the first group of patients will receive a
      low dose of PS-341 (VELCADE) and Docetaxel (Taxotere). If the low dose of VELCADE and
      Taxotere appears to be safe, then the next group of patients will receive a higher dose of
      VELCADE and Taxotere.

        Inclusion criteria

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          -  Patient has histologically-confirmed advanced and/or metastatic androgen-independent
             prostate cancer requiring anti-neoplastic treatment.

          -  Previous or concurrent hormone therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
             analog (e.g., leuprolide) does not preclude enrollment in the study.

          -  Patient has progressive measurable or evaluable disease, defined as meeting at least
             one of the following three criteria [1]:

               1. Progressive measurable disease (changes in the size of lymph nodes or parenchymal
                  masses on physical examination or x-ray).

               2. Progressive bone metastasis [presence of new lesion(s) on a bone scan].

               3. Progressive PSA, as evidenced by two separate measurements taken at least one
                  week apart and confirmed by a third, and if necessary, a fourth measurement.

                    -  If the third measurement is not greater than the second measurement, then a
                       fourth measurement must be taken; the fourth measurement must be greater
                       than the second measurement for the patient to be eligible for enrollment in
                       the study.

                    -  The confirmatory PSA measurement (i.e., the third or, if applicable, fourth
                       PSA measurement) must be greater than or equal to 5 ng/mL.

          -  Patient is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status of 60% or greater.

          -  Patient has a life expectancy of three months or longer.

          -  Patient has all of the following pretreatment laboratory data within 14 days before
             the first study drug dose:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3.

          -  Platelets greater than or equal to100,000/mm3.

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;8.0 g/dL.

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.5 mg/dL.

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care.

          -  Patient agrees to use an acceptable barrier method for contraception from Screening
             through 90 days after the last study drug dose. [It is recommended that female
             partners of male patients enrolled in this study also use an acceptable method of
             birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine device, diaphragm with
             spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence).]

        Exclusion criteria Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be
        enrolled in the study.

          -  Patient has received chemotherapy within four weeks, nitrosoureas within six weeks, or
             antibody therapy within eight weeks of enrollment.

          -  Patient has received radiation therapy within four weeks of enrollment.

          -  Patient has not recovered from all toxic effects of previous chemotherapy or radiation
             or antibody therapy.

          -  Patient received treatment with flutamide within four weeks of enrollment or
             nilutamide or bicalutamide within six weeks of enrollment.

          -  Patient has had any major surgery within four weeks of enrollment.

          -  Patient has a history of allergic reactions to diuretics or anti-emetics suggested to
             be administered in conjunction with study drug

          -  Patient has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other agents
             formulated with polysorbate 80.

          -  Patient had a myocardial infarction within six months of enrollment or has
             uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or electrocardiographic evidence
             of acute ischemia

          -  Patient has uncontrolled brain metastases or central nervous system disease.

          -  Patient has Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy

          -  Patient has any of the following pretreatment laboratory data within 14 days before
             the first study drug dose:

               -  Total bilirubin &gt; than the upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or aspartate transaminase (AST) &gt;1.5 x the ULN
                  concurrent with alkaline phosphatase &gt;2.5 x the ULN.

               -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt;5 x the ULN, unless shown by fractionation to be
                  bone-derived and AST, ALT, bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and
                  5'nucleotidase are &lt;1.5 x the ULN and bilirubin is within normal range.

               -  Serum testosterone 50 ng/mL or higher.

          -  Patient is HIV-infected.

          -  Patient is hepatitis B surface antigen positive or has previously documented hepatitis
             C infection.

          -  Patient has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness (e.g., active infection).

          -  Patient has another serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the
             investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of treatment
