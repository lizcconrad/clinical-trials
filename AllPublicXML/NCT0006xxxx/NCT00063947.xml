  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib when given
      together with gemcitabine and radiation therapy in treating patients with locally advanced
      unresectable pancreatic cancer. Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for their growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining erlotinib with gemcitabine
      may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy and may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib given concurrently with gemcitabine and
      radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine, preliminarily,
      the antitumor efficacy of this regimen, in terms of response rate, in these patients.

      III. Determine the time to tumor progression and overall survival of patients treated with
      this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study of erlotinib.

      Chemoradiotherapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Beginning on
      day 1 and continuing concurrently with radiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes twice weekly and oral erlotinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 10
      patients receive treatment at that dose.

      Patients are radiologically restaged 3-4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Patients
      with stable or responsive disease proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients whose imaging
      studies suggest a potential for curative resection are referred for a surgical evaluation
      before initiating maintenance therapy.

      Maintenance therapy: Beginning 4-7 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients
      receive maintenance chemotherapy comprising gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8
      and oral erlotinib once daily. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 4 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-28 patients will be accrued for this study.
