  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rhuMAb VEGF (Bevacizumab) is safe and
      effective for the treatment of renal cell cancer when other treatments have failed.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Histologically confirmed, metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) of clear cell histology

          -  Clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression (as assessed by the
             investigator and reviewed by the Sponsor) during or after completion of one, and only
             one, cytokine-based regimen for metastatic disease

          -  At least 21 days since any prior therapy for RCC

          -  Prior nephrectomy

          -  Use of an acceptable means of contraception (potentially fertile men and women)

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 3 months

          -  Age 18 years or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  RCC of papillary or collecting-duct type

          -  More than one nonsurgical therapy for metastatic RCC (note that medroxyprogesterone
             acetate not used for physiologic replacement or birth control is considered a therapy
             for RCC for the purposes of this study)

          -  Prior treatment with thalidomide

          -  Radiotherapy within 14 days of Day 0

          -  Current, recent (within 21 days of Day 0), or planned participation in an experimental
             drug study

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding subjects

          -  Any of the following screening clinical laboratory values: 24-hour urine collection
             with &gt;= 1 g of protein; Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL; Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
             &lt;500/mL; Platelet count &lt;75,000/mL; INR &gt;= 1.5; Total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL; AST or
             ALT &gt; 5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) for subjects with documented liver
             metastases or &gt; 2.5 x the ULN for subjects without evidence of liver metastases;
             Hemoglobin &lt; 9 gm/dL (may be transfused or receive epoetin alfa [e.g., Epogen] to
             maintain or exceed this level)

          -  Other invasive malignancies within 5 years of randomization (other than squamous or
             basal cell carcinoma of the skin)

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from
             treatment complications

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures
