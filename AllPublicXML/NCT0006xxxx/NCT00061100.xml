      The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate, in methadone-maintained patients the association
      between an ADHD diagnosis and high-risk HIV/Hepatitis behavior. In addition, the
      investigators would like to determine whether a new manually-guided HIV intervention; RISE:
      Reduce high risk Intravenous drug use and unsafe Sexual Encounters is superior to standard
      HIV/Hepatitis psycho-education.
