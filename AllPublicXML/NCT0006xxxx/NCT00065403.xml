  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about acupuncture's efficacy for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). This trial
      uses a manualized acupuncture treatment format that closely follows clinical practice and
      allows flexibility in designing individualized treatments. In addition, a second parallel
      qualitative study will follow a subgroup of patients throughout the trial to explore the
      relationships between patients' interpretations and understandings (what anthropologists call
      &quot;meaning&quot;) of irritable bowel and their response to treatment. Cortisol levels (an important
      stress hormone) will also be assessed.

      This will be a 3-arm trial: Active acupuncture, placebo acupuncture, and wait list.
