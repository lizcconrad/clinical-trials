      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pixantrone, cytarabine, methylprednisolone,
      and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing
      or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of pixantrone, cytarabine, methylprednisolone, and
           cisplatin in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in first relapse.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the validity and safety of this regimen as a mobilization regimen before
           high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell support in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Salvage therapy: Patients receive pixantrone IV over 1 hour on day 1; cisplatin IV over
           30 minutes on days 1-4; methylprednisolone IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-5; and
           cytarabine IV over 2 hours on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After 2 courses of salvage therapy, patients are re-evaluated and treated as follows:

        -  Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR): Patients with a CR or PR who are
           suitable candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) proceed to
           mobilization therapy, high-dose chemotherapy, and ASCT. Patients with a CR or PR who are
           unsuitable candidates for ASCT continue to receive salvage therapy for up to 6 courses
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Stable disease: Patients with stable disease continue to receive salvage therapy for up
           to 6 courses. Patients who have a CR or PR after 3-4 courses of salvage therapy and who
           are suitable candidates for ASCT proceed to mobilization therapy, high-dose
           chemotherapy, and ASCT off study at the investigator's discretion.

             -  Mobilization therapy (optional regimen; regimen used for mobilization is at the
                investigator's discretion): Patients receive rituximab* IV on days 1 and 7;
                pixantrone IV over 1 hour on day 2; cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 2-5;
                cytarabine IV over 2 hours on day 6; and methylprednisolone IV over 15-30 minutes
                on days 2-6. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily
                beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients receive 1 or
                more courses of mobilization therapy during which stem cells are harvested.
                Patients then proceed to high-dose chemotherapy and subsequent re-infusion of
                harvested stem cells.

      NOTE: *If this mobilization regimen is used, patients with T-cell lymphoma do not receive
      rituximab

        -  High-dose chemotherapy and ASCT: Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT per
           institutional standard practice.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study.
