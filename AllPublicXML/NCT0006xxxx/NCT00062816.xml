  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this Phase 1/2 study are to examine the safety, tolerability, and antiviral
      activity of ISIS 14803, when given in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin, to
      patients who either failed to have at least a 100-fold HCV reduction at Week 12 of standard
      therapy or still have detectable HCV at Week 24.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously untreated chronic hepatitis C patients undergoing therapy with peginterferon alfa
      and ribavirin have a very poor probability of achieving a sustained virologic response if
      they either do not have a 100-fold or greater reduction in their plasma HCV RNA levels at the
      12th week of treatment or have detectable plasma HCV RNA at the 24th week of treatment. ISIS
      14803 is an experimental antiviral medication for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C that
      has been given to chronic hepatitis C patients in two previous single-agent clinical trials
      (approximately 70 patients).

      In this clinical research study, 12 weeks of ISIS 14803 treatment will be added to the
      peginterferon alfa and ribavirin treatment regimen of previously untreated chronic hepatitis
      C patients who have a very poor probability of achieving a sustained virologic response based
      upon either of the above two criteria. Enrolled patients must continue to be treated with
      peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and must begin ISIS 14803 treatment within four weeks of
      their HCV RNA result report date. ISIS 14803 will be given as a two-hour intravenous
      infusion, two times each week, for 12 weeks. Depending on their HCV response to the
      three-drug combination, patients may continue treatment with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin
      after the end of ISIS 14803 treatment. Patients will be monitored for at least eight weeks
      (for safety) after the end of ISIS 14803 treatment and possibly for longer (for sustained
      virologic response). Two dose levels of ISIS 14803 will be studied in this trial, 3 and 6
      mg/kg ideal body weight.
