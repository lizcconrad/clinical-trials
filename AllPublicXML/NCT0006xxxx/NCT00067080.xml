  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the new orally active iron chelator, ICL670, is
      as safe as deferoxamine in preventing accumulation of iron in the body while a patient is
      undergoing repeated blood transfusions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who require repeated blood transfusions accumulate iron in the body as blood cells
      contain iron and there is no natural body mechanism to eliminate it. After a while the iron
      levels get high enough to be toxic to the body. The current therapy of choice is deferoxamine
      which does a good job of removing excess iron, but is difficult to administer. Deferoxamine
      requires subcutaneous (under the skin) infusions over 4 to 8 hours nightly 3 to 7 nights per
      week. In addition to the need to wear an infusion pump nightly, adverse reactions around the
      site of the injection are frequent.
