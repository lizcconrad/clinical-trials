  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alendronate is a drug that is used to treat osteoporosis. The purpose of this study is to
      examine whether alendronate in combination with calcium and vitamin D is safe and effective
      for treating bone loss in people with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) has been identified in up to 50% of HIV infected men,
      with severe osteoporosis in up to 21% of these men. The mechanisms underlying these bone
      abnormalities remain unclear. Bisphosphonates are potent bone resorption inhibitors and have
      been shown to be effective in treating osteoporosis. While several bisphosphonates are
      approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in women, alendronate is the only bisphosphonate
      approved for treatment in men. This study hypothesizes that alendronate will be able to
      reverse decreased BMD secondary to inhibition of bone resorption in HIV infected patients
      treated with potent antiretroviral therapy, and that these patients will be able to tolerate
      alendronate without any significant toxicities. The study will also examine the efficacy of
      once-weekly alendronate with daily calcium and vitamin D in both men and women with HIV.

      Patients will participate in this study for 48 weeks. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive either alendronate or placebo. All patients will receive calcium and vitamin D. Dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans will be used to evaluate bone density at each visit.
      After study entry, patients will have visits at Weeks 2, 12, 24, 36, and 48. During these
      visits, blood will be drawn and a pregnancy test may be performed. Patients must fast for at
      least 8 hours prior to the entry visit and for the visits at Weeks 2, 12, 24, and 48.
