    <time_frame>Baseline to the end of the study (up to 1 year)</time_frame>
    <description>A best overall response could occur at any time during the study and was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TL) or the disappearance of all non-TLs and normalization of tumor marker level. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the treatment started for TLs and the persistence of 1 or more non-TL(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs.</description>

          -  Measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at
             least one dimension (bilateral dimensions should be recorded). Each lesion must be &gt;=
             20 mm when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain X-ray, CT,
             and MRI, or &gt;= 10 mm when measured by spiral CT.

        <description>A best overall response could occur at any time during the study and was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TL) or the disappearance of all non-TLs and normalization of tumor marker level. A PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SLD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the treatment started for TLs and the persistence of 1 or more non-TL(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above normal limits. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs.</description>

          <description>Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
          <population>Efficacy-evaluable population: Participants who received at least 2 doses of pertuzumab and either underwent at least 1 post-baseline assessment of response or died as a result of disease progression before any evaluation of response.</population>
