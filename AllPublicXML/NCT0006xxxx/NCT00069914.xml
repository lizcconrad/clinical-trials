      This study will evaluate how HIV infection, including CD4 cell count and viral load, affects
      the patient's ability to produce antibodies in response to vaccination with the influenza
      (flu) vaccine. Earlier studies have shown that people with HIV infection do not respond as
      well as healthy subjects to flu vaccine; that is, they don't make as many antibodies in
      response to the vaccine. Before the use of current anti-HIV medications, antibodies made to
      flu vaccination in HIV-positive individuals was related to their CD4 cell count. This trial
      will examine how CD4 counts and the amount of virus in the blood affect how much and what
      kind of antibodies the body makes to the flu vaccine.

      HIV-infected patients and healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be
      eligible for this study. Healthy subjects will serve as controls to make sure the flu vaccine
      works (i.e., stimulates production of enough antibody to protect against the flu), and to
      compare the amount of antibodies made by HIV-positive and HIV-negative people. Candidates
      will be screened with a medical history and blood tests (see below). Women who are able to
      have children will have a pregnancy test. Pregnant women are excluded from the study.

      Participants will undergo the following procedures:

        1. Blood drawing for the following tests:

             -  Routine tests (complete blood count, kidney and liver functions, electrolyte
                levels).

             -  CD4 cell count.

             -  HLA typing (a genetic marker of the immune system) if it has not already been done
                at the NIH. This test may be used to try to identify factors associated with the
                rate of progression of HIV disease or related conditions. Determining HLA type is
                necessary to be able to perform certain research studies. Some HLA types have been
                associated with an increased risk of certain diseases like arthritis and other
                rheumatologic problems.

             -  Viral load (HIV-infected patients only).

             -  Influenza antibody levels.

             -  B cell levels.

        2. Flu vaccination

        3. Follow-up visits on days, 7, 28, and 54 after vaccination for the following:

             -  Review of any illnesses or fever.

             -  Review of medications, if any changes were made.

             -  Repeat blood tests.

      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate the effect of HIV viral load and CD4 counts on
      the generation of influenza-specific antibodies and influenza-specific B cell responses in
      HIV-infected adults. HIV-infected subjects will be enrolled to receive the influenza vaccine
      appropriate to the on-going USA influenza season (Oct-March). Laboratory studies (including
      influenza titers, influenza-specific B cell frequencies, CD4 counts, and HIV viral loads)
      will be obtained at baseline (day of vaccination), day 7, 28, and 54 post-vaccination.
      HIV-negative healthy volunteers will serve as controls. Although there are some risks to
      influenza vaccine, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunizations recommends influenza
      vaccination for HIV-infected patients. The primary study risks are those of phlebotomy and
      the inconvenience of multiple visits. Subjects will be compensated for participation in the
      study. Total enrollment of the study is a maximum of 165 subjects (132 HIV-infected
      individuals and 33 HIV-negative controls).

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        HIV Positive:

          1. Age greater than or equal 18 but less than or equal to 60 years old and willing and
             able to give informed consent

          2. Enrollment during the USA influenza season (October-March)

          3. Self-reported history of HIV infection at enrollment (If NIH HIV testing does not
             confirm that the subject is HIV-positive, the subject will be discontinued from the
             study and not included in the analysis.)

        HIV Negative:
