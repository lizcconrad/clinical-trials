    <textblock>
      Various forms of the plant extract Tripterygium wilfordi Hook F (TwHF) have been used in
      China as a remedy for inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of
      this study is to investigate how tolerable, safe, and effective TwHF is for patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis. Investigators will compare the therapeutic effects of TwHF with
      Sulfasalazine, an FDA-approved drug for arthritis.

      Participants in this 24-week study must have had active rheumatoid arthritis for at least six
      months. Approximately 120 patients will participate. Participants will be assigned to one of
      two drug-treatment groups, TwHF or Sulfasalazine. They will be given the study drug at each
      of six clinic visits and will be asked to take two capsules three times each day with meals
      and water. During the clinic visits, investigators will obtain multiple blood samples; give
      physical exams; assess swollen, tender, and painful joints; and administer x-rays.

      Study participants will be compensated up to $260 for their involvement in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, active treatment controlled phase II study in patients
      with either new onset or therapy resistant rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study will be
      conducted at 7 sites with NIAMS being the coordinating center and 6 external centers.
      Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF) is a traditional medicinal plant that is and has been
      used in China for many years to treat inflammatory conditions including RA. This study we
      will be testing if a standardized plant extract from the roots of TwHF is superior to
      Sulfasalazine in improving the signs and symptoms in subjects with RA, as assessed by the ACR
      20 criteria. Those subjects, who qualify for the study, will be allowed to continue on stable
      doses of NSAID therapy and/or low dose corticosteroids but will discontinue any DMARDs, or
      biologicals prior to the start of the study. Study subjects will then be randomized to
      receive either TwHF or Sulfasalazine and subjects will remain on double blind medication for
      24 weeks. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks and every 4 weeks thereafter using a
      standardized joint exam, questionnaires and laboratory measures for inflammation. ACR 20
      responses will be calculated at each visit and compared in both groups at the end of
      evaluation at 24 weeks. Safety will be monitored throughout the trial. This is the first
      study that compares the extract of TwHF to a currently used DMARD in treating patients with
      RA and will help to define the role of new anti-inflammatory and possibly disease modifying
      agents in treating patients with RA.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Male and female outpatients between 18 and 75 years of age

        Females must be of non-childbearing potential (post-menopausal, surgically sterilized or
        post hysterectomy) or using a double-barrier method of birth control for the duration of
        the study. A protocol acceptable method of double barrier method of birth control includes
        any combination of two or three of the following: condom, spermicidal and diaphragm.

        Documented diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis of at least six (6) months duration, as
        defined by the American Rheumatism Association 1987 Revised Criteria

        American Rheumatism Association Functional Class I, II, or III

        Meet the criteria for (active disease) at both screening and baseline visits by achieving
        all of the criteria below:

        6 or more painful/tender joints

        6 or more swollen joints

        Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain of at least 3 (on scale of 1-10, where 1 is mild)

        C-reactive protein (CRP) greater than or equal to 0.6 mg/dl or ESR greater than 25 mm/hr.

        Prior/Current Therapy:

        A. Subjects must be either DMARD or biological anti-RA agent naive or have failed a
        DMARD/biological RA agent, other than sulfasalazine, and have stopped this DMARD/biological
        one (1) month prior to randomization unless they have a flare in disease activity upon
        discontinuing DMARD/biological therapy as part of this protocol. DMARDs include but are not
        limited to methotrexate, leflunomide, minocycline, hydroxychloroquine, gold, cyclosporine,
        and biologics include anti-TNF and anti-IL-1 agents.

        B. Subjects may be taking NSAIDs, provided the dose and frequency have been stable for 30
        days prior to randomization. However if the patient meets the flare criteria they can be
        enrolled even if they have not fulfilled the criteria of being on a stable dose of NSAIDs
        and steroids for 30 days prior to randomization. At the time of flare neither steroids nor
        NSAIDs can be increased.

        C. Subjects may be taking corticosteroid therapy equivalent to prednisone less than or
        equal to 7.5 mg/day. This dose must be stable for at least 1 month prior to randomization.
        Subjects may not change the dose of their corticosteroid or receive intra-articular or
        intra-muscular injections of corticosteroids, within 1 month of randomization or during the
        study. Note section 9.3 of the protocol, Concomitant Medication, has been amended to read:
        If it is medically necessary a one joint steroid injection is acceptable. This must be
        noted on the CRF and the joint excluded from the joint count.

        D. Subjects may not be taking other complementary and/or alternative medications for RA for
        the last 1-month prior to randomization.

        Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to any study-related screening tests.
