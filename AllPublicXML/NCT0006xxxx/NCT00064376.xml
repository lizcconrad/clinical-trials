      RATIONALE: Paricalcitol is a form of vitamin D that may help myelodysplastic cells develop
      into normal bone marrow cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paricalcitol in treating patients who
      have myelodysplastic syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical effects of paricalcitol in patients with myelodysplastic
           syndromes.

        -  Determine whether this drug can improve RBC, WBC, or platelet counts in these patients.

        -  Determine whether this drug can decrease the risk of development of leukemia without
           causing undue toxicity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral paricalcitol daily for 4 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.
