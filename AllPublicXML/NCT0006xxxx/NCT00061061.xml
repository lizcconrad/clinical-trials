      Female subjects were screened and randomized. Following two weeks of medication monitoring,
      all participants continued smoking as usual for one week, at which time baseline measurements
      were taken. For the remaining two weeks (the experimental period), participants were
      randomized to a continued smoking or smoking abstinence condition. The abstinent group was
      provided with cessation counseling and monitored for abstinence. For all participants, data
      were collected during five clinic visits on all dependent measures: MNWS, QSU, Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI), Profile of Mood States, Motor Speed Tasks and Reaction Time
      Tests. Question of interest was whether hormone replacement therapy would improve these
      dependent measures as manifested during short-term smoking cessation.
