      The purpose of this study is to determine if treating periodontal infections (gum problems)
      will lead to fewer heart problems in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence of a strong association between infection and atherosclerosis as
      well as a specific link between periodontal infection (gum problems) and heart disease.
      Previous studies have established possible effective treatments of periodontal disease. These
      treatments may lead to fewer heart events in persons at high risk for cardiovascular disease.
      In contrast to previous heart disease studies, the primary treatment in this project is
      directed toward infectious agents at periodontal sites. This project is a pilot randomized
      clinical trial to test the feasibility of selecting and refining a periodontal infection
      treatment and examining the effect of that treatment on future heart events. It is a
      multi-center planning and pilot study involving five investigational centers at the
      University at Buffalo (lead and overall coordinating center), University of North Carolina,
      Boston University, Kaiser Permanente/Oregon Health Science University, University of
      Maryland, and a data coordinating center at the University of North Carolina. Central
      microbiology and cytokine laboratories and a biologic specimen bank are also included. A team
      of cardiologists, periodontists, epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists,
      biostatisticians, research nurses in periodontics and cardiology, and data managers has been
      assembled to accomplish the research with a careful, cost-effective approach. The ultimate
      goal is to develop a definitive randomized clinical trial that will include about 4,000
      participants from approximately 15 centers across the United States
