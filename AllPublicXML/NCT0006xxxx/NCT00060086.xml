      RATIONALE: Pomegranate juice may contain substances that decrease or slow the rise of
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and may be effective in delaying or preventing
      recurrent prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pomegranate juice works in decreasing or
      slowing the rise of PSA levels in patients who have undergone radiation therapy or surgery
      for prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether pomegranate juice can decrease or slow rising prostate-specific
           antigen (PSA) levels in patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy or
           radiotherapy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral pomegranate juice once daily. Treatment continues for 18
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
