      The purpose of this study is to attempt to identify the immune response of healthy adults to
      an investigational dilution of the Dryvax smallpox vaccine. In addition, we will try to
      determine whether certain genetic characteristics influence the size of the sore around the
      vaccination site, and use blood samples from subjects in the study to make a new form of
      antibody that could be given to people with vaccine side effects.

    <textblock>
      Smallpox is a very serious disease that is fatal in about 1 in 3 patients. Smallpox does not
      exist naturally in the world, and there have been no cases of smallpox in the world since
      1980. Smallpox can be prevented through the use of a very effective vaccine called vaccinia
      virus (Dryvax). After the world was considered free of smallpox, the production of smallpox
      vaccine was discontinued, but due to the recent concern that the smallpox virus may be used
      as a means of bioterrorism, the production of the smallpox vaccine may be restarted. Although
      Dryvax is known to be an effective vaccine for the prevention of smallpox, very little is
      known about the ability of the body to develop defenses to prevent disease (immune responses)
      with this vaccine. As new vaccines for preventing smallpox are developed, it will be
      important to compare the immune responses they cause to the responses that occur with the
      standard vaccine, Dryvax.
