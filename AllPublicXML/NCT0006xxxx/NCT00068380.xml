      Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      tumor cell growth. This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in
      treating patients with refractory metastatic and/or unresectable stomach or gastroesophageal
      junction cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate, time to tumor progression, and overall survival in
      patients with metastatic gastric cancer treated with STI571 who have failed one chemotherapy
      regimen for metastatic disease.

      II. To assess the toxicities of STI571 in these patients. III. To obtain preliminary data on
      molecular correlates to determine clinical efficacy and toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk (good risk
      [chemonaïve] vs poor risk [1 prior chemotherapy regimen]).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-1.5
      years.

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>In the first stage none of the 17 patients responded (CR/PR) to treatment. Due to budget constraints and recent reprioritizations, CTEP closed the study to accrual.</limitations_and_caveats>
