    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Estrogen can stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      anastrozole may fight breast cancer by reducing the production of estrogen. Gefitinib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Combining
      anastrozole with gefitinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of anastrozole with or
      without gefitinib in treating postmenopausal women who have metastatic or locally recurrent
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the 1 year antitumor activity of anastrozole with vs without gefitinib, in terms
           of progression-free survival, in postmenopausal women with metastatic or locally
           recurrent advanced breast cancer.

        -  Compare the objective tumor response and duration of tumor response in patients treated
           with these regimens.

        -  Compare the progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to participating center, dominant site of metastatic disease (bone
      alone vs other), prior chemotherapy (no vs yes), stage (metastatic vs locally recurrent), and
      measurability (measurable vs evaluable). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral anastrozole and oral gefitinib once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral anastrozole and an oral placebo once daily. In both arms,
           treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 108 patients (54 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
