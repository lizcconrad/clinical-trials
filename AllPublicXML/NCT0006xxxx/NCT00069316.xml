  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will assess whether Omr-IgG-am(Trademark), an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)
      containing antibodies specific for West Nile virus (WNV), is safe and well-tolerated in
      patients with suspected or laboratory diagnosed WNV disease. An initial estimation of
      efficacy will also be made.

      This Phase I/II study will enroll hospitalized adults with a presumptive diagnosis of West
      Nile encephalitis and/or myelitis or those with a positive laboratory test for diagnosis of
      WNV infection who are at high risk for progressing to severe neurologic disease based on age
      or immunosuppression. Patients will be randomized in blocks of five to receive either
      Omr-IgG-am(Trademark), Polygam(Registered Trademark) S/D (IVIG containing minimal anti-WNV
      antibodies) or normal saline in a ratio of 3:1:1. Patients and investigators will be blinded
      to treatment assignments.

      Patients will receive a single intravenous dose of study medication or one of two placebos.
      The study participants will receive 0.5 grams/kg of Omr-IgG-am(Trademark) or
      Polygam(Registered Trademark) S/D or a comparable volume of normal saline. All patients will
      be followed for safety, natural history endpoints, and efficacy. A subset of patients will
      have pharmacokinetic measurements of specific anti- WNV antibodies assessed following
      treatment.

      The primary endpoints are safety and tolerability following Omr-IgG-am(Trademark)
      administration.

      Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics of specific anti-WNV antibodies, mortality in
      confirmed WNV positive patients, and the combination of mortality and functional status at
      three months in both confirmed WNV-infected patients and all patients by intention to treat.
      This combined endpoint will be measured using four standardized measures of cognitive and
      functional status: the Barthel Index; the Modified Rankin Scale; the Glasgow Outcome Score;
      and the Modified Mini-Mental Status Examination. A comparison of outcomes will be made for
      the group receiving Omr-IgG-am(Trademark) versus those receiving either placebo, and between
      the two placebo groups. Other secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients in each
      group returning to pre-morbid baseline and each subject's improvement at 3 months as compared
      to that subject's worst (of any previous) evaluation.

      Natural history endpoints will also be assessed. They will include the duration of intensive
      care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, development and persistence of WNV-specific IgG and IgM
      antibodies, combined functional score and mortality at 3 months between the group with
      encephalitis and/or myelitis at baseline versus the group with a positive WNV test only,
      outcomes in patients treated late in coma and correlation of outcome with time-to-treatment
      following symptom onset.
