      Ideomotor apraxia, a disorder that affects patients with stroke and a variety of other brain
      lesions, features disturbed timing, sequence, and spatial organization of skilled movements.
      This study will look at how different areas of the human brain control fine hand movements.

      Thirty-five participants 21 years and older will be enrolled in this study-25 healthy,
      right-handed people, and 10 stroke patients. They will undergo two outpatient sessions, each
      lasting up to 3 hours. The first visit for the stroke patients will occur between 2 weeks and
      3 months after the stroke; the second visit will be at least 6 months after the stroke.

      Participants will have a physical exam, give a medical history, and complete a questionnaire.
      Then they will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. They will lie in the MRI
      scanner and will be asked to do a number of skilled hand movements using the right hand (such
      as pretending to use a hammer or waving goodbye) in response to directions that will appear
      on a screen mounted over their head. Their movements will be recorded on videotape during the
      procedures.

      OBJECTIVE: The present study focuses on evaluating neural activation patterns underlying
      praxis movements in normal controls and in patients with ideomotor apraxia using
      event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Ideomotor apraxia is a disorder
      affecting patients with stroke and a variety of other brain lesions. The disorder involves
      disturbed timing, sequence, and spatial organization of skilled movements, during the
      execution and probably also preparatory phases. As a consequence, patients suffer from
      incorrect temporal and spatial components to movements as evidenced during pantomime of
      transitive (object/tool related) and intransitive (independent of object/tool use) gestures.
      Thus far, damage to posterior parietal regions and parietofrontal circuits has been
      implicated in significantly contributing to this disorder. However, little is known about the
      mechanism of cortical reorganization following damage, notably during recovery process. We
      hypothesize that recruitment of parallel and contralateral motor pathways compensates for
      reduced communication within parietofrontal circuits which prevents accurate motor
      performance.

      STUDY POPULATION: We will study two groups of participants: one group of patients with
      ideomotor apraxia and one group of healthy subjects.

      DESIGN: We will measure fMRI activation on transitive and intransitive gestures in 10
      patients with ideomotor apraxia during subacute and chronic stage compared to 25 normal
      controls. The design of the behavioral paradigm incorporates a distinct period of planning
      prior to each movement.

      OUTCOME MEASURES: The design of this study allows evaluating any differences in the planning
      and execution phases between patients and controls. Further analysis will examine patterns of
      functional connectivity between activated brain areas, notably their altered interactions in
      ideomotor apraxia. Of special interest is the putative engagement of perilesional or even
      remote brain areas in a neuronal network during attempted recovery from motor deficit.

      It is expected from the study that a better understanding of cortical plasticity compensating
      for motor deficits in ideomotor apraxia can be therapeutically exploited, notably in the
      rehabilitation process.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy volunteers.

        Patients diagnosed with ideomotor apraxia with a single left hemisphere stroke will be
        included.

        The lesion will be located in any part of the frontal and parietal areas or both, as well
        as their connections.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects with abnormal neurologic examinations, previous or current neurological and
        psychiatric disorders will be excluded.

        Subjects under age 21, pregnant or mentally impaired will also be excluded.

        Ideomotor apraxic patients with a second neurologic disorder including more than one brain
        lesion of the inability to cooperate fully will be excluded.

        Patients with a history of significant medical disorders such as cancers will be excluded.

        MRI experiments will not be performed in subjects or patients who have pacemakers, brain
        stimulators, dental implants or metallic braces, aneurysm clips (metal clips on the wall of
        a large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves, and
        cochlear implants), permanent eyeliner, insulin pumps, or shrapnel fragments.

        Welders and metal workers are also at risk for injury because of possible small metal
        fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware. Subjects will be screened for these
        contraindications prior to the study.

        MRI experiments will not be performed on pregnant women.
