  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have developed an 8-week Meaning-Centered Group Psychotherapy designed to help patients
      with advanced cancer sustain or enhance a sense of meaning, peace and purpose despite the
      limitations of their cancer illness. This project's overall aim is to explore the feasibility
      and efficacy of this new and unique psychotherapy intervention for advanced cancer patients
      in enhancing psychological and spiritual well-being and quality of life by comparing it with
      a standard supportive group psychotherapy.
