  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving erlotinib together with celecoxib works in
      treating patients with recurrent stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib
      and celecoxib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor
      cell growth. Celecoxib may slow the growth of a tumor by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
      Combining erlotinib with celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate of patients with stage IIIB or IV recurrent non-small cell
      lung cancer treated with erlotinib and celecoxib as second-line therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen. II. Determine the
      survival duration of patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this
      regimen in these patients. IV. Correlate the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor
      and cyclooxygenase-2 in tumor specimens with response, time to progression, and survival in
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      Group 1: Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily and oral celecoxib twice daily.

      Group 2: Patients receive erlotinib as in group 1.

      Treatment in both groups continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-80 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.
