  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial is comparing the effectiveness of three adjuvant combination
      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who are receiving radiation therapy and
      fluorouracil either before or after surgery for stage II or stage III rectal cancer. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, use
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet known which adjuvant
      combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating patients who are receiving
      radiation therapy and fluorouracil either before or after surgery for rectal cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the overall survival of patients treated with irinotecan, 5-FU and leucovorin
      versus those treated with oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-FU versus those treated with
      leucovorin and 5-FU for patients with stage II and III rectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To prospectively assess rectal function using the Patient Bowel Function/Uniscale
      questionnaire and the FACT Diarrhea Subscale in patients treated with an adjuvant program of
      pelvic radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

      II. To correlate TS, DPD and TP expression (key targets for 5-FU); retention of chromosome
      18q alleles and MSI with TGFÎ²1RII mutation (markers for 5-FU efficacy); ERCC1, ERCC2 and XPF
      expression (participants in repair of adducts from oxaliplatin); and p53 gene mutation in
      tumor tissue specimens with treatment efficacy.

      III. To correlate tumor molecular prognostic markers (chromosome 18q allelic loss and MSI)
      with survival.

      IV. To determine physician preference in regard to the radiation-chemotherapy sequence in the
      Intergroup.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG
      performance status (0 vs 1), chemotherapy/radiotherapy sequence (preoperative vs
      postoperative), and risk group (high risk [T3, N+, M0 or T4, any N, M0] vs low risk [T1-2,
      N+, M0 or T3, N0, M0]). Patients are treated in 1 of 2 groups according to physician
      preference and then randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      GROUP I (preoperative chemoradiotherapy and additional adjuvant chemotherapy): Preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive 1 of 3 treatment regimens, determined by the treating
      physician.

      REGIMEN A (radiotherapy and fluorouracil): Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy once
      daily 5 days a week for 5 1/2 weeks (total of 28 fractions). Patients also receive concurrent
      fluorouracil IV continuously 7 days a week for 5 1/2 weeks.

      REGIMEN B (radiotherapy, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium): Patients undergo external
      beam radiotherapy as in regimen A. Patients also receive concurrent fluorouracil IV and
      leucovorin calcium IV continuously for 4 days on weeks 1 and 5.

      REGIMEN C (radiotherapy and capecitabine)*: Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy as in
      regimen A. Patients also receive concurrent oral capecitabine twice daily for 5 1/2 weeks.

      NOTE: *Regimen C is allowed only for patients enrolled on protocol NSABP-R-04.

      Surgery: Within 21-56 days after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo
      surgical resection.

      Additional adjuvant chemotherapy: Within 21-56 days after complete surgical resection,
      patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours
      followed immediately by fluorourcil IV bolus on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses.

      ARM II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours
      followed immediately by fluorourcil IV bolus on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV
      continuously over 46 hours beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 8 courses.

      ARM III: Patients receive leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 1 hour
      on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 3 courses.

      In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP 2 (postoperative chemoradiotherapy and additional adjuvant chemotherapy): Within 21-56
      days after complete surgical resection, patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in group 1, arm I
      for 4 courses.

      ARM II: Patients receive oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in group 1, arm
      II for 4 courses.

      ARM III: Patients receive leucovorin calcium and fluorouracil as in group 1, arm III for 1
      course.

      Within 4 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy, all patients undergo concurrent pelvic
      chemoradiotherapy as described in group 1 preoperative chemoradiotherapy Regimen A, B, or C,
      followed 4-6 weeks later by 4 additional courses of adjuvant chemotherapy for arms I and II
      and 2 additional courses of adjuvant chemotherapy for arm III.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually for 5 years.
