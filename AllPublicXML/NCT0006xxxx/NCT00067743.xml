    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study in adult subjects with Type 1 Complex Regional Pain
      Syndrome. Subjects diagnosed with unilateral Type 1 CRPS will be enrolled sequentially to
      receive CC-5013 10 mg/day orally. For each subject the study consists of two phases:
      Pre-treatment phase(1 wk) and treatment phase (12 wks)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once the subject completes the 12 week treatment phase the subject is eligible to continue on
      the trial. Subjects may continue until no further benefit is obtained.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of Type 1 CRPS as defined by modified International Association for the
             Study of Pain criteria (App 1) for at least one year duration

          -  Unilateral involvement of a distal hand or foot with or without proximal speed must be
             present. The most severely affected limb will be designated the index limb.

          -  CRPS pain severity score in the index limb of 4 or greater on an 11-point (0-10) NRS
             (Appendix I).

          -  Opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
             anticonvulsants and antidepressant drugs may be continued provided that the subject
             was on stable doses for at least four weeks prior to the Treatment phase.

          -  Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test within 7 days of starting study drug.

          -  In addition, sexually active WCBP must agree to use adequate contraceptive methods
             (oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation;
             intra-uterine device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner)
             while on study drug.

          -  WCBP must agree to have pregnancy tests every 4 weeks while on study drug.

          -  The average CRPS pain severity score in the index limb at the end of the Pre-Treatment
             Phase I (must be 4 or greater) and 2 each of the daily scores over the week must be
             within +/- one point of this average.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form.

          -  Prior treatment with CC-5013

          -  Prior development of an allergic reaction/hypersensitivity while taking thalidomide.

          -  Prior development of a moderate or sever rash or any desquamation while taking
             thalidomide.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Active litigation, compensation or disability issues related to CRPS.

          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 28 days of the treatment phase.
