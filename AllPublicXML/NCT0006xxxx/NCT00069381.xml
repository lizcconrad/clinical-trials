      disorder (PTSD).

      PTSD is a debilitating and often chronic anxiety disorder with serious psychiatric
      comorbidity. The most common trauma associated with PTSD among women is childhood abuse. PTSD
      related to childhood abuse may cause problems with emotion regulation and interpersonal
      functioning. This study will address three domains of PTSD related to childhood abuse:
      emotion management problems, interpersonal problems, and PTSD symptoms.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to 16 sessions of one of three
      treatments: Skills Training for Affective and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR), which focuses
      on helping individuals strengthen and build skills in managing feelings and improving
      interpersonal relationships; Modified Prolonged Exposure (MPE), which focuses on developing
      narratives of abuse history and completing an &quot;emotional processing&quot; of the trauma in a safe
      environment; and a combination of STAIR and MPE. Dropout rates and adverse effects will be
      measured.
