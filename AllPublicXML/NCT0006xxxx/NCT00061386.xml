    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a community-based program to improve diet and physical activity in
      women during the first 12 months following the birth of a child. The program is designed to
      complement existing federal programs for low-income families and is directed toward
      low-income, postpartum, multi-ethnic women.

    <textblock>
      The postpartum period is a window of opportunity to promote behaviors that reduce the risk of
      chronic disease and benefit reproductive health. The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education
      Program (EFNEP) is an educational program delivered by community-based paraprofessional's
      that aims to improve dietary and activity patterns among low income, multi-ethnic women
      during the postpartum period. This study will evaluate the efficacy of the EFNEP to impact
      the diet and activity patterns of women.

      Women were recruited through the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and
      Children (WIC) and randomized to either the EFNEP group or a usual care group. Women in both
      groups will receive standard WIC care consisting of nutrition-risk and breastfeeding
      educational messages at postpartum and follow-up visits. Women in the EFNEP group
      participated in an additional two component intervention that included five home visits and
      motivational telephone calls from project staff.

      Primary study outcomes were assessed at Months 1 and 12. Primary outcomes included fruit and
      vegetable intake, saturated fat intake, and physical activity. Secondary outcomes will
      include Body Mass Index and indicators of fat mass and distribution. The study will also
      analyze mediating and modifying factors, including social support and norms, perceived health
      status, smoking, television viewing, food insecurity, food and activity access, and
      utilization of federal programs and health care.
