      The purpose of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Study is to identify the genes that are
      responsible for causing Alzheimer's Disease (AD). One of the ways in which the risk factor
      genes for late onset AD can be investigated is by identifying and collecting genetic material
      from families with multiple members diagnosed with AD or dementia.

      The purpose of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Study is to help identify the genes that may
      be responsible for causing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by collecting genetic material from
      families with multiple members diagnosed with AD. Qualifying families will have two living
      blood-related individuals who have been diagnosed with or are showing symptoms of AD or
      dementia. Local study sites are located all over the United States, and arrangements may be
      made for eligible families who do not live near a participating site. The biological samples
      and data from these families will be made available to qualified researchers, who must sign a
      Materials Transfer Agreement (MTA) in order to protect the privacy rights of study
      participants before receiving DNA and data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Two living family members diagnosed with AD or other dementia with any age of onset

          -  Biological samples available

               -  Fresh blood, or

               -  Immortalized lymphoblastic cell lines, or

               -  3-5 grams of frozen cerebral cortex; fixed samples are not accepted

        Please note: this study does not include genetic counseling; because no personal
        identifying information such as name or date of birth is attached to samples, results of
        individual tests are not available to participants or family members.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Does not meet inclusion criteria

          -  Member of a family that was included in the National Institute of Mental Health AD
