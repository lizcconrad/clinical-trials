  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will determine whether exposing youths to a &quot;fitogenic&quot; after-school environment
      that emphasizes vigorous exercise and healthy snacks will have a favorable effect on body
      composition (i.e., less fat tissue and more lean tissue), cardiovascular fitness and
      cardiovascular disease risk profile. The environmental intervention will be provided in nine
      schools in Augusta, Georgia, with another nine schools serving as non-intervention comparison
      schools. Children in the 3rd grade will be recruited to participate. They will be followed
      for 3 years, through the 5th grade. Measurements will be made at the beginning and end of
      each school year. The 2-hour after-school intervention will be offered every school day. It
      will consist of three components: (1) homework assistance; (2) a healthy snack; and (3)
      exercise designed to improve skills and fitness.
