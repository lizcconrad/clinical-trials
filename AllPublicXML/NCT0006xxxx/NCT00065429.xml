  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a Phase I/II trial primarily focused on efficacy of BB-10901 in relapsed small
      cell lung cancer and other solid tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase II efficacy expansion was restricted to SCLC patients with relapsed disease and the
      MTD was determined by the Phase I portion of the trial (60mg/m2).

    <time_frame>every 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dose limiting toxicities graded according to common terminology criteria for advers events, version 2.0 and defined as AEs (probably/definitely related to study drug) meeting the NCI CTC criteria, assessed on the basis of the first cycle of therapy (4 weeks of weekly dosing/2 week fu): Hematologic Tox (Grade 4 neutropenia ≥ 5 days, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenic infection); Non-Hem Toxicity: (Any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity, excluding nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and alopecia); Toxicity present at Screening (concurrent conditions), an increase in severity of 2 or more grades.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response was evaluated by RESIST and Investigator assessment at baseline and every 6 weeks. CR: all target lesions disappear with no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression in 2 observations. PR: At least 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters of target lesions shown in 2 observations. SD: does not qalify for PR or PD based on 2 observations. PD: Either a) the appearance of one or more new lesions, or b) at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions</description>

            <description>The study had a conventional open-label cytotoxic study design to determine the safety, tolerability and MTD, preliminary efficacy signal and PK. Once the MTD was found in Phase I, the study would continue to a Phase II expansion at the MTD and the MTD-1 dose levels determined in Phase I. Infusions given at 1-week intervals were expected to provide intermittent exposure with no accumulation of BB-10901. The maximum duration of treatment at each dose level was 4 cycles of treatment; patients with evidence of response were eligible to continue for up to 6 cycles of treatment. Dose levels planned were 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 90 mg/m2/week. Three patients were to be enrolled per dose level with dose escalation when 1 of 3 patients completed 1 cycle and 2 patients had received at least 2 weekly infusions and were eligible for their third infusion, all without DLT. Once the MTD had been defined, 3 more patients were planned for enrollment at the MTD and 3 patients at the MTD-1 level.</description>

        <description>Response was evaluated by RESIST and Investigator assessment at baseline and every 6 weeks. CR: all target lesions disappear with no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression in 2 observations.

            <title>Phase I</title>
            <description>The study had a conventional open-label cytotoxic study design to determine the safety, tolerability and MTD, preliminary efficacy signal and PK. Once the MTD was found in Phase I, the study would continue to a Phase II expansion at the MTD and the MTD-1 dose levels determined in Phase I. Infusions given at 1-week intervals were expected to provide intermittent exposure with no accumulation of BB-10901. The maximum duration of treatment at each dose level was 4 cycles of treatment; patients with evidence of response were eligible to continue for up to 6 cycles of treatment. Dose levels planned were 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 90 mg/m2/week. Three patients were to be enrolled per dose level with dose escalation when 1 of 3 patients completed 1 cycle and 2 patients had received at least 2 weekly infusions and were eligible for their third infusion, all without DLT. Once the MTD had been defined, 3 more patients were planned for enrollment at the MTD and 3 patients at the MTD-1 level.</description>

            <title>Phase II</title>
            <description>For Phase II, the planned design was to use a Gehan's two-stage design [4], with a total of 14 patients assigned to each of 2 dose levels. The dose levels to be tested were to be selected after review of the Phase I data and, assuming evidence of efficacy was seen in that phase, were likely to be the MTD and MTD-1.</description>
