  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed experimental therapies that involve taking white blood
      cells from patients' tumor or from their blood, growing them in the laboratory in large
      numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient.

      Objective:

      This study will collect white blood cells from normal volunteers and white blood cells and/or
      tumor cells, from patients who have been screened for and are eligible for a NCI Surgery
      Branch treatment protocol. The cells collected from normal volunteers will be used as growth
      factors for the cells during the period of laboratory growth. The cells and/or tumor from
      patients will be used to make the cell treatment product.

      Eligibility:

      Patients must be eligible for a NCI Surgery Branch Treatment Protocol

      Normal Volunteers must meet the criteria for blood donation

      Design

      Both patients and normal Volunteers will undergo apheresis. Patients will then undergo
      further testing as required by the treatment protocol.

      There is no required follow up for normal volunteers.

      BACKGROUND:

      There are numerous clinical trials underway in the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch
      (NCI SB), in which patients are administered autologous lymphocytes with anti-tumor activity
      generated from either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or tumor infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TIL). All adoptive cell therapy protocols require that certain cell criteria be
      evaluated and met prior to enrollment.

      This protocol is also designed to serve as a biorepository for samples and associated data
      collected on patients enrolled on NCI SB protocols, which are now closed. Patients who were
      enrolled prior to 2003 were not enrolled on this protocol. Their tissue and data will now be
      retained on this protocol for long-term storage. The protocol is concerned with the retention
      of serum, CSF, bone marrow, ascites fluid, PBMCs, tumor, healthy tissue samples, and CD34
      purified HSCS samples collected from patients with cancer to support basic science and
      clinical research activities of the NCI (SB) at the NIH Clinical Research Center and Center
      for Cancer Research.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To obtain autologous blood, stem cells and/or tumor tissue from patients currently with
           cancer for laboratory analysis and ex vivo generation of autologous anti-tumor
           lymphocytes for future enrollment on a NCI SB adoptive cell therapy clinical trial.

        -  To obtain allogeneic PBMC via apheresis, or blood samples from healthy volunteers for
           use in generating anti-tumor patient lymphocytes ex vivo.

        -  To conduct genomic, proteomic and immunologic research studies on samples collected.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Patients with cancer must be 16 years of age or older and meet the laboratory safety testing
      for infection included in all the cell therapy treatment trials.

      Healthy volunteers must meet the safety evaluation criteria established by the FDA for
      donation of blood products including HBsAg, HBc, HCV, Trypanosoma cruzi, West Nile Virus.
      Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea, CMV, syphilis, and other requirements as updated
      on the FDA website.They must also meet the strict behavioral and medical history
      requirements.

      DESIGN:

      Once a cancer patient is determined to be a potential candidate for one of the NCI SB
      clinical trials, they will undergo an apheresis and/or tumor resection for future treatment
      and/or research purposes. In addition, this protocol will allow for the pheresis of healthy
      volunteers for allogeneic PBMC used in generating autologous antitumor lymphocytes in the
      laboratory, or for research purposes.

      No treatments, investigational or standard therapy, will be administered on this protocol.

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH A CURRENT DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have a form of cancer currently being studied with adoptive cell
             therapies in the NCI SB.

          -  Patient, or their parent(s)/legal guardian(s) (if the patient is less than 18 years of
             age), is able to understand and willing to sign a written Informed consent document.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 16 years

          -  All participants greater than 18 years of age must be willing to sign a durable power
             of attorney.

          -  Serology:

               -  Seronegative for HIVantibody. (The experimental treatments being evaluated depend
                  upon an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can have
                  decreased immune competence and thus may be less responsive to the experimental
                  treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities).

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B surface antigen and seronegative for hepatitis C
                  antibody. If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then the patient must be
                  tested for the presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          -  Lesions which will be harvested for the generation of TIL should be accessible via
             standard surgical or radiological techniques and be associated with acceptable
             morbidity

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

             the cardiovascular, respiratory, or immune system.

          -  Patients who cannot give proper informed consent to the adoptive cell experimental
             therapy due to an active psychiatric disorder or inability to understand the nature of
             the proposed therapy and attendant risk.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant because of the potentially dangerous
             effects of some of the procedures (e.g., tumor biopsy or surgery for tumor resection)
             on the fetus.
