      RATIONALE: Interleukin-7 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-7 in
      treating patients with refractory solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and dose-limiting toxicity of biologically active doses of
           interleukin-7 in patients with refractory solid tumors.

        -  Determine a range of biologically active doses of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the biological effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive interleukin-7 (IL-7) subcutaneously on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14
      (for a total of 8 doses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IL-7 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and &quot;biologically active dose&quot; (BAD) are determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
      The BAD is defined as the dose that produces a sustained 50% increase in CD3+ count over the
      patient's baseline without unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months and at 1 year after study completion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.75-10
      months.
