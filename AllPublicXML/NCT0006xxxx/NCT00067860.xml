  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized controlled study on the clinical and metabolic effects and
      underlying gut mucosal mechanisms of modified diet, with or without recombinant human growth
      hormone, in adults with severe short bowel syndrome dependent upon parenteral nutrition.
      Clinical endpoints include ability to wean patients from parenteral feeding, metabolic
      endpoints include gut nutrient absorptive function and molecular endpoints include expression
      of growth factors and nutrient transporters in small bowel and colonic mucosa. The 6-month
      study is performed, in part, in the General Clinical Research Center for inpatient stays and
      outpatient visits.
