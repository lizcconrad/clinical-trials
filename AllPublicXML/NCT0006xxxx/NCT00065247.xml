      The Beat Osteoporosis: Nourish and Exercise Skeletons (BONES) Project is an after-school
      program that includes weight loading physical activity, nutrition and bone health education,
      and calcium-rich snacks. The program is designed to improve bone health in early elementary
      school children.

    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a serious public health concern expected to threaten 52 million Americans by
      the year 2010. This debilitating disease comes at an annual cost of $17 billion. By
      optimizing bone development during the growing years, individuals can lower their risk of
      osteoporosis by building an adequate reserve of bone. This study will implement and evaluate
      an after-school program with exercise, education, and diet components designed to improve
      bone quality and muscle strength in early elementary school children.

      First and second grade children from 84 after school programs in 33 diverse communities
      throughout Massachusetts and Rhode Island will be enrolled in the study. After-school
      programs will be randomized to either the BONES Project, to the BONES Project plus a
      parent/caregiver component, or to a no-intervention control group. The BONES curriculum will
      be implemented 4 days per week over a 20- to 25-week period; each after-school program will
      implement the program for 2 years. Participants will be followed for an additional year,
      assuming they remain in the after-school program or do not withdraw for some other reason.
      All parents will be asked to complete a Child Medical History survey and a Parent Health
      Survey at baseline, during the 2-year intervention, and at the end of the follow-up year.
      Parents in the BONES Project plus parent/caregiver component will receive a newsletter and
      worksheet 5 times per year.

      Participants will be assessed by quantitative ultrasound, height, weight, and body
      composition measurements, muscular strength, self competence, physical activity level, food
      knowledge and preference, calcium intake, perceived parental support, and sleep habits.
