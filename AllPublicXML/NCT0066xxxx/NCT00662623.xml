  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of different methods of providing
      education about sleep apnea and continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) use and
      how that education might help to improve health outcomes and the amount of time CPAP is used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor treatment adherence with CPAP therapy is well-documented. Set against a backdrop of
      telemedicine applications that have grown as fast in unsubstantiated claims and assumptions
      of patient satisfaction, diagnostic accuracy, clinical efficacy, and cost-effectiveness as
      they have in technological sophistication and capabilities, the evaluative aspect of this
      proposal is designed as as a randomized, controlled clinical trialâ€”Usual Care patients
      (control) versus i-PAP patients (intervention). An important empirical-methodological
      advantage of the project is the objective measurement of CPAP adherence, which is measured by
      internal microprocessor as the &quot;amount of time CPAP is used at the prescribed pressure.&quot; This
      objective measurement allows feedback of treatment adherence and efficacy to both patient and
      provider, and the i-PAP intervention was designed around this central feature.
