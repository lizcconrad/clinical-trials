  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways affecting approximately 15 million
      individuals in the U.S. The rate of asthma exacerbations among women is twice that of men
      after adolescence, and a large proportion of females with asthma report worsened asthma
      symptoms during different phases of the menstrual cycle. Hormonal influences have been
      hypothesized to account for these differences. Decreased peak flow rates and increased
      symptoms have been found in females during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle when
      estrogen and progesterone levels are low. Estrogen and progesterone have both been found to
      reduce smooth muscle contractility and increase bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. A
      perimenstrual shift toward a Th2 (allergic) phenotype characterized by a decreased
      interferon-gamma to interleukin-10 ratio has been demonstrated in healthy women not using
      oral contraceptives compared to midcycle; however, the effect was blunted in healthy oral
      contraceptive pill users, implying hormonal modulation of the allergic phenotype. Several
      case reports have demonstrated a therapeutic benefit of oral contraceptives in decreasing
      asthma exacerbations and corticosteroid requirements. Human studies have demonstrated that
      estrogen decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, neutrophil recruitment, and inhibits
      inducible nitric oxide synthase activity, which could lead to lower exhaled nitric oxide
      levels.

      The measurement of the fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) is a
      non-invasive method to assess airway inflammation in adults and children with asthma. The
      hypotheses of the current study are that women using oral contraceptives will have lower FENO
      levels and better asthma control as assessed by the Asthma Control TestTM during different
      phases of the menstrual cycle. This study may identify clinically important changes in FENO
      levels and asthma control during the menstrual cycle and modification of these effects by
      oral contraceptive pills. This data may lead to future studies aimed at identifying
      therapeutic roles for hormones in asthma therapy in women.
