  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FOLFOX6 regimen is a standard chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of patients with
      colorectal cancer and other gastrointestinal cancers. Tivozanib (AV-951) is a targeted
      anti-angiogenesis agent that has demonstrated acceptable tolerability in a phase I clinical
      trial. This study is designed to test the hypothesis that tivozanib (AV-951) can be combined
      with standard FOLFOX6 chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with colorectal and other
      gastrointestinal cancers. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dose of
      tivozanib (AV-951) that can be safely combined with FOLFOX6 chemotherapy, and to evaluate the
      safety profile, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of this combination.

      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, study design that will examine safety, tolerability, and
      maximum tolerated dose of tivozanib (AV-951) and FOLFOX6 in advanced colorectal cancer and
      other gastrointestinal cancers. In the study, only the doses of tivozanib (AV-951) will be
      escalated from 0.5 mg/day to 1.5 mg/day. All subjects will receive standard doses of FOLFOX6
      chemotherapy every 2 weeks.

    <description>Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration (1 cycle = 4 weeks of treatment):
Tivozanib (AV-951): 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, and 1.5 mg oral once daily On Day -5 (± 2 days) subjects will receive a single dose of tivozanib (AV-951) for pharmacokinetic sampling. Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 1, subjects will receive tivozanib (AV-951) once daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off. Tivozanib (AV-951) dosing repeats every cycle in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. On days when both tivozanib (AV-951) and the FOLFOX6 chemotherapy regimen are co-administered, tivozanib (AV-951) will be administered immediately prior to the start of the FOLFOX6 chemotherapy regimen.
Subjects will receive FOLFOX6 chemotherapy every 2 weeks starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Subjects will receive 2 treatments of FOLFOX6 in each treatment cycle, starting on Day 1 and Day 15.</description>
