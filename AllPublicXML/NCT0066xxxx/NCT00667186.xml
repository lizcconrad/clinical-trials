  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late diagnosis of HIV infection is believed to be responsible for high rates of HIV
      transmission. The purpose of this study is to determine whether targeted screening versus
      routine screening will identify a greater number of HIV infected participants. This study
      will also compare the costs of the resources used for targeted screening versus routine
      screening.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel strategies are needed to reduce HIV transmission, particularly among individuals who
      are unaware of their HIV status. Emergency departments (EDs) routinely receive individuals in
      a medical setting where an opportunity exists to screen them for HIV. The purposes of this
      study are to determine whether the proportion of tested participants identified as HIV
      infected by targeted screening exceeds routine screening and to determine whether the program
      resources used per infected patient identified are lower for targeted screening than for
      routine screening.

      Participants will be recruited from the University of Cincinnati Emergency Medicine Clinical
      Trials Center. The existing ED-based clinical HIV counseling and testing program in a lower
      HIV prevalence area will randomly alternate between two strategies for offering testing to ED
      participants: 1) targeted screening based on self-reported HIV risk and 2) routine screening.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to the targeted or routine screening group based on
      their presence in the ED during randomized days and times.

      At study entry an interview, blood collection, and counseling will occur. Participants will
      be telephoned following their ED visit to be given their negative results. Participants with
      positive results will be asked to return to the ED for notification, counseling, and
      connections to subsequent care. Participants who are HIV infected will be transferred to the
      University of Cincinnati Infectious Disease Center for care.
