      This study A3471107 was terminated on February 4th, 2005 due to enrollment difficulties,
      problems related to need for rescue medication, and perceptions about cardiovascular risk
      potentially associated with all NSAIDs.

    <description>parecoxib 40 mg intravenously after recovery from anesthesia; if pain persisted, the patient could receive an optional second drug dose on Study Day 1 (only) if more than 4 hours after the first dose. When the patient was able to tolerate oral medication, one valdecoxib 40 mg tablet was administered by mouth once daily in the morning until a maximum period of 7 days.</description>
