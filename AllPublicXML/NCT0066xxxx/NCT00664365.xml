      This study is the first administration of GSK958108 to man. The study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of GSK958108 and evaluate
      the effect of food on GSK958108 pharmacokinetics

             monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines (Can be repeated once at screening).
