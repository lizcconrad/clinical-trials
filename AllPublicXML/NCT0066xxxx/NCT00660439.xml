    <textblock>
      This study compares Narrative Exposure Therapy with a Waiting list control group, both
      consists of traumatized patients with diagnosed Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. The main aim
      is to investigate if the patients psychiatric symptoms and levels of the stress hormone
      cortisol will improve more after Narrative Exposure Therapy than the Waiting list (i.e. no
      intervention).

      In this study we want to compare Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) to Waiting list controls.
      Adult patients with diagnosed Posttraumatic Stress Disorder following different types of
      trauma, will be included. Clinicians in psychiatric outpatient clinics will treat patients
      with NET, either immediately after assessment, or after a second assessment 3 months later.
      All patients will also be assessed 1 and 6 months after treatment completion. All patients
      will be assessed for psychiatric symptoms by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
      Interview (version 5.0.0) and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Patients will also
      answer several questionnaires (IES-R, SCL-90, BDI-II, DES and UCL). Baseline level of the
      stress hormone cortisol will be collected in saliva for measuring the diurnal cycle. We will
      investigate if patients with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder will show more symptom improvement
      with NET than those on the waiting list (i.e. no intervention) in addition to measuring
      potential differences in cortisol between the groups.
