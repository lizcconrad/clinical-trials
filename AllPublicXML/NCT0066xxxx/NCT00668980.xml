  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to characterize the process of constitution of symbolic
      representation in infants with Down syndrome, as well as to investigate the relationship
      between gestures and the emergence of oral language. The investigators hypothesis is that
      children with Down syndrome could present difficulties during the constitution of symbolic
      representation that may be related to later deficits on expressive language, generally
      observed in these children.

      According to the Genetic Epistemology, language development is directly related to cognitive
      construction. Such relationship is clearly observed after the constitution of representation
      that allows one individual to express his or her thinking through language.
