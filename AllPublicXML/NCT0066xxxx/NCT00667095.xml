  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether women with overactive bladder (OAB) who
      receive direct instillation via a catheter of a Botulinum-A Toxin (Botox) with Dimethyl
      Sulfoxide (DMSO) solution experience significantly better improvement of their OAB symptoms
      when compared to a similar group of women with OAB who receive instillation of DMSO only.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of catheter-based
      instillation of a solution of Botox/DMSO as a novel method for treating women with overactive
      bladder (OAB) and secondary urinary incontinence who have failed oral pharmacologic therapy.
      This study will test the broad hypothesis that administration of Botox/DMSO instillations
      into the bladder with a urethral catheter can significantly improve symptoms and quality of
      life in patients with OAB when compared to DMSO installations alone. Explicitly, we
      hypothesize that scores on the validated Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) questionnaire
      of women with OAB who receive Botox/DMSO instillation will be much improved at three-month
      follow-up compared to similar women receiving DMSO instillation alone. Our long-term goal is
      to offer women with detrusor hyperreflexia or OAB a less invasive alternative to surgery and
      an alternative to anticholinergic by mouth medications. In support of this effort, we are
      proposing a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to be conducted in
      the Department of Urology at Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida.

      Note: The study was terminated early in July of 2011 due to an extended medical absence of
      the Principal Investigator.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QoL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The I-QoL measures the effect of urinary incontinence on quality of life. It is divided into 3 subscales: 1) avoidance and limiting behavior, 2) psychosocial impact, and 3) social embarrassment. The I-QOL is comprised of 22 items, each with the response scale from '1= Extremely' to '5= Not at all'.
A mean score for each subscale is calculated (averaging the scores for the items in each subscale) as well as a total score for all 22 items (sum of all subscale scores). The scores are then transformed to a 'Scale score' ranging from 0-100 points for ease of interpretation: Scale score = (sum of the items - lowest possible score)/possible raw score range X 100. Higher scores indicate less impact of incontinence on quality of life.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The IIQ-7 measures the effect of urinary incontinence on quality of life. It is comprised of 7 items, each with the response scale from &quot;0=Not at all&quot; to &quot;3=Greatly.&quot; The scores can range from 0 to 21; a low score indicates less impact of incontinence on quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form Score (ICIQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ICIQ-SF provides a brief and robust measure to assess the impact of symptoms of incontinence on quality of life and outcome of treatment. The questionnaire has 4 items and the score can range from 0 to 21, with greater values indicating increased severity of symptoms and lower quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The UDI-6 measures the effect of urinary incontinence on quality of life. It consists of 6 items, each with the response scale from &quot;0=Not at all&quot; to &quot;3=Greatly.&quot; The scores can range from 0 to 18; a low score indicates less impact of incontinence on quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Decrease in Blaivas-Groutz Anti-Incontinence Score at 1 Month and 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Blaivas-Groutz Anti-incontinence scale was used as a measure of urinary incontinence. This scale combines information on the number of incontinent episodes in a 24-hour period, 24-hour pad weights, and a qualitative rating by the patient into a single score ranging from 0 to 6. this score is then used to categorize incontinence as none (0), mild (1-2), moderate (3-4), or severe (5-6).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Decrease in Urinary Urgency at 1 Month and 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary urgency was measured by the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS). The IUSS asks patients to assess the severity of 'urgency' at each void. The scale employs the following wording: &quot;Degree of urgency is meant to describe your urge to urinate. Sometimes you may feel a very strong urge to urinate and at other times, you may feel a milder urge prior to the onset of a toilet void. Rate this feeling by circling 0, 1, 2, or 3, defined as: 0: NONE - no urgency, 1: MILD - awareness of urgency, but it is easily tolerated and you can continue with your usual activity or tasks, 2: MODERATE - enough urgency discomfort that it interferes with or shortens your usual activity or tasks, 3: SEVERE - extreme urgency discomfort that abruptly stops all activity or tasks.&quot;</description>

          <title>Body Mass Index</title>
          <description>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a health index for comparing weight to height. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared. The body mass index is an indication if a person is at a suitable weight for his height on an approximation of body fat. A body mass index of under 20 is considered to be underweight, while a body mass index between 20 to 25 is considered healthy. A body mass index in the range of 25 to 30 is regarded as overweight. A body mass index over 30 is regarded as obese.</description>

        <title>Change in Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QoL) Score</title>
        <description>The I-QoL measures the effect of urinary incontinence on quality of life. It is divided into 3 subscales: 1) avoidance and limiting behavior, 2) psychosocial impact, and 3) social embarrassment. The I-QOL is comprised of 22 items, each with the response scale from ‘1= Extremely’ to ‘5= Not at all’.
A mean score for each subscale is calculated (averaging the scores for the items in each subscale) as well as a total score for all 22 items (sum of all subscale scores). The scores are then transformed to a ‘Scale score’ ranging from 0-100 points for ease of interpretation: Scale score = (sum of the items – lowest possible score)/possible raw score range X 100. Higher scores indicate less impact of incontinence on quality of life.</description>

This scale combines information on the number of incontinent episodes in a 24-hour period, 24-hour pad weights, and a qualitative rating by the patient into a single score ranging from 0 to 6. this score is then used to categorize incontinence as none (0), mild (1-2), moderate (3-4), or severe (5-6).</description>
        <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 3 months</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was done according to the principle of intention-to-treat. The sample size was reduced to 9 in the DSMO instillation arm at 3 months due to withdrawal for reasons unrelated to study (cancer).</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Decrease in Urinary Urgency at 1 Month and 3 Months</title>
        <description>Urinary urgency was measured by the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS). The IUSS asks patients to assess the severity of ‘urgency’ at each void. The scale employs the following wording: “Degree of urgency is meant to describe your urge to urinate. Sometimes you may feel a very strong urge to urinate and at other times, you may feel a milder urge prior to the onset of a toilet void. Rate this feeling by circling 0, 1, 2, or 3, defined as: 0: NONE – no urgency, 1: MILD – awareness of urgency, but it is easily tolerated and you can continue with your usual activity or tasks, 2: MODERATE – enough urgency discomfort that it interferes with or shortens your usual activity or tasks, 3: SEVERE – extreme urgency discomfort that abruptly stops all activity or tasks.”</description>
