  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The radical treatment for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgery. However, it is only for
      10 to 20% of all patients and 10 to 30% of them have relapsed every year after surgery. For
      an inoperable case, we can consider Liver transplantation. But there is not enough organ
      donor and it is very expensive. In that case, various treatment modalities for HCC (i.e.,
      transcatheter arterial embolization [TAE] and percutaneous ethanol injection [PEI],
      radiofrequency ablation etc.) have become clinically available. In addition, after these
      treatment, radiation therapy can be conducted as a combined treatment. If it is difficult,
      radiation therapy can be conducted alone. In this case, radiation therapy can use
      fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy [FSRT] or 3D simulation to minimize the exposure
      to normal tissues. In recent years, Proton therapy is a new radiation therapy which remaining
      energy is released when they reach the tumor, delivering the most effective dose of
      radiation. The purpose of this trial is to improve the therapeutic effects by using proton
      therapy.
