      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of losartan, an ARB, on glucose
      metabolism and inflammatory cytokines in CHF patients treated with ACE inhibitors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with marked insulin resistance, characterized by
      both fasting and stimulated hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore, insulin resistance is a predictor
      of CHF and associated with more severe disease and a worse prognosis in patients with CHF. In
      CHF patients, therefore, insulin resistance is not merely a function of adiposity and may
      have implications in the pathophysiology of CHF disease progression. Angiotensin II
      negatively modulates insulin-mediated actions by regulating multiple levels of the insulin
      signaling cascade such as the insulin receptor, IRS, and PI3-kinase. Furthermore, both ACE
      inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) improve glycemic status not only in
      patients with type II diabetes but also in patients with hypertension and the metabolic
      syndrome. On the other hand, it is well known that some cytokines, such as TNF-Î±, are
      involved with pathophysiology of insulin resistance and CHF. However, it is still unclear
      whether the ARB improves insulin resistance in CHF patients already treated with ACE
      inhibitors and whether there is the relationship between insulin resistance and inflammatory
      cytokines in CHF patients already treated with ACE inhibitors. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effects of losartan, an ARB, on glucose metabolism and inflammatory
      cytokines in CHF patients treated with ACE inhibitors.
