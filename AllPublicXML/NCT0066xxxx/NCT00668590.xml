  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mounting evidence documents the positive impact of using patient decision aids (PtDA) to
      facilitate shared decision-making (SDM) between patients and physicians in preference
      sensitive contexts. But overall use of PtDAs across the broader US healthcare system remains
      low. More compelling evidence is needed to make the case for policies that would accelerate
      adoption of PtDAs in routine clinical practice in primary care settings that serve diverse
      and economically disadvantaged populations. The investigators believe that it is now time to
      move beyond the subjective evaluations of PtDAs that are commonly reported in clinical trials
      of PtDAs, to evaluate whether these tools can also change health behavior and improve health
      outcomes. Therefore, the investigators will build on their expertise in working with
      community-based physicians to evaluate a newly developed PtDA focused on diabetes, using a
      mixed-methods approach. The investigators patient sample will be drawn from primary care
      practices serving African American, Latino and Caucasian patients. The investigators will
      conduct a 2-group randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of the diabetes PtDA,
      combined with telephone coaching, in increasing patient self-care and self-efficacy,
      increasing diabetes knowledge and improving clinical measures including glycosylated
      hemoglobin A1c, lipids and blood pressure. The investigators will also explore variation in
      effects of the patient decision aid, comparing African American, Latino and Caucasian
      patients and conduct in-depth interviews with a randomly selected subset of trial
      participants to explore patient perceptions of the decision aid and variation across
      racial/ethnic groups. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to the control condition,
      participants assigned to receiving the video PtDA program and telephone coaching will report:
      greater self-efficacy and diabetes knowledge, more engagement in self-care behaviors, better
      glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c, as well as lower quantitative LDL and blood
      pressure levels. The conceptual model guiding the investigators trial is the Integrative
      Model of Behavior Change. The model includes three primary determinants of behavior:

        1. attitudes toward performing the behavior

        2. perceived social norms about performing the behavior

        3. self-efficacy. The investigators expect the diabetes PtDA to affect each of these
           constructs directly or indirectly.
