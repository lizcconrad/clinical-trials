  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is a condition unique to pregnancy characterized by the new onset of
      hypertension and proteinuria. Eclampsia, characterized by maternal seizures, is a serious
      complication increasing the risk of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Magnesium
      sulfate is the drug of choice for prevention and treating convulsions in severe preeclampsia
      and eclampsia.

      Magnesium sulfate is administered parenterally by intramuscular (IM) or intravenous routes
      (IV). In general a loading dose of 4 to 5 grams of magnesium sulfate is administered
      intravenously followed by an IM injection every 4 hours or by a continuous IV infusion. The
      IV regimen achieves more stable serum levels of magnesium but requires the use of an infusion
      pump for safe delivery and has a greater potential for inadvertent overdose. Although
      magnesium sulfate has been demonstrated as a safe and effective drug for the treatment and
      prevention of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia, concerns about the safety of the drug
      remain. The IM dosing regimen, while potentially safer, requires repeated painful IM
      injections. These limitations in administration hinder the widespread use of magnesium
      sulfate despite its demonstrated benefits.

      The goal of this research is to develop a system of care that avoids overdose and facilitates
      the use of magnesium sulfate for the treatment of preeclampsia. To this end, a primary
      objective of this research is to demonstrate the safety of a simple, inexpensive flow
      controlled pump system (Springfusor®). This randomized study will compare the administration
      of magnesium sulfate by the Springfusor® controlled pump with an IM regimen, the standard of
      care in most hospitals in India. The study will document the efficacy and acceptability of
      each treatment for patients and staff and compare the cost and time elements involved in
      providing each method.

    <description>Women in Group II (standard of care) will receive an 8 mL loading dose containing 4g magnesium sulfate administered manually per standard hospital protocol. The solution will be diluted with normal saline according to standard hospital practice, and given IV over 20 minutes. For women in Group II, the IV loading dose will be followed immediately with 20 mL treatment by IM injection, given as 10 mL (5 g magnesium sulfate) into each buttock. This dose will be followed by 10 mL treatments (5g magnesium sulfate) every four hours, injected into alternate buttock. Treatment will be discontinued when clinically indicated.</description>

    <description>Women in Group I (Springfusor® arm) will receive a 8 mL loading dose containing 4g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4*7H2O) 50% solution, which is approximately 2 mmoL magnesium/mL. The loading dose of 8mL with 4 g MgSO4will be administered using the Springfusor® pump. For women in Group I, the administration of the loading dose will be immediately followed by a maintenance infusion. The maintenance dose of 4 g (8 cc, 50% MgSO4) will be administered with the Springfusor® pump continuously over four hours. The pump will be started immediately after the initial bolus and the 4g dose repeated (and syringe replaced) every four hours for upto 24 hours postpartum.</description>
