      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of home blood pressure monitors plus
      nurse telephone monitoring is more effective than the use of blood pressure monitors alone in
      improving control of high blood pressure in an urban medical clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will all have home blood pressure monitors, education session on controlling
      their blood pressure and will be randomized to recieve 6 months of intensive telephonic on a
      set monitoring schedule or no telephonic follow up. Phone calls will be weekly for 4 weeks,
      then every 2 weeks for 8 weeks then monthly for 3 months.

    <description>Participants will receive a home blood pressure monitor and be taught how to use it. They will have an education session to review treatment goals, medications, diet and exercise. They will be asked to see their primary care provider at least every 3 months and the research nurse at 3, 6 and 12 months.</description>
