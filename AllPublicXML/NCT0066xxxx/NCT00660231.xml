      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and bexarotene, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving gemcitabine together with bexarotene to see
      how well it works in treating patients with progressive or refractory stage IB, stage II,
      stage III, or stage IV cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Confirm the feasibility and efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine hydrochloride and
           bexarotene in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma whose disease is no longer
           controlled by skin-directed therapy and who have had at least one prior systemic
           therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of objective disease control as defined by complete response (CR),
           clinical complete response (CCR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) for 6
           months as determined by the Objective Primary Disease Response Evaluation Criteria
           (OPDREC).

        -  Evaluate the duration and durability of objective disease response (CR, CCR and PR) as
           determined by OPDREC criteria.

        -  Evaluate time to objective disease response.

        -  Determine the safety of this combination in terms of adverse events, clinical laboratory
           data, physical examinations, rate of neutropenic fever and sepsis, blood transfusions,
           and treatment compliance.

        -  Determine the time to objective disease progression.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure.

        -  Determine change from baseline in Severity-Weighted Assessment Tool (SWAT) value,
           Erythroderma SWAT value, Pruritus Visual Analogue Scale, and ECOG performance status.

        -  Determine proportion of disease control, response, and progression as determined by
           RECIST criteria.

        -  Evaluate the proportion of patients with clearing of Sézary cells from the blood and
           bone marrow.

        -  Measure changes in patient assessed Quality of Life using Skindex 29 and EORTC QLQ-30.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 8 and oral bexarotene daily on
      days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 4 courses of study therapy, patients with
      responding disease receive oral bexarotene alone daily until disease progression or treatment
      no longer tolerated.

      Patients complete a quality of life questionnaire at baseline, during study therapy, and
      after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for up to 5 years.
