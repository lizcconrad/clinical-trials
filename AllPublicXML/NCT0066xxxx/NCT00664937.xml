  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a condition where airways tighten when you
      exercise and may cause coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. In many patients, this
      condition can cause lung function to drop making it harder to breath. An instrument called a
      spirometer is commonly used to measure lung function. This traditional means of assessing
      lung function in asthma is limited in its ability to provide information as to where in the
      lung the tightness is. Hyperpolarized helium magnetic resonance imaging (3He MRI) is a novel
      way to see the where air is going in the lungs using an MRI and special gas. The ability to
      see where the air can and cannot reach in the lungs may help show more accurately if a
      medication is working to make the asthma better. The purpose of this study is to examine
      patients with EIB in order to see if 3He MRI provides a better way to measure lung function.
      Patients will be given either montelukast sodium, a drug to improve the ability to breath
      with EIB, or placebo and then put on a treadmill to induce an occurrence of airway
      constriction. The patient's lung function will be measured more than once using both the
      spirometer and the 3He MRI.
