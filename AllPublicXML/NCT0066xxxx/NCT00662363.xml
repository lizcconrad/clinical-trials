    <textblock>
      Patients requiring opioids for post-operative pain control following elective orthopedic
      procedures which has resulted in constipation symptoms, and who are in inpatient
      rehabilitation will be randomized to two different treatment arms: lubiprostone or senna.
      Baseline scores regarding constipation and a quality of life bowel questionnaire will be
      compared the day following 6 days of treatment intervention.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Lubiprostone (Amitiza) compared to
      standard care for the treatment of constipation in orthopedic patients receiving opioids for
      pain control during inpatient rehabilitation. Lubiprostone (Amitiza®) is a locally acting
      chloride channel activator that increases intestinal fluid, and thus increases intestinal
      motility. It has been approved for chronic constipation, but not in the setting of
      opioid-induced constipation. Senna is a stimulant laxative that increases propulsive
      peristaltic activity of the colon through local effects on the mucosa.

      Subjects will be compared using from the Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC) which has
      previously been found to be a valid and reliable way to measure constipation symptoms and
      clinical course. (Frank, Kleinman et al. 1999) as well as with other measures of
      bowel-related symptoms and functional outcomes.

    <description>Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC) - Change in this measure was assessed. The PAC has previously been found to be a valid and reliable way to measure constipation symptoms and clinical course. The PAC has two components. The symptom (SYM) component is composed of 12 items with score range 0-4 with lower scores indicating improvement. Scores within the two domains were separately averaged. The PAC-SYM questionnaire has shown good concurrent and clinical validity for opioid-induced constipation in a number of pain populations and has demonstrative responsiveness to treatment. There are three symptom domains within the PAC-SYM: Abdominal symptoms (4 items), rectal symptoms (3 items) and stool symptoms (5 items).</description>

    <description>The second component of the PAC is the quality of life (QOL) component.The quality of life (QOL) component consists of five items that are rated on a 0-4 scale with higher scores indicating better QOL. Scores within the domains are averaged.</description>

        <title>Change in Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC) - Symptoms (Sym)</title>
        <description>Patient Assessment of Constipation (PAC) – Change in this measure was assessed. The PAC has previously been found to be a valid and reliable way to measure constipation symptoms and clinical course. The PAC has two components. The symptom (SYM) component is composed of 12 items with score range 0-4 with lower scores indicating improvement. Scores within the two domains were separately averaged. The PAC-SYM questionnaire has shown good concurrent and clinical validity for opioid-induced constipation in a number of pain populations and has demonstrative responsiveness to treatment. There are three symptom domains within the PAC-SYM: Abdominal symptoms (4 items), rectal symptoms (3 items) and stool symptoms (5 items).</description>

            <groups_desc>Primary outcome measures chosen were between group comparisons for change on Constipation Symptom Questionnaire ratings at exit from the study. The PAC-SYM is a symptom scale where higher numbers indicate more symptoms. Change from baseline to Day 7 was calculated and larger negative differences indicated greater improvement in constipation symptoms. The PAC-QOL is a quality of life scale where higher numbers indicate better quality of life. Change from baseline to 7 days was calculated.</groups_desc>
