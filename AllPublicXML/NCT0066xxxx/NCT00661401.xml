      Objective: Measure serum IgG antibody to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6B, 9V e
      14, Haemophilus influenzae type b and tetanus toxoid in patients with primary antibody
      deficiencies who were treated with subcutaneous immunoglobulin infusions.

    <textblock>
      Therapy with polyvalent immunoglobulin (Ig) has been established as the standard therapy for
      antibody deficiencies for several decades now. Although subcutaneous infusions were
      originally proposed as an alternative to intramuscular injections, more recently, this method
      has been proven as a safe and convenient method for providing immunoglobulin levels in adults
      and children. Subcutaneous administration of immunoglobulins has some clinical advantages
      over intravenous immunoglobulin infusions (IVIG) , including a more benign side effect
      profile, better sustained levels of IgG in the blood and reduced cost. An additional benefit
      is an improvement in the quality of life, which is in part secondary to the feasibility of
      the patients to administer it themselves at home. The most common infections in primary
      antibody deficiency patients involves encapsulated bacteria, mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae
      and Haemophilus influenzae type b. The aim of this study is to verify if patients with
      antibody deficiency receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) infusions keep protective
      antibody levels to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and tetanus
      toxoid.

    <measure>Specific IgG levels were measured using ELISA. Adequate response was arbitrarily defined as equal to or higher than 1.3 mg/L to pneumococci (Sorensen RU et al 1998), 1.0 mg/L to Hib (Takano AO 1997) and 0.1 IU/mL to tetanus toxoid (Kayhtyh et al 1983).</measure>

    <description>They were administered a polyvalent, pasteurized liquid immune globulin subcutaneously (human 16% Beriglobin ®, Germany) with doses ranging from 57 to 132 mg/kg/week in order to maintain the same dosage they received by intravenous route monthly previous to this protocol. After a wash-out period (15 weeks) of the subcutaneous immunoglobulin administration, blood was collected every 4 weeks immediately before infusions. The infusions were administered using battery-powered ambulatory syringe drivers together with 10 or 20 ml syringe and infusions sets according to a pre-defined protocol (Gardulf et al, 2006).</description>
