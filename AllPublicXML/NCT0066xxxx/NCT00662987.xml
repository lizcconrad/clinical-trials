      To determine whether a 3-day course of postoperative antibiotics is effective as a 7-day
      course in reducing pain and reducing time to resumption of normal diet and activity following
      pediatric tonsillectomy

      STUDY DESIGN : A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial METHODS : All pediatric
      patients (under the age of 18) scheduled to undergo a tonsillectomy with or without
      adenoidectomy from an outpatient otolaryngology practice will be recruited for the study.
      Exclusion criteria include prior use of antibiotics 7 days before surgery, penicillin allergy
      or medical comorbidity necessitating antibiotic use. Preoperative demographic information
      will be obtained. Tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy will be performed by a single
      surgeon (JJ) using electrocautery. Patients will be randomized to receive either a 3- or
      7-day course of amoxicillin. Parents will be asked to record the following information:
      analgesic use for the first 7 postoperative days, postoperative days the child initiated her
      usual diet and level of activity and medical treatment for oral hemorrhage or dehydration.
      Statistical analysis will be performed to determine a real difference between the two groups
      with regard to analgesic use, resumption to normal diet and activity, and incidence of oral
      hemorrhage or dehydration.
