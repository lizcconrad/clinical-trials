    <measure>Number of Participants With Greater Than or Equal to 50 Percent Reduction in Ulcer Surface Area Including Intact Skin Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24 [end of treatment (EOT)] or early termination</time_frame>
    <description>University of Texas (UT) system assesses ulcer depth, wound infection and clinical signs of lower-extremity ischemia. UT Wound Classification (1C/2C) was based on grade (0= healed site to 3= penetrating wound to bone or joint) and stage (A= clean wounds to D= ischaemic infected wounds) of wounds. Participants were evaluated at 4 stratums: Stratum 1: Toe pressure&gt;30 mm of mercury (mmHg) and UT grade and stage 1C. Stratum 2: Toe pressure&lt;=30 mmHg and UT grade and stage 1C. Stratum 3: Toe pressure&gt;30 mmHg and UT grade and stage 2C. Stratum 4: Toe pressure&lt;=30 mmHg and UT grade and stage 2C.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 24 (EOT) or early termination</time_frame>
    <description>Intact skin healing was defined as 100 percent reduction in ulcer surface area with full epithelialisation. UT system assesses ulcer depth, wound infection and clinical signs of lower-extremity ischemia. Participants were evaluated at 4 stratums: Stratum 1: Toe pressure&gt;30 mm of mercury (mmHg) and UT grade and stage 1C. Stratum 2: Toe pressure&lt;=30 mmHg and UT grade and stage 1C. Stratum 3: Toe pressure&gt;30 mmHg and UT grade and stage 2C. Stratum 4: Toe pressure&lt;=30 mmHg and UT grade and stage 2C.</description>

    <measure>Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)- Utility Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (EOT or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. It assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (eg, &quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

    <measure>Euro Quality of Life (EQ-5D)- Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (EOT or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single index value. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 mm (worst imaginable health state) to 100 mm (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state.</description>

    <measure>36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (EOT or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning).</description>

    <measure>11-point Likert Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (EOT or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>The 11 point Likert pain scale which used a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) point rating system was used to assess participant's pain score. No distinction was made between neuropathy and inflammatory (nociceptive) pain.</description>

    <measure>Transcutaneous Local Tissue Oxygenation (pO2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (EOT or early termination)</time_frame>
    <description>Transcutaneous pO2 was assessed at the dorsum of the foot in the first intermetatarsal space using an appropriately calibrated instrument. The skin oxygen partial pressure was determined by measuring the oxygen reduction current by means of a measuring cell.</description>

        <description>University of Texas (UT) system assesses ulcer depth, wound infection and clinical signs of lower-extremity ischemia. UT Wound Classification (1C/2C) was based on grade (0= healed site to 3= penetrating wound to bone or joint) and stage (A= clean wounds to D= ischaemic infected wounds) of wounds. Participants were evaluated at 4 stratums: Stratum 1: Toe pressure&gt;30 mm of mercury (mmHg) and UT grade and stage 1C. Stratum 2: Toe pressure&lt;=30 mmHg and UT grade and stage 1C. Stratum 3: Toe pressure&gt;30 mmHg and UT grade and stage 2C. Stratum 4: Toe pressure&lt;=30 mmHg and UT grade and stage 2C.</description>

        <title>Euro Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)- Utility Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. It assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (eg, &quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24 (EOT or early termination)</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all participants who were randomized. Participants were only considered when all items contributing to the score had been answered.

The 'n' is signifying those participants who received study drug and were evaluated for this measure at the timepoint for each group respectively.</population>
