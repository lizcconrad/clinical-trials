    <textblock>
      We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy of 10 mg mitiglinide or 0.2mg
      voglibose with insulin glargine for 16 weeks after single administration of insulin glargine
      for 4 weeks in type 2 diabetic patients whose glycemic control were not enough despite
      administration of oral antidiabetic drug or insulin glargine.
