    <textblock>
      A randomised, prospective, cross over study will be done to determine whether the
      anticoagulation therapy with UFH or LMWH used for hemodialysis sessions modifies
      osteoprotegerin and RANKL plasma levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It's well known that treatment with heparin can lead to a reduction in bone density and the
      development of osteoporosis [ 1 ]. Until now, it's not clear the mechanism by which heparin
      produces this side effect, but several studies in animals [ 2,3] and in humans [ 4 ] have
      shown that LMWH may induce less osteoporosis than UFH.

      Recently it was observed that heparin interferes with RANK/RANKL/POG system [5,6]. RANK,
      RANKL and OPG are members of TNF alfa receptor superfamily. The pathways involving them in
      conjunction with various cytokines and calciotrophic hormones play a pivotal role in bone
      remodelling. In addiction experimental and clinical studies established a consistent
      relationship between the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway and both skeletal lesion related to disorders
      of mineral metabolism [7,8,9] and vascular calcification [7,10]. OPG exists either as active
      soluble form or is expressed by osteoblast, stromal and cardiovascular cells, acting as decoy
      receptor that competes with RANKL for RANK.

      This interaction inhibits osteoclastic proliferation and differentiation and consequently
      prevents bone resorption . OPG is also produced by both endothelial cells (EC) and Vascular
      Smooth Muscle Cells (VSMCs ). EC-derived OPG seems to act as an important autocrine /
      paracrine factor able to protect against arterial calcification blocking the effects of RANKL
      that promotes monocytes differentiation in osteoclast -like cells and an osteogenic
      differentiation program in VSMC. This process leads to the synthesis of bone proteins and
      matrix calcification within the arterial vessel. OPG levels increase with aging and are
      higher in ESRD patient [11,12].

      Recently it was demonstrated in cultures of murine bone marrow that the heparin inhibits
      osteoprotegerin activity binding OPG competitively and in this way inhibiting the interaction
      between OPG and RANKL [5].

      On the other side heparin seems cause the mobilization of OPG into the circulation. It was
      reported that OPG is co-localized with vWF in Weibel Palade bodies in endothelial cells [13]
      and binds to Glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) at cellular membranes through its highly basic heparin
      binding domain [14,15]. Heparin treatment causes an immediate mobilization of these protein
      in to the circulation by displacement from the endothelial surface since they have higher
      affinity for heparins than GAGs at the endothelial surface[16,17]. UFH cause a more
      pronounced vascular mobilization of OPG than LMWH, indicating that UFH have an higher
      affinity for OPG than LMWH [6].
