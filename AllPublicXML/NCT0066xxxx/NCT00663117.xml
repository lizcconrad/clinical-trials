  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the opioid antagonist naltrexone will improve inflammation of the
      bowel and quality of life in subjects with active Crohn's disease compared to placebo. In
      order to test this hypothesis the following specific aims are proposed:

        1. Evaluate the effects of low dose naltrexone compared to placebo on the activity of
           Crohn's disease by the following end points: Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), pain
           assessment, laboratory values (CRP and ESR), endoscopic appearance, histology, and
           quality of life surveys;

        2. Examine the effects of naltrexone given over 3 months compared to 6 months for
           durability of response;

        3. Determine the safety and toxicity of low dose naltrexone in subjects with active Crohn's
           disease, and

        4. Study the mechanism by which naltrexone exerts its effect by measuring plasma enkephalin
           levels of subjects on therapy.

      Purpose statement: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of low dose
      naltrexone in a blinded placebo controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of this
      compound in those with active Crohn's disease.

      Study design : The study is designed as a double-blind placebo controlled study for 3 months
      followed by a pseudo cross-over such that all subjects receiving placebo the first 3 months
      will receive active drug the second 3 months and all receiving naltrexone the first 3 months
      remain on the drug the last 3 months of this 6 month study.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Achieving a 70-point Decline in CDAI Scores (Crohn's Disease Activity Index) Scores;</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI score is a number which consists of information collected from a 7-day diary from the patient regarding symptoms. It also includes objective information from the physical exam, weight and hemotocrit. Remission is considered a score of 150 or less. Active disease is considered 220 or greater. A response to therapy is considered a decline in the CDAI score of 70-points from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Between baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>IBDQ (Inflammatory bowel Disease questionnaire) contains questions about health ranging from a score of poor (i.e., 32) to excellent (i.e., 224) an increase from baseline indicates improvement in quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With a 5 Point Drop in CDEIS Score by Endoscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome was the appearance of the colonic mucosa on endoscopy using the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) score described by Mary et al. Gut 1989;30:983-989.This score ranges from 0-44 based upon the extent and severity of inflammation and ulcers seen during endoscopy of the colon. A response is a drop of &gt; 5 points from baseline. Endoscopic remission is a score of &lt; 6 and Complete endoscopic remission is a score of &gt; 3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Histology Inflammatory Score by Colon Biopsies</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Histology scores to assess microscopic inflammation and structural architecture were determined at baseline and after 12 weeks of either naltrexone therapy or placebo by mucosal biopsy samples obtained during colonoscopies.The pathology specimens were reviewed and scored by a Pathologist blinded to the treatment. The mean scores at baseline were the same between both groups.Differences between naltrexone and placebo treated subjects was assessed.The range in scores could be 0-25, with 0 representing no inflammation and 25 being maximum or severe inflammation..</description>

The response to the intervention administered is measured in the activity index and mucosal healing by colonoscopy.</description>

          <title>Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score</title>
          <description>The CDAI score is a number unit calculated from symptoms recorded by the subject over a 7-day period before each visit, weight, hemoglobin, and physical exam findings. The score ranges from 0 to 450. A score of 220 is considered 'active' disease. A score of 150 is considered &quot;remission.&quot; A drop of 70-points in the score is considered a &quot;response&quot; to therapy.</description>

It also includes objective information from the physical exam, weight and hemotocrit. Remission is considered a score of 150 or less. Active disease is considered 220 or greater. A response to therapy is considered a decline in the CDAI score of 70-points from baseline.</description>

        <description>A secondary outcome was the appearance of the colonic mucosa on endoscopy using the Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) score described by Mary et al. Gut 1989;30:983–989.This score ranges from 0-44 based upon the extent and severity of inflammation and ulcers seen during endoscopy of the colon. A response is a drop of &gt; 5 points from baseline. Endoscopic remission is a score of &lt; 6 and Complete endoscopic remission is a score of &gt; 3.</description>
        <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Sample size was calculated under the assumption that at least 60% of the naltrexone-treated patients, and no more than 10% of the placebo-treated patients, would respond with at least a 70-point decline in CDAI scores. With a 10% withdrawal rate, 40 subjects yields an 86% power using a two-sided, 0.05-significance level Fisher’s exact test.</population>
