  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to see how well the drugs 2CdA, cyclophosphamide,
      and rituximab (rituxan) shrink a lymphoma called Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. After these
      drugs are given for 2 courses, a second goal is to see how long a remission lasts. A third
      goal is to see how often repeat remissions can be achieved when the lymphoma returns later
      and the same drugs are restarted.

      This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved each of these drugs for the treatment
      of low-grade lymphoma. The combined use of these drugs for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is
      investigational, although each drug has been effective by itself for this disease. About 50
      patients will take part in this study. This study will take place only at UTMDACC (outpatient
      basis).

      Before the study starts, patients will have a complete exam. Blood and urine tests will be
      done. A bone marrow test, a chest x-ray and a CT scan of the abdomen will be done if not
      studied recently.

      Blood tests will be repeated after 14, 21, and 42 days. Provided the disease has responded,
      another bone marrow sample will be taken to confirm remission. X-rays may be repeated for the
      same reason.

      The patient or a family member will be taught to inject 2CdA under the skin three times a day
      for 7 days. The patient will also take cyclophosphamide by mouth twice each day. Rituxan will
      be given by vein once weekly for 4 weeks after a test infusion on the day prior to the first
      injection. A second course of the 3 drugs will be given about 6 weeks after the start of the
      first course. All patients with improving disease will then be followed without further
      treatment.

    <description>Response defined as at least 50% reduction of monoclonal IgM synthesis for at least two months with more than 50% reduction of tumor infiltrates at all involved sites (bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen etc.). Complete response defined as disappearance of abnormal protein by immunofixation, resolution of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, less than 20% lymphocytes in bone marrow and no evidence of monoclonal lymphocytes.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic macroglobulinemic lymphoma are eligible.
             Macroglobulinemic lymphoma includes patients with either biopsy proven small
             lymphocytic lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal IgM. Also included
             are symptomatic patients with clonal proliferation producing a pathologic monoclonal
             IgM that causes cryoglobulinemia, peripheral neuropathy or cold agglutinin hemolytic
             anemia.

          2. Patients must have adequate liver function (bilirubin &lt;2.5 mg%) and renal function
             (creatinine &lt;2.0 mg%).
