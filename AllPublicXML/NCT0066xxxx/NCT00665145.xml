      The primary and secondary objectives of this study are:

      Primary: To evaluate stem-cell-mobilization in subjects with diabetic neuropathy receiving
      SB-509. Stem cell mobilization will be assessed by evaluating the presence of stem cells
      circulating in peripheral blood.

      Secondary: To evaluate the safety of SB-509 in subjects treated with SB-509 with diabetic
      neuropathy; and to compare the effect of SB-509 versus placebo on a pre-defined
      multi-endpoint analysis that includes visual analog scale for pain intensity (VASPI), total
      neuropathy score (TNS), evoked nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and quantitative sensory
      testing (QST)

      SB-509 contains the gene (DNAâ€”a kind of biological &quot;blueprint&quot;) for a protein. When a
      researcher injects SB-509 into your legs, the drug enters the muscle and nerve cells around
      the injection site and causes these cells to make a protein. This protein causes your cells
      to increase production of another protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      which may improve the structure and function of nerves. In addition, there are changes in the
      levels of 28 additional proteins in your cells. These proteins function to promote the growth
      of cells, are structures in cells, help synthesize products, and affect immune cells, and
      some have unknown functions. This increase in your own VEGF proteins may protect and repair
      the damaged nerves caused by diabetic neuropathy.

      This study is intended to further evaluate the mechanism of SB-509 action.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I or II for at least 12 months
             prior to the study.

          -  Have received a diagnosis of sensorimotor diabetic neuropathy from a neurologist (a
             doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system) or endocrinologist (a
             doctor who specializes in diabetes).

          -  Have reduced nerve conduction velocity in any lower extremity nerve: peroneal, tibial
             or sural due to diabetic polyneuropathy

          -  If female and of childbearing potential, agree to use a medically acceptable physical
             barrier method during the study.

          -  Have blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mm Hg

          -  Body mass index (BMI) &lt; 38 kg/m2

          -  Have moderate to severe ischemic heart disease, any history of congestive heart

             amputation of the lower extremity.

          -  Have a history of cancer within the past 5 years (except for curable non-melanoma
             cancer of the skin, superficial bladder cancer in complete remission, or any other

             afterwards.
