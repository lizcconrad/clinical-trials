      Aim of the project is to assess the long-time clinical impact of surgical ablation (MAZE
      procedure) on patients who suffer from atrial fibrillation but are indicated to a cardiac
      surgery for other predominant cardiac diagnosis (heart valve surgery, coronary
      revascularization or combined surgery). In recent years, those patients are more and more
      frequently indicated to some type of MAZE procedure, without the real benefit of this
      procedure for patients has been assessed with an enough large, randomized study. Even though
      it is well known, that MAZE procedures declines the early postoperative incidence of atrial
      fibrillation, convincing data about its mid-term and long-term impact on patients and about
      the appearance of recidives of atrial fibrillation in long-time horizon are still missing.
      Our hypothesis assumes, that MAZE procedure will significantly decrease the appearance of
      atrial fibrillation one year after the operation, without increasing mortality or incidence
      of serious postoperative complications in thirty postoperative days.
