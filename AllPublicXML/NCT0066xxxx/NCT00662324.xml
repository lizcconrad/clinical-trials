  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a Question Prompt List (QPL) about clinical trials
      for cancer patients and find out what cancer patients and their caregivers think of the QPL.
      A QPL is a list of questions patients might want to ask their doctors during their
      appointments.

      We will conduct three focus groups to talk about using QPL's as a new way to recruit patients
      like you to clinical trials. The three groups will be made of patients who have and have not
      participated in clinical trials, their caregivers and doctors. This study is also being done
      to learn about how the QPL affects the question asking behavior of patients during their
      appointments with doctors at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).

During the focus group, you will discuss a Question Prompt List that will be handed out to you. You will be asked about what you think of it and if you think it would be useful if the patient you care for were ever to take part in a clinical trial sometime in the future.
