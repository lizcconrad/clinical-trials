  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. CPAP compliance will be significantly higher in both the heated humidity with
           Thermosmart™ and the nasal steroid phases compared to the double placebo phase.

        2. CPAP compliance will be comparably improved in the heated humidity with Thermosmart™
           phase versus the nasal steroid phase.

        3. Improvement in nasal symptoms in using CPAP will be significantly improved in both the
           heated humidity with Thermosmart™ and the nasal steroid phases compared to the double
           placebo phase, and comparable between the heated humidity with Thermosmart™ phase versus
           the nasal steroid phase.

        4. Secondary to improvements in CPAP compliance, measures of daytime functioning and
           quality of life will improve in the heated humidity with Thermosmart™ versus double
           placebo.

      Eligible participants will undergo this double-blind, placebo controlled, single-blind double
      placebo run-in, crossover trial to determine the efficacy of heated humidity with
      Thermosmart™ in improving compliance and nasal symptoms in patients using CPAP versus a nasal
      steroid and placebo (heated humidity, nasal steroid placebo) phases. After successful
      screening, participants will undergo a two week single-blind double placebo run-in phase
      using heated humidity and a nasal steroid placebo. The double-blind treatment phase will last
      a total of six weeks. Participants will undergo both phases: three weeks using heated
      humidity with Thermosmart™ and nasal steroid placebo and three weeks using a nasal steroid
      with a heated humidifier. Treatment phases will be counterbalanced. Study participation will
      last a total of 8 weeks from screening to completion of double-blind treatment.

    <description>To enter into the single-blind placebo phase, subjects will be setup with a Fisher &amp; Paykel 604 CPAP unit with a heated humidifier and &quot;deactivated&quot; Thermosmart™ tube, thus, only traditional heated humidity will be available. The deactivated unit will still &quot;appear&quot; to function with intact heated humidity settings. The CPAP machine will be set to the patient's prescribed pressure. Subjects will also be given a nasal steroid spray placebo and instructed to deliver one spray in each nostril daily.</description>

Subjects will now receive the Fisher &amp; Paykel 604 CPAP machine with traditional heated humidity and a deactivated Thermosmart™ tube set to their prescribed pressure. Subjects will also be given the nasal steroid Nasacort AQ (triamcinolone acetonide) at a dosage of 220 mcg. They will be instructed to deliver two sprays in each nostril daily. Once again, phone follow-up will be made 7-10 days after the visit to assess compliance with study procedures and adverse events.</description>
