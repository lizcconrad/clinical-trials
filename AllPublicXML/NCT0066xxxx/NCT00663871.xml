    <textblock>
      Omega-3 fatty acids are a certain kind of fish fat that has recently been shown to have
      health benefits. This study will examine the effectiveness of fish oil supplementation for
      reducing the early signs of heart disease risk and for improving mood, impulsivity, and anger
      levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a broad term that includes diseases that affect the heart and
      blood vessels, including coronary heart disease, heart failure, high blood pressure, and
      stroke. CVD is the leading cause of death in the United States, resulting in 700,000 deaths
      each year. Preliminary research has shown that increased consumption of fish, specifically
      the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil, has beneficial effects in people with CVD. Fish
      oil may also have positive effects on the psychological health and well-being of people with
      psychiatric disorders. However, more research is needed to confirm the positive physical and
      psychological effects of fish oil in healthy adults. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of fish oil at reducing CVD risk markers, symptoms of depression and
      antagonistic disposition, and levels of impulsivity and aggression. The study will also
      examine whether genetic variations influence the effects of fish oil on markers of
      inflammation, a characteristic of CVD.

      This study will enroll healthy adults who habitually consume low quantities of long-chain
      omega-3 fatty acids. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either fish oil
      supplements or placebo on a daily basis for 4 months. Study visits will occur at baseline and
      Months 2 and 4. At the baseline and Month 4 visits, participants will undergo blood
      collection; heart rate measurements; and interviews, psychological tests, and questionnaires
      to assess mood, disposition, impulsivity, and aggression. Additionally, medication adherence
      will be measured at the Months 2 and 4 study visits and through phone calls from study staff
      at Week 2 and Month 3.
