  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will perform a randomized, controlled trial, the primary aim of which is to assess the
      effectiveness of a behavioral-based physical activity program in the prevention and treatment
      of obesity and related co-morbid conditions in a primary care setting. We hypothesize that
      the prevention and/or reduction of obesity and related co-morbidities in patients randomized
      to an individualized education and behavior counseling group will be greater by comparison to
      those randomized to a group that receives standard care alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between 25 and 65 years of age.

          -  Sedentary lifestyle (planned physical activity for the purpose of health one day per
             week or less).

          -  Abdominally obese (waist circumference greater than 88 and 102 cm for women and men
             respectively).

          -  Weight stable (Â± 2 kg) for 6 months prior to the beginning of the study.

          -  BMI between 25 and 34.9 kg/m2 (Because a lifestyle-based intervention alone for
             obesity reduction is ideal for persons with a BMI greater less than 35, and, that 94%
             of overweight and obese Canadian adults have a BMI between 25 and 34.9 kg/m2, subjects
             with a BMI 35 or greater will be excluded).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Physical impairment which would make the intervention very difficult, or unsafe
             according to the patient's physician including history of myocardial infarction,
             stroke, coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty in the last 6 months; peripheral artery
             disease, unstable angina or ischemia, uncontrolled or insulin dependent diabetes
             mellitus.

          -  Alcohol consumption &gt; 21 drinks per week.

          -  Plans to move from the area.

          -  Participating in another research study.

          -  Clinically judged to be unsuitable for participation or adherence

          -  Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent.

          -  For women, planned pregnancy in the next 3 years.
