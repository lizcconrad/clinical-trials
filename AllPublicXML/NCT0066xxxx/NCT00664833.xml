  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, cluster-randomized, open-label flexible dose study with a 2x2
      factorial design with administration of vardenafil at a dose of 5, 10 and 20 mg doses in
      males with erectile dysfunction.The treatment period is for 12 weeks, after a 4 week
      unmedicated period for subjects taking ED medication. For ED treatment-na√Øve subjects (ie,
      previously not treated with ED medication), the unmedicated period can be only 2
      weeks.Approximately 150 investigational centres may be utilised with approximately 10
      subjects screened and entered into a 4 week treatment free period at Visit 1 to subsequently
      enroll approximately 1380 subjects to therapy. Each centre should enroll 10 subjects. Sites
      should try to recruit approximately 50% of subjects who have not previously tried oral PDE5
      inhibitor therapy for erectile dysfunction. An attempt should be made to enroll subjects
      whose partners are interested in being involved.Sites will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio
      to receive either the education intervention at the Primary care Physician (PCP) level, at
      the subject level, both levels or no intervention (usual care). The PCP education program is
      an accredited CME program and included a comprehensive overview on the screening and
      diagnosis of ED, the available treatment options and appropriate treatment selection, as well
      as subject and partner counseling. The subject education was a two-pronged approach which
      included physician-to-subject instruction and a direct-to-subject education method. After the
      unmedicated period, treatment was initiated with vardenafil 10 mg tablets for 4 weeks. This
      will be followed by a flexible dose titration period of 4 weeks during which subjects may
      maintain the previous dosage regimen or will step up to 20 mg of vardenafil or will step down
      to 5 mg vardenafil. There is a final 4 week treatment period where the previous dosage
      regimen is either maintained, increased or decreased by one step according to the three
      applicable dosage strengths of vardenafil (5, 10 or 20 mg). The highest applicable dosage
      regimen of 20 mg vardenafil will not be exceeded. A 24 hour follow-up phone call is required
      within 24 hours of the last dose of vardenafil to collect data concerning serious adverse
      events, if needed.

             sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance).

          -  Heterosexual relationship

          -  The subject must make at least four attempts at sexual intercourse (according to the
             question in the subject diary: &quot;Was sexual activity initiated with the intention of
             intercourse?&quot;) on four separate days during the untreated baseline period.

          -  At least 50% of attempts during this period must be unsuccessful, according to the
             following questions from the subject diary [at least one question should be answered
             &quot;No&quot;]: &quot;Were you able to achieve at least some erection (some enlargement of the
             penis)?&quot;, &quot;Were you able to insert your penis into your partner's vagina?&quot; and &quot;Did
             your erection last long enough for you to have successful intercourse?&quot;
