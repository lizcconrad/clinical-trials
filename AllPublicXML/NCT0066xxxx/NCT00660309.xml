    <textblock>
      The study objective was to assess the effect of single and multiple doses of aliskiren on
      renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate and to compare the effects of single and
      multiple doses of aliskiren versus captopril or irbesartan on renal blood flow, glomerular
      filtration rate, and retinal blood flow in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

        <description>Renal plasma flow (RPF) was measured by the clearance of para-aminohippurate (PAH) by autoanalyzer methods.
This maximum multiple dose effect (MDE_Max) was calculated as Day 15 peak – Day 2 baseline. Baseline RPF was determined as the median of the -10 minute, -5 minute predose and predose (0 hour) values. Peak RPF was obtained using a moving average concept.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 2: Baseline (10 minutes and 5 minutes pre-treatment and 0 hours) and Day 15: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hours post-dose.</time_frame>
        <population>Pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis set consisted of all patients with available PD data and no major protocol deviations with impact on PD data. Analysis includes patients for whom data were available.</population>

The single dose effect (SDE) for captopril, expressed as the ratio to pre-dose measurement on Day 1, = Day 1, 5 hour / Day 1 Baseline.
SDE for aliskiren and irbesartan = Day 2, 5 hour / Day 2 Baseline.
Steady state trough effect (multiple dose effect at steady state; MDE_SS) = Day 15 Baseline / Day 2 Baseline.

The single dose effect (SDE) for captopril, expressed as the ratio to pre-dose measurement on Day 1, = Day 1, 5 hour / Day 1 Baseline.
SDE for aliskiren and irbesartan = Day 2, 5 hour / Day 2 Baseline.
Steady state trough effect (multiple dose effect at steady state; MDE_SS) = Day 15 Baseline / Day 2 Baseline.
Steady State peak effect (maximum multiple dose effect; MDE_Max) = Day 15, 5 hour / Day 2 Baseline.
Accumulation of peak effect from single dose to multiple dose (MDE_Acc) = Day 15, 5 hour / Day 2, 5 hour.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Retinal Blood Flow After Aliskiren or Irbesartan</title>
        <description>Retinal blood flow was assessed using the laser Doppler technique. The blood flow in the superior temporal retinal artery in one of the eyes of each study participant was determined.
The Single dose effect of aliskiren or irbesartan was measured as the change/difference between Day 2 and baseline measurements.
The Multiple dose effect of aliskiren or irbesartan wsas measured as the change/difference between Day 15 and Day 2 measurements</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 2 and Day 15.</time_frame>
        <population>PD analysis set. This assessment was only conducted at sites with available Canon Laser Blood Flowmeter. The number of patients with data available included in each analysis is indicated by 'N' [Aliskiren, Irbesartan].</population>
