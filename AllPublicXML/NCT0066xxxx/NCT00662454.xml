    <textblock>
      The purpose of the blood spot validation portion of the study is to test if measuring female
      hormone levels in the blood is as accurate through a finger stick, as it is by a blood draw
      from a vein. The purpose of the feasibility study is to evaluate ovulation occurrence in two
      populations of oral contraceptive users: heavier and lighter women.

      The blood spot validation portion of the study tests the hypothesis that progesterone assays
      from self-collected daily blood spots are equivalent to serum samples, and that the values
      obtained can identify women that ovulate. After validating collection methods, enrollment
      will begin for the feasibility portion of the study looking at thin and heavy women on birth
      control pills. All women in this portion of the study will take a very-low dose birth control
      pill that is normally available through a doctor's office. During each month of the study,
      women will have their blood pressure and weight recorded, and have their blood drawn twice
      per week or use a finger stick kit daily at home to check for the natural hormones and brain
      chemicals that tells if an egg develops. During the last week of each menstrual cycle (period
      week), women will also have their blood drawn to measure the levels of hormone found in the
      birth control pill. Women will also need to report in a written diary that they have taken
      their birth control pill for the day.
