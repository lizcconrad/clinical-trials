    <textblock>
      A randomised, cross-over trial targeting a small sample of older (age 45-65 years) overweight
      adults with type 2 diabetes the aims of this pilot study are to:

        1. Determine the feasibility of investigating the acute effects of prolonged sedentary
           behaviour (sitting) in this target group.

        2. Compare the acute effects of a single prolonged (8 hour) bout of sedentary behaviour
           (sitting) on glucose and triglyceride concentrations and key muscle and adipose
           regulatory enzymes to a similar bout of sedentary behaviour combined with intermittent
           bouts of light-intensity activity.

      The proposed study will involve a randomised cross-over experimental trial conducted in the
      laboratory setting in older overweight adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants will receive
      both of the acute testing conditions in a randomised manner.

      Study design: Randomised cross-over pilot trial of 20 overweight/obese older adults with
      diet-controlled type 2 diabetes involving 2 acute treatment conditions, with a one-week
      wash-out period between testing conditions (Figure 1 a).

      Setting: Acute, supervised laboratory setting within the Alfred and Baker Heart Institute
      Medical Unit.

      Outcomes: We will measure acute responses in laboratory-measured plasma glucose &amp;
      triglyceride levels (every 60 mins) and glucose concentrations determined from continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGMS).
