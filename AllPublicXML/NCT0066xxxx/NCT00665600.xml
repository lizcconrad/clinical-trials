      This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled,
      parallel-group study of adult subjects with COPD. Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled
      to randomize at least 200 subjects. Study participation will consist of a total of six study
      visits over nine weeks for each subject. This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In
      October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010,
      Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
