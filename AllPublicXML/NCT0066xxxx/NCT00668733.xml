      The objective of this study was to obtain long-term sustained clearance rates for subjects
      previously treated with imiquimod creams in studies GW01-0702, GW01-0703, GW01-0704 and
      GW01-0705.

      This is a Phase 3 longitudinal and observational study. Subjects who previously enrolled in
      studies GW01-0702, GW01-0703, GW01-0704, and GW01-0705 and were completely cleared of their
      AK lesions in the selected treatment area at the end-of-study visit will return for follow-up
      visits at 6 and 12 months after the EOS visit or until a recurrence of AKs.

      The NCT numbers for the above mentioned studies are:

      NCT00603798 - for Studies GW01-0703 and GW01-0705
