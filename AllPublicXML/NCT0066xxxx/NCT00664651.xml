  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary research question is to find out whether there is a genetic component to the
      development of joint contractures following knee surgery, through the application of lab
      techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After total knee replacement surgery, some people develop joint stiffness, which is also
      called a joint contracture. Contractures cause the envelope of the knee (called the capsule)
      to stiffen and become rigid so the patient can no longer move their knee the way they used
      to. After stretching and other exercises, only a surgery can try and divide or remove the
      contracture. The main purpose of this research is to study the cause of the contracture and
      specifically if certain people are predisposed to contractures.
