  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the infrastructure for a national neuropathic pain database.

      To determine the longterm outcome of the management of chronic neuropathic pain including
      pain relief, disability, and quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The database will provide standard information on demographics, diagnosis, treatment
      interventions and outcome modeled on guidelines from the expert panel on initiatives on
      Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT)(Turk et al.,Pain
      2003;106:337-345) The IMMPACT panel determined that patients should be evaluated according to
      six core domains as follows: Pain, physical functioning, emotional functioning, subject
      rating of global satisfaction with treatment, symptoms and adverse events and subject
      disposition.

      The database will allow us to examine outcomes based on single (eg. pregabalin) and multiple
      (e.g tricyclic antidepressants and gabalin) therapeutic interventions. Standard guidelines
      for management of neuropathic pain acknowledge that polypharmacy is appropriate when
      individual first line treatments fail to provide adequate pain relief (Gilron I et al., CMAJ
      2006; 175: 265-275; Attal N et al., European Journal of Neurology 2006; 13: 1153-1169)
