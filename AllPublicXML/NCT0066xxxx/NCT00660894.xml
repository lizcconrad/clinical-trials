      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tegafur-uracil, leucovorin, and S-1, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving tegafur-uracil together with
      leucovorin is more effective than giving S-1 in treating patients with stage III colon
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving tegafur-uracil together with
      leucovorin to see how well it works compared with giving S-1 in treating patients with stage
      III colon cancer that has been completely removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients with stage III colon cancer treated with
           S-1 or tegafur-uracil and leucovorin after curative surgery .

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tegafur-uracil and oral leucovorin 3 times daily on days
           1-21. The treatment repeats 5 times every 5 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral S-1 twice daily on days 1-28. The treatment repeats 4
           times every 6 weeks.

      Biological samples are collected for gene expression analysis for identification of
      predictive markers.
