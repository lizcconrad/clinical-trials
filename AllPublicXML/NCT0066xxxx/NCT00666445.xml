  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypothesis that the Synchronous Neural Interaction™ Test
      is useful for diagnosing Probable Alzheimer's Disease according to standard criteria.
      Subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease as well as age-matched normal control subjects
      will be evaluated for symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease and those meeting inclusion criteria
      will undergo a brief, non-invasive scan of brain function using a magnetoencephalography
      (MEG). The scan itself lasts 1 minute while the subject is asked to stare at a dot projected
      in front of them on a video screen. Orasi Medical believes that patterns of brain activity
      measured at rest are indicative of Alzheimer's Disease pathology.

      The protocol is amended to add a follow-up assessment for previously enrolled and completed
      subjects who agree to participate in the follow-up assessment approximately 9 - 15 months
      after initial study enrollment. Subjects who agree to participate in the follow-up assessment
      will undergo the same standardized tests and MEG scan procedure as completed in the initial
      study.

             Parkinsonism.

          4. Show prominent changes in personality or social conduct prior to the onset of
             prominent cognitive dysfunction

          5. Have a Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale score of greater than 4

          6. Have a history of primary psychotic disorder (e.g schizophrenia, schizoaffective
             disorder, delusional disorder) or bipolar disorder

          7. Have a lifetime or current history of alcohol or substance abuse/dependence

          8. Have had an MRI two weeks prior to completing the MEG scan

          9. Have metal braces or pacemaker that may interfere with the MEG scan

         10. Are unable to complete the MEG scan procedure

        Follow-up Assessment Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who completed Protocol ADG 08-01 will be contacted and invited to participate in
        the follow-up assessment.
