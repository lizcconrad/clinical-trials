    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is a phantom auditory perception of meaningless sound, meaning that there is
      registration of sound in the absence of an external or internal acoustic stimulus. It is a
      common problem (prevalence 7-19%) which may interfere with the ability to lead a normal life.
      Unfortunately, it is a very difficult symptom to treat because there are hardly any
      therapeutic options for the cause of tinnitus. Most therapies focus on alleviating the
      condition rather than treating the cause. Tinnitus is thought to be generated in the brain,
      as a result of functional reorganization of auditory neural pathways and tonotopic maps in
      the central auditory system, following damage to the peripheral auditory system. Repetitive
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a therapy, based on this concept of
      reorganization in the auditory cortex. It uses a pulsed magnetic field to disrupt the neural
      circuit and to thereby (temporarily) excite or inhibit certain brain areas, leading to the
      suppression of tinnitus.

    <description>Neuronavigated rTMS will be applied bilaterally to the auditory cortices, which will be identified through a structural MRI scan. Stimulation will be performed with 1 Hz frequency and an intensity of 110% motor threshold for 2000 stimuli (32 minutes) on each side, on five subsequent days.</description>
