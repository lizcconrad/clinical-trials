  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AC-1202 (Ketasyn) is a nutritional beverage currently being studied in neurodegenerative
      conditions including Alzheimer's disease. The current study is a randomized, open-label trial
      to compare the safety, tolerability, and PK profiles of 3 formulations of Ketasyn
      administered on a daily basis for 14 days, with and without a 7-day titration period, in
      normal, healthy elderly volunteers.

      Sixty healthy, elderly volunteers between the ages of 55 and 85 will be enrolled at one of
      four clinical sites in the Tampa/St. Petersburg area. Subjects with a history of GI
      inflammatory conditions (e.g., IBS or diverticulitis) or other clinically significant
      abnormalities will be excluded from enrollment. Subjects will be randomized to one of two
      dosing regimens (with or without a 7-day titration period) and to one of three formulations
      of Ketasyn containing the identical amount of active ingredient, but different amounts of
      proteins and carbohydrates. Subjects assigned to Group 1 will receive 10 grams active
      ingredient daily on Days 1-7, followed by a daily dose of 20 grams active ingredient on Days
      8-14. Subjects assigned to Group 2 will receive 20 grams active ingredient on Days 1-14. All
      subjects will have clinic visits on Day 1 and 14; subjects assigned to Group 1 will also have
      a clinic visit on Day 8. Subjects will fast prior to each clinic visit and have vital signs
      and routine lab tests performed prior to dosing. A standard breakfast will be served along
      with the study product, following which blood samples will be collected for product
      concentration levels.
