      This pilot study will examine one issue only in weight loss - food cravings in overweight
      (i.e. BMI between 25-29.9) or obese (BMI greater than 30) consumers. Food craving is
      hypothesized to be an important intervening causal variable and the development of obesity.

      This randomized clinical trial will explore whether a relatively under researched energy
      based therapeutic procedure, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), can reduce food cravings in
      participants under laboratory-controlled conditions, and compare this to a waitlist group.
      The following foods will be tested: chocolate, salty foods (e.g. chips, crisps, salted nuts),
      sweet carbohydrate foods (eg. cakes, biscuits, soft/soda drinks), carbohydrate foods which
      are neither sweet nor salty such as white refined foods such as bread), and caffeinated
      items.

      Research examining energy based procedures (e.g. EFT) combines cognitive strategies with
      somatic procedures adapted from acupuncture and related systems for altering the cognitive,
      behavioural, and neurochemical foundations of psychological problems. It is often referred to
      as &quot;psychological acupuncture&quot;. Few adequately controlled studies have been conducted on EFT
      however acupuncture has been quite extensively studied, with hundreds of research reports
      published (see attached references).

      Screening will occur over the telephone with one of the chosen self report questionnaires -
      the Food Craving Inventory (FCI; White et al., 2002). The FCI is a reliable and valid measure
      for the assessment of cravings for specific types of foods: High Fats, Sweets,
      Carbohydrates/Starches, and Fast Food Fats, all of which comprise the higher order construct
      of &quot;food craving&quot; or the FCI Total score (White et al., 2002). Higher numbers for each of the
      subscales reflect greater cravings for that food type with the highest score being 185.
      Scores of 93 or higher during the screen will be used to admit subjects to the next
      diagnostic interview phase of the trial. In addition, subjects will be asked their weight and
      height in order to ascertain their BMI and this will be confirmed in the diagnostic interview
      with a standardized weight machine.

      The Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-II; Spitzer, Williams, Gibbon, &amp; First, 1990) has 12
      groups of questions corresponding to12 personality disorders and will be used as a diagnostic
      tool in a face-to-face interview with subjects who are suitable from the telephone screen.
      The aim is to exclude any active diagnoses from the DSM-IV in order to obtain the purest non
      clinic sample possible. All subjects will be notified by letter of the outcome of their
      diagnostic interview and those unsuitable for the trial will be told they did not meet
      selection criteria. Suitable practitioners who would be able to provide individual support
      for the food cravings will be provided in written format. Subjects who meet a diagnostic
      category will be informed of this and appropriate referral will be offered.

      Participants will be randomly assigned (using the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre service) to a
      free group EFT treatment condition or a non treatment waitlist control condition of the same
      duration (4 weeks). This design ensures that potential treatment gains are neither due to the
      mere passage of time nor regression to the mean. To limit attrition from waitlist conditions,
      several contacts will be made with the waiting clients. Prescheduled phone contacts, for
      example, may maintain adherence to the waitlist condition.

      Prior to treatment all subjects will be weighed and height measured for their BMI status and
      food craving outcome measures (pre, post and follow-up) will be measured using:

        1. SUDS rating (subjective) in daily food diaries (food diaries were chosen as a method
           that best measures real-life eating behaviour)

        2. Power of Food Scale (Didie, 2003)

        3. Food Craving Inventory (White et al., 2002)

      Three aspects of eating behaviour will be measured using the Revised Restraint Scale (Herman
      &amp; Polivy, 1980). The items are summed for a total score that ranges from 0 to 40. High scores
      indicate chronic dieting in which the individual is constantly cycling on and off the diet,
      typically without any substantial weight loss. Dietary restraint appears to play a causal
      role in the development of eating disorders and obesity and loss of control over intake. Food
      cravings may trigger these eating behaviours.

      The Symptom Assessment 45 (SA-45, Strategic Advantage, 1998) will be used to assess
      symptomatology across nine psychiatric domains and as measures of the outcome of the
      psychological intervention.

      Demographic information will be collected in questionnaire format at the beginning of the
      study.

      The EFT intervention will consist of 4 sessions (2 hours duration) with homework and will be
      based on standard delivery of EFT, as per founder Gary Craig's training for level 1 EFT
      certification ( see http://www.emofree.com/WorkShop/workshop-guidelines.htm#Level%201).

      Participants will be recruited through community announcements in print advertisements,
      radio, and television. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be highlighted in the
      advertising. Criteria will consist of: participants being (l) over 18 years old and under 60
      years and not suffering any severe psychological impairment, (2) not currently receiving
      treatment (psychological or medical) for their food cravings, (3) agree to be contacted for
      follow-up testing. Women and men will be included, and (4) active diagnoses from the SCID II
      and subjects taking 'heavy' psychotropic (see attached list) which can suppress feelings,
      cravings and sensitivity will be excluded.

      Known sufferers of diabetes (Type I and II) and hypoglycemia will be excluded due to any
      physiological aetiology (effects related) to food cravings.

      Eligible applicants will be offered participation in the study through an informed consent
      procedure. Self report questionnaires will be issued as part of the study and a demographic
      questionnaire will be included in this. All identifying information will be destroyed once
      data has been analysed.

      Unsuitable participants will be advised in letter form that they did not meet selection
      criteria, and a list of suitable practitioners will be included should they wish to address
      their food craving.The study will use a Research Assistant to screen participants, administer
      questionnaires and collate data. Separate qualified clinicians to the investigating
      researchers will be used to deliver the EFT treatment condition.

      The treatments will be delivered in a number of appropriate venues. Analysis will examine pre
      versus post effects for each intervention to highlight any differences in self report, and a
      repeated measures ANOVA will examine the effect of time on all the self report scores.

      The following questions will be addressed: does EFT reduce food cravings and weight more than
      no intervention? It is anticipated that because this is a pilot study, results may indicate
      positive direction for these questions only. Due to anecdotal suggestion that EFT has long
      lasting effects (see http://www.emofree.com/articles.aspx?id=19), it is hypothesised that
      food cravings will reduce significantly with the EFT intervention and remain consistent at
      follow-up points. It is expected that the waitlist condition will remain unaffected prior to
      any treatment condition. Increases in eating restraint and decreases in SUDS ratings and
      general psychopathology are expected with the EFT intervention post treatment and are
      expected to stay constant at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up. Gender and age will be examined.

      A standard process will be used for informed consent, including a general information sheet
      for subjects and consent form indicating any areas of psychological risk, benefits of the
      study, self report questionnaire details and follow-up procedures. Detailed information about
      what constitutes a food craving will be given to all subjects as well as information about
      voluntary involvement and study withdrawal.
