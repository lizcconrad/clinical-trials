      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of paricalcitol in
      participants with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) undergoing
      hemodialysis who are resistant to treatment with calcitriol.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, open label, one arm, phase IV study designed to
      demonstrate paricalcitol efficacy and safety in the treatment of moderate to severe secondary
      hyperparathyroidism in calcitriol resistant participants on dialysis.

      Following screening, participants began an 8-week controlled calcitriol therapy period.
      Participants whose parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels decreased were to be discontinued from
      the study. Those whose PTH levels did not decrease began paricalcitol therapy using a dose
      calculated by 0.04 to 0.1 microgram per kilogram (mcg/kg). Paricalcitol was administered
      intravenously at anytime during the subjects' dialysis. The paricalcitol dose was to be
      titrated every 2 weeks until iPTH was reduced or up to 4 months, after which it was to be
      adjusted monthly for 1 year based on serum PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and albumin
      measurements.

            <description>To confirm this resistance, participants began a controlled calcitriol therapy period. After this period, participants whose parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were not reduced according to parameters in protocol were to begin a paricalcitol titration period of up to 4 months, followed by paricalcitol therapy for up to 1 year.</description>
