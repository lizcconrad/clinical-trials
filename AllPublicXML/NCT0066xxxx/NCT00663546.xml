      This study, conducted by the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control
      of Cambodia s Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
      Diseases, will explore whether the following factors confer protection against malaria and
      associated anemia: certain blood groups, the hemoglobin E variant, G6PD-deficiency and
      alpha-thalassemia. Malaria is caused by parasites (P. falciparum and P. vivax) that are
      transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. This protocol includes two studies, a cohort
      study and a P. vivax collection study.

      Individuals are eligible for enrollment in the studies as follows:

      Cohort study:

      Residents of all ages of Kandal, Ekapheap and Sangkumthmey villages (Thmar Da commune) who
      plan to remain in Thmar Da commune for the next 5 years.

      P. vivax collection study:

      2 years of age and older

      Participating in NIAID protocol 05-I- N210 ( Severe Malaria and Anti-malarial Drug Resistance
      in Cambodia ) and diagnosed with P. vivax malaria

      Participants undergo the following procedures:

      Cohort study:

      Baseline evaluation, including the following:

        -  Collection of demographic information

        -  Malaria history, temperature measurement and review of current symptoms, if any

        -  Blood draw of 300 microliters

        -  Additional blood draw of 10 milliliters in selected adults 18 years of age and older

      Treatment with artesunate-piperaquine at a commune health post for subjects who develop
      malaria

      Contact once a year for 5 years to determine continued residency in Thmar Da commune

      P. vivax collection study:

        -  Medical history and physical examination

        -  Hemoglobin level measurement

        -  Blood draw

        -  Treatment with chloroquine

        -  Blood draw 3 to 5 weeks after treatment in some patients 18 years of age or older

      Cohort study. Hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cell (RBC) polymorphisms that give rise to HbE,
      alpha-thalassemia, G6PD-deficiency, and ABO blood groups occur at high frequency along the
      Thailand-Cambodia border, where Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum have been and continue to
      be transmitted. To determine whether these Hb/RBC polymorphisms have been naturally selected
      because they confer protection against malaria and malaria-associated anemia, we will conduct
      a cohort study of ethnic Khmer in Cambodia. Approximately 1000 individuals of all ages will
      be genotyped for the four polymorphisms listed above and then followed for 5 years to
      determine the mean incidence rates for both P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria, stratified by
      genotype. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) will be calculated for each polymorphism relative to
      the wildtype genotype. Differences between Hb levels during acute episodes of malaria and Hb
      levels at baseline will also be calculated to determine if Hb/RBC polymorphisms influence the
      degree of malaria-associated anemia.

      P. vivax collection study. Unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax cannot be efficiently cultivated in
      vitro. Improved cultivation methods are needed to make progress on nearly all aspects of P.
      vivax malariology, including pathogenesis, naturally-acquired immunity, vaccination, and
      antimalarial drug resistance. We plan to improve both short- and long-term cultivation
      methods in order to test various hypotheses of P. vivax pathogenesis and protection. Using
      freshly obtained parasite isolates from individuals with P. vivax malaria, we will test
      whether Hb/RBC polymorphisms influence potentially pathogenic properties of P. vivax
      parasites, such as their ability to bind non-infected RBCs and other host cells. It is
      believed that P. vivax selectively invades reticutocytes. This tropism has frustrated
      attempts at long-term cultivation of this parasite, which requires a constant source of
      reticulocyte-rich blood not easily obtained even in developed countries. The host
      reticulocyte receptor that mediates the highly selective tropism of P. vivax has not been
      identified. Fresh P. vivax parasites will also be used in in vitro experiments to identify
      the putative receptor that defines reticulocyte tropism. Any P. vivax ligand that bound
      selectively to a reticulocyte receptor will then be discovered and worked up as a promising
      vaccine candidate.
