  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new couple-based
      intervention for women with recently diagnosed, early stage breast cancer and their spouses
      or male partners. This cancer-focused relationship enhancement intervention adapts
      well-validated cognitive-behavioral interventions to teach patients and partners specific
      relationship skills, such as problem-solving skills, communication, and maximizing positive
      interactions, that they can use in addressing breast cancer. This project's major goals are
      to improve the patient's individual functioning and specific aspects of the couple's
      relationship affected by breast cancer (e.g., mood, role functioning, sexual functioning, and
      social support). In the current investigation, cancer-focused relationship enhancement will
      be compared to (a) a couple-based Cancer Education intervention and (b) a Treatment-as-Usual
      condition.
