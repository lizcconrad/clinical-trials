             irradiated will not be considered target lesions unless increase in size has been
             observed following completion of radiation therapy.

             metastatic disease settings.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          <description>Sunitinib was administered orally from Day 1 at the starting dose of 37.5 mg/day on a continuous daily dosing schedule in 21-day cycles. Capecitabine was administered orally from Days 1 to 14 every 21 days at a starting dose of 2,000 mg/m^2/day. Participants were monitored for toxicity, and sunitinib and/or capecitabine dosing could be interrupted or reduced according to individual tolerance. Participants with progressive disease (PD) or intolerable toxicity were considered for discontinuation from the study.</description>
