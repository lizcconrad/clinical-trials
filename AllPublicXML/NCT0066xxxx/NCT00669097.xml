  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase l study to examine Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion of
      TKI258. There are 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 (4 patients) will receive single radio-labeled 500mg
      dose of TKI258 followed after 15 days by daily dosing of 400mg TKI258. Cohort 2 (9 patients)
      will receive 400mg TKI258.
