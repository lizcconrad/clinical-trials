  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography are two imaging methods that are used
      to obtain pictures of the heart and assess heart function. This study will evaluate a new,
      four-dimensional echocardiography approach of obtaining heart images to determine if it is as
      effective at evaluating heart function as MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MRI is a non-invasive method of obtaining images of the body. An MRI is conducted by having a
      person lie down on a narrow table, which then slides into a large tunnel-like tube. Powerful
      magnets and radio waves scan the body and a computer records the resulting signals. An
      echocardiography is a non-invasive ultrasound test that uses sound waves to create images of
      the heart. It is performed by having a doctor move a wand-like device over a patient's chest.
      The device then converts sound waves into pictures of the heart. Currently, a special MRI
      technique is used to evaluate heart function; however, MRI is expensive and cannot be used on
      critically ill patients. Echocardiography can be performed at a patient's bedside and it may
      be a more effective way of assessing heart function. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effectiveness of a new four-dimensional echocardiography approach at evaluating
      heart function. Results from this study may be used to diagnose and treat patients more
      effectively in the future.

      This study will enroll healthy people who do not have heart disease and people who are
      receiving chemotherapy who do not have heart disease. Participants will have a physical
      examination and a medical records review. MRI scans and a four-dimensional echocardiography
      of the heart will be performed. There will be no additional study visits.

        Participants will consist of two groups:

          1. Normal volunteers will be recruited through the use of an approved study recruitment
             flyer.

          2. Chemotherapy patients will be approached at the time of their nuclear scan to rule out
             cardiac disease prior to chemotherapy. These patients will be referred to the study by
             their doctor for the assessment of heart function.
