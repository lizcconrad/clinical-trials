      This study proposes to transfer marker genes (detectable genetic traits or segments of DNA
      that can be identified and tracked) into aliquots of marrow obtained for Bone Marrow
      Transplant (BTM) in patients in remission of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).

      The primary objective of this study was to estimate the continuous complete remission rate at
      2 years post transplant for children with AML in first complete remission treated with
      autologous BMT.

      Secondary objectives used transduction of marker genes into autologous marrow to determine
      the following:

        1. whether the source of relapse after BMT for AML is residual malignant cells in the
           harvested marrow or in the patient, and whether marrow purging is therefore rational.

        2. whether the majority of AML, which lack genetic markers, represent abnormalities in a
           multi-lineage progenitor cell, and whether therefore, auto grafting/intensified
           chemotherapy is ever likely to augment the cure rate.

        3. the mechanisms of autologous reconstitution, and the effects of stimuli which modify the
           process.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged between 1 and 18 years at diagnosis with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia
             in first remission are eligible for this protocol.
