    <textblock>
      Prevention of HIV-1 transmission from mother-to-child by non-breast-feeding is complicated by
      increased infant mortality in developing countries. However, extensive counselling about
      formula feeding turned out safe in Vietnam, a middle-income country.Extensive counselling
      together with formula feeding and antiretroviral therapy reduced vertical transmission of
      HIV-1 considerably.

      Observation 135 HIV mother to check up and delivery in the Obstetric and Gynecology in two
      big city in Northern Vietnam (Hanoi and Haiphong)and follow up their children from the birth
      to 18 months. They were provide the antiretroviral by the National program for prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission of HIV, also the counseling estimates 6 hours for each
      mother-child pair while study progressing. Using the Nested PCR to diagnosis HIV infected in
      the children in difference time point before 18 months. Our Outcome are

        -  The rate of HIV transmission form mother to child in our study is 6,7%(9?135). In utero
           is 1,5% and 5% in gestation.

        -  Sixty-nine percent of HIV pregnant women were get antiretroviral. Most of them (84%) get
           nevirapine at delivery (6 children HIV infected). The rest get triple antiretroviral(2
           infected child).

        -  Selective cesarean section not comment for HIV pregnant women.

        -  Non breast feeding were recommended and all mothers chose formula feeding to their child
           so that we had no data for transmission by breast milk.

        -  Two HIV infected child die before 18months versus non die in uninfected child.

        -  CD4 T cell count lower than 200/microliter were observed dominate in mother infected
           child.

      Peripheral EDTA blood samples were collected from the child at birth (1-2 days), at 1, 3, 6,
      12, and 18 months of age and processed at the Molecular Laboratory in the Hanoi Obstetric and
      Gynaecology hospital. The maternal blood samples were taken at the same day as the first
      sample of their child. Three ml EDTA blood was taken from the mother and 2 ml from the child.
      The blood was processed within 8 hours. Cells and plasma were stored separately at - 20
      Celcius degree.

        HIV-1 infected pregnant women were identified in the Obstetric and Gynaecology hospitals in
        Hanoi (2004-2007) and Haiphong (2006-2007).

        They were encouraged to participate in a prospective study with regular clinical follow up
        of their children from birth to 12-18 months of age. All participants signed an informed
        consent.
