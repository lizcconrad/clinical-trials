    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tri-Luma® Cream (fluocinolone acetonide
      0.01%, hydroquinone 4%, tretinoin 0.05%) when used sequentially with a series of intense
      pulsed light (IPL) treatments in Subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe melasma during a
      10 week treatment period.
