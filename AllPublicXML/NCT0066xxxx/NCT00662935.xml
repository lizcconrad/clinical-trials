    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS)
      in chronic and treatment-resistant CH. Inclusion criteria are: patients with chronic CH
      (&gt;3years), with daily attack and non response to adequate treatment. Electrodes are implanted
      stereotactically in the postero-inferior hypothalamus. In this crossover, randomized,
      placebo-controlled double-blinded study, the efficacy of DBS is evaluated using comparison of
      two one-month sequences: one with stimulation &quot;on&quot; and the other with stimulation &quot;off&quot;
      (placebo sequence). Efficacy is defined as ≥50% decrease of weekly frequency of CH attacks.
      After the randomized period, long-term efficacy and safety are evaluated after one year of
      stimulation in open conditions.

    <textblock>
      Over the past 7 years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used in various centres to treat
      patients with intractable chronic cluster headache (CH). Results in these non-controlled
      studies were encouraging but need to be confirmed in controlled conditions. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DBS in chronic and treatment-resistant CH, in
      randomized placebo-controlled conditions.

      Inclusion criteria are: patients with chronic CH (&gt;3years), with daily attack and non
      response to adequate treatment (verapamil up 960 mg/d, lithium with plasmatic level 0.6-1
      mEq/ ml, and association of both drugs). After induction of local anaesthesia, electrodes are
      implanted stereotactically in the postero-inferior hypothalamus according to the previously
      described coordinates, and connected to a sub-cutaneous generator. In this crossover,
      randomized, placebo-controlled double-blinded study, the efficacy of DBS is evaluated using
      comparison of two one-month sequences: one with stimulation &quot;on&quot; and the other with
      stimulation &quot;off&quot; (considered as the placebo sequence). Primary efficacy is defined as ≥50%
      decrease of weekly frequency of CH attacks, compared to a prospective run-in pre-implantation
      period. Safety and tolerability are clinically and biologically assessed. After the
      randomized period, long-term efficacy and safety are evaluated after one year of stimulation
      in open conditions.
