      The purpose of this study is to determine if ACR16 is effective and safe in the symptomatic
      treatment of Huntington's disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective in the present study is to confirm whether ACR16 is efficacious in
      improving voluntary motor function in Huntington's disease, symptoms that seem to be most
      important for the functional disability associated with the disorder. To achieve this,
      patients are randomised to ACR16 45mg qd, ACR16 45mg bd, or placebo treatment in equal
      proportions in a parallel design for treatment duration of 26 weeks.

             history and/or the presence of ≥ 36 CAG repeats in the Huntington gene.

          -  Male or female age ≥ 30 years.

             dosing of medication must have been kept constant for at least 6 weeks before
             randomisation.
