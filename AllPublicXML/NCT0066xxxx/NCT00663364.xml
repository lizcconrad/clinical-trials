    <textblock>
      Dry skin is a physiological condition and is characterized in contrast to greasy skin by
      roughness, desquamation and lack of brightness of the skin surface. Subjectively, feelings of
      tension, burning and itching can occur. Dry skin needs special care due to its structural and
      functional characteristics.We monitor an application test the Dermatocosmetics Oilatum
      Physiogel AI Lotion and Physiogel Lotion. This is to be accomplished with patients having dry
      skin. The influence on the roughness of skin, desquamation, feeling of tingle, burning and
      itching should be documented. If sleep quality is disturbed by tingle or itch, this will be
      monitored, too.

      The included patients use the lotion twice daily for a two-week period. If not sufficient it
      can be continued up to a four-weeks period. Additionally, the patient receives a
      documentation sheets to note several parameters. In a sensory assessment, product specific
      parameter such as spreadability, permeability, lubricating, smell of lotion and cosmetic
      acceptance during the treatment will be assessed (at the beginning, after 2 weeks, after 4
      weeks, 2 weeks after stopping treatment). After four weeks the skin care measurement will be
      terminated and the patient can continue with a treatment of his choice. A monitoring of at
      least 50 patients per preparation is intended.
