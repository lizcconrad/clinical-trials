  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if 8-week dietary treatment with the omega-3 fatty
      acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) improves attention performance and associated cortical
      activity and metabolism in 8 - 10 year old males that were not breast-fed during infancy.
