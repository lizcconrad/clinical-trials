    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the investigational
      radioisotope Radium-223, Xofigo (Alpharadin), in treatment of men with prostate cancer and
      bone metastases that no longer respond to hormonal treatment.

    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate whether there is a dose-response relationship for
      radium-223 in patients with painful bone metastases secondary to prostate carcinoma regarding
      palliation of bone pain. The palliative efficacy will be established through assessments of
      bone pain and consumption of analgesia. Furthermore, the aim is to find the most efficient
      dose with an acceptable safety profile. The safety will be assessed through measurements of
      adverse events, and acute haematological toxicity during the study period. Long-term chronic
      toxicity, and the overall survival at one and two years post treatment will also be assessed.

      This is a double-blind, dose-response, randomized, multi-centre phase II efficacy and safety
      study of radium- 223. The clinical sites will enroll a total of 100 eligible patients. The
      treatment is a single intravenous administration of radium-223.

      The target population is patients suffering from bone pain due to skeletal metastasis
      secondary to hormone refractory prostate cancer.
