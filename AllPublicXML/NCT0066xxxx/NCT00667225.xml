  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The University of North Carolina Department of Dermatology is conducting a clinical trial to
      evaluate a drug called cantharidin in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum is a
      common dermatologic disorder caused by a poxvirus. Molluscum typically presents with many
      flesh-colored bumps on the skin. It goes away on its own, though can last several months to
      several years. Cantharidin is a topical medicine which is applied at the clinic visit. It is
      well tolerated by the majority of children.

    <description>Cantharidin's vehicle is composed of: Hydroxypropylcellulose, Acetone, and Collodion Flexible. The vehicle will be topically applied to molluscum lesions at each visit. Only two lesions will be treated at the first visit, and up to 20 lesions can be treated at subsequent visits.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this arm will receive cantharidin at all visits. At the first visit, up to 2 lesions can have application with cantharidin. All other visits will have up to 20 lesions with application of the cantharidin. During every visit, lesions will be counted and subjects will be assessed for any adverse events.</description>

Up to 2 lesions were treated on the first visit, and up to 20 lesions were treated on subsequent visits. Parents were instructed to wash the area 4 hours after application.</description>
