      Primary objective: Evaluation of the safety of Seretide discus administration in subjects
      with COPD. Treatment duration: 2 years. Study has 3 phases: Screening phase (visit 1),
      treatment phase (visits 2-5. In the case of AE, there will be another visit (visit 6) as a
      follow up visit - follow up phase.

        Planned: 1000 / Recruited: 771 / Analyzed: 771 A target enrolment of approximately 1000
        subjects is planned, at outpatient sites. Any subject with COPD who has an indication to
