    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to demonstrate that 100 mg of oral minocycline twice daily reduces
      the conversion of CIS to McDonald Criteria MS (McDMS) by an absolute 25% as compared to
      placebo, over a 6 month follow-up period (primary outcome).

      A key secondary outcome is to confirm that this early treatment benefit is maintained at two
      years.

      -  Minocycline 100 mg bid orally compared to identical placebo

        -  Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS): Patients with a first clinical demyelinating event
           suggestive of multiple sclerosis (At baseline participants may meet 2010 McDonald
           diagnostic criteria for MS, but not 2005 criteria)

        -  Men and women, aged 18-60y, first event within the previous 180 days; brain magnetic
           resonance imaging (MRI) with at least two brain T2 lesions which are at least 3 mm in
           diameter, and at least one of which is ovoid or periventricular or infratentorial.

        -  Up to 24 months of study drug (Up to 12 months of study drug for patients recruited
           after December 31, 2012)

        -  Patients will be discontinued from the study when they convert to McDMS based on the
           2005 McDonald definition.

        -  12 Canadian MS Clinics

        -  A total of 154 patients will be randomized. Because 30% of screened patients with CIS
           who are clinically eligible are not expected to meet the MRI criteria for inclusion, up
           to 280 patients will be screened.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 18 and 60 years.

          -  First focal clinical episode suggestive of demyelinating disease within the previous
             180 days (measured from onset of the first symptom to treatment start), based on the
             appearance of a neurological abnormality, present for at least 24 hours.

          -  Objective clinical evidence must be present or documented. Patients will be included
             irrespective of whether the first clinical demyelinating episode was monosymptomatic
             (i.e. clinical evidence of a single lesion) or polysymptomatic (i.e. clinical evidence
             of more than one lesion).

          -  At least two lesions on the T2-weighted brain MRI* scan at least one of which is ovoid
             or periventricular or infratentorial. MRI eligibility will be determined centrally by
             the UBC MS/MRI Research Group.*One lesion on spinal MRI may substitute for one brain
             lesion as per the 2005 McDonald Criteria.

          -  Sexually active women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception.

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any disease other than MS that could better explain the patient's signs and symptoms.

          -  Any previous clinical event reasonably attributable to acute demyelination, regardless
             of whether medical attention was obtained.

          -  Complete transverse myelitis or bilateral optic neuritis. A waiver can be obtained for
             bilateral optic neuritis but must be obtained prior to randomization. Waivers must be
             approved by 3 neurologists including a member of the Clinical Eligibility / Endpoint
             Committee, a member of the DSMC, and by an experienced MS neurophthalmologist.
