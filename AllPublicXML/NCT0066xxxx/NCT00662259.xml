  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how an anti-anxiety drug or placebo affects the
      activity of your brain when you are at rest and when you are viewing emotional material, such
      as, emotional faces and pictures.

      This is an exploratory study to evaluate the usefulness of fMRI as a biomarker to measure the
      response to a known, FDA approved marketed anxiolytic. As such, this is not a study testing
      safety and efficacy of an approved medicine; it is a study to evaluate the usefulness of fMRI
      (a non-significant risk device procedure) to correlate the clinical/behavioral effects of a
      marketed anxiolytic with brain activity assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. fMRI is a
      more direct measure of brain function than behavior, outcomes are quantitative and objective.
      As such, it may be more specific, i.e., may be more sensitive to drug effects or show them
      earlier than clinical endpoints and enable determination of efficacy in smaller or shorter
      studies than those required to show effects on clinical endpoints. Finally, imaging may allow
      differentiation of placebo responders from true drug responders.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female between 18 - 65 years of age, inclusive

          2. In good general health (as determined by medical history, physical examination,
             laboratory assessments and ECG), especially no findings (including concomitant
             medications) that would constitute contraindications for treatment with alprazolam

          3. DSM-IV criteria for GAD (exception: at least 3 months of symptoms)

          4. HAM-A at screening &gt;/= 20

          5. MADRS at screening &lt; 25

          6. Prior medications washout:

               -  2-week medication washout prior to randomization for most psychotropic
                  medications

               -  If prior history of fluoxetine use, this drug must have been discontinued at
                  least 5 weeks before randomization

          7. For females of non-childbearing potential: either postmenopausal for the past year
             (confirmed by an FSH level greater than 40 mIU/mL unless the subject is receiving
             HRT), or surgically sterile (e.g., tubal ligation, hysterectomy)
