    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate the relationship between treatment with MetroGel® 1% and cosmetic performance with
      the Subjects' usual cosmetic products. It is expected that the female subjects will be able
      to use their routine cosmetics after application without affecting the cosmetic product's
      performance or causing side effects.
