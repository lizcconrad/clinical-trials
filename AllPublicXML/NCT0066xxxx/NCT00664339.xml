      We evaluated the preventive impact of vaccination on subsequent death events in 117 severe
      congestive heart patients requiring ventilator support without endotracheal intubations and
      aggressive medical therapy.

      They were randomly allocated in a single-blind manner as a unique intramuscular influenza
      vaccination or as controls.

      The first primary outcome evaluated at 6 months follow-up - cardiovascular death - occurred
      in 3% of the patients in the vaccine group Vs 17% in controls (p=0.022). The composite end
      point occurred in 33% of the patients in the vaccine group Vs 74% in control group, p =
      &lt;0.001.

      Background: Recent reports detected that one of the barriers that vaccination against
      influenza infection is that, physicians do not strongly recommend its applications to
      cardiovascular patients at risk. We evaluated the preventive impact of vaccination against
      death in severe congestive heart failure hospitalized patients.

      Methods and Results: A total of 117 severe congestive heart failure patients (New York Heart
      Association class III and IV) admitted in the first 12 hours who required ventilator support
      without endotracheal intubations and high doses of loop-diuretics, were included in a
      prospective, multicenter log, during the winter season. Congestive heart patients received
      intravenous vasodilators and loop-diuretics plus standard therapies, and then were randomly
      allocated in a single-blind manner as a unique intramuscular influenza vaccination or as
      controls. Death, and combined end points (death, and re-hospitalization for any reason) were
      assessed at 6 months follow-up.

      The first primary outcome - cardiovascular death - occurred in 3% of the patients in the
      vaccine group Vs 17% in controls (odds ratio with vaccine as compared with controls: 0.16; 95
      percent confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.79; p=0.022). The composite end point occurred in 33%
      of the patients in the vaccine group Vs 74% in controls, p = &lt;0.001. The need of adding
      inotropic drugs occurred in 8% of patients receiving vaccination, and in 12.5% in the control
      group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patient's &gt; 21 years of age with a severe congestive heart failure (New
             York Heart Association class III or IV) requiring an immediate administration of
             intravenous vasodilators drugs, oxygen therapy, and no less than 160 mg of intravenous
             furosemide were eligible for inclusion.

          -  Definite evidence of underlying heart failure was also required as shown by at least
             two of the following:

               -  a) Orthopnea on admission

               -  b) X-ray showing evidences of elevated wedge pressure indicating congestive heart
                  failure

               -  c) recent prior hospitalization (within the 30 days prior to the index
                  hospitalization) because a congestive heart failure episode
