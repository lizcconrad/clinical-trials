  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telcagepant in the
      treatment of acute migraine in participants with stable vascular disease.
      Acetaminophen/paracetamol (APAP) will be used as an active comparator in this study. The
      primary hypothesis of this study is that telcagepant 300 mg is superior to placebo.

    <time_frame>2 hours post-dose (Up to 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Freedom (PF) at 2 hours post-dose (Period 1, Attack 1) defined as a decrease from a moderate or severe migraine headache (Grade 2 or 3) at baseline to no pain (Grade 0). Headache severity was subjectively rated by the participant at predefined time points on a scale of Grade 0 to Grade 3: Grade 0 - No pain; Grade 1 - Mild pain; Grade 2 - Moderate Pain; and Grade 3 - Severe Pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 14 days of any dose of study medication (Up to 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, that occurs during the course of the study.</description>

    <time_frame>2 hours post-dose (Up to 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Relief (PR) at 2 hours post-dose (first migraine attack), with pain relief defined as a reduction in headache severity from Grade 3/2 at baseline to Grade 1/0 at 2 hours post-dose. Headache severity was subjectively rated by the participant at predefined time points on a scale of Grade 0 to Grade 3: Grade 0 - No pain; Grade 1 - Mild pain; Grade 2 - Moderate Pain; and Grade 3 - Severe Pain.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Confirmed Vascular Event Within 48 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 hours after the dose of any study medication (Up to 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed Vascular Event included cardiac events, cerebrovascular events, and peripheral vascular events.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours post-dose (Up to 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>SPF from 2 to 24 hours post-dose is defined as PF at 2 hours, with no administration of either rescue medication or the optional second dose and with no occurrence thereafter of a mild/moderate/severe headache during the 2 to 24 hours after dosing with the study medication.</description>
