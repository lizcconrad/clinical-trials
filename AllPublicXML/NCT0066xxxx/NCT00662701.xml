    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare 2 invasive strategies for Atrial Fibrillation
      treatment, Endocardial catheter ablation isolation of the Pulmonary veins versus minimally
      invasive thoracoscopic surgical epicardial isolation. Both strategies are in use for several
      years now, and have been reported as a successful strategy with success rates of 60-90%.
      However, it is not known which technique is preferable in a given patient population in terms
      of efficacy to cure AF, safety, or patient discomfort. Therefore, in the present trial a
      randomized study is proposed to provide more insight into the relative merits of both
      techniques

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting millions of people
      around the world. It is a large burden on health care resources and may even lead to a
      shorter life expectancy. Drug treatment has been found insufficient and sometimes even
      hazardous to the pt. Traditionally, there was only one invasive approach available, being
      MAZE 3 procedure by means of full open chest cardiac surgery. This was a very invasive
      approach, limited to only a few skilled surgeons, with insufficient options to treat large pt
      volume.

      With the discovery that AF often is initiated and maintained by electrical instability inside
      and around the Pulmonary Veins, catheter ablation is now a widely accepted early invasive
      strategy to cure AF. Success rates of 60% to 90% have been reported, depending on technique
      employed and the type of AF (Resp, chronic versus paroxysmal)
