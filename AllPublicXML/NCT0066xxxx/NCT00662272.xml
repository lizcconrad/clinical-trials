  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Fluzone® vaccine
      with four dose levels of JVRS-100 adjuvant compared to Fluzone® vaccine alone in healthy
      adults 18-49 years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of graded, ascending
      doses of JVRS-100 adjuvant when administered in combination with a vaccine antigen.
