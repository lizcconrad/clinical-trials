      To determine the safety and efficacy of surgical resection with Gliadel® 3.85% wafer
      implantation, followed by concomitant limited field radiation therapy and temozolomide,
      followed by dose dense temozolomide and bevacizumab in subjects undergoing initial surgery

    <description>Between 14 and 28 days after surgery, all subjects will begin a standard course of post-operative limited field radiation therapy to the tumor site and a surrounding margin with concomitant temozolomide at a daily dose of 75 mg/m2 (7 days/week).
No later than 45 days after date of completion of radiation therapy, all subjects will begin dose dense temozolomide at dose of 150 mg/m2 on Days 1-7 and 15-21 of a 28 day cycle with concomitant bevacizumab 10mg/kg administered intravenously every other week.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects, men and women, must be between ages 18 and 75 years.

          -  Subjects must have radiographic evidence on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             of a single, contrast-enhancing unilateral supratentorial cerebral tumor.

          -  Surgery is recommended within 4 weeks of the baseline MRI scan.

          -  Subjects must have a Karnofsky Performance Score of 60 or higher.

          -  Subjects must have signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed
             consent prior to any non-standard of care study procedure or no later than the start
             of dose dense temozolomide and bevacizumab..

          -  Subjects must have a pathological diagnosis of a high grade (IV) malignant glioma.

          -  Subjects, both men and women, must be willing to avoid pregnancy for up to 2 years
             after wafer implantation surgery and be counseled regarding the unknown, and
             potentially harmful, risks to the embryo or fetus from participation in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had prior cytoreductive surgery for high-grade glioma. Subjects who
             have had a diagnostic stereotactic biopsy are eligible.

          -  Subjects with more than one focus of tumor or tumor crossing the midline as assessed
             by coronal cranial MRI scan.

          -  Concomitant significant life-threatening disease from which the subject could
             reasonably be expected to die within the first 12 months of the study.

          -  Known hypersensitivity reactions to temozolomide, nitrosoureas or any other components
             of the Gliadel® wafer.

          -  Prior CNS radiotherapy.

          -  Subjects who have received any prior chemotherapy for this malignant glioma prior to
             the baseline evaluation or subjects who are currently being treated with
             chemotherapeutic agents.

          -  Subjects with fewer than 100,000 platelets per mm3 or fewer than 3.500 leukocytes per
             mm3.

          -  Liver function tests greater than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal
             (transaminases (SGOT, SGPT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase).

          -  Serum creatinine equal to or greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, blood
             urea nitrogen (BUN) equal to or greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Pregnancy, or lactating females or females of childbearing potential not using
             adequate contraception.

          -  Participation in any other investigational protocol in the prior twelve months for any
             type of malignancy.

          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions which do not permit
             adequate medical follow-up and compliance with the study protocol.

          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension (blood pressure systolic &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic
             &gt; 100 mmHg).

          -  Unstable angina or history of myocardial infarction within six months prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Evidence of bleeding, diathesis, or coagulopathy. Chronic full-dose anticoagulation
             with warfarin is not permitted though subjects may be on low molecular weight heparin
             or fondaparinux.

          -  Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.
