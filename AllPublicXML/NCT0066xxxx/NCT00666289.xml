  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloproliferative disorders occur in families, thus giving rise to the theory that it is a
      genetic disease that may be caused by an abnormal gene in the DNA that can be passed from one
      generation of family members to another. DNA can be gathered from family members through
      blood samples and the investigators will investigate (through DNA testing) to see if there
      are abnormal genes that may be responsible for causing the MPDs. Understanding which genes
      are responsible for causing MPDs can help develop ways to identify people who may be at risk
      for developing an MPD, allow for the development of better treatments, possibly a cure, or
      even prevent the development of MPDs.

          -  Subjects who have a known acquired cause of polycythemia (increased
             hemoglobin/hematocrit), such as people living in high altitudes (in excess of 14,000
             feet), subjects with heart disease, left to right heart shunt, severe hypoxia,
             cyanotic congenital heart disease, or severe pulmonary disease, will be excluded from
