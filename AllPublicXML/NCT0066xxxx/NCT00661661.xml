        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom, arise, eat, walk, reach, grip, hygiene and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale, 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty;2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as sum of domain sc ores and divided by number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3: 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty. The baseline data of Study A3921039, A3921040 or A3921044 were used as baseline data for efficacy evaluations except for Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS).</description>

Dose flexibility (increasing from 5 mg BID to 10 mg BID, reducing from 10 mg BID to 5 mg BID, or temporary discontinuation) during study was allowed in consideration for the risks and benefits to the patient’s condition. Data was summarized in three reporting groups including CP-690,550 5 mg BID, CP-690,550 10 mg BID and Total.</description>

        <description>DAS28-4 (ESR) calculated from swollen joint count (SJC) and tender/painful joint count (TJC) using 28 joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient's global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (transformed score ranging 0 to 10; higher score indicated greater affectation due to disease activity). Total score range:0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity.

            <description>All subjects were assigned oral CP-690,550 5 mg tablets twice a day at baseline visit. Dose flexibility (increasing from 5 mg BID to 10 mg BID, reducing from 10 mg BID to 5 mg BID, or temporary discontinuation) during study was allowed in consideration for the risks and benefits to the patient’s condition. Data was summarized in three reporting groups including CP-690,550 5 mg BID, CP-690,550 10 mg BID and Total.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tender/Painful Joint Counts</title>
        <description>This was carried out on 68 joints. Each joint’s response to pressure/motion was assessed using the following scale: Present/Absent/Not Done/Not Applicable (to be used for artificial joints). The baseline data of Study A3921039, A3921040 or A3921044 were used as baseline data for efficacy evaluations except for Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS).</description>

Dose flexibility (increasing from 5 mg BID to 10 mg BID, reducing from 10 mg BID to 5 mg BID, or temporary discontinuation) during study was allowed in consideration for the risks and benefits to the patient’s condition. Data was summarized in three reporting groups including CP-690,550 5 mg BID, CP-690,550 10 mg BID and Total.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Domain Score_Physical Functioning</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning. The baseline data of Study A3921039, A3921040 or A3921044 were used as baseline data for efficacy evaluations except for Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Domain Score_Role Physical</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning. The baseline data of Study A3921039, A3921040 or A3921044 were used as baseline data for efficacy evaluations except for Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Domain Score_Bodily Pain</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning. The baseline data of Study A3921039, A3921040 or A3921044 were used as baseline data for efficacy evaluations except for Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Domain Score_General Health</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning. The baseline data of Study A3921039, A3921040 or A3921044 were used as baseline data for efficacy evaluations except for Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Domain Score_Social Functioning</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning. The baseline data of Study A3921039, A3921040 or A3921044 were used as baseline data for efficacy evaluations except for Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Domain Score_Role Emotional</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning. The baseline data of Study A3921039, A3921040 or A3921044 were used as baseline data for efficacy evaluations except for Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Component Score_Mental</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning. The baseline data of Study A3921039, A3921040 or A3921044 were used as baseline data for efficacy evaluations except for Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS).</description>

        <description>mTSS = sum of erosion and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) scores for 44 joints (16 per hand and 6 per foot). mTSS scores range from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst possible total score). Change: scores at observation minus score at baseline. An increase in mTSS from baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented potential improvement. Month 24 (the final visit) in Study A3921044 was taken as the first visit in current study.</description>
