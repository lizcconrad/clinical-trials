      To determine the effects of three different doses of bardoxolone methyl administered orally
      on the kidney function (glomular filtration rate) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

    <textblock>
      Bardoxolone methyl is an Antioxidant Inflammation Modulator in clinical development for
      inflammation and cancer-related indications that inhibits immune-mediated inflammation by
      restoring redox homeostasis in inflamed tissues. It induces the cytoprotective transcription
      factor Nrf2 and suppresses the activities of the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory
      transcription factors NF-kB and the STATs. In vivo, bardoxolone has demonstrated significant
      single agent anti-inflammatory activity in several animal models of inflammation such as
      renal damage in the cisplatin model and ischemia-reperfusion model of acute renal injury. In
      addition, significant reductions in serum creatinine have been observed in patients treated
      with bardoxolone. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that bardoxolone can improve renal
      function in patients with diabetic nephropathy through suppression of renal inflammation and
      improvement of glomerular filtration.
