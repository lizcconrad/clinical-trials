      Purpose: This study will be a single arm, prospective cohort study to examine the safety,
      efficacy, and pharmacokinetic and metabolic characteristics of Raltegravir in
      African-American men and women.

      Participants: 40 HIV positive, ARV treatment-naive, African-American women and men (estimated
      to be 70% men, 30% women)

      Procedures (methods): Subjects will receive Raltegravir 400 mg BID along with Truvada for 104
      weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection documented by HIV serology or detectable viral load

          -  Self-described as African-American

          -  Less than 7 days cumulative of prior HIV therapy

          -  Plasma HIV RNA PCR equal to or greater than 1000 copies/mL within 90 days prior to
             study entry

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, able to comply with study medication and
             procedures

          -  ALT (SGPT) &lt; or equal to 3.0 x ULN within 45 days prior to study entry

          -  GRF &gt; 59 as calculated by MDRD within 45 days prior to study entry

          -  All women of reproductive potential (who have not reached menopause or undergone
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) must have a negative serum or
             urine β-HCG pregnancy test performed within 48 hours before entry.

        All study volunteers must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active
        attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, in vitro fertilization) and,
        if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female study
        volunteer/male partner must use at least one reliable method of contraception (e.g.,
        condoms, with or without a spermicidal agent; a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide;
        an IUD; or hormonal-based contraception), simultaneously while receiving the
        protocol-specified medication(s) and for 6 weeks after stopping the medication(s). If oral
        birth control pills, hormone patches, or hormone injections are used for contraception,
        then a second method of contraception must be used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Breastfeeding

          -  Prior receipt of Raltegravir

          -  Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator is likely to interfere with
             follow-up or ability to take the study medication appropriately
