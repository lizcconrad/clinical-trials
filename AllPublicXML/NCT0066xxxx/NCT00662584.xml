    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method that holds
      promise for treating several psychiatric disorders. Yet the most effective location and
      parameters for treatment need more exploration. Also, whether rTMS is an effective treatment
      for individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) has not been
      empirically tested. The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate whether fMRI guided rTMS is
      effective in reducing symptoms of GAD.

      This study utilized a 3-week open-label design to evaluate the efficacy of fMRI guided rTMS
      in the treatment of GAD.

      We first used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the gambling task to
      localize anxiety-related brain activations in each individual participant, and then used this
      information to guide treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).

      TMS was delivered to the target site at a frequency of 1 Hz for 20 minutes (900 total
      pulses). The intensity of the TMS was set to 90% of the passive motor threshold for each
      participant.

      The primary efficacy measures include the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I)
      and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Response to treatment was defined as a
      reduction of 50% or more on the HARS and symptom remission was defined as a CGI-I score of 1
      or 2 (&quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; respectively) and a score â‰¤ 8 on the HARS. Data
      was entered anonymously into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed by the UCLA Semel Institute
      Statistical Core. The analysis was done on the intent to treat sample using last observation
      carried forward (LOCF). A one-sample paired t-test was used to compare endpoint to baseline
      means on the HARS, with a significance level set at p= 0.05, two-tailed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male or female outpatients age 18 to 65 years, inclusive

          -  The subject meets DSM-IV criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder as determined by
             the MINI.

          -  Sexually active female patients of childbearing potential must be practicing at least
             one or more the following methods of contraception during the study: intrauterine
             device (IUD), barrier method in combination with a spermicide, oral/hormonal
             contraception or abstinence. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test prior to receiving study drug.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to study
             participation.

          -  The subject is in good medical health or with chronic medical conditions which are
             currently stable.

          -  No current abuse of alcohol or other substance.

          -  The subject has a total score of 20 or more on the SIGH-A at screening.

          -  The subject has a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity score of 4 or more at
             screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject meets DSM-IV criteria for an Axis I diagnosis (other than GAD) as the
             primary diagnosis (i.e., schizophrenia, mood disorder, psychosis, anorexia nervosa) as
             determined by the MINI.

          -  The subject is clinically judged by the investigator to be at risk for suicide or is
             acutely suicidal as objectively measured by the MINI and MSE.

          -  The subject is clinically judged by the investigator to be at risk for homicide or is

          -  The subject has a psychiatric condition that would require inpatient, or partial
             psychiatric hospitalization.

          -  Seizure disorders.

          -  Significant history of medical disease (i.e. cardiovascular, hepatic (e.g. cirrhosis,

             potential or progressive neurological disorders) which could impair reliable
             participation in the trial or necessitate the use of medication not allowed by this
             protocol.

          -  The subject is pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or nursing. If a subject becomes
             pregnant, she will be discontinued immediately and followed appropriately.

             Sertraline (Zoloft), Luvox (Fluvoxamine), and Citalopram. Potential subjects may
             remain on one of the SSRI medications provided that he or she has been on a stable
             dose for at least 4 weeks prior to entering this study; this dose remains stable
             throughout the remainder of this study; and it can be determined that this medication
             is not exacerbating the anxiety symptoms.

          -  The subject has a Structured Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (SIGH-D) score above 38
