  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain at the front of the knee is a common condition treated by physical therapists. Treatment
      may consist of generalised strengthening exercises directed at the quadriceps muscle or
      specific retraining aimed at restoring motor control at the knee. This study compared these
      two exercise programs in a group of people who were painfree at the time to evaluate their
      effect on motor control. It was hypothesised that only the motor retraining program would
      influence motor control at the knee.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  aged between 16-40 years, with the upper age limit to reduce the likelihood of
             osteoarthritic changes in the patellofemoral joint

          -  a self-reported history of anterior or retropatellar knee pain with insidious onset of
             symptoms and with at least one episode of pain in the past 12 months where pain was
             aggravated by at least two of the following: prolonged sitting, stairs, squat,
             running, kneeling and hopping/jumping

          -  currently asymptomatic for at least 8 weeks prior to assessment

          -  delay in the onset of VMO EMG relative to that of VL of greater than 10 ms during
             either the ascent or descent of a stair stepping task

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  current knee pain

          -  history of knee surgery or other knee injury in previous 12 months

          -  clinical evidence of meniscal lesion, ligamentous instability, traction apophysitis
             around the patellofemoral complex, patellar tendon pathology, chondral damage,
             osteoarthritis and spinal referred pain

          -  current lower limb pathology affecting their ability to satisfactorily complete the
             testing or exercise protocol
