  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to evaluate in adult men with erectile dysfunction (often called
      impotence), the effect of vardenafil HCl on the quality of their erections. Many men
      experience occasional erectile problems during their lives. The causes of erectile
      dysfunction are varied and may be due to physiological or emotional reasons. This study is
      designed to study the responsiveness of the erection quality scale (EQS) to vardenafil HCl.
      In this study, vardenafil HCl will be compared to placebo. Placebo is a pill which looks like
      the real drug but it is not. It contains no active ingredients.
