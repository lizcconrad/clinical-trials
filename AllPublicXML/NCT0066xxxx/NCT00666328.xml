  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of clevidipine for
      treating acute hypertension (high blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure &gt;160
      mmHg) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (i.e., bleeding in the brain; stroke).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, single-arm, non-blinded dose titration efficacy and safety trial
      evaluating the ability of clevidipine, a vascular-selective L-type calcium channel
      antagonist, to rapidly control acute hypertension in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.
      Informed consent was obtained from patients meeting the inclusion criteria before the
      initiation of any study-specific procedures. At screening, a clinical and neurological
      examination was carried out. For the purposes of this study, acute hypertension was defined
      as SBP &gt;160 mmHg immediately prior to initiation of study drug. Approximately 30 to 40
      patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were planned to be enrolled with
      approximately 10 patients requiring monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP). Infusion of
      study drug was initiated within 12 hours of ICH symptom onset. All eligible patients enrolled
      received clevidipine in an open label manner. Clevidipine was to be infused at an initial
      rate of 2.0 mg/h for the first 1.5 minutes. Thereafter, titration to higher infusion rates
      were to be attempted as needed, to obtain the target SBP range (SBP ≤160 mmHg to ≥140 mmHg).
      Titration to effect was to proceed by doubling the dose every 1.5 minutes, up to a maximum of
      32.0 mg/h, until the desired effect (SBP within the target range) was attained. During the
      first 30 minutes, if the desired blood pressure lowering effect was not attained or
      maintained, an alternative intravenous (IV) antihypertensive agent(s), advised to be a
      different class other than calcium channel blockers, could be used with or without stopping
      the clevidipine infusion. The clevidipine infusion could continue for up to a maximum of 96
      hours. Twenty-four hour follow-up computerized tomography (CT) scan results were recorded,
      including measurement of intracerebral hematoma volumes. Assessment of safety was performed
      throughout the treatment period and until 6 hours after termination of study drug. Patients
      were followed for 7 days following termination of the clevidipine infusion.

    <time_frame>Within 30 minutes of study drug initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The median time, in minutes, was estimated with its two-tailed 95% confidence interval from the time of the initiation of clevidipine infusion until the first observed SBP was achieved in the target range of ≤160 mmHg to ≥140 mmHg within the first 30 minutes of clevidipine treatment. If patients did not reach the blood pressure target range within the first 30 minutes, their data was considered censored at 30 minutes. If another IV and/or oral antihypertensive agent indicated for hypertension was administered less than 30 minutes prior to achieving the endpoint, the data was considered censored at the time when the additional or alternative antihypertensive agent was given.</description>

    <description>The percentage of patients who reached SBP of ≤160 mmHg within the first 30 minutes of initiation of clevidipine infusion was summarized. If an additional or alternative IV antihypertensive agent and/or oral antihypertensive agent was administered for hypertension prior to a patient achieving SBP≤160 mmHg during the initial 30-minute treatment period, then the patient was considered to have failed to reach this efficacy endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure During the Initial 30 Minutes of Clevidipine Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 30 minutes post initiation of clevidipine infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Over the initial 30 minutes of the treatment period, the percent change from baseline (defined as immediately prior to study drug initiation) was summarized descriptively at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after clevidipine initiation. Decreases in SBP from baseline were observed over the course of this time period.</description>

    <description>Total AUC-SBP captures the magnitude and duration of SBP either above the upper limit of the target SBP range at 160 mm Hg or below the lower limit of 140 mm Hg and normalized per hour for the duration of clevidipine infusion. A larger value for AUC-SBP indicates greater SBP variability outside the target range.</description>

    <description>The percent time that SBP was maintained within the SBP target range (≤160 mmHg to ≥140 mmHg) was summarized for each 24-hour period of monotherapy of clevidipine infusion through 96 hours (0 -≤24 h, 24-≤48 h, 48-≤72 h, 72-≤96 h). For purposes of this analysis, SBP data were available from all mITT patients for the overall infusion period and from 0 to ≤24 hours of infusion; however, data was only available for 8 patients from 24 to ≤48 hours, 4 patients from 48 to ≤72 hours and 1 patient from 72 to ≤96 hours due to the variability in infusion durations &gt;24 hours across patients.</description>

    <description>Clevidipine injectable emulsion (0.5 mg/mL) in 20% lipid emulsion in 100 mL bottles was administered intravenously to all patients via a single dedicated line.
Clevidipine was infused at an initial rate of 2.0 mg/h for the first 1.5 minutes. Thereafter, titration to higher infusion rates were to be attempted as needed to obtain the target systolic blood pressure (SBP) range (SBP ≤160 mmHg to ≥140 mmHg). Titration to effect was to proceed by doubling the dose every 1.5 minutes, up to a maximum of 32.0 mg/h, until the desired effect (SBP within the target range) was attained.

Clevidipine was titrated to effect thereafter by doubling the dose every 1.5 minutes, as tolerated by the patient, up to a maximum dose of 32 mg/h, to lower blood pressure within the protocol specific target range (SBP ≤160 mmHg to ≥140 mmHg) for a minimum of 30 minutes and up to 96 hours.</description>

          <description>Over the initial 30 minutes of the treatment period, the percent change from baseline (defined as immediately prior to study drug initiation) was summarized descriptively at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes after clevidipine initiation. Decreases in SBP from baseline were observed over the course of this time period.</description>
