    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such
      as triptorelin, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving triptorelin and
      radiation therapy soon after surgery or later after surgery is more effective in treating
      prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving triptorelin and radiation therapy
      soon after surgery to see how well it works compared with giving them later after surgery in
      treating patients who have undergone surgery for intermediate-risk stage III or stage IV
      prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy, in terms of event-free survival at 5 years, of immediate
           radio-hormonal therapy immediately after prostatectomy for tumor pT2, R1, pN0, or pNx
           versus radio-hormonal therapy at biochemical relapse.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the metastasis-free survival of these patients.

        -  Compare the acute and late toxicities of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the functional dependence of patients over 75 years old.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (delayed treatment): Patients receive triptorelin intramuscularly on day 1 and
           then 3 months later. Patients also undergo conformal radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week,
           for 7 weeks. Treatment begins at biochemical relapse (PSA is more than 0.2 ng/mL) and
           before PSA is more than 2 ng/mL.

        -  Arm II (immediate treatment): Patients receive treatment as in arm I, but treatment
           begins within 6 months after surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 5 years.
