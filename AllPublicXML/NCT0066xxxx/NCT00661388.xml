  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous methoxy
      polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera) for the correction and maintenance of hemoglobin
      levels in predialysis patients with renal anemia who are not currently treated with
      erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA). Eligible patients will receive monthly subcutaneous
      injections of Mircera at an initial recommended dose of 1.2 micrograms/kg. The anticipated
      time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to EEP (Week 29 to Week 36)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in Hb concentration was calculated as the difference between the time adjusted average of Hb during the efficacy evaluation period (EEP [Week 29 to Week 36]), and the Hb at Baseline (Week 0). A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Requiring Dose Adjustments During Dose Titration Period and EEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0 to Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants requiring dose adjustments during dose titration period (DTP [Week 0 to Week 28]) and EEP (Week 29 to Week 36) is presented. The dose adjustments (increase or decrease) were required: if a single Hb concentration was either ≥ 13 g/dL or &lt; 9 g/dL; if the difference of 2 consecutive Hb concentrations was ≥2 g/dL; if the values of scheduled Hb assessments on the day of administration of C.E.R.A. and on the previous study visit were both out of range of 10 to 12 g/dL; if the values of the scheduled Hb assessments on the day of administration of C.E.R.A. and on the previous study visit were both out of the range 10.5 to 11.5 g/dL. Dose adjustment could be made at any time at the discretion of the clinician if clinically warranted.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Received Red Blood Cell Transfusions During the Study Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Red blood cell transfusions were given during the treatment period in case of medical need. Blood transfusions occurred during the DTP (Week 0 to Week 28), EEP (Week 29 to Week 36), and during the long term safety period (LSTP [Week 37 to Week 52]) are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced Any Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
