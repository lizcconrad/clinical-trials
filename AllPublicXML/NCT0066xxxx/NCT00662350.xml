      To measure intra-prostatic temperatures and evaluate the shape and size of necrotic lesions
      achieved under the standard treatment protocol in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia
      (BPH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Wallterm System provides minimally invasive treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia
      (BPH) via a high temperature, liquid filled, balloon thermotherapy. The catheter is composed
      of a silicone positioning balloon which anchors the catheter against the bladder neck. The
      multi-layer silicone treatment balloon may be adjusted to fit short (20-35mm) and long
      (40-55mm) prostates and is inflated (to approximately 650-700 mmHg / 20-22mm diameter) to
      ensure tight tissue contact and reduced blood perfusion. The handle contains the heating
      element and the liquid circulation mechanisms

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men with symptomatic BPH requiring treatment,

          -  IPSS score &gt; 15

          -  Age &gt; 50 years

          -  Prostate size of 25 g or greater

          -  Prostatic urethra length between 2.0 cm and 5.5 cm,

          -  Ability to understand and consent to participate in this investigation,

          -  Willingness and ability to participate in all required follow-up evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy towards Silicone,

          -  Peak Urinary Flow &gt; 15 mL/s,

          -  Penile or urinary sphincter implant,

          -  Patients with active urinary tract infection indicated by a positive urinary culture
             &gt;105 CFU (Note: These patients may be treated after successful treatment of the
             infection.)

          -  Clinical (historical), paraclinical (i.e. PSA&gt; 10ng/mL) or histological evidence of
             prostatic cancer or bladder cancer,

          -  Evidence of a non-symmetric prostatic median lobe enlargement, or a prostatic lobe
             which is prominent with an obstructing &quot;ball valve&quot;, as determined by cystoscopy or
             ultrasound,

          -  Patients with any previous prostate surgery, procedure for BPH, or any other invasive
             treatment to the prostate (such as TUR-P).

          -  Previous rectal surgery (Exception: hemorrhoid surgery), radical pelvic surgery or
             pelvic irradiation.

          -  Patients with confirmed or suspected bladder cancer.

          -  Patients with a history of cystolithiasis or bladder pathology, or who have
             experienced relapsing bacterial prostatitis within the last 6 months.

          -  Patients with gross haematuria. (Note: These patients may be eligible for this
             investigation if the results of a careful workup for cancer, including an X-ray study,
             cystoscopy and cytology, are found to be negative.)

          -  Patients with a history of bladder neck contracture.

          -  Patients who presently have urethral strictures, which prevent the passage of a 20 Fr
             endoscope (these patients may be treated after successful treatment of the stricture).

          -  Patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction (neurogenic detrusor hypo- or
             hyperactivity).

          -  Patients interested in future fertility.

          -  Patients who have chronic catheter drainage due to urinary retention (these patients
             may be treated if a CMG demonstrates that the patient has a contractile bladder).

          -  Patients with bleeding disorders, or other systemic disorder contraindication
             minimally invasive surgical therapies.

          -  Any condition (ie: vascular clips) which would preclude an MRI from being performed,
             or otherwise confound this investigation.

          -  Patients with compromised renal function (i.e. serum creatinine &gt;150 mls/l), renal or
             upper tract dilatation.
