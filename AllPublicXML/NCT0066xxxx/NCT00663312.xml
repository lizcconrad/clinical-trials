  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson' disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by bradykinesia, rigidity,
      rest tremor and postural instability. Dopaminergic therapy such as L-Dopa and dopamine
      agonists usually leads to a dramatic improvement of symptoms, but disease progression
      nevertheless remains inevitable. Bilateral Deep brain stimulation in subthalamic nucleus
      (STN) leads to a spectacular clinical improvement in patients with motor complications and is
      now considered as the gold standard surgical treatment.

      However, this surgery induces a post-operative body weight gain which may limit the benefits
      of this technique and induce critical metabolic disorders such as profound alterations in the
      central control of energy metabolism. Previous data seems to show that glucose metabolism is
      also altered.

      The aim of this prospective study was to identify if the STN stimulation could modify glucose
      metabolism regulation especially the endogen glucose production (by liver) Hypothalamus is
      able to detect glucose concentration variations and to control/adjust glucose levels by
      modulating the hepatic glucose production. As hypothamus and STN are anatomically closed, we
      hypothesise that the STN stimulation could modulate the hypothalamus function and
      consequently modify glucose production.

      ilot study 8 patients

      Inclusion visit :

        -  Clinical examination/ Interview on health and medical history

        -  Complete UPDRS

        -  Body composition measured by DEXA

        -  Biologic check up

        -  MMS

      Protocol :

      All subjects were studied in the postabsorptive state after a 10-h overnight fast.

      On the day of the experiment, patients do not receive their treatment (MED OFF). One catheter
      was retrogradely inserted into a dorsal vain and was used for blood sample. A second catheter
      was inserted into the controlateral arm for the tracer infusion. A continuous infusion of
      D-6,6 2H2 glucose (0,05mg/kg/h) was performed during 6 hours (after a primed dose of 0,05
      mg/kg of this tracer).

      The first 3 hours, patients were studied without stimulation (STIM OFF); the last 3 hours the
      stimulator was actuated (STIM ON). Blood samples were regularly collected for the 2H2 glucose
      enrichment determination, and for the insulin, glucose and glucagon plasma concentration
      analyses.
