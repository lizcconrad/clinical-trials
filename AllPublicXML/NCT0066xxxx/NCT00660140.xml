      To determine the activity of gemcitabine combined with carboplatin in the treatment of
      patients with metastatic or recurrent cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer.

      Due to better non-hematologic toxicity profile, less need for pre- and post chemotherapy
      hydration, and tolerability as compared to cisplatin, we propose to combine gemcitabine with
      carboplatin in the treatment of patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma.
      In lung cancer, available literature suggests that carboplatin is as efficacious as
      cisplatin.

      Several Phase I, II and III studies using gemcitabine with carboplatin have already been done
      or are currently ongoing. Phase I studies determined the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of
      gemcitabine at 800-1250 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 combined with at AUC of 4-5.5, day 1 of a 21-day
      cycle.

      Initial Phase II studies using a 28-day schedule using gemcitabine on days 1,8 and 15 with
      carboplatin caused severe thrombocytopenia on day 15 precluding day 15 treatment in over 50%
      of courses. A Spanish Lung Cancer Group conducted a sequential Phase II trial wherein 52% and
      30% of the first 33 patients with lung cancer treated using the 28-day schedule were noted to
      have Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, respectively. Subsequently, the next 56
      patients were treated on the 21-day schedule, and despite a higher dose intensity, response
      rates were equal (45-48%) with less Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (21%) but similar rates of Grade
      4 neutropenia (27%).

      A randomized Italian Phase II studies have demonstrated that when gemcitabine was given at
      doses of 1 g/m2 with carboplatin at AUC of 5 mg/mL/min were tolerable and when compared to
      gemcitabine and cisplatin caused less non-hematologic toxicities. Current Phase III trials in
      lung cancer utilizes the 21-day schedule with gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and
      carboplatin at AUC of 5.5.

      Therefore, our proposed schedule will be gemcitabine at 1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes on days
      1 and 8 with carboplatin dosed at an AUC of 5 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
