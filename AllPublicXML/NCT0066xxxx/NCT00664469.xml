      In South Asian Canadians with documented coronary artery disease or diabetes and
      hypercholesterolemia with LDL-C levels &gt; 2.0 mmol/L after 4 weeks of monotherapy with any
      statin: To compare the percent (%) of patients who achieve an LDL-C concentration of
      2.0mmol/L after a 6-week course of treatment with ezetimibe 10 mg/day co-administered with
      any statin at any dose versus doubling of the current statin dose.
