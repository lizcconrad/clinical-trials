      Background: Innovation: Over 150,000 soldiers are currently deployed in Iraq as part of
      Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and 12% of returning OIF veterans have posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). Research from our group and others showed lasting neurobiological
      consequences of PTSD, including increased amygdala function and decreased medial prefrontal
      function, verbal declarative memory problems, and smaller hippocampal volume that reverses
      with treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine or the anticonvulsant
      phenytoin. Recently we found that three months of treatment with paroxetine in PTSD patients
      resulted in an increase in hippocampal N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal
      integrity, as well as decreased brain metabolism in the amygdala and a reversal or stress
      induced decreases in medial prefrontal function. Subjects treated with placebo did not have
      an increase in NAA, however subsequent treatment for three months with open label paroxetine
      resulted in an increase in NAA to the level seen in the subjects treated with paroxetine in
      the double-blind phase. Paroxetine was associated with a decrease in amygdala metabolism
      measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and increased medial prefrontal function.
      Intervening soon after the trauma is critical for long-term outcomes, since with time
      traumatic memories become indelible and resistant to treatment. Diminished efficacy of
      treatment over time is shown by the fact that trials of Vietnam veterans have shown less
      efficacy over the years. Animal studies show that pretreatment before stress with
      antidepressants reduces chronic behavioral deficits related to stress; although for ethical
      and other reasons no studies have provided pretreatment before trauma exposure in humans. In
      our current VA Merit funded program we are looking at the effects of early interventions for
      Iraq soldiers with paroxetine, looking at chronicity of PTSD, cognition, cortisol response to
      stress, hippocampal volume and NAA, as outcomes. We now propose to add measurement of neural
      correlates of paroxetine response using PET.

      Objectives/Hypotheses: The objectives of this research are to:

        -  Assess the efficacy of paroxetine versus placebo in the treatment of early PTSD in OIF
           veterans

        -  Assess the effects of paroxetine versus placebo on amygdala metabolism and medial
           prefrontal response to stress in OIF veterans with PTSD.

        -  Assess the ability of brain imaging to predict treatment response and to identify
           veterans with early PTSD who will benefit from early interventions.

      Hypotheses are that paroxetine will be associated with: 1) an improvement in PTSD symptoms
      compared to placebo based on the change in the CAPS from baseline to three months of
      treatment in veterans of OIF; 2) increased medial prefrontal function and decreased amygdala
      metabolism in veterans of OIF.

      Specific Aims:

        -  Compare paroxetine to placebo in the treatment of early PTSD in OIF veterans

        -  Measure amygdala metabolism and medial prefrontal response to stress with PET in OIF
           veterans with PTSD before and after paroxetine or placebo treatment.

      Study Design: Subjects returning from Iraq who meet criteria for early PTSD (N=160) will be
      included in the study with a recruitment goal of 144 completers. A group of 80 healthy
      subjects with a history of military service during the period of OIF without a history of
      deployment and without PTSD and 80 healthy subjects with a history of deployment without PTSD
      will serve as comparator groups. All subjects will undergo baseline imaging of the brain with
      PET FDG and with measurement of brain blood flow during a memory task and with exposure to
      trauma related reminders (slides and sounds) and MRI and baseline psychometric assessments,
      following which PTSD subjects will be randomized to receive paroxetine or placebo for three
      months, with repeat imaging and assessments. After this PTSD subjects will be treated with
      three months of open label paroxetine, followed by a repeat of imaging and assessments. This
      will be an intent to treat analysis, therefore all subjects who were randomized and took at
      least one dose of study medication will be assessed at three months, regardless of whether
      they were able to stay on study medication. This will complement our currently VA Clinical
      Trial Merit funded application to measure hippocampal volume, NAA, and cortisol response to
      stress before and after early intervention with paroxetine in returning Iraq vets with early
      PTSD.
