      Primary Aim # 1: Determine the willingness of the public to participate in an intervention
      trial - NutritionQuest's Alive!TM - available in a public forum.

      Aim #1 Hypotheses: Less than 10% of individuals visiting the NutritionWeek site will register
      to participate in the Alive!TM Intervention; 70% of these individuals will complete the full
      intervention.

      Primary Aim # 2: To determine among individuals enrolled in the Alive!TM intervention,
      changes in measurements of body composition from pre- to post-intervention.

      Aim #2 Hypotheses: Participation in Alive!TM will result in positive changes in body
      composition, including reduction of body weight, percent body fat and blood LDL and an
      increase in blood HDL cholesterol.

      Purposes:

        1. Educate the public on the relationship between diet, weight and chronic disease

        2. Collect data for future research

        3. For participants of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) portion of this
           study, we also provide a diet assessment and optional 3-month intervention

      Recruitment:

      Researchers will have a display at OMSI coincidental with the Body Worlds 3 exhibit and at
      local health fairs. Participants will be recruited from the attendees of the OMSI Body Worlds
      3 exhibit as well as general OMSI visitors from July through October 2007 and from health
      fairs at later dates.

      Subject procedures:

      No identifiable information will be collected; only gender, year of birth, race and ethnicity
      are collected on any participant.

      Subjects under age 18 can participate in any or all of the following: a brief online,
      touch-screen assessment of eating and physical activity (health screening for immediate,
      printed feedback), physiologic measurements (height, weight, hip and waist circumference,
      percent body fat, blood pressure).

      Subjects who are age 18 and over can participate in any or all of the following: a brief
      online, touch-screen assessment of eating and physical activity (health screening for
      immediate, printed feedback), physiologic measurements (height, weight, hip and waist
      circumference, percent body fat, blood pressure), finger prick to assess blood glucose and
      lipid levels as well as DNA sample (mouthwash swish).

      For participants of the OMSI portion of this study, adults may also choose to join a 3-month
      online lifestyle intervention (Alive!â„¢). Participants who enroll in the 3-month intervention
      will receive 12 intervention messages over a 3-month period. Each of the messages will take
      about 5 to 10 minutes to read. At the end of this 3-month period, participants will receive a
      post-assessment health screening at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) Clinical
      and Translational Research Center. This post-assessment will include completion of a diet and
      physical activity assessment, fasting blood measures of glucose and lipids, blood pressure,
      weight and height.

      All visitors to the display area and all research subjects will be offered educational
      materials.

      Instruments used, for OMSI participants only:

      The Alive!TM lifestyle intervention is a web-based diet assessment program designed to help
      individuals evaluate their diet and make healthy changes via tailored e-mail correspondence.
      This program is operated by NutritionQuest out of Berkeley, California; utilizing the Block
      questionnaires, designed and validated over many years by Dr. Gladys Block, and now in use by
      researchers and health practitioners world-wide.

      Data analysis:

      De-identified data will be stored for future analyses and will be used in descriptive
      analyses to provide information on the distribution of body size variables and how they
      relate to reported dietary intake. DNA data from cheek cell samples will be linked by
      identification number to dietary intake and physiologic measures. Though de-identified, this
      data may still be used to identify genetic profiles of individuals with various physiologic
      parameters.

      For OMSI participants only:

      Alive!TM lifestyle intervention data will be used to determine predictors of change in
      physiologic and reported intake measures pre and post-intervention, using analysis of
      variance. At the time of analyses ALL data (including Alive!TM participant data) will be
      de-identified.
