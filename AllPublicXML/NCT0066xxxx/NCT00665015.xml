  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pleural effusion is a common complication of cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to
      determine the prevalence, characteristics and determinants of clinically significant pleural
      effusions, defined as those requiring therapeutic pleural drainage.

      This was a retrospective cohort study of prevalence and characteristics of patients who had a
      pleural effusion after coronary artery bypass graft, valve replacement or both procedures.

      Information was collected on all consecutive patients who underwent CABG surgery and/or valve
      replacement between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005. Demographic information,
      anthropometric parameters, cardiac and renal function assessments, and comorbid conditions
      were retrieved from medical files. We also collected data on the type of procedure, whether
      it was elective or urgent, the number and origin of the grafts, the duration of surgery and
      of cardiopulmonary bypass and the postoperative complications, including pleural effusions.
      Clinical presentation and evolution of the effusions as well as pleural fluid characteristics
      were also studied.

      Patients were considered to have a clinically significant pleural effusion when they met at
      least one of the following criteria: need for thoracentesis, a pleural drainage tube or a
      hospital readmission due to a pleural effusion that occurred within one year of surgery.
