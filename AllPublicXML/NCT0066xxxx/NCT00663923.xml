    <textblock>
      Both eyes of 50 patients(100 eyes) with medium-high compound myopic astigmatism and inclusion
      criteria,will be treated by photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) using excimer laser.It breaks
      chemical bonds within corneal stroma.It's wavelength is 193 nm that is in the ultraviolets
      range with high energy and very low tissue penetrance. The right or left eye of every patient
      would be allocated randomly to one of the study groups using RandList 1.1. In spite of recent
      advances in excimer laser machines and surgical techniques,correction of astigmatism is not
      more successful compared to myopia. In this study we will compare two methods of laser
      correction of astigmatism regarding to visual acuity,residual error and aberrations.

    <measure>Correction of Astigmatism</measure>
    <time_frame>six months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>It shows the result of correction of astigmatism .In compound myopic astigmatism the meridians of maximum and minimum power are both too strong.So both line images fall short of the retina.It is measured by refraction(using autorefractor).Diopter is a unit of measurement of the optical power of any refracting surface ,which is reciprocal of the focal length measured in meters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Higher Order Aberrations</measure>
    <time_frame>six months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Although lower- order aberrations decrease after laser vision correction,higher -order aberrations may increase after conventional PRK or LASIK(Laser in situ keratomileusis).Higher-order aberration is Composed of delicate irregularities within the cornea not correctable by spectacles.It is measured using aberrometer.In this study OPD scan was used that is one of the methods of wavefront analysis .</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corrected Distance Visual Acuity(CDVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>CDVA is attained after correction of refractive errors using lenses of varying powers .the data are the LogMAR values calculated from the snellen chart using the visual acuity conversion chart(the units would be LogMAR).Any patient with better vision can see the smallest letters at 20 feet(20/20=0.00 LogMAR).Higher LogMAR values represent worse outcome.Log MAR(logarithmic minimum angle of resolution)notation ,has gained widespread use in statistical calculations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity (UCDVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>UCDVA is attained without correction of refractive errors .the data are the LogMAR values calculated from the snellen chart using the visual acuity conversion chart( the units would be LogMAR).Any patient with better vision can see the smallest letters at 20 feet(20/20=0.00 LogMAR).Higher LogMAR values represent worse outcome.Log MAR(logarithmic minimum angle of resolution)notation ,has gained widespread use in statistical calculations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgically Induced Astigmatism</measure>
    <time_frame>six months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>It is the vector of the astigmatic change actually induced by the surgery.Participant population was the same as baseline participants.
It was measured by refraction(using autorefractor) and vector analysis(using special software).Diopter is a unit of measurement of the optical power of any refracting surface ,which is reciprocal of the focal length measured in meters</description>

          <title>high order aberration</title>
          <description>Although lower- order aberrations decrease after laser vision correction,higher -order aberrations may increase after conventional PRK or lasik.Higher-order aberration is Composed of delicate irregularities within the cornea not correctable by spectacles.It is measured using aberrometer.In this study OPD scan was used for aberrometry which is one of the methods of wavefront analysis.Participant population was the same as baseline population.</description>

          <title>Surgically Induced Astigmatism</title>
          <description>It is the vector of the astigmatic change actually induced by the surgery.Participant population was the same as baseline participants.
It was measured by refraction(using autorefractor) and vector analysis(using special software).Diopter is a unit of measurement of the optical power of any refracting surface ,which is reciprocal of the focal length measured in meters</description>
