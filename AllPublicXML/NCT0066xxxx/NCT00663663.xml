    <textblock>
      Treatments teaching people how to manage pain have been used to treat chronic pain in the
      general population. The purpose of this study is to see if these treatments delivered over
      the telephone can benefit persons with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or an acquired
      amputation. Specifically, we want to determine if these treatments can help reduce the
      negative consequences that pain often causes in terms of a person's mood, daily activities,
      and enjoyment of life. We are also interested in finding out if these treatments decrease a
      person's pain.

    <description>Intervention 1 will consist of eight 60-minute sessions conducted by phone over eight weeks (1 session/week on average). Intervention 1 will include: (1) education about the role of cognitions (particularly catastrophizing) and pain beliefs (including control) in chronic pain and adjustment; (2) instruction in how to identify negative thinking and cognitive distortions about pain; (3) instruction in thought-stopping and cognitive-restructuring techniques, including challenging negative thoughts and core beliefs about pain; (4) instruction in utilization of positive coping self-statements; (5) relaxation techniques; (6) activity pacing and scheduling; (7) coping with pain flare-ups; and (8) relapse prevention/maintenance of gains. Each intervention 1 session will include a brief relaxation exercise practiced over the phone.</description>

    <description>Intervention 2 will consist of eight 60-minute sessions conducted by phone over eight weeks (1 session/week on average), scheduled at times convenient for participants (including evenings and weekends if necessary). The sessions will cover a variety of topics, including the definition of chronic pain, the physiological processes underlying chronic pain, common pain-related conditions such as sleep disturbance, and the effects of chronic pain.</description>
