  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I pilot study to evaluate the toxicity of two intra-tumoral injections of GSL
      alpha-GAL in patients with advanced or metastatic cutaneous melanoma. Patients who have
      failed standard therapies or are not eligible for standard treatment will be eligible for
      this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A standard Phase I dose escalation model will be used to define the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of GSL alpha-GAL that can be administered directly into the tumor lesion on two
      separate injections separated by 4-weeks. This trial will serve as the basis for future Phase
      II trials utilizing multiple injections of GSL alpha-GAL in refractory solid tumors.

      Additionally, in this study we will look for histologic evidence of an immune response
      against the injected melanoma lesions which matches that seen in mice. Our hypothesis for
      this study is that a second injection of GSL alpha-GAL into a melanoma lesion will not
      precipitate an allergic or autoimmune reaction, but will cause a histologically evident
      immune response to the tumor.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with recurrent melanoma who have failed standard therapies, or are not
             candidates for standard therapies.

          2. Patients must have at least one measurable cutaneous lesion that is accessible and
             suitable for injection of the GSL alpha-GAL.

          3. Patients should not be undergoing any active treatment with chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, or steroids (either because the patient or the treating physician has
             decided not to employ these therapies at this time, or because they had already been
             tried and failed). If they have been treated with these modalities, the treatments
             should have been completed at least two weeks prior to date of injection of GSL
             alpha-GAL.

          4. Patients should be judged by the investigator to be able to undergo safely the
             procedure needed to inject the tumor with GSL alpha-GAL.

          5. Age &gt;18 years old.

          6. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance of &lt;2. International Normalized
             Ratio (INR)&lt;1.5 and a PTT (partial thromboplastin time ) no greater than normal limits
             within 1 week prior to intra-tumoral injection (For patients who may be on blood
             thinners)

          7. Laboratory Criteria (completed &lt;2 weeks before enrollment) Hematologic: (White Blood
             Cell Count) WBC &gt; 3500/mm3 or (absolute neutrophil count) ANC &gt; 1500/mm3 and platelet
             count &gt; 100 000/ mm3 Hepatic: Total bilirubin &lt; 4.0 mg/dl Renal: Creatinine &lt; 2.2
             mg/dl.

          8. Patients must be negative for HIV (circulating antibody), Hepatitis B (circulatory
             antigen), and Hepatitis C (circulating antibody).

          9. Patients should have an expected survival of &gt;6 weeks and should not have other
             systemic anti-tumor treatments planned during this time frame.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible:

          1. Patients who are pregnant or nursing (PRN serum pregnancy test to be done at week -1).

          2. Patients under the age of 18.

          3. Patients with severe infections or septicemia.

          4. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease.

          5. Patients in, or about to be in, active treatment with chemotherapy or steroids.

          6. Patients who refuse HIV/hepatitis testing and patients who do not sign an approved
             consent form

          7. Patient has received other investigational drugs within 14 days before enrollment or
             is expected to participate in an experiment drug study during this study treatment.

          8. Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this
             clinical study.
