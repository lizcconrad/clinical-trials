  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic subjects often report of problems at the workplace or when contracting insurances
      because of their diabetes.

      By distributing a self-report questionnaire to insulin-treated Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic
      subjects we wanted to analyse the frequency of work- and insurance-related discrimination.
      Furthermore we wanted to detect socio-demographic and diabetes-related factors which are
      associated with increased discrimination at workplace and by insurances. We hypothesized that
      diabetes-related discrimination at workplace and by insurances exists and that certain
      factors like having severe hypoglycaemic events, being type 1 diabetic or being overweight
      would be associated with more problems at work or with insurances.

      Our self report questionnaire included 83 items to assess treatment goals, quality of life
      and discrimination at workplace or by insurances. 636 questionnaires were distributed and
      were answered and returned. Anonymity was ensured. Patients were recruited from the diabetes
      outpatient clinic of the University of Basel Hospital, 5 regional hospitals, specialist
      practices and general practitioner practices.

      The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of discrimination at workplace and
      by insurances due to diabetes mellitus. Furthermore we want analyse if socio-demographic
      factors (age,gender,origin) show an impact on diabetes-related discrimination at workplace
      and by insurances. We hypothesize furthermore that certain diabetes-related factors like
      having severe hypoglycemias, being type 1 diabetic, having diabetic complications or being
      overweight/obese is associated with more problems at work and with insurances.

      Data will be analysed by a multiple ordinal regression analysis. We will correct data for
      age, gender, employment status and diabetes type.

        Within a time period of two month we recruited all insulin-treated diabetic patients from
        the outpatient clinic of the University Hospital of Basel (n=203), from 5 regional
        hospitals (n=135) in the North-western part of Switzerland and from 13 specialist practices
        (n=107) as well as from 15 randomly selected general practioner practices (n=64)in the
        mentioned area.
