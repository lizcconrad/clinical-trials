        <description>Accumulation index area under the concentration–time curve of daclatasvir to the end of the dosing period [AI AUC(TAU)] was defined as the ratio of AUC(TAU) at steady-state to AUC(TAU) after the first dose.Accumulation index maximum observed concentration of daclatasvir in plasma (AI Cmax) was defined as the ratio of Cmax at steady-state to Cmax after the first dose. Degree of Fluctuation (DF) was defined as the ratio of difference between Cmax and Cmin at steady state by Css-av.
