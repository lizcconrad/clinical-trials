      Assess the tolerability of quinagolide 200 μg/day in a dose-titration regimen in oocyte
      donors undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and at risk of developing OHSS
      Secondary Objectives

      Estimate the effects of a quinagolide dose-titration regimen compared to placebo in
      peritoneal fluid accumulation, incidence of ascites, OHSS symptoms and clinical laboratory
      parameters of haemoconcentration
