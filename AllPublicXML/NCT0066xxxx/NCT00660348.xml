      RATIONALE: Giving medications in different ways may change their effectiveness in controlling
      pain. It is not yet known whether intrathecal therapy is more effective than standard therapy
      in controlling pain in patients with pancreatic cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying standard pain control to see how well it
      works compared with intrathecal therapy in controlling pain in patients with locally
      advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To compare the effectiveness of pain control comprising intrathecal opioid delivery
           versus the standard analgesia-delivery method in patients with locally advanced,
           unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the difference of a total amount of opioid consumption (parenteral morphine
           equivalent) between two different opioids-delivery groups at one month of treatment.

        -  To assess the average of percent change in Karnofsky performance status with respect to
           the baseline status between two different analgesic-delivery groups at one month of
           treatment.

        -  To assess the difference in quality of life between two different opioids-delivery
           groups at one month of treatment using the EORTC QLQ-C30.

        -  To assess overall survival of these patients.

        -  To assess the safety profile of two different analgesic-delivery methods (i.e., adverse
           event and serious adverse event).

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to Karnofsky performance status (60-80% vs &gt; 80%).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (standard pain management): Patients are evaluated by the JHH Pain Medicine
           Integrated Team for pain, for the potential of diagnostic/neurolytic celiac plexus
           block, and undergo the institution of or modification of or continuation and titration
           of oral or parenteral analgesics. Patients undergo a limited, problem-oriented physical
           exam including weight, vital signs, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), assessment of
           previously abnormal findings or new complaints, pain scores, analgesia consumption, side
           effects (i.e., sleepiness, nausea, pruritus, and constipation), and quality-of-life
           score (EORTC QLQ-C30) once every 2 weeks for 3 months and then once a month thereafter.
           Patients also keep a diary of pain scores and side effects during the trial. Patients
           may have their treatment titrated as needed to control their pain. Patients who are not
           adequately pain controlled or develop debilitating side effects from their therapy may
           be managed by adjuvant analgesics or be allowed to crossover into the treatment arm of
           the study to provide compassionate care.

        -  Arm II (intrathecal therapy): Patients undergo implantation of a Medtronic intrathecal
           pump and catheter system for delivery of morphine sulfate directly into the spinal
           fluid. Following implantation, patients undergo a limited, problem-oriented physical
           exam including vital signs, KPS, assessment of previously abnormal findings or new
           complaints, pain scores, analgesia consumption, and quality-of life-score (EORTC
           QLQ-C30) once every 2 weeks for 3 months and then once a month thereafter. Patients are
           also evaluated by the Interventional Pain Treatment Team for wound status, presence of
           symptoms of post-dural puncture headache, signs of infection, or meningitis. Patients
           are followed by the JHH Pain Medicine Integrated Team for evaluation of pain and for
           institution of or modification of or continuation and titration of oral or parenteral
           analgesics.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 1 year.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of pain control between intrathecal opioid delivery and standard analgesia delivery method in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary end point is the number of subjects on each arm showing a decrease in the change in VAS self-assessment pain intensity rating (VAS pain rating) at one month from initial treatment with respect to the baseline pain score. The change is defined as (the Pain Score at one month of the treatment - the Pain Score at baseline). Serial pain scores will be collected at all assessment time points. Min: zero cm. Max 10cm. A higher value means worse pain. Subjects on each arm will report pain on a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain rating scale, by making a mark on the 10cm horizontal line with a pen and study team will measure distance from the mark to the start of the scale, which will indicate pain score (eg 1 cm, 3 cm 6 cm, etc.).</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects Per Arm With Decrease in Pain Scores</title>
        <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of pain control between intrathecal opioid delivery and standard analgesia delivery method in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary end point is the number of subjects on each arm showing a decrease in the change in VAS self-assessment pain intensity rating (VAS pain rating) at one month from initial treatment with respect to the baseline pain score. The change is defined as (the Pain Score at one month of the treatment - the Pain Score at baseline). Serial pain scores will be collected at all assessment time points. Min: zero cm. Max 10cm. A higher value means worse pain. Subjects on each arm will report pain on a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain rating scale, by making a mark on the 10cm horizontal line with a pen and study team will measure distance from the mark to the start of the scale, which will indicate pain score (eg 1 cm, 3 cm 6 cm, etc.).</description>
        <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
        <population>One subject was enrolled, and baseline pain score was obtained on questionnaire, but the subject came off-study before follow-up pain score could be collected. Study terminated shortly thereafter. No outcome data were collected.</population>

            <title>Intrathecal Pump</title>
            <description>Pump internal used to deliver morphine. This is a newer method for delivery of morphine. Morphine is FDA approved for intrathecal use. The intrathecal pump will be titrated gradually to effect by the interventional pain medicine team. These are the maximum doses and concentrations in keeping with the Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference guidelines: Dose (mg/day):15 ; Conc (mg/cc): 20
Medtronic intrathecal pump: This pump will be inserted into the research subject and then the pump will deliver morphine.</description>
