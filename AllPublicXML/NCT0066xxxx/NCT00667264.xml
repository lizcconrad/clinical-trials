  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research study to determine if putting local anesthetic—or numbing medication—through one or
      two tiny tube(s) placed next to the nerves that go to an amputated limb will decrease phantom
      limb and/or stump pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current standard-of-care treatment, the
      addition of an ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve block decreases post-amputation phantom
      limb and stump pain.

      Hypothesis 1: Following upper or lower extremity amputation, phantom limb and/or stump pain
      will be significantly decreased four weeks following a multiple-day ambulatory continuous
      peripheral nerve block as compared with patients receiving standard-of-care treatment (as
      measured on the 11-point numeric rating scale).

      Specific Aim 2: To investigate the possible relationship between the addition of a
      multiple-day ambulatory continuous peripheral nerve block to standard-of-care treatment of
      post-amputation phantom limb and/or stump pain and cortical reorganization.

      Hypothesis 2: Following upper or lower extremity amputation with subsequent phantom limb
      pain/sensation and/or stump pain, the addition of a multiple-day ambulatory continuous
      peripheral nerve block to standard-of-care treatment will result in cortical reorganization
      during and four-weeks following the perineural infusion (as measured by MRI).
