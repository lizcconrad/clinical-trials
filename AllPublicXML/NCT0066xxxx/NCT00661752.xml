  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new, innovative software image processing method, wide beam reconstruction (WBR), utilizes
      resolution recovery and incorporates Poisson noise-reduction into the reconstruction process
      of NM images. This method facilitates the reconstruction of low count density myocardial
      perfusion SPECT images. Preliminary research indicates that SPECT acquisition time
      consequently can be reduced by 60% (less than 5 minutes) for rest and by 75% (just over 3
      minutes) for stress, while tomographic image quality is maintained, or even improved. Such a
      decrease in image acquisition time decreases patient discomfort during the tomographic
      acquisition, decreases the opportunity for patient motion, and improves laboratory
      efficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard full-time SPECT will be processed using FBP and compared to 3-minute stress and
      5-minute rest scans processed with WBR. The following scan parameters will be evaluated:
      image quality; perfusion defect extent, severity, and reversibility; transient ischemic
      dilatation; left ventricular end-diastolic volume; left ventricular end-systolic volume; left
      ventricular ejection fraction; and regional wall motion and wall thickening abnormalities.
      These parameters will be assessed visually by experienced Nuclear physicians (at least 2
      blinded readers) and quantitatively using several different commercially available software
      programs.
