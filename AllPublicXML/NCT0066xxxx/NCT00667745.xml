      This study evaluated whether lithium included as part of optimized medication treatment
      improved overall level of illness, symptoms of mania and depression, and quality of life in
      people with bipolar disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar illness, a brain disorder that causes dramatic changes in a person's mood and energy,
      affects about 2.6% of adults in the United States. Bipolar disorder is characterized by
      cyclical periods of extreme highs and lows, known as episodes of mania and depression. A
      person undergoing an episode of mania often experiences euphoric moods, increased energy, and
      aggressive behaviors, while a person in a depressed state often experiences low moods, lack
      of energy, and feelings of sadness. Lithium is a widely used mood stabilizing medication that
      has been shown to reduce the occurrence and intensity of manic episodes and may lessen
      depressive episodes as well. Including lithium as a part of a personalized medication
      treatment approach may be the most effective means of improving symptoms of bipolar disorder.
      This study will evaluate whether lithium included as part of optimized medication treatment
      improves overall level of illness, symptoms of mania and depression, and quality of life in
      people with bipolar disorder.

      Participation in this study lasted for 6 months. All participants had an initial assessment
      that included an interview and questionnaires to confirm a diagnosis of bipolar disorder,
      vital sign measurements, a blood draw, and if female, pregnancy. Eligible participants were
      then assigned randomly to receive either optimized medication plus lithium or optimized
      medication without lithium. Participants in both groups received 6 months of monitored
      treatment with their medication regimens, as prescribed by their study doctor. Participants
      attended study visits every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks and then once a month for 4 more
      months. These visits lasted between 45 and 60 minutes and included medication adjustments and
      questions about symptoms, side effects, and quality of life.

    <time_frame>Relevant time points: baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Scale: Clinical Global Impression for Bipolar Disorder Severity (CGI-BP-S) Construct: This scale holistically measures severity of a participant's depression, mania, and overall illness.
Range: 0- not assessed, 1-normal (not at all ill), 2- borderline mentally ill, 3- mildly ill, 4- moderately ill, 5- markedly ill, 6- severely ill, 7- among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Necessary Medication Adjustments</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured over 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Metric Definition (Necessary Clinical Adjustments (NCA)): Medication adjustments to reduce symptoms, optimize treatment response and functioning, or to address intolerable side effects. This was determined with the Medication Recommendation Tracking Form (MRTF), a novel method for capturing physician prescribing behavior and clinical decision making.
Range: whole numbers
Relevant time points: Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Symptoms as Measured Self Report Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured over 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item measure and has a fixed scaling of seven points (from 0 through 6), with 0 representing sypmtoms that are not present and 6 being the most severe symptoms. When completed, the sum of each individual item is taken to create an overall score.
Overall scores:
0 to 6 - normal /symptom absent 7 to 19 - mild depression 20 to 34 - moderate depression &gt;34 - severe depression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mania Symptoms as Measured by the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured over 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale has 11 items and is based on the patient's subjective report of his or her clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale with 0 indicating that symptoms are absent and 8 indicating that symptoms are severe (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale, with 0 indicating that symptoms are absent and 4 indicating that symptoms are severe (Elevated mood, increased motor activity-energy, sexual interest, sleep, language-thought disorder, appearance, and insight). Total scores can vary from 0-60, with 0 indicating that symptoms are completely absent and 60 indicating that the patient is severely manic.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicidality as Measured by the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured over 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Scale for Suicide Ideation (MSSI) assesses the presence of absence of suicide ideation and the degree of severity of suicidal ideas. The time frame is from the point of interview and the previous 48 hours. It uses 13 items from the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) and 5 new items. The modifications increased both reliability and validity. The scale was also changed to range from 0 to 3, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 54. A total score is attained by summing all of the items. A score between 0-8 indicates low suicidal ideation; 9-20 indiciates mild-moderate suicidal ideation; 21+ indicates severe suicidal ideation.</description>

Lithium Carbonate : Lithium was started at 300 mg and then increased to 600 mg after 3 days. Lithium doses were maintained at 600 mg per day for 8 weeks, but may have been adjusted after that time as needed up to a serum level of 1.2 mEq/L.
Optimized Treatment (OPT) : The foundation of OPT was to maintain treatment that will typically include at least one FDA-approved mood stabilizer other than lithium (e.g., divalproex, carbamazepine, risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone) and to follow the recommendations summarized in the evidence-based stages of the Texas Implementation of Medication Algorithm (TIMA) revised guidelines.</description>

There are four items that are graded on a 0 to 8 scale with 0 indicating that symptoms are absent and 8 indicating that symptoms are severe (irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior), while the remaining seven items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale, with 0 indicating that symptoms are absent and 4 indicating that symptoms are severe (Elevated mood, increased motor activity-energy, sexual interest, sleep, language-thought disorder, appearance, and insight). Total scores can vary from 0-60, with 0 indicating that symptoms are completely absent and 60 indicating that the patient is severely manic.</description>

        <title>Suicidality as Measured by the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI)</title>
        <description>The Modified Scale for Suicide Ideation (MSSI) assesses the presence of absence of suicide ideation and the degree of severity of suicidal ideas. The time frame is from the point of interview and the previous 48 hours. It uses 13 items from the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) and 5 new items. The modifications increased both reliability and validity. The scale was also changed to range from 0 to 3, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 54. A total score is attained by summing all of the items. A score between 0-8 indicates low suicidal ideation; 9-20 indiciates mild-moderate suicidal ideation; 21+ indicates severe suicidal ideation.</description>

            <description>Participants received lithium plus optimized medication treatment, as needed. Lithium Carbonate : Lithium was started at 300 mg and then increased to 600 mg after 3 days. Lithium doses were maintained at 600 mg per day for 8 weeks, but may have been adjusted after that time as needed up to a serum level of 1.2 mEq/L.
Optimized Treatment (OPT) : The foundation of OPT was to maintain treatment that will typically include at least one FDA-approved mood stabilizer other than lithium (e.g., divalproex, carbamazepine, risperidone, quetiapine, olanzapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone) and to follow the recommendations summarized in the evidence-based stages of the Texas Implementation of Medication Algorithm (TIMA) revised guidelines.</description>
