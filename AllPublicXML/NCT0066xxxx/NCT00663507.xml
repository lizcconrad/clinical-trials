      The purpose of this research is to better characterize the components and mechanisms of the
      immune systems of persons with sickle cell disease who have had a kidney transplant and are
      immunosuppressed. If we can improve our scientific understanding of the fundamental
      mechanisms involved in patient outcomes, we can potentially maximize the benefits that we
      seek from transplantation in sickle cell patients with end stage renal disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is a common disease in the African-American population. In sickle cell
      disease red blood cells are abnormal in shape and can damage organs. In particular, patients
      with sickle cell disease can have damage to the kidneys, resulting in renal failure. The
      number of patients developing renal failure with sickle cell disease is unknown. This is
      largely due to the high mortality of patients with sickle cell disease and renal failure.

      There are two types of renal replacement therapy available to patients with sickle cell
      disease- dialysis and kidney transplantation. The best form of renal replacement therapy has
      not been determined for patients with sickle cell disease and renal failure. There have been
      approximately 190 renal transplants performed in the United States since 1988 in patients
      with sickle cell disease. Patients do well, but do not survive as long as patients with other
      causes of renal failure. It appears that patients with sickle cell disease who meet the
      criteria for kidney transplantation may derive a benefit from transplantation rather than
      undergoing dialysis.

      We are performing this study to follow patients with sickle cell disease who have received a
      renal transplant. We hope to learn the best way to manage patients with sickle cell disease
      to improve both survival of the transplanted kidney and the patients.

      In addition, we are studying the immune system and how it responds to receiving a kidney
      transplant in sickle cell patients. We hope the information we learn about the immune system
      will allow us to prevent injury to the new kidney transplant and allow for better outcomes in
      sickle cell patients.
