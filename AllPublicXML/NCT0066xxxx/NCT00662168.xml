      This proposed pilot study is to conduct detailed interviews into the medical, environmental,
      and family histories The second phase of this study project is to and to collect blood
      specimen to obtain DNA. The Blood specimen and DNA will be processed by the Rutgers
      University Cell and DNA Repository (RUCDR) and stored for a second phase of this pilot. The
      purpose is to rule out Familial Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN 1), and succinate
      dehydrogenase complex, subunit D (SDHD), gene inactivation thought to be associated with
      different types of carcinoid cancer.

      There have not been any studies published which specifically describe the medical,
      environmental, and genetic factors in carcinoid tumors cases that have carcinoid in family
      members. While rare, with an incidence of four per 100, 000, carcinoid represents the most
      frequent malignancy affecting the small intestine. Because nearly half (49%) of the cases of
      gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors have hepatic metastasis at diagnosis, identification of the
      risk factors associated with carcinoid has the potential to increase early diagnosis and
      cure. Carcinoid tumors are thought to occur spontaneously and not associated with an
      inherited genetic abnormality that would increase a family member's risk for developing
      carcinoid cancer. There is a known inherited genetic abnormality that is associated with
      bronchial carcinoid tumors but only less than 10%. Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors are not
      thought to be associated with a inherited genetic abnormality. There have been several small
      studies that have examined gastrointestinal carcinoid in multiple family members. It remains
      uncertain if these cases of carcinoid in multiple family members are characteristic of a
      heritable or environmental etiology. Most carcinoid cancer is not inherited; however, less
      than 10% of neuroendocrine carcinoid cancer is thought to be due to a change (called a
      &quot;mutation&quot;) in a gene inherited from a parent. There are several genes that are suspected to
      be associated with carcinoid cancer, two of interest in this study is the Multiple Endocrine
      Neoplasia Type1 (MEN1), and succinate dehydrogenase complex, subunit D (SDHD) genes.
