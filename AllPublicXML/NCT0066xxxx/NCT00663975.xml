      Hypothesis:DCI 1020 capsules are safe and effective in treating exocrine pancreatic
      insufficiency in CF patients &lt;= 2 years of age.

      The results of this study are intended to be submitted to the FDA as part of the NDA package
      for marketing approval of PANCRECARB (DCI 1020).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large body of data supporting the safety and efficacy of PANCRECARB® (pancrelipase)
      Capsules is available in patients above age 2. This study is being performed to gather the
      data to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of DCI1020 in pediatric CF patients (≤ 2 years)
      with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. This study also takes into consideration an &quot;age
      appropriate&quot; dosing form. Specifically, the enzymes will be administered orally by opening
      the capsules and emptying the microspheres into a small amount of applesauce as an example of
      a slightly acidic soft food such as jelly, jello, etc. for feeding.

      The results of this study are intended to be submitted to the FDA as part of the NDA package
      for marketing approval of PANCRECARB® DCI 1020(pancrelipase).
