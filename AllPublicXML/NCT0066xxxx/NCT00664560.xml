    <measure>Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Pain Questionnaire Subscore From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain questionnaire has 5 questions on pain all use visual analog scale (VAS) of 100 mm, with 0 mm being &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 mm being &quot;extreme pain&quot;. The outcome measures a change in WOMAC pain at 12 weeks from baseline (in mm). WOMAC is a self-administered, patient-reported health status questionnaire designed to capture elements of pain, stiffness and physical disability in patients with OA of the knee and/or hip joints. It consists of 24 questions (5 questions about pain, 2 on stiffness and 17 about physical function).</description>

         22. Other than noted specifically, any Screening laboratory value that was clinically
             significant in the investigator's opinion and would have endangered a subject if the
