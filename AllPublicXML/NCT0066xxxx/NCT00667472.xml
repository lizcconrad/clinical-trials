    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve port wine stain therapeutic outcome in response to
      laser therapy. The researcher want to determine whether the combined use of pulsed dye laser
      therapy and topical ranibizumab will improve port wine stain therapeutic outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combined use of pulsed dye laser to induce port wine stain blood vessel injury, and
      ranibizumab to prevent port wine stain blood vessel angiogenesis and recanalization after
      laser therapy, will improve port wine stain lesion blanching.

      After pulsed dye laser treatment of the entire port wine stain, topical ranibizumab will be
      applied to two of the test sites for two weeks following pulsed dye laser therapy. The degree
      of port wine stain blanching which will be quantified objectively using visible reflectance
      spectroscopy measurements. port wine stain test site blanching responses following the
      combined use of pulsed dye laser and topical ranibizumab will be compared with pulsed dye
      laser only and with the baseline controls.
