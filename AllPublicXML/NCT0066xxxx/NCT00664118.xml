  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence indicated that neuraxial analgesia in the latent phase of the first
      stage of labor would be an effective and safe health care procedure for nulliparas. Doulas,
      women with labor experience trained for parturients, is a new way to alleviate the
      psychological stress from the laboring pain. Previous data in our study showed that doula
      accompany is a good method in shortening the progress of labor used in the active phrase of
      the first stage of labor, and decreasing the rate of cesarean delivery. Investigators
      hypothesized that doula combined neuraxial (epidural) analgesia in the latent phrase would be
      a superior means for effective pain relief, decreased rate of cesarean section, and shortened
      duration of labor.
