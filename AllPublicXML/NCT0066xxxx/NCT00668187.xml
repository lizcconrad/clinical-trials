      Hypothesis: To characterize and describe disease progression and heterogeneity of the
      gangliosidosis diseases.

      This research study seeks to develop a quantitative method to delineate disease progression
      for the gangliosidosis diseases (Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, and GM1 gangliosidosis)
      in order to better understand the natural history and heterogeneity of these diseases. Such a
      quantitative method will also be essential for evaluating any treatments that may become
      available in the future, such as gene therapy. The data from this study will be necessary to
      provide end-points for future therapies, guide medical decisions about treatment, provide
      objective measurement of treatment outcomes, and accurately inform parents regarding
      potential outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The infantile form of GM2 and GM1 gangliosidosis diseases (&quot;classic&quot; infantile) is the most
      common. Infants with Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease or GM1 gangliosidosis appear normal
      at birth, but at approximately 6-10 months of age begin to manifest progressive weakness and
      loss of muscle strength, such as loss of the ability to sit up or turn over. They may
      evidence deafness, and display decreased attentiveness. This is followed by rapid
      deterioration of motor skills and slowed mental development (neurodegeneration), often with
      seizures. Retinal involvement leads to visual impairment and eventual blindness. Death
      typically occurs by the age of five. Currently there is no treatment for Tay-Sachs disease,
      Sandhoff disease or GM1 gangliosidosis.

      Late Onset Tay-Sachs disease (&quot;LOTS&quot;) occurs in patients beginning in their twenties or
      thirties, and is characterized by poor motor coordination and psychotic behaviors. Patients
      with LOTS also have decreased life expectancy, although to a lesser degree than those with
      infantile or juvenile Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff diseases. Currently there is no treatment for
      LOTS.

      This study is comprised of two different 'arms.' The first arm, entitled Aim 1, will focus on
      the developmental course of infantile and juvenile Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, and
      GM1 gangliosidosis. Longitudinal data from individuals with these diseases will be collected
      in order to delineate the natural history of these diseases. This data will help to objectify
      disease progression, and can be used to create a disease stage and severity index.

      The second arm, entitled Aim 2, will focus on LOTS and will seek to understand the
      progression of central nervous system disease, with special focus upon cerebellar and frontal
      systems. This will be accomplished by using quantitative methods including neuroimaging and
      neuropsychological measures that explore motor and executive functions, visual-spatial and
      emotional-behavioral dysfunction.

    <time_frame>Upon enrollment; then at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychological testing data will be collected at baseline and annually, that measure fine and gross motor skills, visual tracking and attention, verbal and non-verbal communication, and emotional and social behaviors. For infantile and juvenile Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease and GM1 gangliosidosis-affected subjects, age- and ability-appropriate neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental testing will include instruments such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Third Edition), and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales.</description>

    <measure>Ascertainment of Enzyme Activity Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>If either of the following diagnostic measures have been performed in the course of subjects' clinical care not connected with this study, the resulting data will be collected: for Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease-affected patients, levels of hexosaminidase enzyme activity; or for GM1 gangliosidosis-affected patients, levels of Î²-galactosidase enzyme activity. Determinations of these enzyme activity levels are a requisite part of the diagnostic process in all of the gangliosidosis diseases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon enrollment; then at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical assessments will be performed that measure initial symptomology, along with the appearance and evolution of symptoms over time. For infants and juveniles, these may include: evaluation of motor control, gain and/or loss of developmental milestones, hyperacusis, seizures, macrocephaly, the appearance of retinal &quot;cherry-red spots&quot; ascertained by ocular exam, personal interaction, and reflexes.
For adults, assessments may include: coordination, psychological disorder, verbal skills, muscle wasting with weakness, fasciculations, and posture abnormalities.</description>

    <time_frame>Upon enrollment; then at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>For infantile and juvenile Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease and GM1 gangliosidosis-affected subjects, if any MRI brain imaging is performed during the course of subjects' clinical care not connected with this study, these MRI brain imaging data will be captured for this study. Any developmental abnormality, and the volumes of specific brain structures imaged, will be measured and the resulting data recorded. If data from multiple MRI examinations performed at different times in any given patient's life become available, the resulting brain structure measurements will be compared across time, and analyzed in order to reveal progressive changes in brain structure, if any have occurred.</description>
