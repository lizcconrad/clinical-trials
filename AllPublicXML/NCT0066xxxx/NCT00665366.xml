    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (LOCF Data Set)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is a clinician-administered scale, consisting of 11 multiple choice items, and used to assess a patient's manic symptoms and clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Total scores range from 0 to 60, with 12 or greater signifying hypomania or mania. Each item is given a severity rating ranging from 0 to 8 or 0 to 4. Items for the scale are based on the core symptoms of mania: elevated mood, increased motor activity, sexual interest, sleep, irritability, speech (rate and amount), language-though disorder, content, disruptive-aggressive behavior, appearance, and insight. Scores for each item reflect the severity of that symptom in the patient. The test is administered during a clinical interview typically lasting 15-30 minutes. LOCF=last observation carried forward.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total and Subscale Scores on the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST)(LOCF Data Set)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FAST is an interview-administered instrument used to assess the main functioning problems that patients with bipolar disorder experience. Participants are rated at Baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 9, and Week 12/End of Study Visit. The FAST consists of 24 items that assess impairment or disability in 6 specific areas of functioning, categorized as the subscales: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal (IP) relationships, and leisure time. All items are rated using a 4-point scale, 0=no difficulty, 1=mild difficulty, 2=moderate difficulty, and 3=severe difficulty. The global score is the sum of the scores of all items and ranges from 0 (0*24)to 96 (4*24). The higher the global score, the higher the level of impairment. function=functioning. LOCF=last observation carried forward.</description>

          <description>Participants randomly received aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy to current ongoing treatment with valproate or lithium for 12 weeks. Aripiprazole was provided in 5-, 10-, or 15-mg oral tablets and administered at a starting dose of 5 mg per day for Week 1. For Weeks 2 through 3, the dose was titrated up to 10 mg per day, and for Weeks 4 through 6, the dose increased to 15 mg per day. Flexible doses of either 15 or 30 mg per day were administered for Weeks 7 through 12. If participants were unable to tolerate the dose of 15 mg per day of study drug, the dose was decreased to 10 mg per day for Weeks 7 through 12.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Score on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) (LOCF Data Set)</title>
        <description>The YMRS is a clinician-administered scale, consisting of 11 multiple choice items, and used to assess a patient’s manic symptoms and clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Total scores range from 0 to 60, with 12 or greater signifying hypomania or mania. Each item is given a severity rating ranging from 0 to 8 or 0 to 4. Items for the scale are based on the core symptoms of mania: elevated mood, increased motor activity, sexual interest, sleep, irritability, speech (rate and amount), language-though disorder, content, disruptive-aggressive behavior, appearance, and insight. Scores for each item reflect the severity of that symptom in the patient. The test is administered during a clinical interview typically lasting 15-30 minutes.

        <description>Adjusted mean change. The CGI-BP is a scale used to assess a clinician's impression of a patient's illness. Each patient is rated at baseline and at subsequent visits on items related to severity of depression, mania, and overall bipolar illness. The CGI-BP is a 7-point scale, with scores ranging from 1=normal/not ill to 7=very severely ill. Higher total score indicates greater severity of illness.

Aripiprazole was provided in 5-, 10-, or 15-mg oral tablets and administered at a starting dose of 5 mg per day for Week 1. For Weeks 2 through 3, the dose was titrated up to 10 mg per day, and for Weeks 4 through 6, the dose increased to 15 mg per day. Flexible doses of either 15 or 30 mg per day were administered for Weeks 7 through 12.

        <description>The FAST is an interview-administered instrument used to assess the main functioning problems that patients with bipolar disorder experience. Participants are rated at Baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 9, and Week 12/End of Study Visit. The FAST consists of 24 items that assess impairment or disability in 6 specific areas of functioning, categorized as the subscales: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal (IP) relationships, and leisure time. All items are rated using a 4-point scale, 0=no difficulty, 1=mild difficulty, 2=moderate difficulty, and 3=severe difficulty. The global score is the sum of the scores of all items and ranges from 0 (0*24)to 96 (4*24). The higher the global score, the higher the level of impairment. function=functioning. LOCF=last observation carried forward.</description>

            <description>Participants randomly received aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy to current ongoing treatment with valproate or lithium for 12 weeks. Aripiprazole was provided in 5-, 10-, or 15-mg oral tablets and administered at a starting dose of 5 mg per day for Week 1. For Weeks 2 through 3, the dose was titrated up to 10 mg per day, and for Weeks 4 through 6, the dose increased to 15 mg per day. Flexible doses of either 15 or 30 mg per day were administered for Weeks 7 through 12. If participants were unable to tolerate the dose of 15 mg per day of study drug, the dose was decreased to 10 mg per day for Weeks 7 through 12.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Showing A Response From Baseline on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)(OC Data Set)</title>
        <description>Response on the YMRS is defined as a 50% or greater improvement from baseline in YMRS total score. The YMRS is clinician-administered and consists of 11 multiple choice items. It is used to assess a patient’s manic symptoms and clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Total scores range from 0 to 60, with 12 or greater signifying hypomania or mania. Each item is given a severity rating ranging from 0 to 8 or 0 to 4. Items for the scale are based on the core symptoms of mania: elevated mood, increased motor activity, sexual interest, sleep, irritability, speech (rate and amount), language-thought disorder, content, disruptive-aggressive behavior, appearance, and insight. Scores for each item reflect the severity of that symptom in the patient. The test is administered during a clinical interview typically lasting 15-30 minutes. OC=observed cases.</description>

Aripiprazole was provided in 5-, 10-, or 15-mg oral tablets and administered at a starting dose of 5 mg per day for Week 1. For Weeks 2 through 3, the dose was titrated up to 10 mg per day, and for Weeks 4 through 6, the dose increased to 15 mg per day. Flexible doses of either 15 or 30 mg per day were administered for Weeks 7 through 12. If participants were unable to tolerate the dose of 15 mg per day of study drug, the dose was decreased to 10 mg per day for Weeks 7 through 12.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Showing Remission in the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Score From Baseline (LOCF Data Set)</title>
        <description>Remission is defined as a YMRS total score of 12 or less. The YMRS is clinician-administered and consists of 11 multiple choice items. It is used to assess a patient’s manic symptoms and clinical condition over the previous 48 hours. Total scores range from 0 to 60, with 12 or greater signifying hypomania or mania. Each item is given a severity rating ranging from 0 to 8 or 0 to 4. Items for the scale are based on the core symptoms of mania: elevated mood, increased motor activity, sexual interest, sleep, irritability, speech (rate and amount), language-thought disorder, disruptive-aggressive behavior, appearance, and insight. Scores for each item reflect the severity of that symptom in the patient. The test is administered during a clinical interview typically lasting 15-30 minutes. LOCF=last observation carried forward.</description>

Aripiprazole was provided in 5-, 10-, or 15-mg oral tablets and administered at a starting dose of 5 mg per day for Week 1. For Weeks 2 through 3, the dose was titrated up to 10 mg per day, and for Weeks 4 through 6, the dose increased to 15 mg per day. Flexible doses of either 15 or 30 mg per day were administered for Weeks 7 through 12. If participants were unable to tolerate the dose of 15 mg per day of study drug, the dose was decreased to 10 mg per day for Weeks 7 through 12.</description>

          <description>Adjusted Mean Scores. The PGI-I is a self-administered 7-point scale, with scores ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), that assesses the improvement or worsening of a patient's illness relative to baseline at the beginning of the intervention. Scores: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; or 7=very much worse. OC=observed cases.</description>

Aripiprazole was provided in 5-, 10-, or 15-mg oral tablets and administered at a starting dose of 5 mg per day for Week 1. For Weeks 2 through 3, the dose was titrated up to 10 mg per day, and for Weeks 4 through 6, the dose increased to 15 mg per day. Flexible doses of either 15 or 30 mg per day were administered for Weeks 7 through 12. If participants were unable to tolerate the dose of 15 mg per day of study drug, the dose was decreased to 10 mg per day for Weeks 7 through 12.</description>
