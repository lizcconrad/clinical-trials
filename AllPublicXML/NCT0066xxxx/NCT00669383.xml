    <textblock>
      One course of steroids given to a mother before a premature delivery helps the lungs of the
      premature infant and decreases breathing problems. One course of antenatal steroids is the
      standard of care for threatened premature deliveries. It is unclear as to how long the
      benefit of one course of steroids last. The most benefit to the baby's lungs seem to occur if
      the steroids are given at least 24 hours before but within 7 days of a premature delivery. It
      is difficult to predict the timing of a preterm delivery so deliveries often do not occur
      within this time period. We hypothesize that the benefits of the steroids to the lungs wear
      off if the steroids are given more than 14 days before a preterm delivery, and that in these
      circumstances an extra course of steroids will help the premature baby's lungs and the
      premature baby will have less breathing problems as shown by lung function testing.

      The primary purpose of this randomized, blinded placebo controlled trial is to quantify and
      compare measurements of pulmonary function (including respiratory compliance and lung
      volumes/functional residual capacity) of hospitalized preterm infants whose mothers received
      an initial course of antenatal corticosteroids, remained undelivered after 14 days and at &lt;
      34 weeks of gestation, and were then randomized to either a rescue course of antenatal
      corticosteroids or to a rescue course of placebo. In addition, follow-up pulmonary function
      tests, clinical outcomes, growth parameters, and the neurodevelopmental outcome of these
      infants will be followed.
