  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a non-randomized, open label trial that will examine the potential to
      reduce metabolic risk factors in patients with bipolar I disorder and improve psychiatric and
      functional outcomes. To accomplish our objective, we plan to conduct a 5-month intervention
      of 50 obese or overweight adults diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The study will be divided
      in three steps: Screening, Baseline Period (cross taper to aripiprazole, up to 2 months in
      duration), Months 1-3 (continued aripiprazole treatment). Subjects will be assessed and meet
      with their study psychiatrist at least bi-monthly throughout their participation, more
      frequently when clinically necessary (e.g. during medication tapering or if manic/depressive
      symptoms emerge). Brief clinical assessments will be conducted at each visit. More thorough
      assessments will be conducted at Baseline, Week 2, and Month 3.

    <description>All subjects will be assessed at baseline and then switched from their current antimanic agent to aripiprazole. Arpipirazole will be titrated from a starting dose of 5 mg/day up to a target dose of 15 mg/day over a period of up to 2 months (approximately 8 weeks). Concomitant medication will not be changed unless medically necessary. If a subject is taking an antipsychotic in addition to divalproex, aripiprazole will replace the antipsychotic.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 to 65 years

          2. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;=25;

          3. Currently taking a regimen of medications for bipolar disorder likely to cause,
             sedation, weight gain or undesirable metabolic effects;

          4. Able to give basic informed consent

          5. Meets DSM-IV criteria for lifetime bipolar I or II disorder and are presently in
             sustained remission (CGI BP&lt;3 in the previous 8-week period measured through a
             complete psychiatric history at screening and patient report.)

          6. Epworth Scale Score &gt; 7

          7. Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a doctor-approved birth control
             throughout participation in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements (i.e., complete forms, attend
             scheduled evaluations)

          2. Not competent to provide informed consent in the opinion of the investigator

          3. Ultra-rapid cycling (&gt;4 episodes per month) bipolar I disorder

          4. Unstable and severe medical illness that requires immediate and intensive medical
             attention, When appropriate, the patients can be reconsidered for inclusion in the
             study if/when their medical condition becomes compatible with participation in a
             protocol-driven research study

          5. Women who are planning to become pregnant, currently pregnant, or breast-feeding;

          6. Current substance dependence; however, if a subject only has substance abuse/use,
             after the first positive drug screen, another drug screen will be repeated. If that
             drug screen is positive, the subject will be excluded. If the second drug screen is
             negative, the subject will be considered for the study;

          7. Subjects who have previously failed an adequate trial of aripiprazole.

          8. Subjects with a suicide attempt in the past 2 years;

          9. Subjects with a history of inpatient admission in the past 1 year;

         10. Subjects with a history of homicidal ideation;

         11. Any subject for whom the PI deems that the potential risks in participating in the
             study outweigh the potential benefits.

Aripiprazole: All subjects will be assessed at baseline and then switched from their current antimanic agent to aripiprazole. Arpipirazole will be titrated from a starting dose of 5 mg/day up to a target dose of 15 mg/day over a period of up to 2 months (approximately 8 weeks). Concomitant medication will not be changed unless medically necessary. If a subject is taking an antipsychotic in addition to divalproex, aripiprazole will replace the antipsychotic.</description>
