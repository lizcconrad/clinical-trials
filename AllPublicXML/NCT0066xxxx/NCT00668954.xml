      This is a research study designed to look at how pomegranate juice (or a placebo juice)
      affects the body through the measurement of specific biomarkers, which are indicators of
      health.

      This research study will evaluate how pomegranate juice (or a placebo juice) affects the
      body. Participants will be asked to drink 8 oz. of juice daily for 12 weeks. Biomarkers,
      which are indicators of health, will be measured throughout the study. They are present in
      blood and urine. The placebo is a juice that is not made from pomegranates, but resembles
      pomegranate juice in color and taste. Eating pomegranates has been shown to have a positive
      impact on certain biomarkers. Recent studies have shown that biomarkers can be indicators of
      general health. The investigators want to know if drinking pomegranate juice daily for 12
      weeks is effective at improving a variety of biomarkers in diabetic adults.
