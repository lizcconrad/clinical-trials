      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if patients randomized to a hospital sleep
      environment intervention would have improved sleep quality and reduced fatigue as compared to

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if patients randomized to a hospital sleep
      environment intervention would have improved sleep quality and reduced fatigue as compared to
      the patients not receiving the intervention (standard care).

      All patients enrolled on SJMB03 and admitted to receive either the 2nd or 3rd course of
      chemotherapy will be eligible for the study. The patients are admitted for four to six days
      and all participants will wear an actigraph to collect information on 8 sleep quality
      indicators for each of the six days. In addition, fatigue measurements will also be collected
      and compared between the two groups. Given the nature of the intervention, it is difficult to
      follow the traditional randomization scheme and randomize eligible patients to the
      intervention or standard care because there is a high likelihood of design contamination
      secondary to interactions among family members and among the nurses in regards to the
      different care for the study participants in the two study groups. Therefore, this study will
      use a group randomized trial design with patients randomized by month. That is, all patients
      admitted in a month randomized to be an intervention month will receive the intervention and
      all patients admitted to a standard care month will not receive the intervention. This type
      of randomization plan has notable strengths that match this study design but it also has two
      potential challenges: 1) patients randomized within the last five days of each month will
      continue to receive the assigned treatment to which they were randomized although this
      treatment assignment will continue into a different month that could have been randomized to
      the same or different condition as the previous month, and 2) with random assignments of
      months to the two treatment arms, there is a possibility of an unequal distribution of
      patients randomized to the two groups.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients between the ages of 4 and 21 years who are enrolled on SJMB03 and to be
             admitted for either Course 2 or Course 3 of high dose chemotherapy and stem cell
             rescue.

          -  English - speaking and able to understand English items on the study instruments as
             these are only available in English.

          -  Patients willing to give assent to participate in the study and whose parents are
             willing to give permission according to institutional guidelines for their child to
             participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability or unwillingness of research participant or legal guardian/representative to
             give written informed consent.

          -  Patients experiencing serious neurological effects such as posterior fossa syndrome
             that interfere with their ability to self-report on fatigue and mood.

          -  Patient is bedridden and unable to participate in an activity.

          -  Patients or parents who would find participating in the consent process too
             emotionally demanding as determined by the treatment team.
