      Methodology: This study will be a randomized, multi-center evaluation comparing N2vac
      polyethylene inserts and patellas with X3 inserts and patellas when used in the Triathlon PS
      total knee system.

      Study Duration: 12-18 month enrollment period + 10 year follow-up for each case years total
      duration

      Multi-centre study

      Objectives

      Primary: To compare the 10 year implant survival of the Triathlon PS total knee system when
      X3 polyethylene components are used to the same knee system when N2Vac components are used.

      Secondary: To compare pain, function, radiographic outcomes, and health related quality of
      life of subjects in both treatment groups. Safety will be assessed by comparison of adverse
      events between the groups.

      Number of Subjects 384 cases (197 each group)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject requires a primary cemented total knee replacement.

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA), traumatic arthritis (TA), or
             avascular necrosis (AVN).

          -  The subject has intact collateral ligaments.

          -  The subject has signed the ethic committee approved, study specific Informed Patient
             Consent Form.

          -  The subject is willing and able to comply with post-operative scheduled clinical and
             radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has inflammatory arthritis.

          -  The subject is morbidly obese, BMI &gt; 40.

          -  The subject has a history of total or unicompartmental reconstruction of the affected
             joint.

          -  The subject has had a high tibial osteotomy or femoral osteotomy.

          -  The subject has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, that would limit the
             ability to assess the performance of the device.
