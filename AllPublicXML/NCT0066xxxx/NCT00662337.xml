      Subjects were required to observe a ten-hour fast and a one-hour fluid restriction prior to
      each dosing period.

      Subjects were randomized into one of two active treatment groups, received supervised dosing
      of their treatment with approximately eight ounces of water, and were required to maintain
      fluid restriction for one hour after treatment. Following the one-hour post-dose fluid
      restriction, subjects could drink water, but consumer no other food or fluids for four hours
      post-dose.

      Following a seven-day washout period, the comparison treatment was administered according to
      the same procedure as above.
