  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to study an experimental vasectomy device called the
      Vas-X. This is an experimental study of this new approach to vasectomy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Vas-X works by stripping the lining of the vas deferens, the tube that sperm pass through
      during ejaculation. It is used in a way very similar to routine vasectomy, however, in a
      routine vasectomy, the vas is burned with an electrical device. With the Vas-X, there is no
      burning. The investigators are testing the Vas-X to determine whether it will offer a better
      way of performing a vasectomy.

      The investigators will conduct this study at the University of Washington Medical Center,
      Seattle.
