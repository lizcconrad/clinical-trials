  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once-monthly
      administration of intravenous Mircera for the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in
      hemodialysis patients with chronic renal anemia. Patients will receive 4-weekly intravenous
      injections of Mircera, at a starting dose of 120, 200 or 360 micrograms. The anticipated time
      on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Their Mean Hemoglobin Concentration Within +/- 1.0 Gram/Deciliter of Their Reference Hemoglobin Concentration and Between 10.0 and 12.0 Gram/Deciliter During the Efficacy Evaluation Period</measure>
    <time_frame>EEP (Week 16 to Week 24)</time_frame>
    <description>The reference hemoglobin (Hb) value was taken as the time adjusted average of all Hb assessments during the SVP (Week -4 to Week 0). The time adjusted average Hb concentration of all the values recorded during the efficacy evaluation period (EEP) was calculated for each participant and their reference Hb concentration was subtracted from this value. The percentage of participants maintaining their average Hb concentration during the EEP within +/- 1 gram/deciliter (g/dL) of their reference Hb concentration and between the Hb range 10.0 -12.0 g/dL is presented. The EEP was defined as Week 16 to Week 24. Data missing at the end of the EEP was handled using the last value carried forward method, including any data missing due to withdrawal of participants following red blood cells (RBC) transfusion.</description>

    <description>Eligible participants were administered Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator (C.E.R.A.) at a dose of 120, 200, or 360 microgram (mcg), intravenously (IV), every 4 weeks i.e. Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 but not on Weeks 24 and 28. The initial dose of C.E.R.A.was based on the last dose of the previous Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA). The ESA therapy was administered from enrollment to the 4 weeks stability verification period (SVP), weekly, either as epoetin (&lt;8000 IU, 8000-16000 IU, or &gt;16000 IU) or darbepoetin alpha (&lt;40 mcg, 40-80 mcg, or &gt;80 mcg). A telephone follow-up visit took place 4 weeks after the end of C.E.R.A. treatment (Week 28).</description>

          <description>Eligible participants were administered Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator (C.E.R.A.) at a dose of 120, 200, or 360 microgram (mcg), intravenously (IV), every 4 weeks i.e. Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 but not on Weeks 24 and 28. The initial dose of C.E.R.A.was based on the last dose of the previous Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA). The ESA therapy was administered from enrollment to the 4 weeks stability verification period (SVP), weekly, either as epoetin (&lt;8000 IU, 8000-16000 IU, or &gt;16000 IU) or darbepoetin alpha (&lt;40 mcg, 40-80 mcg, or &gt;80 mcg). A telephone follow-up visit took place 4 weeks after the end of C.E.R.A. treatment (Week 28).</description>

        <description>The reference hemoglobin (Hb) value was taken as the time adjusted average of all Hb assessments during the SVP (Week -4 to Week 0). The time adjusted average Hb concentration of all the values recorded during the efficacy evaluation period (EEP) was calculated for each participant and their reference Hb concentration was subtracted from this value. The percentage of participants maintaining their average Hb concentration during the EEP within +/- 1 gram/deciliter (g/dL) of their reference Hb concentration and between the Hb range 10.0 -12.0 g/dL is presented. The EEP was defined as Week 16 to Week 24. Data missing at the end of the EEP was handled using the last value carried forward method, including any data missing due to withdrawal of participants following red blood cells (RBC) transfusion.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Hematocrit at Week 16 and Week 24</title>
          <description>The hematocrit, also called packed cell volume or erythrocyte volume fraction, is the volume percentage of red blood cells in the blood. Mean change from Baseline (BL) in hematocrit was calculated as the value at a specific week during the study minus the BL value. The BL was defined as Week -4 to Week 0.</description>

The initial dose of C.E.R.A.was based on the last dose of the previous Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agent (ESA). The ESA therapy was administered from enrollment to the 4 weeks stability verification period (SVP), weekly, either as epoetin (&lt;8000 IU, 8000-16000 IU, or &gt;16000 IU) or darbepoetin alpha (&lt;40 mcg, 40-80 mcg, or &gt;80 mcg).

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who is administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events</title>
          <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who is administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
