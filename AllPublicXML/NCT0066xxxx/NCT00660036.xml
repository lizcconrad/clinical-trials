      The purpose of this study is to investigate the combination of gemtuzumab ozogamicin,
      mitoxantrone and etoposide as second line therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of mitoxantrone and etoposide is an active regimen in refractory/relapsed AML
      patients. In order to improve the efficacy of mitoxantrone and etoposide as second line
      therapy in patients with AML we proposed to conduct a phase I/II clinical trial combining
      gemtuzumab ozogamicin with mitoxantrone and etoposide. The phase I portion of the trial will
      determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin combined with mitoxantrone and
      etoposide and the phase II portion of the trial will determine the efficacy and safety of the
      combined regimen in patients with AML.
