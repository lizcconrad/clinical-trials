      Optimized treatment algorithm in early rheumatoid arthritis:

      Methotrexate and intra-articular glucocorticosteroid plus adalimumab or placebo in the
      treatment of early rheumatoid arthritis.

      A Randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled, two arms, parallel group study of the
      additive effect of adalimumab concerning inflammatory control and inhibition of erosive
      development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis patients it is recommended to treat as soon as
      possible with methotrexate and steroids However, this treatment algorithm, will only bring
      one third of the patients into remission and cannot stop progressive, persistent joint
      damage. The possible benefits and risks of adding adalimumab to this conventional treatment
      algorithm is unknown.

      The aim of the study is to clarify the possible benefits of adding adalimumab an
      anti-TNF-alfa inhibitor versus placebo to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients, who
      are treated very early and given methotrexate and intraarticular triamcinolone hexacetonide.
      Efficacy will be evaluated by DAS 28, ACR 20/50/70, HAQ, progressive changes in X-ray, MRI
      and DXA-scans.

      Adverse events will also be registered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients (more than 18 years) with rheumatoid arthritis according to the ACR
        classification criteria (1) who have had the diagnose &lt; 6 months.

        2. Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis defined as DAS28 (CRP-based) &gt; 3.2.

        3. Negative pregnancy test (serum HCG) for women of childbearing potential prior to trial

        women included in the trial should use contraception during the entire trial period (i.e.
        one of the following methods: Oral contraception, intrauterine device (IUD), depot
        injection of progesterone, subdermal implantation, contraceptive vaginal ring, transdermal
        depot plaster). In addition, contraception should be used for a period of 150 days after
        any discontinuation of trial medicine.
