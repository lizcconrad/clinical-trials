          3. Willingness to have HIV testing performed, if HIV serostatus is not known or if the
             last documented negative HIV test was more than 6 months prior to enrollment.

          4. Residence within the Durban Functional Region (Durban Metropolitan Area) or Tugela

               3. Platelet count of ≥ 80,000/mm3

               4. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/ mm3

               5. Negative pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential)

         10. Able to provide informed consent or legally authorized representative able to do so if

             serotonin uptake inhibitors (citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and
             sertraline), amitriptyline, bupropion, mirtazepine, levodopa, carbidopa, sinemet, or
             herbal medications.

          4. Significant peripheral neuropathy as evidenced by &lt; 5 seconds of vibratory sense to a
             128 Hz tuning fork on either big toe

          5. Pain, aching or burning of the feet that interfere with walking or sleep.

          6. In the judgment of the physician the patient is not expected to survive for more than
             4 weeks.

          7. Anticipated surgical intervention for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis

          8. Visual acuity of 20/200 (6/60 meters) best corrected vision or less.

             plates

         10. Participation in another drug trial.

         11. The patient has received second line TB drugs for &gt; 7 days immediately prior to
             enrollment (note: use of first line drugs such as INH, Rifampin, PZA, or ethambutol
             for &gt; 7 days immediately prior to enrollment is allowed)
