  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid and volume management are a challenging part of critical care and the difficulties
      increase in the face of renal failure. Utilizing the Crit-Line to monitor blood volume
      changes in conjunction with arterial pressure cardiac output monitoring may lead to better
      understanding of the impact fluid removal during dialysis has on hemodynamics.

    <textblock>
      Patients in an ICU often require large amounts of IV fluid to maintain adequate cardiac
      function. In patients with renal failure, the ability to gauge adequacy of circulating blood
      volume based on urine output is obviously lacking. The FDA approved devices called
      Flotrac/Vigileo and Crit-Line are used in this setting to determine adequacy of fluid
      resuscitation. This study proposes to use the data collected in a retrospective manner to
      determine if correlation of the various measured parameters can serve as a predictor of
      hemodynamic status.
