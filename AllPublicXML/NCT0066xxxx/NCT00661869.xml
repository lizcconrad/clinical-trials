  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is increasing at an alarming rate in patients with schizophrenia, possibly in
      association with the increased use of atypical antipsychotics. In order to address the weight
      and metabolic syndrome issues, Manhattan Psychiatric Center (MPC) has implemented the
      Solutions for Wellness and Team Solutions Program. This program is designed to create a
      supportive, educational and monitoring environment to stabilize both the psychiatric and
      medical conditions and to prepare patients for independent management of their psychiatric
      and physical health condition in the community.

    <textblock>
      The present program is divided into five detailed segments with three progressive levels,
      that provide a manualized lesson-by-lesson curriculum for implementation on the treatment
      mall.

        -  Medication Education

        -  Symptom recognition and management

        -  Living Healthy

        -  Interpersonal Skills

        -  Discharge Preparation

      The program comprised of detailed instructor and patient manuals, specific curriculums and
      pre- and post-tests to determine acquisition of the learned materials. All modules are
      imbedded in weekly small group sessions.

        -  Each of the 5 modules are discussed in groups in weekly morning or afternoon session,
           Monday through Friday.

        -  Each module is divided into three 12-week periods for a total of 36 sessions.

        -  Upon completing 12 weeks at Level 1, each patient moves to Level 2 and then Level 3 for
           12 weeks each.

        -  Each group has two trained instructors.

        -  Number of patients per group: ≤ 15.

        -  Sessions are interspersed within the patient's regular treatment mall classes
