      The purpose of this clinical study is to compare, in a controlled fashion, the response to
      three concentrations of methotrexate in novel topical formulations in the treatment of
      subjects with psoriasis of the fingernails. Such a determination will be used as the basis
      for evidence of efficacy and safety of these formulations as a therapeutic treatment for
      fingernail psoriasis.
