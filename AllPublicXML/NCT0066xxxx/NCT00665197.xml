      Hypothesis: In the management of advanced oesophageal cancer, to determine if a shorter
      regime of external beam radiotherapy (using higher daily doses, and combined with
      intraluminal high dose rate brachytherapy) is not inferior in the palliation of dysphagia
      than a more protracted course of external beam radiotherapy (using lower daily doses and
      combined with equal intraluminal high dose rate brachytherapy).

      This is a prospective, pragmatic and multi-centre clinical trial, without blinding or masking
      to the randomly assigned treatment. Patient registration and randomization are centralized.
      There are two arms to the study, expecting an equal numbers of patients randomized to each
      arm. Stratification will by according to: (1) treating institution/country, and (2) baseline
      Stage (M1 = distant metastases versus M0 = no distant metastases). The primary statistical
      analysis will be conducted as an &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; clinical trial.

      A cost-effectiveness analysis is not required because the main contrast is between 5 and 10
      fractions of EBRT, where 5 fractions are less expensive than 10 fractions. This protocol
      follows the recommendations of CONSORT for the reporting of non-inferiority and equivalence
      trials. The active control is 30 Gy in 10 fractions, and the new therapy is 20 Gy in 5
      fractions.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Endoscopic and biopsy-proven carcinoma of the esophagus, either Adenocarcinoma or
             Squamous cell carcinoma;

          -  Lesions of the thoracic oesophagus and the abdominal oesophagus but not involving the
             cardia of the stomach. (The oesophagus extends from the cricopharyngeus muscle at the
             level of the cricoid cartilage to the GEJ junction. The most proximate cervical
             oesophagus extends approximately 2-3 cm distal to the cricopharyngeus muscle
             approximately 18 cm from the incisors, and is excluded from this study; however the
             remaining oesophagus is included in this study, including the last 1-2 cm of the
             oesophagus which is intra-abdominal and up to the GEJ.);

          -  Dysphagia immediately prior to the first HDR ILBT session (based on a 4-question
             summary score of 4-15 (i.e. less than a score of 16) using four of the questions from
             the EORTC QLQ OES-18 measure;

          -  Able to insert the intra-esophageal applicator (Dilatation is allowed to open up the
             tumor/lumen to facilitate insertion, and this does not preclude eligibility. Any
             oesophageal stent must be removed prior to brachytherapy because metal stents may
             inappropriately increase the dose of radiation to the esophageal wall by approximately
             10%.]);

          -  Karnofsky is between 40 and 90, inclusive and at baseline (no patient can be 100 as
             all will have at least dysphagia from disease at baseline; patients with KPS &lt;40 are
             not eligible for this study);

          -  Eligible for radiotherapy (e.g. any pacemaker is not within 2.5 cm of the outside of
             the field edge for the EBRT component of therapy);

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18;

          -  Patients suitable for curative treatment with either surgery or chemo-radiation;

          -  Tracheo-esophageal fistula, or deep mucosal ulceration;

          -  Perforation or massive esophageal bleeding ;

          -  Previous treatment (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation therapy, laser therapy or surgery)
             for esophageal cancer (gastrostomy or PEG does not constitute exclusion criteria, and
             should be considered for patients with complete obstruction or where there has been
             substantial loss in body weight prior to diagnosis);

          -  Stents in situ (i.e. not removed prior to the first HDR ILBT);

          -  Previous thoracic radiation therapy for any cause, either EBRT or ILBT;

          -  Evidence of other uncontrolled malignancies, or evidence of synchronous head and neck
             or lung primary cancers (regardless of whether those malignancies could be managed
             with curative intent);

          -  Failure to complete all baseline assessments required for the study, including
             patient-elicited scores for symptoms and QOL;

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients.
