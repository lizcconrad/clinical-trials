      We will conduct a faculty development workshop with intent to improve interrater reliability
      and rater accuracy. Outcomes will include interrater reliability, accuracy, and workshop
      evaluations.

      Hypothesis: An intervention for training faculty preceptors on the use of the mini-CEX will
      improve inter-rater reliability and classification accuracy.

      Methods. We will develop a faculty development workshop aimed at improving the inter-rater
      reliability and accuracy of mini-CEX scores. To evaluate the workshop we will conduct a
      randomized, controlled trial. Preceptors will be randomly assigned to immediate or delayed
      workshop. The primary outcome will be inter-rater reliability of mini-CEX scores as
      preceptors rate videotaped resident-patient encounters before and four weeks after the
      workshop. We will also evaluate the accuracy of performance classifications. We will also
      collect mini-CEX ratings of actual resident-patient interactions one year preceding and one
      year following the workshop, and calculate interrater reliability.

      Statistical methods. Inter-rater reliability will be determined using the intraclass
      correlation coefficient (ICC) and corresponding confidence intervals. ICC will be used to
      determine chance-corrected agreement (accuracy). Discrimination (differences in mean scores
      among scripted levels of performance) will also be evaluated as a measure of accuracy.

      Scientific basis. Clinical performance assessments constitute a key element of resident
      education. The effect of rater training on the inter-rater reliability of mini-CEX scores is
      unknown. This workshop will utilize methods (rater error and field of reference training)
      shown to be effective in improving rater accuracy in non-medical fields.

      Inclusion criteria. All internal medicine residency continuity clinic preceptors are
      eligible.
