      Primary objective: To investigate the biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and
      pharmacokinetics of two separate intravenous (IV) injections of Xofigo (100 kBq/kg body
      weight [b.w.] [=110 kBq/kg based on the 2015 National Institute of Standards and Technology
      standardization], 6 weeks apart).

      Secondary objectives: To determine the safety of IV injections of Xofigo after two separate
      injections (6 weeks apart), to evaluate treatment response (antitumour effect in osteoblastic
      bone metastases) of Xofigo treatment consisting of two injections of activity 100 kBq/kg b.w.
      (=110 kBq/kg based on the 2015 National Institute of Standards and Technology
      standardization), 6 weeks apart and to evaluate long term radiation toxicity and to collect
      survival data at 6 and 12 months after the first injection

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Hormone refractory with evidence of rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA): Subject
             must be maintained on androgen ablation therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing
             hormone agonist or have undergone bilateral orchiectomy

          -  Serum testosterone level required to be ≤50 ng/dL

          -  Subjects who have received prior antiandrogen drug therapy: Flutamide, nilutamide, or
             cyproterone acetate must have stopped at least 4 weeks prior to study drug
             administration and progression, as defined by rising PSA as defined below, must have
             been demonstrated since cessation; bicalutamide must have stopped at least 6 weeks
             prior to study drug administration and progression, as defined by rising PSA as
             defined below, must have been demonstrated since cessation

          -  PSA progression: Progressive rise in PSA, defined as two consecutive increases in PSA
             documented over a previous reference value (measure 1). The first increase in PSA
             (measure 2) should occur at a minimum of 1 week from the reference value (measure 1).
             This increase in PSA should be confirmed (measure 3) after a minimum of 1 week. If the
             confirmatory PSA value (measure 3) is less than the previous value, the subject will
             still be eligible provided the next PSA measure (measure 4) is found to be greater
             than the second PSA value (measure 2)

          -  Skeletal metastases confirmed by bone scintigraphy within the last 6 weeks

          -  Performance status: Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2

          -  Life expectancy: ≥6 months

          -  Laboratory requirements: Neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥100 x109/L,
             haemoglobin ≥95 g/L, total bilirubin level within normal institutional limits,
             aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2.5 times upper institutional
             limit of the normal range, S Creatinine ≤1.5 times upper institutional limit of the
             normal range

             radium-223, or is scheduled to receive one during the treatment and post-treatment
             period

          -  Has received chemo-, immunotherapy, or external radiotherapy within the last 4 weeks
             prior to administration of study drug, or has not recovered from adverse events due to
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  More than one regimen of previous cytotoxic chemotherapy

          -  Has received prior hemibody external radiotherapy

          -  Has a need for immediate external radiotherapy

          -  Patients who are &lt;/= 4 weeks (6 weeks for bicalutamide) post withdrawal of
             antiandrogen therapy

          -  Patients who have started or stopped systemic steroids, within a week prior to study
             drug administration, or are expected to be subject to changes in the systemic steroid
             medication

          -  Other currently active (relapse within the last 3 years) malignancy (except
             non-melanoma skin cancer) that are not prostate cancer metastases

          -  Visceral (e.g. liver, lung) metastases from prostate cancer as assessed by abdominal/
             pelvic CT or chest radiograph within six weeks before administration of study drug

             heart failure more severe than this (NYHA Heart Failure Class III or IV), Crohns
             disease or ulcerative colitis
