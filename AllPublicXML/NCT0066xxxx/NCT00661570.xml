    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate long-term clinical feasibility of a new voice
      prosthesis and insertion system Provox Vega 20 with SmartInserter) for voice rehabilitation
      after total laryngectomy. Outcome measures are voice quality, ease of insertion, device life,
      and reason for replacement.

    <description>The Vega voice prosthesis used in this study is inserted with a new insertion tool, the SmartInserter. Physicians were asked to rate the insertion on a 4 point scale. what they thought of the new insertion tool, also in comparison to the regular tool used in the clinic, the Provox2 inserter. As the Provox voice prosthesis is a tool physicians already used, no insertions were performed with the Provox2 inserter during the study.</description>
