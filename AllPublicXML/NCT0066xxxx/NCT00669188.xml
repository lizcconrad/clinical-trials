  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate factors surrounding use and application of scientific literature
      in patient-provider interactions and will examine facets of the patient-provider interaction
      itself as studied in a virtual encounter using virtual reality.

      Healthy third- or fourth-year medical students or first-year medical interns in internal
      medicine and family practice specialties may be eligible for this study. Participants are
      recruited from the Washington, D.C., area.

      Study subjects perform two tasks and complete two sets of questions. The first task involves
      reading scientific content on a health topic of public interest and explaining the article as
      if to a patient. The second task involves interacting with a virtual patient in a virtual
      environment clinical scenario. While in the virtual environment, the subject wears a
      head-mounted video unit that allows him or her to see elements of the environment. The
      activities in the virtual environment take about 15 minutes. The total time for the study is
      about 60 minutes.

      This study will investigate issues around how physician trainees understand and convey
      various types of health-related information to patients and how they interact with patients
      of varying health histories. Participants will complete tasks that include reading and
      distilling a scientific review of a health-related topic, and participating in a virtual
      reality clinic simulation. As part of the study, participants will wear a virtual reality
      helmet and be immersed in a clinic where they will interact with a virtual patient.
      Participants will also complete questionnaires describing their experiences. For this study,
      we are recruiting only medical students in their third or fourth years and first-year medical
      interns in internal medicine or family practice specialties.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy adult volunteers who are third or fourth-year medical students. Both men and women
        over age 18 will be eligible for this study (though in practice the age range is likely to
        naturally be constrained by the typical age of medical students).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) persons with seizure or vestibular disorders; 2) women with known
        pregnancy; 3) persons who are highly prone to motion sickness; 4) those with low,
        uncorrected vision or hearing; 5) all current and past employees and contractors of

        NHGRI; and 6) persons who have received information about the study purpose or procedure
        from a past participant.
