      This study is about Prostate Health Cocktail, a combination supplement that contains vitamin
      D3, vitamin E, selenium, green tea extract, saw palmetto, lycopene, and soy derivatives. This
      product is currently available on the market, as herb and vitamin supplements are not
      regulated by the FDA. Each ingredient has been studied in prostate cancer cells and/or in
      patients with prostate cancer. At the doses included in this supplement, no serious side
      effects have been reported.

      The purpose of this study is to find out whether Prostate Health Cocktail can lower your PSA.
      Additionally, we will be looking to see whether taking this treatment causes any unexpected
      side effects, and whether certain blood tests can inform us about your disease status in
      addition to your PSA

      Objectives of this study are:

        -  To assess the PSA response in prostate cancer patients who have a PSA-only disease
           recurrence after curative local therapy, during treatment with a combination herbal
           supplement.

        -  To qualitatively and quantitatively describe the toxicity profile of this herbal
           supplement.

        -  To assess changes in PSA doubling time for subjects treated with this supplement.

        -  To measure tissue GRP78, serum neuroendocrine markers, and circulating tumor cells, for
           correlation with treatment response and prostate cancer outcomes

               -  Adjuvant radiation after radical prostatectomy is allowed, provided at least 6
                  months have elapsed between completion of radiation and enrollment in study

          -  PSA recurrence, with a rising PSA, as defined by:

               -  Post Radiation Therapy:

                    -  At least 2 increases in PSA, separated by at least 2 weeks; these can be
                       separated by a PSA value which declines provided the second rising value is
                       higher than the first rising value.
