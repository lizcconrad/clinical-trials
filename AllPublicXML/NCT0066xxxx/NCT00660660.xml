  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the safety and effectiveness (how well the
      medicine works) of esomeprazole (study drug) to placebo (a capsule that does not contain any
      medication) taken daily in relieving nighttime heartburn and problems sleeping in patients
      with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percent Activity Impairment Due to Sleep Disturbances (Average)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the impact of treatment as measured by: Change in global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores from baseline to week 4. Scale details -'Scoring ranged from 0, &quot;no difficulty&quot; to 3, &quot;severe difficulty.&quot; Items were grouped into 7 component scores. The 7 components were then summed to yield a global PSQI score. Global scores &gt;5 were considered to meet the criteria of sleep disturbance.</description>
