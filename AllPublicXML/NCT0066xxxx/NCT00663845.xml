  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in US to obtain information on the efficacy, safety, and
      duration of erection of flexible-dose regime of vardenafil compared to placebo (dummy
      medication with no pharmacological activity), in patients with co-morbid factors associated
      with erectile dysfunction (also called impotence). The duration of erection endpoint will be
      assessed by patient utilized stopwatch timings during each attempt at sexual intercourse.
      Elevated levels of total cholesterol or low levels of HDL may result in atherosclerosis and
      induce erectile dysfunction. Vardenafil (Levitra) is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. While there is no intent to assess
      the effect vardenafil has on blood lipids, the study will provide prospective data on men
      diagnosed with both ED and dyslipidemia.
