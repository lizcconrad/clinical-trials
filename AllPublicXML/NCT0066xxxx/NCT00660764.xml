  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an observational multi-centre study (HEROS), the effects of starting treatment with
      rosuvastatin were assessed, on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal achievement,
      in patients with a dissimilar high-risk profile who had not been treated with cholesterol
      lowering drugs at least in the past three months. Also set-up costs of rosuvastatin treatment
      and proportional changes in LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were
      studied.

    <description>Patients eligible for the study were patients who had not been treated with cholesterol lowering drugs at least in the past three months, with an LDL-C ≥ 3.2 mmol/l. Patients were aged ≥ 18 years and ≤ 70 years (men) and ≤ 75 years (women), according to the advise of the CBO, and could be included in one of the following risk groups: secondary prevention, DM or primary prevention. The general practice investigator made the decision to start treatment with rosuvastatin irrespective of study participation.
