  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated and optimized settings for, and evaluated the performance of,
      AI-700-enhanced echocardiographic imaging on several ultrasound imaging platforms, as well as
      collected additional safety data for AI-700 in healthy volunteers and stable cardiac
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the quality of AI-700-enhanced images is in part determined by the ultrasound (US)
      settings selection, the continuing study of different imaging modes and/or techniques is
      required in order to provide US settings recommendations for the many available systems.
      Therefore AI-700-enhanced imaging was performed in this study using imaging platforms and
      modes not previously tested and the AI-700 dose and administration methods employed in
      previous Phase 3 studies.

      Two cohorts of subjects were studied at each site. Enrollment commenced with Cohort A and
      included normal (healthy) volunteers and stable cardiac patients. Settings optimization was
      performed in Cohort A using a single platform and real-time imaging. If the Sponsor agreed
      that the images and settings acquired in Cohort A were acceptable, the site was authorized to
      begin enrollment in Cohort B using the platform and settings that were defined in Cohort A.
      Authorized sites enrolled stable cardiac patients in Cohort B; no healthy volunteers were
      studied. For Cohort B subjects, the first 0.04 mL/kg dose of AI 700 was used to evaluate
      real-time imaging with the settings defined in Cohort A. The second dose of AI-700 for Cohort
      B subjects may have been used to confirm the data obtained with the first dose, or to explore
      imaging in a second mode (e.g. 3D/4D) and/or using real-time, high mechanical index triggered
      imaging on a second platform.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For Cohort A, men and non-pregnant/non-lactating women in good health who are 18 to 70
             years of age and who have a low chance of CAD will be enrolled.

          -  For Cohort B, men and non-pregnant/non-lactating women in good health who are 18-70
             years of age who have had a prior MI and/or coronary artery revascularization
             intervention &gt;90 days before AI-700 administration, without new or recurrent angina
             will be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers in Cohort A who have or have had any of the following conditions
             will be excluded from the study: clinically significant intra-cardiac shunts or any
             other cardiovascular structural and/or severe functional abnormalities on the
             Qualification Echo, unless deemed not clinically relevant by the Investigator and
             subsequently approved by the Sponsor; ejection fraction (EF, estimated from the
             Qualification Echo) that is ≤55% (outside normal range), history or clinical
             manifestations of significant mental illness or significant pulmonary, hematological,
             renal, hepatic, central nervous, cardiovascular, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal
             disorders, or diabetes; history of any major surgical procedure within 90 days of
             Screening/Baseline; body mass index (BMI) &gt;35; sitting systolic blood pressure &lt;90
             mmHg or &gt;150 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;50 mmHg or &gt;95 mmHg, or a pulse rate &lt;45
             bpm or &gt;90 bpm; oxygen saturation &lt;92% at rest; and inadequate image quality on the
             Qualification Echo. Other exclusion criteria include: participation in an
             investigational drug/device study within 30 days prior to dosing (90 days for UK
             sites), participation in a previous clinical trial of AI-700, non-seasonal asthma
