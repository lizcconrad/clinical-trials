    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to evaluate the side effects of Gleevec when given in
      combination with Temzolomide; and to learn more about how these drugs work in the body and
      whether this combination is useful in treating patients with melanoma.

          -  Prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy (Phase I portion only), cytokine,
             biologic, or vaccine therapy is permitted, however no prior treatment with
             temozolomide

          -  Measurable disease

          -  Organ allografts

          -  Prior radiotherapy, or prior intratumor injection therapy, to areas of measurable
             disease that are used as target indicator lesions, unless progression has occurred at
