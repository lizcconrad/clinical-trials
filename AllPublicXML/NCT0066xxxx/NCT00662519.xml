  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to find out if giving a 12 week course of Neulasta
      (Pegylated granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF)) to people with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
      is safe. The secondary purpose of this research study is to determin if giving GCSF to
      patients with T1D changes the immune system or preserves insulin production.

      As a participant in this study the following will happen:

      Blood test, Mixed meal Tolerance Test (MMT) to find out how much C-peptide is being produced,
      Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) test, Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) test for overall blood sugar
      control, and randomized to either receive the 12 week course of Neulasta (Pegylated
      granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF)) or a placebo (no medication).
