  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of the drug rotigotine on the syndrome of
      hemispatial neglect and motor deficits following strokes affecting the right hemisphere of
      the brain.

      Hemispatial neglect and motor deficits remain major problems following right-hemisphere
      stroke. This study aims to assess the effect of rotigotine on hemispatial neglect, its
      component cognitive deficits (including spatial working memory and sustained attention) and
      motor deficits following right-hemisphere stroke.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed clinical diagnosis of right-hemisphere stroke.

          -  Able to give informed consent.

          -  Presence of left hemispatial neglect defined by a deficit in finding leftward targets
             on standard cancellation or visual search tests68-70. (A deficit on the line bisection
             test alone will not be sufficient for inclusion, as a previous study shows that there
             is no significant relationship between performance on this test and spatial working
             memory capacity37).

          -  Presence of motor deficits: all patients will have suffered from first-ever clinically
             defined stroke resulting in weakness of at least wrist and finger extensors, and hand
             interossei (to &lt;/= 4+ on the Medical Research Council scale), at the time of
             recruitment.

          -  Age over 18 years.

          -  More than 9 days since stroke-onset (Note that on our protocol patches do not commence
             until a minimum of 6 days after the study begins. Thus patients will not receive drug
             / placebo until a minimum of 15 days post-stroke).

          -  Able and willing to use patches of drug/placebo and assessments at regular intervals
             as defined by the protocol.

          -  Able to comply with study requirements.

          -  If female and of child-bearing potential, subject has a negative serum pregnancy test
             within two days of enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing neurological conditions that would confound cognitive and motor
             assessments, e.g. dementia, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis.

          -  Presence of acute concomitant illness, e.g. infection, unstable angina, myocardial
             infarction or heart, respiratory, renal or liver failure which, based on clinical
             judgment, would be considered to confound interpretation of results.

          -  Systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg and / or diastolic less than 70 mmHg.

          -  Exposure to any other investigational drug within 30 days of enrollment in the study.

          -  History (obtained from patient and medical records) of clinically significant drug or
             alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to enrollment into the study.

          -  Pregnancy (because the effects of rotigotine on the fetus and mother in pregnancy are
             not known). If female and of child-bearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be
             performed within two days of enrollment.

          -  Mothers who are breast feeding (because the effects of rotigotine on the newborn have
             not been established)
