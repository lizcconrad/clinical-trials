    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish a feasible combination of bendamustine and paclitaxel in
      a weekly schedule. The two agents have different toxicity profiles and are well tolerated
      when given in a weekly fashion. The combination might be of special interest for elderly
      patients with hormone insensitive breast cancer
