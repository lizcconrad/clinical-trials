    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a 12-month randomized controlled trial comparing the
      effects of strength and impact exercise training to flexibility/relaxation training on body
      composition (bone, muscle and fat mass), physical function (strength, gait, power, balance
      and self-report physical function and symptoms) in men currently treated with hormone therapy
      for prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer survivors with advanced disease are commonly treated with androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT) to reduce testosterone. Serious side effects of ADT are rapid bone
      and muscle loss that can lead to osteoporosis and declines in neuromuscular function
      (strength, power, gait and balance) which increases the risk of fracture and falls (a risk
      factor for fracture) and impairs physical function. Men on ADT are 1.4 times more likely to
      fracture compared with their cancer-free peers and those who fracture have a poorer prognosis
      than those who do not. Self-report physical function is also lower among men on ADT. Exercise
      can prevent bone loss, neuromuscular declines and falls in several populations. However, the
      ability of exercise to prevent bone loss from ADT has not been tested, while data on exercise
      and neuromuscular function (strength only) in this population are limited to one published
      trial. The long-term goal of our research is to improve musculoskeletal health and function
      in cancer survivors. Critical first steps to meet this goal are to determine whether our
      previously tested program of impact and resistance exercise, shown to improve bone health and
      neuromuscular function in women, can prevent bone loss and neuromuscular declines in prostate
      cancer survivors on ADT. Based on our previous research, we have developed the Prevent
      Osteoporosis With Impact + Resistance (POWIR) program to be adapted to clinical populations
      at risk for bone loss and declines in neuromuscular function. Potentially, POWIR could
      mitigate bone and muscle losses from ADT, and thereby lower fracture risk and improve quality
      of life.

    <description>60 minute session 3 times a week focusing on whole body flexibility (stretching) and relaxation (progressive neuromuscular relaxation, focused breathing) exercises. Exercises are selected to be non-weight bearing and require minimal muscle strength in order to provide a contrast to the intervention arm. Two sessions are conducted in a supervised setting at a university fitness center and the third is a home-based version of the program performed at home.</description>
