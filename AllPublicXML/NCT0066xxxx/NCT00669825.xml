    <textblock>
      ALV003-0812 is a study of the safety and tolerability of a study drug (ALV003) in healthy
      adult volunteers and in patients with well-controlled celiac disease, following a meal that
      contains gluten.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALV003-0812 (the FED study) is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      dose of the study drug, ALV003, administered at one of four different dose levels, and
      following a test meal containing a small amount (1 gram) of gluten. ALV003 has been
      demonstrated to proteolyze (assist with the digestion of) various forms of gluten (gluten
      flour, wheat bread) in laboratory studies and in animals. Celiac disease has been estimated
      to affect 1% of the population of the United States, is related to gluten, and has a wide
      range of clinical manifestations including chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, malabsorption,
      and bone disease.
