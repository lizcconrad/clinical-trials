      The investigators propose to study the effects of virtual reality (VR) on patients' pain
      perception during burn wound care. Such variables include psychiatric diagnosis and standard
      pain coping (i.e. pain catastophizer vs. non-pain catastrophizer).Aims: The investigators
      intend to evaluate the use of virtual reality in pain distraction for burn patients
      undergoing burn wound care. To that end our aims are: 1) To determine if pain perception will
      be less during the portion of the procedure in which the patient is immersed in the VR
      session in comparison to the portion of wound care which will occur without VR immersion. 2)
      To determine if anticipatory anxiety will be less for the portion of wound care that includes
      the virtual reality in comparison to the portion without virtual reality. 3) To determine if
      current psychiatric diagnosis, especially acute stress disorder and depression, is related to
      higher pain perception and greater decrease in pain with the virtual reality distraction. 4)
      To determine if being a &quot;pain catastrophizer&quot; is related to higher pain perception and
      greater benefits from the

    <description>The first treatment session will involve 5-7 minutes of burn wound care while distracted by VR, and 5-7 minutes of burn wound care without the distraction of VR. The second session of burn wound care (performed within the next 3 days) will involve 5-7 minutes of burn wound care without the distraction of VR, and 5-7 minutes of burn wound care with the distraction of VR. The treatment order will be randomized.</description>

    <description>Virtual reality (VR) gives patients an illusion of going into the 3-D computer generated environment/virtual world. During VR, the subject wears a head-mounted virtual reality helmet that positions two goggle-sized miniature LCD computer screens close to the subject's eyes. Position tracking devices keep the computer informed of changes in the patient's head location. An electro-magnetic head orientation device feeds the x, y, z coordinates of the patient's head to the computer, which can quickly change what the patient sees in virtual reality accordingly. The scenery in VR changes as the patient moves her head orientation (e.g., virtual objects in front of the patient in VR get closer as the patient, wearing the VR helmet, leans forward in the real world).</description>
