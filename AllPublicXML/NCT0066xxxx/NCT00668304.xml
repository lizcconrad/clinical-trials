      This study evaluated the time to bacteriological eradication of common pathogens during
      moxifloxacin therapy for acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. The study also examined the
      time to resolution of key symptoms associated with sinusitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of acute sinusitis with signs and symptoms present for &gt;7 days but
             &lt; 28 days as defined by A), radiographic, and B) clinical criteria, as follows:a. The
             presence of 1 or more of the following on a radiographic paranasal sinus film (Waters'
             view) or limited CT scan:** evidence of air-fluid levels** opacification. The presence
             of at least one major and one minor symptom as defined in the list below:** Major
             Symptoms*** Purulent anterior or posterior nasal discharge*** Unilateral moderate or
             severe facial pain or malar tenderness** Minor Symptoms*** Cough or frequent throat
             clearing*** Frontal headache*** Halitosis*** Fever (oral &gt; 38.0°C/100.4°F, tympanic &gt;
             38.5°C/101.2°F)*** Purulent secretions obtained via middle meatus secretion sampling
             using nasal endoscopic technique; the specimen sent for Gram stain, culture and
             susceptibility testing prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of chronic sinusitis defined as greater than four weeks of continuous symptoms
             (patients with history of sinus surgery may be included; patients with recurrent
             sinusitis may be included)

          -  Known bacteremia, meningitis or infection infiltrating the tissues neighboring the
             sinuses- Received systemic antibacterial therapy likely to be effective in sinusitis
             for more than 24 hours within 7 days of enrollment- A requirement for concomitant
             systemic antibacterial therapy with agents other than those specified in this
             protocol- Known immunodeficiency diseases including AIDS (CD4 &lt;200)- On topical nasal
             or systemic corticosteroids, unless they have been on a stable dose for &gt; 4 weeks
             prior to enrollment- History of allergy to quinolone antibiotics or related compounds-
             Pregnant or breast feeding- Of childbearing potential in whom pregnancy cannot be
             excluded by a negative pregnancy test and who are not using reliable barrier method of
             contraception

          -  Received an investigational drug in the past 30 days- Unable to take oral medication-
             Known to have congenital or sporadic syndromes of QTc prolongation or receiving
             concomitant medication reported to increase the QTc interval (e.g. amiodarone,
             sotalol, disopyramide, quinidine, procainamide, terfenadine)

          -  End stage liver cirrhosis (class Child-Pugh C)- Severe renal impairment requiring
             dialysis

          -  Previous history of tendinopathy associated with quinolones- Any symptoms that suggest
             that the patient's current illness is allergic rhinitis (e.g., repetitive sneezing,
             itchy nose or eyes, provocation by an allergen) and not acute bacterial sinusitis

          -  Diagnosis of rapidly fatal illness with a life expectance of less than 6 months-
             Previously enrolled in this clinical study- Uncorrected hypokalaemia
