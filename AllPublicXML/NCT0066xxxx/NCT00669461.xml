  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed colonic transient time secondary to a multi-degenerative process is the most likely
      cause of constipation in idiopathic PD. Since lubiprostone demonstrated its ability to
      accelerate colonic transit time in healthy volunteers in addition to activating the chloride
      channels in the intestinal cells, it has the potential to improve constipation in patients
      with PD with no subsequent adverse events on the control of the neurological manifestation of
      PD. So we hypothesize the following:

        1. Lubiprostone will improve ratings on the Bristol stool form scale (BSFS) in patients
           with PD induced constipation compared to baseline.(primary)

        2. Lubiprostone will increase the number of spontaneous bowel movements (SBM) per week,
           compared to baseline. (secondary)

        3. Lubiprostone will improve health related quality of life in subjects with PD induced
           constipation. ( secondary)

    <description>The average BSFS will be determined at baseline (prior to the start lubiprostone) and compared with average rating of BSFS at end of the 4 weeks of treatment with Lubiprostone and at end of 2 weeks after stopping the Lubiprostone. BSFS is scale between 1-7, it measured the shape of the stool. BSFS is a scale between 1-7, where 1 correlates with the firmest stool and 7 correlates with entirely liquid stool. Measure was reported at end of week #1-Baseline-,end of Week #5 ( after taking the lubiprostone for 4 weeks) and end of week # 7 ( end of 2 weeks after stopping the Lubiprostone).</description>
