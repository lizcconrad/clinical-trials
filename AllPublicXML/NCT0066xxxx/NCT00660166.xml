  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the safety of infusing escalated doses of
      allogeneic (from a relative of the patient), enriched natural killer (NK) cells after
      autologous (from the patient) stem cell transplantation. The hypothesis is that the infusion
      of these NK cells early after an autologous stem cell transplant will help to eliminate and
      eradicate any residual cancerous cells that remain in the body and may have survived the
      chemotherapy or radiation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Natural killer cells are blood cells that are responsible for eliminating cancer cells
      especially when there are only a few. It has been shown that NK cells coming from a
      &quot;mismatched&quot; person (a relative) have a better chance than the patient's own NK cells to
      recognize and kill cancer cells. These cells will be collected from the blood of a parent,
      child or sibling and after preparation in the laboratory, will be given to the patient early
      after an autologous stem cell transplantation like a blood or platelet transfusion. A person
      who has been diagnosed with a blood tumor and received an autologous stem cell transplant has
      the chance of his/her cancer coming back. This study uses NK cells obtained from a relative
      to prevent disease recurrence by potentially eliminating and eradicating any residual
      cancerous cells.

    <description>The infusion of natural killer (NK) cells will be performed in the Infusion Center at New England Medical Center. The NK cells will be given to the subject intravenously (into a vein). In addition, a balanced salt solution will be infused beginning about two hours prior to and continuing for two hours after the infusion of NK cells to keep the fluid level in the body well balanced. The subject will also receive Benadryl by injection 15-30 minutes prior to infusion to counteract and prevent any unwanted allergic side effects. The subject will be observed for any side effects during this time. If the subject feels well, he/she can go home. However, there may be a requirement to keep him/her overnight.</description>
