      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue in the laboratory from patients with nonmelanoma
      skin cancer that has been treated with topical aminolevulinic acid may help doctors predict
      how patients will respond to photodynamic therapy.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying topical aminolevulinic acid in patients with
      nonmelanoma skin cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the distribution and depth of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) within different
           types of nonmelanoma skin cancers after topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA)
           administration.

        -  To obtain in vivo measurements of ALA-induced PpIX formation within different zones of
           the tumors as measured by fluorescence detection methods.

        -  To correlate the level of PpIX fluorescence detected by non-invasive optical
           measurements with morphological characteristics of the tumors.

        -  To establish a skin cancer tissue bank.

      OUTLINE: Topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is applied to the center of the tumor surface.
      Patients then undergo punch tumor biopsy of the area where the ALA is applied followed by
      surgery to remove the tumor. Tissue samples are assessed for protoporphyrin (PpIX) levels by
      fluorescence confocal microscopy and hyperspectral imaging. Excess tumor tissue may be stored
      in a skin cancer tissue bank. Surface measurements (from a total of 5 surface sites) of PpIX
      fluorescence are taken at baseline and at 2 hours after ALA application using an optical
      fiber-based hand-held dosimeter.

    <description>On Day 1, ALA will then be applied topically to the center of the tumor surface (at the location of its greatest diameter) in a standardized manner with great care not to include normal skin. The solution will be applied directly to the lesions by dabbing gently with a wet applicator tip. Enough solution will be applied to uniformly wet the exposed lesion surface. Once the initial application has dried, the ALA will be applied again in the same manner. The ALA will be left on for 2 hours under occlusion with Duoderm Extra ThinÂ®.</description>

    <description>Then local anesthesia, lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1:100,000, will be administered and before the tumor is excised by one of the Cleveland Clinic MOHS surgeons, a 2mm punch biopsy will be taken from the area where the ALA was previously applied. The punch biopsy will be full thickness, extending to the subcutaneous fat.</description>
