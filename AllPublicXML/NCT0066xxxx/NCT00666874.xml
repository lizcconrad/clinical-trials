  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which may be mediated by
      increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by adipose tissue.

      To determine the effect of a program of changes in lifestyle designed to obtain a sustained
      reduction of body weight on markers of systemic vascular inflammation and insulin resistance.

      Randomized single-blind trial conducted from February 1999 to February 2002 at a university
      hospital in Italy.

      One hundred twenty premenopausal obese women (body mass index 30) aged 20 to 46 years without
      diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia.

      The 60 women randomly assigned to the intervention group received detailed advice about how
      to achieve a reduction of weight of 10% or more through a low-energy Mediterranean-style diet
      and increased physical activity. The control group (n = 60) was given general information
      about healthy food choices and exercise.
