      This study focuses on collecting and analyzing quantitative data related to adherence to
      antiretroviral treatment from patients in Dali, China, over a one-year time-frame and
      generating preliminary data on an intervention designed to improve adherence to
      antiretroviral treatment among the study population.

      This study is a continuation of &quot;Adherence for Life (AFL): Phase I: Exploratory Research&quot;
      (H-25203), which focused on collecting and analyzing qualitative data on adherence to
      antiretroviral treatment (ART) among HIV-positive patients in Dali, Yunnan Province, China.
      Like Phase I, the AFL Pilot Study (Phases II and III) will be a collaborative effort between
      US researchers based in Boston, MA and Chinese researchers based in Beijing and Dali. The
      current study, Phases II and III, will focus on collecting and analyzing qualitative and
      quantitative data related to adherence to ART over a one-year time-frame and generating
      preliminary data on an intervention designed to improve adherence to ART among the study
      population. The questionnaires used in these phases of the study will draw on the results of
      Phase I as well as standardized instruments adapted to the Chinese context. The specific aims
      of the study are as follows: (1) To determine the best surrogate measure of ART adherence
      among the study population; (2) To determine ART adherence rates in this population; (3) To
      analyze the relationship between adherence factors and measured adherence rates; and (4) To
      generate preliminary effectiveness data on an intervention that makes use of electronic drug
      monitors (EDM) to improve ART adherence.

    <time_frame>Month 12 (last month of 6-month intervention period) and 6-month post-intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>We used the electronic drug monitors (EDM) adherence metric that was found to be most strongly associated with viral suppression (HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/ml) in analysis of the pre-intervention data, EDM 'proportion taken within dose time' (see Gill et al, 2009). This measure estimated monthly adherence as the proportion of prescribed doses taken on time, e.g., within 1 hour of scheduled dose time ([number of doses taken ±1 hour of dose time] / [total number of prescribed doses]).</description>

    <description>The intervention group patients were given their electronic drug monitoring feedback data at each monthly visit. The study coordinator would quickly calculate whether the patient's adherence was below 95% in the previous month. If so, that patient was flagged for enhanced counseling with a clinic doctor and this counseling was based on a printout containing the electronic drug monitoring data.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Comparison</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The comparison group patients were not given the data from the electronic data monitoring feedback data. Instead, they filled out a self report form that all patients fill out. If they indicated in this report that their adherence in the previous was less than 95%, then they were flagged for &quot;enhanced counseling&quot; with a doctor. This counseling was based on the patient's self report. Thus both groups received enhanced counseling if they indicated poor adherence, but only the intervention group were given their electronic data output.</description>

    <description>All patients were given electronic drug monitors that can monitor pill-taking behavior. In the intervention arm, patients and their attending doctors were given the electronic drug monitoring data on pill bottle openings at each monthly visit for use in adherence counseling sessions. Control arm patients were not given their electronic drug monitoring feedback data and their counseling sessions were based on self-reported adherence, as per standard of care in Dali.</description>

            <description>The intervention group patients were given their electronic drug monitoring data at each monthly visit. The study coordinator would quickly calculate whether the patient's adherence was below 95% in the previous month. If so, that patient was flagged for enhanced counseling with a clinic doctor and this counseling was based on a printout containing the electronic drug monitoring data.</description>

        <title>Mean Adherence, as Measured by Electronic Drug Monitors (EDM)</title>
        <description>We used the electronic drug monitors (EDM) adherence metric that was found to be most strongly associated with viral suppression (HIV RNA &lt;400 copies/ml) in analysis of the pre-intervention data, EDM ‘proportion taken within dose time’ (see Gill et al, 2009). This measure estimated monthly adherence as the proportion of prescribed doses taken on time, e.g., within 1 hour of scheduled dose time ([number of doses taken ±1 hour of dose time] / [total number of prescribed doses]).</description>
