  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of monthly administration of
      intravenous methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (CERA/Mircera) for the maintenance of
      hemoglobin (Hb) levels in participants on dialysis with chronic renal anemia in routine
      clinical practice in Hungary. Participants currently receiving maintenance treatment with
      intravenous epoetin or darbepoetin will receive monthly injections of Mircera, with the
      starting dose derived from the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose they had been
      receiving.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Average Hb Within Plus/Minus (±) 1 g/dL of Reference Hb and Within Target Range During the Efficacy Evaluation Period (EEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks -4, -3, -2, and -1; pre-dose (0 hours) during Weeks 18, 20, 22, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Reference Hb was determined individually per participant as the average of all Hb values during a pre-treatment stability assessment (Weeks -4 to -1). During the EEP (Weeks 18 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with CERA/Mircera. The average Hb during the EEP was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The percentage of participants who had average Hb during the EEP in the target range of 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL and within ±1 g/dL of their individual reference Hb was determined as the primary endpoint. The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Pearson-Clopper method for exact confidence bounds.</description>

During the EEP (Weeks 18 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with CERA/Mircera. The average Hb during the EEP was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The mean change in Hb value between reference (i.e., &quot;Baseline&quot;) Hb and the EEP average Hb was calculated and expressed in g/dL.</description>

    <description>During the EEP (Weeks 18 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with CERA/Mircera. The percentage of participants who maintained each single Hb measurement in the target range of 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL was determined.

    <description>During the EEP (Weeks 18 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with CERA/Mircera. Time spent in the target range of 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL was defined as time from first on-target Hb to time of last known on-target Hb, as collected during the EEP. Time spent in the target range was averaged among all participants and expressed in days.</description>

    <description>Study drug administration occurred monthly during the DTP (Weeks 0 to 16), which began with a pre-specified dose of Mircera/CERA according to the dose of ESA administered during Week -1. Subsequent doses could be adjusted throughout the study including during the EEP (Weeks 18 to 24) on the basis of Hb levels or other modification criteria. The dose received at each administration visit was averaged among all participants during the DTP and EEP and expressed in mcg.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Average Hb Within Plus/Minus (±) 1 g/dL of Reference Hb and Within Target Range During the Efficacy Evaluation Period (EEP)</title>
        <description>Reference Hb was determined individually per participant as the average of all Hb values during a pre-treatment stability assessment (Weeks -4 to -1). During the EEP (Weeks 18 to 24), participants provided a total of four blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with CERA/Mircera. The average Hb during the EEP was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The percentage of participants who had average Hb during the EEP in the target range of 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL and within ±1 g/dL of their individual reference Hb was determined as the primary endpoint. The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Pearson-Clopper method for exact confidence bounds.</description>
