  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelofibrosis is the gradual replacement of bone marrow (place where most new blood cells are
      produced) by fibrous tissue which reduces the body's ability to produce new blood cells and
      results in the development of chronic anemia (low red blood cell count). One of the main
      distinctions of myelofibrosis is &quot;extramedullary hematopoesis&quot;, the migration or traveling of
      the blood-forming cells out of the bones to other parts of the body, such as the liver or
      spleen, resulting in an enlarged spleen and liver.

      Treatment for myelofibrosis is unsatisfactory and there is no medication that is specifically
      used in the treatment of myelofibrosis. There is a protein that is found to be present in the
      majority of myelofibrosis patients (JAK2) and the drug Lestaurtinib is being studied to see
      if it will stop this protein from functioning and thereby help control the disease.

      This study is divided into two Phases (1 &amp; 2). In phase 1 we will be looking for the dose of
      study medication (Lestaurtinib) that will be the highest dose a patient can take without
      experiencing serious side effects, maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      In phase 2, after the MTD dose has been established in phase 1, we will be investigating how
      well CEP-701 (Lestaurtinib) works at suppressing the protein (JAK2).

      The investigators also wish to find out important biologic characteristics or features of
      myelofibrosis through an additional correlative biomarker study (MPD-RC #107). The
      correlative biomarker study is a study that is related to the main study, but is looking to
      answer different questions than the main study. The purpose of the biomarker study is to
      understand the causes of MPD and to develop improved methods for the diagnosis and treatment
      of these diseases, while the main study is trying to find out how well CEP-701 (Lestaurtinib)
      will work in treating the myeloproliferative disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia related myelofibrosis,
             or polycythemia vera related myelofibrosis requiring therapy, including:

               1. those previously treated and relapsed or refractory

               2. or newly diagnosed, with intermediate or high risk according to Lille Scoring
                  system (adverse prognostic factors are: Hb &lt; 10 g/dl, WBC &lt; 4 or &gt; 30 x 109/L;
                  risk group: 0 = low, 1 = intermediate, 2 = high)

               3. or with symptomatic splenomegaly (must be &gt;=10 cm below the left costal margin in
                  the mid-clavicular line).

          2. The subject must not be considered as a candidate to receive allogeneic hematopoietic
             stem cell transplant at the time of being enrolled into the study.

          3. The subject has a detectable JAK2 V617F mutation.

          4. Signed informed consent: Patients must have signed consents for both the Lestaurtinib
             protocol and for the mandatory biomarker MDP-RC 107 protocol to be eligible to
             participate.

          5. Patients must have been off any PMF-directed therapy for 4 weeks prior to entering
             this study and have recovered from the toxic effects (grade 0-1) of that therapy.
             Treatment with erythropoietin is permitted.

          6. Serum bilirubin levels less than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of the normal
             range for the laboratory (ULN). Higher levels are acceptable if these can be
             attributed by treating physician to active hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis due
             to myelofibrosis.

          7. Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) levels
             less than or equal to 2 x ULN.

          8. Serum creatinine levels less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             prior to Lestaurtinib treatment and should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant. Men
             must be advised to not father a child while receiving treatment with Lestaurtinib.
             Both women of childbearing potential and men must practice effective methods of
             contraception (those generally accepted as standard of care measures). Women of child
             bearing potential are women who are not menopausal for 12 months or who have not
             undergone previous surgical sterilization. If the subject is a woman of childbearing
             potential, she must use a medically acceptable form of contraception during the study
             period and for 30 days thereafter. If the subject is a man he must be surgically
             sterile or must use a medically approved method of contraception for the duration of
             the study and for 60 days following the last dose of CEP-701.

         10. Age &gt; 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Nursing and pregnant females. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          2. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure.

          3. Unstable angina.

          4. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days,
             or anticipation of the need for major surgical procedure during the course of the
             study.

          5. Biopsy or other minor surgical procedure, excluding placement of a vascular access
             device or bone marrow biopsy, within 7 days prior to study enrollment.

          6. Ongoing serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          7. Known hypersensitivity to any component of Lestaurtinib.

          8. The subject has received a donor stem cell transplant in the past and has detectable
             full or partial donor chimerism.

          9. The subject requires treatment with a CYP3A4 inhibitor, including azole antifungals
             (topicals are permitted); protease inhibitors; nefazodone; cyclosporine; erythromycin;
             clarithromycin; and troleandomycin.
