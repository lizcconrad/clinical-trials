    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see how well a new investigational medical device, the StimRouter
      (STR) System, will work to treat the chronic pain in people who have failed previous
      treatments for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) pain, including surgery. These people have been
      treated for CTS pain before including surgical carpal tunnel release, but without good
      results, and they are still having pain. The study will look at both the good and bad effects
      of the StimRouter System for treating this kind of pain and as a general peripheral nerve
      stimulation device for treating chronic pain. The study will also help to understand other
      possible uses for the StimRouter System.

      This is a prospective, single-center, open label study designed to evaluate the clinical use
      of the StimRouter (STR) as a peripheral nerve stimulation device for the treatment of chronic
      pain. The clinical study is proposed to serve as an evaluation of the preliminary StimRouter
      design, proposed implantation techniques, electrical stimulation parameters, and outcome
      measures for the StimRouter. The current study will utilize the median nerve (in the context
      of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), status-post a single failed carpal tunnel release (CTR)
      surgery)as a model to represent the device's more general intended use as a peripheral nerve
      stimulator to treat chronic pain.

    <time_frame>at device implantation procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Success of device implantation was defined as uncomplicated minimally-invasive implantation of the StimRouter Lead near the targeted peripheral median nerve, resulting in production of desired paresthesias in the sensory distribution of the median nerve when active peripheral nerve stimulation was applied. This outcome parameter was intended to serve as an indication that the lead and electrode stimulating positions could be correctly placed while still maintaining the minimal invasiveness of the procedure. Fluoroscopic imaging was used to document positioning of the StimRouter Lead and, by applying stimulation from a commercially available Dakmed External Pulse Generator (EPG) to the StimRouter Lead, desired paresthesia response was confirmed.</description>

    <description>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questions 14 and 15 were used to measure pain change after 5 days use of StimRouter System. In the BPI, an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) is used to rate pain intensity, where zero (0) indicates ''no pain'' and 10 indicates ''pain as bad as you can imagine.'' At enrollment, participants circled the number that best described how much baseline pain they had 'on average' (BPI #14). After enrollment and during the study, patients circled the one number that best described how much pain they had at that time 'right now' (BPI #15). The percent of participants with change from Baseline to Day 5 was calculated.</description>

    <description>Using Brief Pain Inventory questions 14 and 15, those 9 subjects who had pain change from Baseline to Day 5 were analyzed to determine change in pain for the overall group. In the BPI, an 11-point NRS is used to rate pain intensity, with a 0 for ''no pain'' and a 10 for ''pain as bad as you can imagine.'' At Baseline, patients circled the number that best described how much baseline pain they had 'on average' (BPI #14). During the study, patients circled the one number that best described how much pain they had at the time 'right now' (BPI #15).</description>

        <title>Implant Success</title>
        <description>Success of device implantation was defined as uncomplicated minimally-invasive implantation of the StimRouter Lead near the targeted peripheral median nerve, resulting in production of desired paresthesias in the sensory distribution of the median nerve when active peripheral nerve stimulation was applied. This outcome parameter was intended to serve as an indication that the lead and electrode stimulating positions could be correctly placed while still maintaining the minimal invasiveness of the procedure. Fluoroscopic imaging was used to document positioning of the StimRouter Lead and, by applying stimulation from a commercially available Dakmed External Pulse Generator (EPG) to the StimRouter Lead, desired paresthesia response was confirmed.</description>

        <description>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questions 14 and 15 were used to measure pain change after 5 days use of StimRouter System. In the BPI, an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) is used to rate pain intensity, where zero (0) indicates ‘‘no pain’’ and 10 indicates ‘‘pain as bad as you can imagine.’’ At enrollment, participants circled the number that best described how much baseline pain they had 'on average' (BPI #14). After enrollment and during the study, patients circled the one number that best described how much pain they had at that time 'right now' (BPI #15). The percent of participants with change from Baseline to Day 5 was calculated.</description>
