      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pentostatin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab and rituximab, can block cancer growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer
      cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving pentostatin
      together with alemtuzumab and rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving pentostatin together with
      alemtuzumab and rituximab works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the rate of complete and overall response in patients with relapsed or
           refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma treated with
           pentostatin, alemtuzumab, and low-dose rituximab.

        -  To monitor and assess toxicity of this treatment regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the overall and progression-free survival, duration of response, and time
           to next treatment.

        -  To assess the correlation between individual prognostic markers (17p-, 11q-, unmutated
           VH gene, VH3-21, ZAP-70+, CD38+, CD49d, and β2 microglobulin, miRNA profiles,
           angiogenesis status, and karyotypes of CpG stimulated cells) and clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Course 1: Patients receive pentostatin IV on days 8 and 22; alemtuzumab subcutaneously
           (SC) on days 3-5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, and 33; rituximab IV on
           days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, and 33; and sargramostim
           (GM-CSF) SC on days 10-14 and 24-28. Patients then proceed to course 2.

        -  Courses 2 and 3: Patients receive pentostatin IV on days 1 and 15; alemtuzumab SC and
           rituximab IV on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26; and GM-CSF SC on
           days 3-7 and 17-21. After completion of course 2, patients with a complete response
           proceed to observation. Patients with a partial response or stable disease receive
           another course of therapy (course 3).

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood is collected on days 1, 3, 8, and 10 of course 1 for monoclonal antibody studies.
      Samples are analyzed for serum concentration of alemtuzumab and rituximab by ELISA and PCR;
      CH50 assay; complement activation and cytokine levels by ELISA; NK cell activation; and NK
      cell phenotype by immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months, every 3
      months for 6 months, and then every 6-12 months for up to 5 years.

    <description>A Complete Response (CR) requires the disappearance of all nodes, a non-palpable liver and spleen, no constitutional symptoms, absolute neutrophil counts &gt;1500/uL, platelets &gt;100000/uL, Hemoglobin &gt;11.0 g/dL, and lymphocytes &lt;4000/uL. In addition, a bone marrow biopsy with evidence of &lt;30% lymphocytes and no nodules.
Here we report the rate of complete response as the number of patients attaining a CR status divided by the total number of evaluable patients. The 95% CI is estimated using the binomial distribution.</description>

A bone marrow biopsy with evidence of &lt;30% lymphocytes and no nodules.
Patients who fulfill all criteria for a CR but have a persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia related to drug toxicity will be classified as CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi).
A Partial Response (PR) requires a 50% reduction in nodes and liver/spleen measurements and at least two of the following: absolute neutrophil counts &gt;1500/uL, platelets &gt;100000/uL, Hemoglobin &gt;11.0 g/dL, or a &gt;50% reduction in lymphocytes.
Here we report the rate of overall response as the number of patients attaining a CR, PR, or CRi status divided by the total number of evaluable patients. The 95% CI is estimated using the binomial distribution.</description>

        <title>Complete Response Rate</title>
        <description>A Complete Response (CR) requires the disappearance of all nodes, a non-palpable liver and spleen, no constitutional symptoms, absolute neutrophil counts &gt;1500/uL, platelets &gt;100000/uL, Hemoglobin &gt;11.0 g/dL, and lymphocytes &lt;4000/uL. In addition, a bone marrow biopsy with evidence of &lt;30% lymphocytes and no nodules.
Here we report the rate of complete response as the number of patients attaining a CR status divided by the total number of evaluable patients. The 95% CI is estimated using the binomial distribution.</description>

A bone marrow biopsy with evidence of &lt;30% lymphocytes and no nodules.
Patients who fulfill all criteria for a CR but have a persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia related to drug toxicity will be classified as CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi).
A Partial Response (PR) requires a 50% reduction in nodes and liver/spleen measurements and at least two of the following: absolute neutrophil counts &gt;1500/uL, platelets &gt;100000/uL, Hemoglobin &gt;11.0 g/dL, or a &gt;50% reduction in lymphocytes.
Here we report the rate of overall response as the number of patients attaining a CR, PR, or CRi status divided by the total number of evaluable patients. The 95% CI is estimated using the binomial distribution.</description>
