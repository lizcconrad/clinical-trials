  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When narcotic pain medicine, like fentanyl or morphine, is given to adults and children for
      several days, they often develop a tolerance to the medicine. This means they may need higher
      doses over time to get the same amount of pain control. When it is time to stop the medicine,
      the dose has to be decreased slowly so that the patient does not have withdrawal symptoms.

      Naloxone is a medicine that at high doses can reverse the effects of narcotics. At very small
      doses it may help prevent tolerance and lessen the severity of withdrawal symptoms. This
      could mean less narcotic pain medicine is needed over fewer days.

      The purpose of this research study is to see if giving naloxone to neonates who require
      narcotic infusions is safe and effective. Safety will be measured by the incidence of side
      effects. Efficacy will be measured by monitoring for changes in pain and sedation scores and
      need for more pain medicine.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single center, open label dose escalation study. We
      hypothesize that critically ill patients in the NICU may benefit from a low dose naloxone
      infusion resulting in decreased tolerance, less severe withdrawal symptoms, lower cumulative
      doses of opiates, and fewer total days of opiates, all while maintaining adequate or enhanced
      pain control and sedation. Establishing safety and efficacy data for this potentially
      beneficial therapy is an important first step towards using this therapy to decrease the risk
      of opioid tolerance and withdrawal in this population of infants.
