    <description>The grip strength was measured using a DynEx digital dynamometer. The result of grip strength was recorded to a resolution of 0.1 kg.
Each grip strength test consisted of 3 maximal repeated contractions (trials). Each participant will perform 2 sessions of grip strength testing. After a 10-minute break, the testing session will be repeated for a total of 6 grip repetitions per hand.</description>

    <description>Relative Change is defined as 100 * (End of the Cross-Over Period - baseline of Cross-Over Period) divided by baseline of Cross-Over Period.
The grip strength was measured using a DynEx digital dynamometer. The result of grip strength was recorded to a resolution of 0.1 kg. For statistical analysis, the mean of (usually three) trials for cross-over sessions 1 and 2 was computed and the mean of the sessions was used in the analysis as the result of the grip strength measurement. Only if no grip strength testing could be performed the results were considered as missing.</description>

    <description>The 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. Participants picked up the pegs one at a time (nine in total), and put them into the holes on the board as quickly as possible, in any order until all the holes were filled. Then, without pausing, participants removed the pegs one at a time and returned them to the container as quickly as possible. Each participant did this two times with their dominant hand. The 9-HCT objective is to see how fast participants could put all of the pegs in and take them out again.</description>

          <description>Each participant was to complete 5 study parts (3 stabilization phases of open label treatment with IGIV, 10%, and 1 cross-over period each of double-blind treatment with IGIV, 10% and placebo according to a randomized sequence). Each study part lasted 12 weeks and comprised 3, 4 or 6 infusion cycles depending on treatment interval.
Study Part 1: Open-label phase of treatment/stabilization on IGIV, 10% (Stabilization Phase 1) for all participants Study Part 2: Participants were randomized to 1 of 2 sequences of double-blind treatment (either: IGIV, 10% or placebo) Study Part 3: Between the two double-blind treatment cross-over periods, participants received open-label treatment/stabilization with IGIV, 10% for 12 weeks (Stabilization Phase 2) Study Part 4: Participants were crossed-over to second sequence of double-blind treatment (IGIV, 10% or placebo) Study Part 5: Participants received open-label treatment/stabilization with IGIV, 10% for 12 weeks (Stabilization Phase 3)</description>

The grip strength was measured using a DynEx digital dynamometer. The result of grip strength was recorded to a resolution of 0.1 kg. For statistical analysis, the mean of (usually three) trials for cross-over sessions 1 and 2 was computed and the mean of the sessions was used in the analysis as the result of the grip strength measurement. Only if no grip strength testing could be performed the results were considered as missing.</description>

Each grip strength test consisted of 3 maximal repeated contractions (trials). Each participant will perform 2 sessions of grip strength testing. After a 10-minute break, the testing session will be repeated for a total of 6 grip repetitions per hand.</description>

        <description>Relative Change is defined as 100 * (End of the Cross-Over Period - baseline of Cross-Over Period) divided by baseline of Cross-Over Period.
The overall disability sum scale (based on Merkies et al., 2002) is a patient questionnaire that measures disability (from 0, “no signs of disability” to 12, “most severe disability”). This was standardized to a scale of 0 to 100 (the best score being 100) to allow calculation of relative changes.</description>

        <description>The 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. Participants picked up the pegs one at a time (nine in total), and put them into the holes on the board as quickly as possible, in any order until all the holes were filled. Then, without pausing, participants removed the pegs one at a time and returned them to the container as quickly as possible. Each participant did this two times with their dominant hand. The 9-HCT objective is to see how fast participants could put all of the pegs in and take them out again.</description>

        <description>The 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. Participants picked up the pegs one at a time (nine in total), and put them into the holes on the board as quickly as possible, in any order until all the holes were filled. Then, without pausing, participants removed the pegs one at a time and returned them to the container as quickly as possible. Each participant did this two times with their non-dominant hand. The 9-HCT objective is to see how fast participants could put all of the pegs in and take them out again.</description>

        <description>Relative grip strength change is defined as 100 * (End of the Cross-Over Period - baseline of Cross-Over Period) divided by baseline of Cross-Over Period.
The grip strength was measured using a DynEx digital dynamometer. The result of grip strength was recorded to a resolution of 0.1 kg. For statistical analysis, the mean of (usually three) trials for cross-over sessions 1 and 2 was computed and the mean of the sessions was used in the analysis as the result of the grip strength measurement. Only if no grip strength testing could be performed the results were considered as missing.</description>

          <description>Relative grip strength change is defined as 100 * (End of the Cross-Over Period - baseline of Cross-Over Period) divided by baseline of Cross-Over Period.
The grip strength was measured using a DynEx digital dynamometer. The result of grip strength was recorded to a resolution of 0.1 kg. For statistical analysis, the mean of (usually three) trials for cross-over sessions 1 and 2 was computed and the mean of the sessions was used in the analysis as the result of the grip strength measurement. Only if no grip strength testing could be performed the results were considered as missing.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>Baxter's agreements with PIs may vary per requirements of individual PI, but contain common elements. For this study, PIs are restricted from independently publishing results until the earlier of the primary multicenter publication or 18 months after study completion. Baxter requires a review of results communications (e.g., for confidential information) ≥90 days prior to submission or communication. Baxter may request an additional delay of ≤120 days(e.g., for intellectual property protection)</restrictive_agreement>
