  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and highest dose of ASONEP
      that can safely be administered to patients with cancer who are no longer being helped by
      standard treatments.

      ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that possesses
      anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity in animal models of human cancer. ASONEP™ binds
      sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid signaling molecule that possesses potent
      pro-growth effects.

      Preclinical studies with ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) and LT1002 (murine homolog of LT1009),
      demonstrate the potential of an anti-S1P treatment to reduce tumor volumes and metastatic
      potential, likely as a result of inhibiting new blood vessel formation needed to support
      tumor growth.

      Lpath is developing ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) for the following therapeutic indication:

      ASONEP™ [parenteral sonepcizumab (LT1009) for the treatment of cancer] is indicated for use
      in combination with TBD cytotoxic agents and other anti-angiogenic agents as second-line
      therapy to treat patients with an unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic TBD
      cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be 18 years old.

          -  Must have a confirmed diagnosis of solid tumor that has been refractory to prior
             therapy and for which no additional therapy of known benefit is available.

          -  Must have measurable or non-measurable disease as defined by RECIST guidelines.

          -  Be male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female. A negative pregnancy test within one
             week prior to the start of the study if a female of childbearing potential.

          -  Subjects and their partners with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective
             contraceptive method (as deemed by the Investigator) while the subject is on study
             treatment and for 30 days after the last treatment.

          -  Must have a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          -  Must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2

          -  Must not be receiving any concurrent anticancer therapy.

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed between any prior systemic treatment for the cancer
             (6 weeks for mitomycin and nitrosourea) and first dose of treatment on this protocol;
             at least 4 weeks must have elapsed between any prior radiation treatment for the
             cancer or major surgical procedure and the first dose of treatment on this protocol;
             all acute and chronic toxicities from prior treatment must have recovered to ≤ grade
             1. Subjects with prostate cancer on Lupron® will be allowed to continue their
             treatment.

          -  Must have physical integrity of the gastrointestinal tract.

          -  Must have adequate organ and immune function as indicated by the following laboratory
             values:

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x ULN or

               -  Estimated creatinine clearance &gt;45mL/min,

               -  Total Bilirubin &lt;2.0mg/dL (&lt;34.2umol/L),
