  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Aneurysm development, progression and rupture are characterised by extensive
      inflammation, dominated by the infiltration of T-cells, B-cells and macrophages. Recent
      studies into the pathophysiology of aneurysm wall degradation suggest a close relation
      between increased mechanical stress and the local activation of infiltrated lymphocytes and
      macrophages. The non-invasive detection of aneurysm wall inflammation, using
      18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) might therefore provide valuable
      information on the extend of the disease and could clarify the role of mechanical stress on
      the propagation of aneurysm wall inflammation.

      Objective: Correlation of FDG uptake and in vitro aneurysm wall tensile strength. (primary
      objective). The effect of aneurysm sac depressurisation, after endovascular aneurysm repair,
      on aneurysm wall inflammation (secondary objective).

      Study design: Observational case series (pilot). Study population: Patients scheduled for
      conventional (open) and endovascular aneurysm repair.

      Main study parameters: Standard uptake value (SUV) measurements to asses FDG uptake in the
      aneurysm wall and in vitro aneurysm wall strength (N/mm).

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation,

      benefit and group relatedness: Patients scheduled for conventional (open) or endovascular
      aneurysm repair are admitted to the hospital the day before surgery. At that point all
      patients will be evaluated using FDG-PET. Although intake of sugar-free liquids is permitted,
      glucose intake is restricted 6 hours prior to FDG-PET imaging. One hour after intravenous
      injection of 200-220 MBq FDG, whole body emission and transmission images will be acquired.
      To determine inflammation markers ( e.g. CRP), blood and urine samples will be collected
      prior to the operation and again 6 weeks after surgery. For in vitro aneurysm wall tensile
      strength testing wall specimens will be harvested during conventional aneurysm repair.

      <textblock>
        Population: At the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, approximately 80 patients
        undergo prophylactic aneurysm repair each year. 10-15 patients are scheduled for
        conventional ('open') repair the remaining 65-70 patients undergo endovascular aneurysm. We
        therefore expect to finish including patients for both studies by the end of august 2008.
        The study population will be comprised both male (Â± 80%) and female patients with an
        abdominal aortic aneurysm.
