  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized open-label uncontrolled phase II trial evaluating efficacy and
      toxicity of erlotinib in patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis advanced NSCLC who was
      benefitted by first line chemotherapy. Patients with stage IV NSCLC who have one or more
      asymptomatic brain metastasis who was benefitted by first line chemotherapy will receive oral
      erlotinib 150mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. These
      patients' direct DNA sequencing of tumor tissue EGFR exons 18-21 will be analyzed The
      response was evaluated by RECIST criteria after the patient received erlotinib 6 weeks.If the
      patients present with progress disease of brain metastasis after the therapy of erlotinib,
      the patients will receive irradiation of brain metastasis.If the response is stable
      disease,partial response or complete response,he will be examined by brain MRI every 12
      weeks.
