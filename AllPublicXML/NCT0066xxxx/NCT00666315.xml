      New haemostatic techniques have been developed with the advent of laparoscopic surgery. Among
      other things, ultrasound instruments have been used for the dissection, division and
      coagulation of vessels and other tissue. Previous studies in Thyroidectomy observed a
      clinically and economically significant reduction in operating time with no increase in the
      complication rate when the Harmonic device has been used. The aim of the present clinical
      trial is to evaluate potential advantages of a new Harmonic device (FOCUS), developed
      especially for Thyroid procedures, in the use of HS in thyroidectomies when compared with EC
      in terms of operative time, number of ligatures, QoL, blood loss, pain intensity at the
      surgical site, amount of drainage, and complications, including the incidence of RLN palsy
      and hypoparathyroidism.

      Thyroidectomy is one of the most frequently performed operations in endocrine surgery.
      Results are generally excellent, and morbidity and mortality are usually negligible. The
      operation requires proper identification of important structures such as the recurrent
      laryngeal nerve (RLN) and the parathyroid glands. Meticulous dissection and exhaustive
      hemostasis are important to ensure a dry field and to avoid inadvertent damage to the
      adjacent structures. The two most common techniques for hemostasis are suture ligatures and
      electrocoagulation. The use of electrocoagulation (EC) to control bleeding has the potential
      risk of injuring the surrounding structures from lateral dispersion of heat. New haemostatic
      techniques have been developed with the advent of laparoscopic surgery. Among other things,
      ultrasound instruments have been used for the dissection, division and coagulation of vessels
      and other tissue. Previous studies in Thyroidectomy observed a clinically and economically
      significant reduction in operating time with no increase in the complication rate when the
      Harmonic device has been used. The aim of the present clinical trial is to evaluate potential
      advantages of a new Harmonic device (FOCUS), developed especially for Thyroid procedures, in
      the use of HS in thyroidectomies when compared with EC in terms of operative time, number of
      ligatures, QoL, blood loss, pain intensity at the surgical site, amount of drainage, and
      complications, including the incidence of RLN palsy and hypoparathyroidism.
