  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of scientific attention devoted to the placebo effect as a phenomenon in its own
      right probably reflects the paucity of theoretical positions within which to organize the
      existing data and design new research. The proposed investigation 1) is an attempt to advance
      from a descriptive to an experimental analysis of the placebo effect, taking into account
      classical conditioning effects, and 2) examines the clinical implications of partial
      reinforcement as it is applied to the treatment of insomnia. Subjects with primary insomnia
      will be treated with zolpidem for a period of one month and then randomized to one of four
      groups for a period of 12 weeks: one receiving full dose zolpidem on a nightly basis
      (continuous reinforcement), one receiving full dose zolpidem on 14 of 28 nights where placebo
      is provided on non-drug nights (partial reinforcement), one receiving full dose zolpidem on
      14 of 28 nights where no pills are imbibed on non-drug nights (intermittent dosing), and one
      receiving 5 mg dose zolpidem on a nightly basis (continuous reinforcement with half the
      standard dose). Following treatment, subjects will be entered into an extinction protocol
      during which they will 1) continue on the schedule assigned during the experimental period,
      2) receive only placebo, or 3) receive neither drug nor placebo. Sleep and daily functioning
      will be monitored on a daily basis via sleep diaries for the duration of the study. It is
      hypothesized that, holding cumulative dose constant, a partial schedule of reinforcement will
      enable patients to better maintain their clinical gains as compared to subjects that receive
      either continuous reinforcement with half the standard dose or half the frequency of use.

      Relevance: The proposed research is not an attempt to offer a behavioral alternative to drug
      treatment; it is an attempt to acknowledge and capitalize on a behavioral dimension in the
      design of drug treatment protocols. The value of the proposed research resides in its
      capacity to provide for the long term treatment of insomnia in a manner that increases the
      durability of pharmacotherapy while reducing the overall amount of medication required. If
      proven effective in the current application, this new approach to pharmacotherapy and placebo
      effects is likely to stimulate new interdisciplinary research for the treatment of a variety
      of chronic diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with insomnia will meet RDC criteria for psychophysiologic insomnia(99).
             These criteria are provided in Appendix 2. In addition, the complaint of disturbed
             sleep will have one or more of the following characteristics:

               -  &gt; 30 minutes to fall asleep (Initial Insomnia)

               -  2 awakenings per night of &gt;15 minutes duration and/or wake after sleep onset time
                  of &gt; 30 minutes (Middle Insomnia)

               -  An awakening of &gt; 30 minutes prior to the desired &quot;wake up&quot; time (Late Insomnia)

               -  Any two of the above complaints (Mixed Insomnia)

        Additionally, total sleep time will not exceed 6 hours (unless the sleep efficiency
        quotient is &lt; 80%) and the problem frequency must be equal to or greater than 4 nights/
        week (severe insomnia) with a problem duration &gt; 6 months (chronic insomnia). This profile
        must be evident at both intake (based on retrospective reports) and as an average profile
        from the two weeks of baseline diaries (based on prospective sampling).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable medical or psychiatric illness Assessed with the Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the The Schedule for Affective Disorders and
             Schizophrenia-Lifetime Version (SADS-L) To assure that the insomnia is not secondary
             to these factors

          -  Symptoms suggestive of sleep disorders other than insomnia Assessed with the SDS-CL To
             assure that the insomnia is not secondary to these factors

          -  Polysomnographic data indicating sleep disorders other than insomnia Assessed with PSG
             in collaboration with our sleep medicine consultants To assure that the insomnia is
             not secondary to these factors

          -  History of head injury with a sustained loss of consciousness Assessed by self report
             during the Intake Interview To help assure that the EEG measures are unconfounded by
             brain damage

          -  Evidence of active illicit substance use or fitting criteria for alcohol abuse or
             dependence Assessed with a structured psychiatric interview schedule (the MINI) ,
             written versions of clinical interview queries regarding alcohol use, abuse and
             dependence (the AUDIT and CAGE), the toxicology screen which is part of the clinical
             chemistries obtained during the screening physical. To assure that the insomnia is not
             secondary to these factors and to assure that substance use/abuse does not confound
             treatment.

          -  Use of CNS active medications, antidepressants, and hypnotics other than zolpidem
             Assessed by self report and from the toxicology screen which is part of the clinical
             chemistries obtained during the screening physical. To help assure that the clinical
             effects observed in this study are due to the study medication and schedule of
             reinforcement.

          -  Inadequate language comprehension Informally, assessed by the Clinical Research
             Coordinator during Intake Interview To assure the quality of self report data as all
             the measures are in English.

          -  Pregnancy Assessed by self report and from the clinical chemistries data obtained
             during the screening physical. Excluded so as to 1) prevent the fetus from exposure to
             the study medication (although it should be noted that the medication is considered
             FDA pregnancy category B) and 2) control for the biopsychosocial changes that occur
             with pregnancy and may alter the response to the study medication and schedule of
             reinforcement.

          -  No first-degree relatives with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia Assessed by self
             report and a structured psychiatric interview schedule (the SADs). Excluded to reduce
             risk for first onset during the study
