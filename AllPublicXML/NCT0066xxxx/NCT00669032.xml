    <description>Percentage of subjects with a clinical response according to Osteaorthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2004 criteria at the end of follow-up. Patients were classified as responders if the pain or physical function scores decreased at least 50% and at least 20mm on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), or if two of the following three findings were recorded: a decrease in pain score of at least 20% or at least 10mm on the VAS, a decrease in physical function score of at least 20% and at least 10mm on the VAS, or an increase in the score of the patient's global assessment by at least 20% and at least 10mm on the VAS.

Patients were classified as responders if the pain or physical function scores decreased at least 50% and at least 20mm on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), or if two of the following three findings were recorded: a decrease in pain score of at least 20% or at least 10mm on the VAS, a decrease in physical function score of at least 20% and at least 10mm on the VAS, or an increase in the score of the patient's global assessment by at least 20% and at least 10mm on the VAS.

          <description>Percentage of subjects with a clinical response according to Osteaorthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2004 criteria at 21 months follow-up visit (6 months after third cycle). Patients were classified as responders if the pain or physical function scores decreased at least 50% and at least 20mm on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), or if two of the following three findings were recorded: a decrease in pain score of at least 20% or at least 10mm on the VAS, a decrease in physical function score of at least 20% and at least 10mm on the VAS, or an increase in the score of the patient's global assessment by at least 20% and at least 10mm on the VAS.
The VAS is set between 0-100mm, higher values represent a worse outcome in all cases except for both patient and physician global assessments where higher values indicate a better outcome.</description>
