  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIV integrase inhibitor, raltegravir (RAL), which was recently approved by the FDA, has
      been shown in several trials to be highly effective. The purpose of this trial is to estimate
      the viral load decay rate in treatment-naive HIV infected participants receiving RAL and
      emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent data suggests that early virologic response to HIV interventions may be predictive of
      long-term virologic outcomes. Defining early decay in viral load through carefully performed
      studies of viral dynamics may be a useful tool for assessing the likely outcome of long-term
      treatment. It may also be a useful screening tool to define which combinations should be
      studied further. In this trial, the viral load decay rate will be estimated in HIV infected,
      treatment-naive participants receiving RAL and FTC/TDF.

      This study will last approximately 72 weeks. All participants will take RAL and FTC/TDF for
      72 weeks. RAL will be provided by the study. FTC/TDF will not be provided.

      This study will consist of 16 study visits. These visits will occur at study entry, Days 2,
      7, 10, 14, 21, 28, and 56, and Weeks 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72. Blood collection and
      pharmacokinetic studies will occur at all study visits. Self-reported adherence assessments
      will be submitted at each visit. A targeted physical exam will occur at most visits. Liver
      function tests and urine collection will occur at select visits. Pregnancy tests will occur
      whenever pregnancy is suspected.
