  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an investigational malaria vaccine is safe
      and induces an immune response against malaria when tested in adults living in the United
      States.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study begins with the US phase in which 26 volunteers aged 18 to 50 years will be
      enrolled to receive an investigational malaria vaccine. The vaccine is made of a malaria
      protein FMP010 mixed in the adjuvant AS01B. Since this vaccine has not yet been in humans,
      first, 5 volunteers will get a small (10 µg) dose of FMP010 in AS01B. If it is safe, then 20
      volunteers will get 50 µg FMP010 in AS01B. Vaccinations are given IM in the deltoid of the
      non-dominant arm, every month for 3 months. After each vaccination, the subjects will follow
      up at clinical trials for evaluation of any adverse events. There will be blood draws to
      assess safety of the vaccine as well as the level of immune response generated to the
      vaccine.

      Upon receipt of preliminary safety results, the Kenya phase begins in which 30 volunteers who
      are randomized to receive either 50 µg FMP010 in AS01B (20) or the rabies vaccine (10).
      Vaccination and is on the same schedule as in the US phase and follow-up is for 112 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female 18 to 50 years of age (inclusive) at the
             time of screening

          -  Free of significant health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study

          -  Available to participate for duration of study (approximately seven months)

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential (either surgically
             sterilized or one year post-menopausal) or, if of childbearing potential, she must be
             capable of preventing pregnancy, have a negative pregnancy test at the time of each
             vaccination, and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after
             completion of the vaccination series.

          -  If the volunteer indicates he/she is active duty military (on the DCT sign-in page and
             intake form), approval from their supervisor through the Division Director using the
             Statement of Supervisor's Approval Form must be signed and on file prior to receipt of
             any test product

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject before screening
             procedures.

          -  Prior to entry into this study, subjects must score at least 80% correct on a 10-
             question multiple-choice quiz that assesses their understanding of this study. If they
             do not score 80% on the initial quiz, the protocol information will be reviewed with
             them to ensure comprehension, and they will have the opportunity to retest. If a
             volunteer fails to correctly answer 8 of 10 questions after two attempts they will be
             excluded from the study.
