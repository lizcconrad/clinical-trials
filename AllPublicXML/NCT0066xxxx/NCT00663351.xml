      This Post-Approval study is prospective follow-up study designed to evaluate the long-term
      safety and effectiveness of the Reflection Ceramic Acetabular System. Randomized
      Non-inflammatory Arthritis, Randomized Inflammatory and Continued Access Cohorts patients
      previously enrolled in the IDE study will be evaluated annually through five (5) year
      follow-up. In addition, all patients enrolled in the original study cohorts as well as the
      continued access patients will be sent a letter questionnaire annually at the 6-10 year
      postoperative time point to assess the patient's general well-being and if the study
      components are still in place

        Criteria

        Inclusion Criteria:

        (Patient must meet all of the following characteristics to be enrolled in the study):

          -  Males and females, 21 to 80 years of age, inclusive;

          -  Primary diagnosis of non-inflammatory arthritis (osteoarthritis) or inflammatory
             arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis), or patients requiring a revision as specified
             previously;

          -  The patient or his/her legal guardian is willing to consent to participate in the
             study by signing and dating the approved consent form;

          -  The patient will be available for follow-up through at least two years postoperative;

          -  The patient has met an acceptable preoperative medical clearance and is free or
             treated for cardiac, pulmonary, hematological, etc., conditions that would pose
             excessive operative risk (FDA requirement);

          -  The patient has a total Harris Hip Score of less than or equal to 60 (FDA
             requirement);

          -  The patient meets none of the exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (Patient with any of the following characteristics must be excluded from the study):

          -  Patients known to have insufficient quantity or quality of bone support resulting from
             Conditions such as cancer, femoral osteotomy, Girdlestone resection, significant
             osteoporosis or metabolic disorders of calcified tissues. Patients with physical
             conditions tending to place extreme loads on implants such as morbid obesity (&gt; 100
             pounds over desirable body weight), Charcot joints, muscle deficiencies, or multiple
             joint disabilities;

          -  Patients with active localized or systemic infection;

          -  Patients who have not reached full skeletal maturity;

          -  Patient psychological or neurological conditions which tend to preempt the patient's
             ability or willingness to restrict activities or follow medical advice, especially
             during the postoperative period, e.g.: drug or alcohol abuse, serious mental illness
             or retardation, or general neurological conditions;

          -  The patient is participating in any other pharmaceutical, biologic or medical device
             clinical investigation;

          -  Immunosuppressive disorders - immunosuppressive disorders are chronic conditions
             characterized by markedly inhibited ability to respond to antigenic stimuli. Examples
             of such conditions include patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy
             (corticosteroid hormones in large amounts, cytotoxic drugs, antilymphocytic serum or
             irradiation in large doses), patients receiving therapy to prevent homograft
             rejection, patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or auto-immune
             diseases (except rheumatoid arthritis).

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Patients with known sensitivity to materials in the device.
