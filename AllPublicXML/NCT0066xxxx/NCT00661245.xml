      The TOGA® trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized sham-controlled trial designed to
      determine the safety and effectiveness of the TOGA System for the treatment of morbid
      obesity. The study will also determine the effect of the treatment on co-morbidities and
      quality of life.

      Subjects will be blinded to treatment or sham. Sham arm may crossover to TOGA treatment at 12
      months.

    <description>The TOGA procedure is an incision-free treatment using a set of flexible staplers introduced into the mouth and esophagus to create a sleeve in the stomach (transoral formation of a gastric sleeve). The TOGA sleeve limits the amount of food that can be eaten and gives the patient a feeling of fullness after a small meal.</description>
