  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry skin is a physiological condition and is characterized in contrast to greasy skin by
      roughness, desquamation and lack of brightness of the skin surface. Subjectively, feelings of
      tension, burning and itching can occur. The skin reacts more intensive on external and
      physical noxae. Dry skin is caused by a lack of moisture. This is most common during the
      winter months, when heating systems dry the air. Bathing with hot water, spending extended
      periods of time in the hot sun, and the skin's natural aging process also remove moisture and
      oils from the skin. It is diagnosed through clinical observation. People suffering from dry
      skin often desire to improve this condition for optical cosmetic reasons and due to the
      occasional feeling of tension. The aim of this investigation is to observe the improvement
      (or not) of dry itchy skin by a lotion containing a cooling compound

      The patient use the lotion twice daily for a four-week period. Additionally, the patient
      receives a documentation sheets to note several parameters. In a sensory assessment, product
      specific parameter such as spreadability, permeability, lubricating, smell of lotion and
      cosmetic acceptance during the treatment will be assessed (at the beginning, after 2 weeks,
      after 4 weeks, 2 weeks after stopping treatment). Before and after skin care measurement, the
      skin surface will be investigated by d-squames and corneometer. After four weeks the skin
      care measurement will be terminated and the patient can continue with a treatment of his
      choice. A monitoring of at least 70 patients is intended.
