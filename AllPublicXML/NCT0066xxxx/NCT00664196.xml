      This study tests the safety and tolerability of autologous anti-PSMA gene-modified T cells
      (designer T cells) in hormone refractory prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study creates autologous gene-modified T cells against prostate specific membrane antigen
      (PSMA, unrelated to PSA) (designer T cells) by ex vivo modification of patient T cells. T
      cells are collected by leukopheresis, transported to the RWMC cGMP Cell Manipulation Core and
      transduced with retrovirus containing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that is expressed on
      the modified cells. This CAR links specificity of an antibody against PSMA with signaling
      domains of the T cell and redirects the recognition of the T cells to engage and kill
      prostate cancer cells anywhere in the body. These are administered at a dose of 10^10 with
      randomization to either low or moderate Interleukin 2 given by CI (continuous infusion) for
      one month following the T cell infusion. Subsequent subjects will receive 10^11 cells with
      Interleukin 2 at either low or moderate dose, in a non randomized manner, depending upon the
      outcome of the prior cohort. Prior to T cell infusion, all subjects will receive
      non-myeloablative (NMA) conditioning. This conditioning creates a &quot;space&quot; in the blood and
      marrow for engraftment of the infused cells to maintain of high level of anti-tumor effector
      T cells in the body. Each patient is treated with a single dose of T cells, without repeat
      dosing. Patients are followed for toxicity and response and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics
      of the infused T cells. Patients are on-study for one-month after their T cell dose.
