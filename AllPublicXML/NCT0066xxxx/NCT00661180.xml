      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-cancer activity and safety of Bay 43-006,
      in patients who have Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia that resisted to Gleevec treatment, one of
      the standard medication administered for these patients.

    <description>Patients will receive Bay 43-9006 400 mg po twice daily in a continuous, uninterrupted schedule. Treatment will continue until there is objective evidence of disease progression, or until evidence of toxicities that are unacceptable and thought to be related to study drug, which requires discontinuation of drug, or due to withdrawn patient consent.</description>
