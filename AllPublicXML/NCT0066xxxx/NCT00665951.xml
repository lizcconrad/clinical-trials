  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot pharmacokinetic study is designed to exclude a large difference (&gt;40%) in
      pharmacokinetics (esp. AUC) between two new Lopimune formulations and the branded
      formulation. The formal bioequivalence study with adequate power will be conducted by the
      manufacturer. In order to get data independently from the manufacturer and to have this
      information in an earlier phase, this small pilot study is initiated.

      The initial study showed a declined bioavailability of the granules under fasting conditions.
      The study has been extended with an arm determining the pharmacokinetics of the granules
      after food (compared to the oral solution taken with food).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cipla has developed two co-formulated forms of lopinavir/ritonavir for second-line
      antiretroviral therapy for children: Lopimune granules and Lopimune tablets. They contain
      100mg lopinavir and 25mg ritonavir.

      Primary objective of this study:

      To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of lopinavir and ritonavir in two different
      co-formulations (Lopimune granules and Lopimune tablets) after single-dose in HIV-negative,
      healthy adult subjects, and to compare this to the branded product.

      Secondary objective:

      To evaluate the safety of single-dose administration of the two generic co-formulations of
      lopinavir/ritonavir and compare this to the branded product.
