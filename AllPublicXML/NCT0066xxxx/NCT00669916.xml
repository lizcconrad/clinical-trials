  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study
      comparing 3 mg/kg of AIN457 to placebo. Subjects with a diagnosis of moderate to severe
      stable plaque psoriasis will be randomized to receive either AIN457 or placebo. AIN457 or
      placebo will be administered by single infusion at baseline and subjects will be observed for
      up to 26 weeks following the infusion.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Mean Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI assessed the extent of psoriasis on four body surface areas (head, trunk and upper limbs) and the degree of plaque erythema, scaling and thickness. The PASI score accounted for the extent of body surface area affected by the erythema, scaling and thickness and the severity of these measures. The score ranged from 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease) where a reduction in PASI score from baseline indicates improvement. The percentage change was calculated by subtracting the week 4 values from the baseline values.The percentage change was calculated for each entire treatment group (not for each participant). A positive percentage change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Change From Baseline in Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA is an instrument which captured and categorized the global assessment of all clinical signs and symptoms of disease. The investigator used all available information for the assessment, including subjective information from the participant and (where available) photographs taken at baseline. The IGA categories were clear, almost clear, mild disease, moderate disease, severe disease and very severe disease. This outcome measure shows the percentage of patients who experienced a category change from baseline. Category changes of 1, 2 or 3 indicate improvement.</description>

        <description>Blood was drawn for PK analyses at baseline (prior to dosing), end of infusion, 1 hr and 2 hr after infusion, and during office visits in Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 26. The PK samples may have been taken at any time during each office visit, following the day of study drug infusion.
