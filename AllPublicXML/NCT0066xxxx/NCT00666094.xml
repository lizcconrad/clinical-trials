      To test the hypothesis that there is no difference in change in HbA1C among men with type
      2-diabetes after an exercise intervention with strength versus endurance training.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training is well documented as part of effective treatment for type 2-diabetes
      patients. Endurance training has been suggested as the most suitable form of exercise. There
      are reasons to believe that strength training also has a positive effect. However,
      comparisons of endurance training and strength training regimes are limited.

      Therefore we randomized 26 men with type 2-diabetes to either an endurance training group or
      a strength training group. Both groups exercised three sessions per week for three months.
      The training was supervised.
