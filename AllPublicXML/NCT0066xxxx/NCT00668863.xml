  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 cycles (1 cycle = 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
PFS data was censored on the day following the date of the last tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who 1) were given anti-tumor treatment other than the study treatment prior to observing objective tumor progression; 2) were removed from the study prior to documentation of objective tumor progression; and 3) were ongoing at the time of the analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 cycles (1 cycle = 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause. OS data was censored on the day following the date of the last contact at which the patient is known to be alive.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Presented Objective Response: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 cycles (1 cycle = 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of either a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) relative to the number of participants in FAS. Based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and PR is defined as a greater than or equal to 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 cycles (1 cycle = 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>DR is defined as the time from the first objective documentation of complete or partial response that is subsequently confirmed to the first documentation of disease progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The definition of censorship is the same as PFS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) of Sunitinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Irinotecan</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples were assessed at prior to initiation of irinotecan (and l-leucovorin) infusion, 1, 2 (predose for 5-FU bolus), 4, 8, and 24 hours after initiation of irinotecan infusion, and Cmax of irinotecan and its metabolite SN-38 were determined.</description>

    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Measurable Concentration (AUC Last) and Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC ∞) of Irinotecan</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>AUC last of irinotecan and its metabolite SN-38 were calculated using the Linear/Log trapezoidal method.
AUC∞ of irinotecan was calculated using following equation; AUC last+(C*t/kel), where Ct* is the estimated concentration at the time of the last quantifiable concentration, kel is terminal phase rate constant that is estimated as the absolute value of the slope of a linear regression during the terminal phase of the natural-logarithm (ln) transformed concentration-time profile.</description>

    <measure>Clearance of Irinotecan</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 15</time_frame>

    <measure>Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of Irinotecan</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 Day 15</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Up to 11 cycles (1 cycle = 6 weeks)</time_frame>

Sunitinib was given in combination with FOLFIRI, which was administered in the standard fashion every 2 weeks: Irinotecan (180 mg/m^2) and l-leucovorin (200 mg/m^2) was infused intravenously on Day 1, immediately followed by 5 FU bolus (400 mg/m^2) and 46-hour (2400 mg/m^2) infusion. FOLFIRI was given on Days 1, 15, and 29 in each 6-week cycle of sunitinib administration.</description>

        <title>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F) of Sunitinib</title>
        <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

          <description>AUC last of irinotecan and its metabolite SN-38 were calculated using the Linear/Log trapezoidal method.
AUC∞ of irinotecan was calculated using following equation; AUC last+(C*t/kel), where Ct* is the estimated concentration at the time of the last quantifiable concentration, kel is terminal phase rate constant that is estimated as the absolute value of the slope of a linear regression during the terminal phase of the natural-logarithm (ln) transformed concentration-time profile.</description>
