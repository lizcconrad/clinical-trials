      To study the toxicity, safety and DTH response of DNP-modified autologous ovarian tumor cell
      vaccine and the DTH response to unmodified ovarian tumor cells in patients with relapsed
      ovarian cancer:

        -  To determine the tolerability and toxicity of the treatment regimen

        -  To determine whether O-Vax induces a DTH response to autologous, DNP-modified ovarian
           cancer cells

        -  To determine whether O-Vax induces a DTH response to autologous, unmodified ovarian
           cancer cells

      Study Population: Patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer whose therapeutic tumor
      surgery provides a mass which yields adequate tumor cells for vaccine preparation and
      delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) testing

      Study Design: A Phase I/IIa double-blind, three-dose, multi-center study

      Investigational Product: O-Vax: DNP-modified autologous ovarian tumor cell vaccine

      Dosage Form: Cell suspension

      Route of Administration: Intradermal

      Dosage and Treatment Schedule: Prior to enrollment in the study, one dose of 5 x 106 modified
      and one dose of 5 x 106 unmodified autologous ovarian cancer cells will be administered, to
      establish a negative DTH response at baseline. Three dosing regimens will be used: 5 x 105,
      2.5 x 106, or 5 x 106 DNP-modified autologous ovarian tumor cells. An initial dose of
      DNP-modified autologous ovarian tumor cells* followed by cyclophosphamide then weekly doses
      of DNP-modified autologous ovarian tumor cells mixed with Bacillus of Calmette and Guérin
      (BCG) for 6 weeks, and completed with one dose of DNP-modified autologous ovarian tumor cells
      mixed with BCG as a 6 month booster if adequate cells

        -  count determined prior to aliquoting for cryopreservation

      Endpoints: Treatment-emergent and related adverse events, serious adverse events, and Grade 3
      and 4 laboratory abnormalities

      Other Parameters:

        -  Delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions for assessing the induction of immune
           responses to DNP-modified and unmodified autologous ovarian tumor cells

        -  CA-125 levels

        -  Survival

        -  Exploratory analysis incorporating in vitro analysis of lymphocytes separated from
           patient blood samples

      Duration of Treatment: Up to 6 months

      Duration of Subject Participation in Study: Three months from the patient's last vaccine

      Duration of Follow-up: Survival information will be collected via phone or visit on a
      quarterly basis for each patient beginning 30 days after the last scheduled visit

      Number of Subjects Required to Meet Protocol Objectives: 42 evaluable subjects

      Number of Study Centers: 4-5

      Number of Individual Blood Draws: 13 draws over nine months

      Volume of Blood Drawn: 11 Draws of 30 mL/draw (total 360 mL) and two draws of 50mL in
      heparinized tubes
