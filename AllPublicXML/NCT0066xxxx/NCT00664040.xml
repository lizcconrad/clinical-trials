      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and many
      people that die of heart disease have no previous symptoms. This study will look specifically
      at the response to four short-term environmental exposures including: the body's response to
      a cold stimulus, to a high fat milk shake, to aspirin, and to a high and low salt diet. These
      interventions are all known to influence CVD and people can have different responses to these
      interventions, which may be due, at least in part, to differences in genetic make up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly one million Americans died of CVD in 1999, and it is predicted that, over one million
      Americans will have a myocardial infarction (MI) with 650,000 of these experiencing their
      first MI. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in the U.S.,
      accounting for 1 of every 5 deaths, or 680,000 of more than 2,000,000 deaths. CAD is also the
      leading cause of premature, permanent disability in the U.S. labor force, accounting for more
      than $110 billion in health care costs annually, as compared to $329 billion for all CVD.
      Risk factors for CAD include high blood pressure, tobacco smoke, abnormal lipids and
      lipoproteins, physical inactivity, overweight and obesity, diabetes mellitus, increasing age,
      male sex, heredity, individual response to stress, and menopause in women. Other indicators
      for increased risk of events include the presence and extent of coronary artery
      calcification, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet aggregation. Of those who die suddenly
      from CAD, 50% of men and 63% of women have no previous symptoms. Studies of how specific
      environmental interventions may interact with genes to influence selected risk factors,
      especially in individuals with varying extent of vascular calcification, a marker of
      atherosclerosis, will facilitate the early identification of asymptomatic high-risk
      individuals who will benefit from existing or new interventions.

      The overall objective of this proposal is to identify novel loci (and ultimately genes) that
      interact with specific environmental exposures to modify risk factors for cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). To achieve this goal, we will perform four short-term interventions known to
      modify CVD risk in participants of the Amish Family Calcification Study (AFCS), an ongoing
      study of the joint genetic determinants of CVD and osteoporosis. Over 1,000 individuals from
      this ongoing study have already been recruited and are being characterized with respect to
      CVD risk factors, including blood pressure, body composition, lipids, and coronary artery
      calcification (by electron beam computerized tomography (EBCT)). From a previous examination,
      DNA has been collected on all AFCS subjects and a 5-cM genome scan (~800 short tandem repeat
      (STR) markers) has been completed by the NHLBI Mammalian Genotyping Service. Thus, this large
      family study from a unique genetically homogeneous founder population provides an ideal
      opportunity to identify genes that interact with the environment in shaping risk factors for
      CVD. The Specific Aims of this proposal are:

        1. To perform four focused short-term interventions known to affect cardiovascular function
           in 1,000 subjects from the AFCS. Responses of relevant CVD-related quantitative traits
           will be measured. The interventions and responses will be: a. cold pressor stress and
           changes in blood pressure and changes in endothelial function as assessed by brachial
           artery dilation (BART); b. a high fat load and changes in brachial artery flow mediated
           dilation (FMD) and serum lipid levels; c. high salt and low salt diets and changes in
           blood pressure; and d. aspirin and changes in platelet function and inflammatory
           markers.

        2. To characterize the genetic epidemiology of the responses to each short-term
           intervention by: a. estimating the heritability of each response to the intervention; b.
           determining if response to intervention is correlated with coronary artery and aortic
           calcification and if so, if the association can be explained by common genes or shared
           environments; and c. determining if response to intervention is correlated with baseline
           measures of CVD risk factors, and if so, if the association can be explained by common
           genes or shared environments.

        3. To identify specific chromosomal loci that influence CVD-related trait responses to the
           four short-term interventions by performing genome-wide linkage analysis utilizing a 5
           cM density (~800 STR markers) genetic map already available in 1,000 subjects of the
           AFCS.

        4. To determine if chromosomal regions linked to, or associated with, variation in
           CVD-related trait responses are also linked to, or associated with, variation in
           coronary artery or aortic calcification.

        5. To fine map the putative chromosomal loci linked to variation in CVD-related trait
           responses to short-term environmental interventions through linkage disequilibrium
           mapping with closely spaced single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.

    <intervention_name>Aspirin</intervention_name>
    <description>The aspirin intervention (81 mg per day) will last a total of 14 days. Pills will be provided in a pre-loaded pillbox. The field team will visit the subject at his/her home at least once to insure adherence to the aspirin intervention and to monitor for adverse side effects. On day 14 of the aspirin intervention, the subject will visit the clinic for a fasting blood draw for platelet aggregation and inflammatory marker studies. A pill count will be performed to assess adherence. The subject can miss up to four aspirin doses over the two-week period; however, an aspirin must be taken each day for the three days prior to clinic visit 2. The aspirin intervention can be extended for up to three days (17 days total) to meet the latter criteria. If more than four doses were missed, then the physician should be contacted and the patient should be withdrawn from the aspirin intervention. Platelet aggregation will be measured 1 hour after the last dose of aspirin.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cold Pressor Test</intervention_name>
    <description>This intervention consists of the participant placing his or her hand and wrist into ice water for 2Â½ minutes. The blood pressure is taken before and after the arm is removed from the water. An ultrasound machine is used to take pictures of the brachial artery in the left arm before and after the arm is removed from the water.</description>

    <intervention_name>High Fat Meal</intervention_name>
    <description>The participants are given a high fat milk shake consisting of 83% fat. Blood samples are drawn from a catheter placed in the participant's arm prior to the test. The samples are drawn before the milk shake and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after the milk shake is consumed. Before and at 2, 4 and 6 hours following the meal the ultrasound is used to obtain images of the brachial artery.</description>

    <intervention_type>Other</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Dietary Salt</intervention_name>
    <description>The salt intervention will consist of 6 days of an isocaloric high salt diet (270 mmol/d) followed by a washout period of at least 8 days and then a low salt diet (40 mmol/d). All food will be prepared by a registered dietician and dietary technicians in a specially equipped kitchen. The specific foods will consist of approximately 50% carbohydrates, 35% fat, and 15% protein. Dietary potassium will remain constant at 120 mmol/d. A food diary will be kept for each diet and subjects will be instructed to eat only the food provided. A field nurse will visit the home on days 3 and 5 of each diet to insure that neither diet is acutely affecting the health status of the subject. A first AM void spot urine will be obtained to measure sodium, potassium and creatinine on the 4th, 5th, and 6th days of each diet to insure compliance. Blood pressure will be measured using an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for 24 hours on the last day of each diet.</description>
