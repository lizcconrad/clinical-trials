  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is our primary hypothesis that pretreatment with arformoterol will provide superior
      protection against EIB in children with mild-moderate asthma compared to placebo added to the
      current asthma regimen.

      Our secondary hypothesis is that nebulized arformoterol has comparable protection against EIB
      compared to inhaled formoterol by dry powder inhaler.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover clinical trial which will
      consist of 5 study visits and will last up to 3 weeks.

      Fifteen children 12-17 years of age with asthma and EIB, regardless of current asthma therapy
      will be eligible for this trial.
