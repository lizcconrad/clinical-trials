  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16 week study of the efficacy of quetiapine in treating symptoms of generalized
      anxiety disorder (GAD) in subjects with comorbid opiate dependence. The study will be
      conducted in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled fashion. Study
      subjects will be inpatients at a residential drug-treatment facility, enrolled in a 1 year
      methadone-to-abstinence treatment plan. Subjects will be randomized to receive either
      quetiapine or placebo in addition to ongoing drug addiction treatment. Subjects will be
      followed for 16 weeks and a variety of psychometric assessments will be made.

      Hypothesis One: Compared to placebo, Quetiapine will demonstrate a greater reduction in
      symptoms of anxiety in subjects with GAD and remitted comorbid opiate abuse.

      Exploratory Hypotheses: Compared to placebo, Quetiapine will demonstrate a greater
      improvement in psychosocial functioning and compliance with community norms in subjects
      enrolled in a residential drug addiction treatment facility.

      <pre_assignment_details>The subjects were individuals with opiate addiction on agonist therapy. After recruitement subjects underwent methadone taper as inpatients. Most subjects left the study because they signed out of the Su Casa Program and did not complete their methadone taper.</pre_assignment_details>

            <description>The participants were scheduled to receive Quetiapine, initially at a dose of 50 mg qHS for 2 days, followed by 100 mg qHS for 2 days, and then raised to a target dose of 150 mg qHS. Patients who do not tolerate that dose were titrated downwards in 50 mg increments until a tolerable dose is achieved. Medication dosage was further adjusted as necessary during the course of the study.
