  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib study to be conducted at approximately eight
      sites in Europe and the U.S. designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and activity
      of SGN-40 when combined with bortezomib in patients with multiple myeloma that is relapsed or
      refractory after at least one prior systemic treatment regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Documented pathologic diagnosis of multiple myeloma that has relapsed or failed to
             respond after treatment with at least one prior systemic therapy (other than
             corticosteroid monotherapy)

          -  Measurable disease

          -  At least one prior systemic therapy other than single-agent corticosteroids

          -  European Union patients must have had prior bone marrow transplant (autologous) or be
             ineligible for transplant

          -  If previously received bortezomib, demonstration of clinical response of any duration
             or stable disease with progression-free interval of ≥ 6 months from the start of that
             therapy

          -  If previously received bortezomib, must have recovered from bortezomib-related
             toxicities and must have a peripheral neuropathy score of Grade ≤ 1, according to the
             NCI CTCAE v3.0

          -  If applicable, completion of autologous transplant ≥ 12 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Discontinuation of previous anticancer or investigational therapy for ≥ 21 days prior
             to treatment, or ≥ 90 days prior to treatment for previous monoclonal antibody
             administration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant

          -  Other invasive malignancies within 3 years prior to Day 1 except for adequately
             treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer; carcinoma in situ of the cervix,
             breast, or prostate; or other cancer of which the patient has been disease-free for ≥
             3 years

          -  Prior anaphylactic reaction to human immunoglobulin administration

          -  Symptomatic hyperviscosity syndrome

          -  Active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics within 14 days of Day 1

          -  Major surgical procedure or significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to Day
             1, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the study

          -  Clinically significant cardiac dysfunction or other significant organ dysfunction
