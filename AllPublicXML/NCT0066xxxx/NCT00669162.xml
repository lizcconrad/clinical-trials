    <textblock>
      Following a radical prostatectomy and lymph node sampling, eligible patients will undergo
      post-operative radiation therapy, concurrent weekly docetaxel chemotherapy , and hormonal
      therapy (Casodex daily and Zoladex every 3 months for 2 times or Lupron 22.5 mg im every 3
      months for 2 times).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and feasibility of combining post-operative radiation therapy, and
      hormonal therapy (6 months) and concurrent docetaxel in men with high risk pathologic T2-3N0
      prostate cancer after a radical prostatectomy.

      To obtain preliminary information regarding the efficacy of combining weekly docetaxel with
      adjuvant radiation therapy and hormonal therapy in men with high risk pathologic T2-3N0
      prostate cancer by determining PSA failure free survival.

      To assess baseline and longitudinal changes in health-related quality of life outcomes during
      and after therapy (at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only those patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who have undergone a radical
             prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node sampling and found to have high risk
             non-metastatic disease with undetectable, persistent or decreasing post-operative PSA
             levels, or who have subsequently experienced a rise in PSA, will be eligible for the
             trial as described below in the inclusion and exclusion criteria

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Status post radical prostatectomy with sampling of the pelvic lymph nodes with
             histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, with the patients falling
             into either the &quot;adjuvant high risk group&quot; or the &quot;salvage high risk group&quot; as
             follows:

               -  a) &quot;Adjuvant High Risk Group&quot; (undetectable, persistent or decreasing PSA levels

                  clinical symptoms or radiologic evidence) who MUST be able to start RT treatments
                  within 6 months of radical prostatectomy with at least one of the 3 disease

                  symptoms or radiologic evidence), and WITH AT LEAST ONE of the high risk disease
