      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      Desvenlafaxine Succinate Sustained-Release (DVS SR) in child and adolescent outpatients with
      major depressive disorder. A secondary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of DVS SR in the
      treatment of child and adolescent outpatients with major depressive disorder in an
      exploratory manner.

    <description>AEs are any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given study treatment. The event does not need to be causally related to the study treatment. SAEs are adverse events that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, result in cancer, or result in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.</description>

    <time_frame>Postbaseline (≥Day 1 in Core study NCT00619619) up to Week 26 (Extension study)</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS is a participant rated questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, actual attempts (yes or no responses), and intensity of ideation (rated 1=low severity to 5=high severity). Yes/No responses are mapped to Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) categories: Completed suicide, suicide attempt, preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and self-injurious behavior, or no suicidal intent. A participant could have a yes or no response in more than one category.</description>

        <description>AEs are any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given study treatment. The event does not need to be causally related to the study treatment. SAEs are adverse events that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, result in cancer, or result in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Number of Participants for Tanner Assessment at Week 26: Females</title>
        <description>Tanner Children and Adolescent Pubertal Staging questionnaire used to document the stage of development of secondary sexual characteristics. Female pubertal development staged by pubic hair development and breast size (test categories). Rated in 5 stages: stage 1 (no development) to 5 (adult-like development in quantity and size). Change categories: 0=no change in stage, 1=change of 1 stage, 2=change of 2 stages, 3=change of 3 stages, and 4=change of 4 stages. Participants may be represented in more than 1 test category.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline (Extension study), Week 26 (Extension study)</time_frame>
        <population>Safety population (Baseline=Extension study); N=number of participants with evaluable data at observation. No participants had a change of 3 stages or change of 4 stages reported, therefore only changes for 0 stages through 2 stages are reported.</population>
