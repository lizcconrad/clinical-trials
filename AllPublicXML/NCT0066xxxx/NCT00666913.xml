      RATIONALE: Gathering information about the frequency and intensity of hot flashes in patients
      with breast cancer and in patients who have a high risk of developing breast cancer may help
      doctors learn more about menopausal symptoms.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is looking at menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer or
      at high risk of breast cancer who received treatment on another clinical trial.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Retrieve data from an archived database of a closed clinical trial that involved
           treatment with sertraline hydrochloride or a placebo for the management of hot flashes
           or other menopausal symptoms in women with breast cancer or at high risk of breast
           cancer.

        -  Analyze the results of this closed clinical trial so that they can be published.

      OUTLINE: Data from an archived database of a closed clinical trial is retrieved. Descriptive
      analyses of outcome variables (e.g., menopausal symptoms, including number and intensity of
      hot flashes, and psychosocial and quality of life scales) are conducted to gain insight into
      their distributional aspects. Data is analyzed using ANOVA with repeated measures to account
      for the changes within a patient over time as a function of treatment assignment. Summary
      scores from the psychosocial scales that are reasonably complete (i.e., FACT-B and POMS) are
      examined using mixed linear models to account for patient-specific differences, treatment
      effects, and variable patterns of completeness.
