From Day 8 to the end of treatment, participants should have taken 1 mg twice daily. Participants who cannot tolerate adverse effects of Champix could have the dose lowered temporarily or permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily.

From Day 8 to the end of treatment, participants should have taken 1 mg twice daily. Participants who cannot tolerate adverse effects of Champix could have the dose lowered temporarily or permanently to 0.5 mg twice daily.
