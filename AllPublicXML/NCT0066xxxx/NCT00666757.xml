Participants rated their overall performance on the days worked in the last week on a scale of 0 (worst performance) to 10 (top performance). Values were then multiplied by 10 to create a percentage scale between 0 and 100 percent. Absolute presenteeism equals the difference between the &quot;score for self&quot; and &quot;score for average worker in same job&quot;.</description>

        <description>The SDS is a participant-rated anchored visual analog scale to assess disability across the three domains of work/school, social life, and family life, with each item scored from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very severely), with a summarization of the 3 items to evaluate global functioning. The Global Functional Impairment Score is a total score score that ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired), and was used to derived the mean change from baseline to endpoint.</description>

        <description>WP score was calculated by taking midpoint of annual before-tax income reported on HPQ. A multiplier of 1.25 produced estimated direct &amp; indirect (i.e. benefits) income. Annual hours expected to work were calculated from expected daily work hours, multiplied by 236 days. Hourly, indirect income was total direct + indirect income, divided by # of expected annual work hours. Indirect hours lost annually for WP=hours expected to be worked annually times WP percent, times hourly rate=dollars earned, and then subtracted from total direct + indirect income=dollars lost annually due to WP.</description>

Tool assesses the potential impact of change in depressive symptoms on work productivity and its associated employer costs. Scale ranges from 0 to 100% of work days in past 30 days. Absenteeism and presenteeism were combined into a measure of total lost work performance by adding absenteeism to the value ([100–absenteeism] × [100–presenteeism]).

        <description>Self-administered assessment used to determine a subject's work performance in terms of employment status, absenteeism if employed, productivity while at work, usual occupation, and annual income. Tool assesses the potential impact of change in depressive symptoms on work productivity and its associated employer costs. Defined on a 0–100 scale for the percentage of work days the respondent missed in the past 30 days. Absolute absenteeism: actual hours worked minus expected hours equals number of missed work days.
