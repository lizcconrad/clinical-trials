  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to use different x-ray and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
      techniques to take pictures of the knee. There are two specific purposes to the study:

        1. whether the different x-ray and MRI techniques will give the same or different
           information about the knee joint and

        2. which part of the knee joint will show the biggest change using the different x-ray and
           MRI techniques. The study is not designed to test a hypothesis.
