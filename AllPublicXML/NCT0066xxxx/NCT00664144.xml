  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of rasburicase in terms of prevention and
      treatment of hyperuricemia related to Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) in 2 populations of adult
      patients, previously treated or not with urate oxidase, with relapsing aggressive
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and at risk of TLS, presenting with hyperuricemia and/or bulky
      disease at diagnostic of relapse.

      The secondary objectives were to :

        -  evaluate the efficacy of rasburicase in terms of renal protection,

        -  evaluate the safety of rasburicase in the two cohorts of patients,

        -  correlate efficacy and safety results with antibodies generation/level.
