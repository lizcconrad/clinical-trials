  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daptomycin is an antibiotic that is affective against many strains of antibiotic resistant
      microorganisms. This antibiotic would be appropriate for use in the intensive care unit (ICU)
      considering the severity of illness and high risk for infection within this hospital
      environment. While in the ICU, patients may develop acute renal failure. Approximately 75% of
      ICU patients who develop acute renal failure will require some form of renal replacement
      therapy until their kidneys recover. Continuous hemodialysis is becoming one of the most
      common forms of dialysis in the ICU as it is a gentle type of dialysis provided over longer
      periods of time. The current data demonstrating the ability of continuous hemodialysis to
      remove daptomycin from the body is derived from in-vitro trials. The purpose of this trial is
      to determine the extent of daptomycin removal from critically ill patients receiving
      continuous hemodialysis. Findings from this trial will be used to develop new dosing
      recommendations for daptomycin in continuous hemodialysis.

      Daptomycin is a FDA approved antibiotic. This pharmacokinetic trial will monitor daptomycin
      drug concentrations during continuous hemodialysis. The daptomycin concentration profiles
      developed from this study will assist in developing a dose recommendation that will result in
      daptomycin levels that are safe and within therapeutic ranges, as previously identified, in
      critically ill patients with acute renal failure treated with continuous hemodialysis.

    <measure>Daptomycin Volume of Distribution at Steady State</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of daptomycin administration to 48 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution quantifies the distribution of daptomycin between the blood and the rest of the body. The greater the volume of distribtion, the greater the extent of daptomycin distribution throughout the body.</description>

    <measure>Daptomycin Total Body Clearance</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of daptomycin administration to 48 hours post dose when subjects were also receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis</time_frame>
    <description>Total body clearance represents the rate at which daptomycin is removed from the body. In patients treated with continuous venovenous hemodialysis, the major pathways of daptomycin removal likely are: removal by continuuous venovenous hemodialysis (transmembrane clearance) and breakdown by the liver.</description>

    <time_frame>From time of daptomycin administration to 48 hours post dose when subjects were also receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis</time_frame>
    <description>Half-life describes the time it takes for the concentration of the daptomycin in the body to decrease by one half.</description>

    <time_frame>From time of daptomycin administration to 48 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>In the body, daptomcyin may be bound to proteins in the blood or it may not be bound to any proteins (also as the &quot;free&quot; component.) Free fraction describes the percent of daptomycin that is unbound or free. The unbound portion of daptomycin is able to kill bacteria.</description>
