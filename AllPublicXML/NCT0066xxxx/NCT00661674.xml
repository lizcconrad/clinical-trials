  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioid medications are commonly used for pain relief. When given over time, physical
      dependence can occur. This results in unpleasant side effects--such as agitation and
      nausea--if opioid medications are suddenly stopped. We are interested in knowing if a
      medication named Ondansetron can help ease or prevent symptoms associated with opioid
      withdrawal. We are also interested in knowing if a similar (but more potent FDA-approved
      drug, palonosetron) can more effectively treat withdrawal symptoms with or without
      combination with an antihistamine called hydroxyzine (vistaril).

      We hope to learn if Palonosetron and/or combination with hydroxyzine can be used to prevent
      or attenuate the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. If we find that it can help prevent
      these symptoms, it may become a new treatment that can aid patients suffering from these
      symptoms.

    <intervention_model_description>There were three treatment arms to the study: Placebo, Palonosetron, and Palonosetron + Hydroxyzine (Combo). Participants were not randomized in between these arms, all participants completed each arm of the study in a cross-over study methodology (Placebo, Palonosetron, Palonosetron + Hydroxyzene (combo). Participants were individually randomized into the order in which they participated in each arm.
Per sequence each individual participant underwent the following randomization schedule:
Participant 1: Placebo, Combo, Palonosetron Participant 2: Palonosetron, Combo, Placebo Participant 3: Palonosetron, Combo, Placebo Participant 4: Combo, Placebo, Palonosetron Participant 5: Placebo, Palonosetron, Combo Participant 6: Combo, Palonosetron, Placebo Participant 7: Combo, Placebo, Palonosetron Participant 8: Combo, Palonosetron, Placebo Participant 9: Palonosetron, Placebo, Combo Participant 10: Placebo, Combo, Palonosetron</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>OOWS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in OOWS score at 180 minutes (15 minutes post naloxone administration)</time_frame>
    <description>The OOWS is a 13-item instrument documenting physically observable signs of withdrawal, which are rated as present (1) or absent (0) during the observation period. Maximum score possible = 13, minimum score possible = 0. T=15 minutes post naloxone administration coordinates with T = 180 (min) for the entire study session.
OOWS scores at T=180 is the primary outcome measure of the study compared with baseline OOWS scores at T=-30 (30 minutes prior to study medication administration). Reported time frames are in relation to time past since administration of study medications.
Mean post-Naloxone OOWS scores (+/- SEM) were determined for pretreatment groups</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SOWS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in SOWS score at 180 minutes (15 minutes post naloxone administration)</time_frame>
    <description>The SOWS score is composed of 16 subjective symptoms rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 4=extremely) based on what subjects were experiencing at the time of testing. 15 minutes post naloxone administration coordinates with T = 180 (min) for the entire study session.
The highest score possible (64) would indicate that the individual was experiencing every symptom of opioid withdrawal to the fullest extent possible while the lowest score (0) would indicate that the individual was not experiencing any symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
Mean post-naloxone SOWS scores (+/- SEM) were computed for pretreatment groups: Placebo, palonosetron, and palonosetron with hydroxyzine</description>

    <description>At T = 0 (minutes), healthy (non-opioid dependent, non-substance abuser) male volunteers (N=10) were pre-treated with either placebo (0.9% normal saline), palonosetron IV (0.75mg), or palonosetron IV (0.75mg) and hydroxyzine per os (PO) (100mg) in a crossover study design. This was followed at T = 30 by intravenous morphine (10mg/70kg). At T = 165, 10mg/70kg naloxone IV was given to precipitate opioid withdrawal. The objective opioid withdrawal score (OOWS) and subjective opioid withdrawal score (SOWS) were determined 5 and 15 minutes after naloxone administration (T = 170, 180, respectively). Baseline measurements were recorded at T = -30 and T = -15.

          <description>At T = 0 (minutes), healthy (non-opioid dependent, non-substance abuser) male volunteers (N=10) were pre-treated with either placebo (0.9% normal saline), palonosetron IV (0.75mg), or palonosetron IV (0.75mg) and hydroxyzine per os (PO) (100mg) in a crossover study design. This was followed at T = 30 by intravenous morphine (10mg/70kg). At T = 165, 10mg/70kg naloxone IV was given to precipitate opioid withdrawal. The objective opioid withdrawal score (OOWS) and subjective opioid withdrawal score (SOWS) were determined 5 and 15 minutes after naloxone administration (T = 170, 180, respectively). Baseline measurements were recorded at T = -30 and T = -15.

        <title>SOWS Score</title>
        <description>The SOWS score is composed of 16 subjective symptoms rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (0=not at all, 4=extremely) based on what subjects were experiencing at the time of testing. 15 minutes post naloxone administration coordinates with T = 180 (min) for the entire study session.
The highest score possible (64) would indicate that the individual was experiencing every symptom of opioid withdrawal to the fullest extent possible while the lowest score (0) would indicate that the individual was not experiencing any symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
Mean post-naloxone SOWS scores (+/- SEM) were computed for pretreatment groups: Placebo, palonosetron, and palonosetron with hydroxyzine</description>

At T = 165, 10mg/70kg naloxone IV was given to precipitate opioid withdrawal. The objective opioid withdrawal score (OOWS) and subjective opioid withdrawal score (SOWS) were determined 5 and 15 minutes after naloxone administration (T = 170, 180, respectively).
