  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Emergency Department (ED), diabetes is commonly encountered as a secondary diagnosis
      and many patients with uncontrolled diabetes are admitted to the hospital after initial
      evaluation in the ED. Currently there are no guidelines in the US for the management of
      hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes during the duration of evaluation and treatment in
      the ED. It is known that high blood glucose levels in hospitalized patients with diabetes are
      associated with increased risk of medical complications. In this study, we hypothesize that a
      defined two-step approach to the management of high blood sugars with insulin injections
      initiated in the ED may decrease length of stay in the ED or hospital, improve clinical
      outcome and prevent some hospital complications. In the first phase, patients with diabetes
      admitted to the ED that have a high blood sugar (BG 200mg/dL) will be randomized to receive
      scheduled aspart or the usual care as dictated by the ED physicians. In the second phase,
      patients enrolled in the first phase that are subsequently admitted to the hospital will
      receive a combination of detemir and aspart insulin or usual care as dictated by the
      Admitting Medicine Team. Detemir is a long-acting insulin which is given subcutaneously
      (under the skin) once daily. Aspart is a rapid-acting insulin which is given subcutaneously
      several times a day and frequently before meals. Detemir and aspart insulins are approved for
      use in the treatment of patients with diabetes by the FDA. Usual care can be oral
      anti-diabetic agents, subcutaneous insulin therapy or a combination of both. Subcutaneous
      insulin used for usual care could include NPH, 70/30 insulin, aspart insulin, regular insulin
      or insulin glargine.

      This investigator-initiated research will be conducted at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta
      and at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL. Dr. Smiley will serve as principal
      investigator at the Atlanta site. A total of 120 patients will be recruited at Grady and 120
      patients at the Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL. This study is supported by Novo
      Nordisk.
