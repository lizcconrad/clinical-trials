  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-authorisation safety study to assess the incidence and severity of all
      pre-defined cardiovascular events in patients treated with DYNEPO, as well as to detect &amp;
      describe less common adverse drug reactions, and to summarise DYNEPO drug utilisation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The termination of the study is not linked to a product recall or result of any safety signal.
    Rather it was sponsor's commercial decision to withdraw the MA
