    <textblock>
      Insomnia is common in the elderly population and is associated with increased health
      problems, reduced quality of life and greater use of sleep inducing drugs. This research aims
      to examine the effectiveness of Yoga practice to treat insomnia in elderly people, determine
      the ability to enhance their quality of life and determine if it is suitable to western
      culture and conditions.

      Introduction: Geriatric insomnia is prevalent, reducing life quality, diminishing cognition
      and increasing risk of accidents and mortality. Treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs has
      limited effectiveness and further increases the risk of accidents and falls. Yoga has been
      shown to increase well-being in the elderly.

      Hypotheses

        1. Integrated yoga style practice can improve sleep quality/quantity

        2. Integrated yoga style practice can improve quality of life.

      Objectives:

        1. Examine effectiveness of yoga for insomnia and reduction in use of hypnotics/relaxants
           in the elderly;

        2. Determine whether yoga enhances quality of life in the elderly; and 3. Determine whether
           yoga is suitable for elderly in western culture(s).

      Methods:

      A mixed design crossover controlled trial (n =74, age range 60-87, M = 74.4, SD = 7.1) with 2
      weekly classes incorporating physical and meditative yoga, and daily home practice of
      meditative yoga for 12 weeks. Measures included self-reported assessment of sleep quality
      (Sleep Logs, KSS, ESS, PSQI, MAPS), mood states (DASS, POMS), general health (SF-36) and
      mobile objective home sleep studies.
