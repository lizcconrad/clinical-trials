      This study will train Lay Health Promoters (LHPs) from African-American churches to
      administer healthy living lessons and activities to their congregations in order to improve
      overall health and address cardiovascular disease. The primary hypothesis is that LHP
      training combined with a well supported maintenance strategy will be more effective than LHP
      training alone in reducing risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

      The GoodNEWS Trial is an 18-month effectiveness trial with an 18-month extended maintenance
      study, among 20 African-American and low-income congregations participating in the GoodNEWS
      faith-based lay health promotion program. After training, congregations will be randomized to
      either GoodNEWS with a health maintenance intervention (GoodNEWS-I) or GoodNEWS program alone
      (GoodNEWS-PA). The maintenance intervention combines elements of the medical care model and
      features of community-based support. Primary data collection will occur at baseline, 18, and
      36 months with the two primary outcomes being levels of physical activity as measured by 7-
      Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) and dietary change as measured by the Diet History
      Questionnaire (DHQ). The primary hypothesis is that the maintenance group will significantly
      increase physical activity and healthy eating behavior compared to the program only group. We
      also hypothesize that lipoprotein and glucose levels, and blood pressure will be
      significantly improved over baseline in the GoodNEWS-I group and that these changes will be
      significantly greater than in the GoodNEWS-PA group. At the end of the trial, both groups
      will continue in an 18-month extended maintenance study.
