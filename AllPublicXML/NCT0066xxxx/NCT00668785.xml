  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label Phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      intravitreally administered ranibizumab 0.5mg in subjects with Proliferative Diabetic
      Retinopathy experiencing post- Panretinal Photocoagulation (PRP) macular edema.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Levels of VEGF are elevated in eyes wth Diabetic Macular Edema and the expression of VEGF was
      found to be elevated temporarily following the photocoagulation of human Retinal Pigment
      Epithelial (RPE) cells. Ranibizumab (Lucentis TM, Genentech) is an anti-VEGF antibody shown
      to have properties to prevent macular edema. We hypothesize that VEGF inhibition can
      effectively treat PRP-induced macular edema, thereby minimizing post-PRP vision loss.

      Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will receive 0.5mg ranibizumab administered 7-14 days
      post-PRP. Additional intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg of ranibizumab at Day 30 and/or Day 60
      may be also be administered. All subjects will be followed for 90 days for safety and
      efficacy assessments. There is no placebo or sham arm of this trial.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-PRP protocol refraction, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography
             AND 7-14 day post-PRP OCT

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age 21 years or older

          -  Previously untreated PDR patients with high risk characteristics who develop edema
             within 7-14 days post PRP therapy. This edema, determined by a masked investigator,
             will be characterized as either increased foveal thickness (&gt;10% increase from pre-PRP
             foveal thickness), and/or increased macular volume on OCT (&gt;10% increase from pre-PRP
             macular volume).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) prior to enrollment in the study

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated.

          -  Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial

          -  Pre-PRP clinically significant diabetic macular edema (CSME) that would make the
             patient eligible for macular laser prior to PRP

          -  Neovascularization of the iris or neovascular glaucoma

          -  Increased central foveal thickness for any other reason

          -  Concurrent macular diseases that could confound the results of this study

          -  Prior vitrectomy in the study eye

          -  Prior treatment with intravitreal injection including pegaptanib sodium, ranibizumab,
             bevacizumab or triamcinolone acetonide
