  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epistaxis is a common disorder with 60% of the population suffering from one episode and 10%
      of these cases requiring medical attention. Between March 2006 and March 2007, in Calgary,
      Alberta, there were 1500 presentations of epistaxis to adult emergency rooms with 7% of these
      (105 patients) requiring packing with admission. Common methods to control epistaxis include,
      nasal packing (88%), operative arterial ligation (10%), and arterial embolization (2%). A
      cost analysis demonstrated that nasal packing had a lower cost compared to embolization and
      arterial ligation, and all modalities had similar lengths of stay (Goddard, Otolaryng Head
      Neck Surg. 2006). Arterial ligation is the current recommended therapy for recurrent or
      refractory epistaxis, with a success rate of 98%. With the advancement of endoscopic
      techniques, emergency room Minimally Invasive Control of Epistaxis (M.I.C.E.) allows for
      selective packing and cauterization, which provides the patient with retained function of
      their nasal cavity and prevents a hospital admission, resulting in significant cost savings.

      Hypothesis:

      Does the M.I.C.E. procedure provide significant cost savings compared to operative
      sphenopalatine artery ligation? Null hypothesis is that there is no difference in hospital
      admission rates between M.I.C.E. and operative sphenopalatine artery ligation.
