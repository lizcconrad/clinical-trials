  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human participants affected with sickle cell disease or thalassemia will donate bone marrow
      for use in experimental laboratory models to study potential new treatments. This is an
      observational study using bone marrow from human participants. The investigators will use
      sickle cell and thalassemia mouse models to observe and evaluate the possibility of
      correcting these disorders through genetic alterations or drug treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These studies are designed to evaluate the potential of retroviral vector mediated gene
      transfer, gene editing, or drug treatment to correct the pathophysiology of sickle cell
      anemia and β-thalassemia. CD34+ cells purified from bone marrow of research participants with
      a sickle cell syndrome or a thalassemia syndrome will be subjected to genetic editing, drug
      treatment, or transduced with retroviral vectors containing γ-globin coding sequences under
      the control of the β-globin gene promoter and including various regulatory elements chosen to
      enhance gene expression and to insulate regulatory elements from cellular genes at or near
      the integration sites. The efficiency of gene transfer and the function of the globin
      transgene will be evaluated in erythroid cells derived from transduced progenitors and from
      the progenitors in the bone marrow of immunodeficient mice engrafted with transduced,
      primitive hematopoietic cells. The hypothesis to be tested in this research is that a gene
      therapy vector, gene editing strategy, or drug modality can be designed to achieve a
      potentially therapeutic level of globin gene expression in maturing erythroid cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with homozygous S/S disease or doubly heterozygous for S and β thalassemia
             who are 2 years or older are eligible. Patients with HbE- β- thalassemia or homozygous
             (severe) β-thalassemia are also eligible. Patients with thalassemia include those who
             are transfusion dependent (major) or severely anemic but relatively transfusion
             independent (intermedia). Diagnostic criteria include standard hematological
             parameters, red cell indices, hemoglobin electrophoresis and quantitative
             determination of HbF and HbA2.

          -  Patients are eligible for participation in the protocol only if they are currently
             clinically stable and have been free of all acute disease manifestations for a minimum
             of 14 days.

          -  Patients may participate while continuing their current therapeutic regimen including
             regular transfusion therapy or hydroxyurea administration.

          -  In general, two categories of patients will be considered as research participants in
             this protocol.

               1. Patients who are 18 years or older and therefore able to provide informed consent
                  will be eligible. Such individuals will be recruited from among patients followed
                  at SJCRH. In addition, individuals followed in an outside clinic who are
                  recruited will be asked to come to the Hematology Clinic at SJCRH to enroll and
                  have the procedure performed. Alternatively, if a patient who is 18 or older is
                  to undergo a diagnostic or surgical procedure under general anesthesia, and they
                  agree to participate in the study, the bone marrow aspirate will be obtained at
                  that time.

               2. Patients between the ages of 2 and 17 years who are scheduled for a diagnostic or
                  surgical procedure at SJCRH or LeBonheur Children's Medical Center for which
                  sedation or general anesthesia is indicated will be eligible for protocol
                  enrollment. A bone marrow aspiration will be performed during the sedation or
                  general anesthesia for the diagnostic or surgical procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active, acute manifestations of sickle cell disease including painful crisis, acute
             chest syndrome, cerebrovascular events or active infection.

          -  Pregnant women will not be eligible for study enrollment.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of the research participant or legal
             guardian/representative to give written informed consent will preclude enrollment on
             this research protocol.

          -  Platelet count &lt; 150,000/mm^3

          -  Neutrophil count &lt; 2000/mm^3 (unless on hydroxyurea therapy)

          -  Neutrophil count &lt; 1000/mm^3 for patients on hydroxyurea therapy

          -  Prothrombin Time &gt; 17 seconds

          -  Partial thromboplastin Time &gt; 43 seconds

          -  History of excessive bleeding in the context of previous procedures including surgery
             and dental extractions
