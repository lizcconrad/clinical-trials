      The primary purpose of this study is to examine the safety of volociximab (V) in combination
      with a standard treatment of carboplatin (C), paclitaxel (P), and bevacizumab (B) in subjects
      previously untreated with chemotherapy for advanced stage (IIIB/IV) non-squamous non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Phase 1b, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of volociximab in combination with C/P + B in subjects with previously untreated
      Stage IIIB/IV non-squamous NSCLC.

      Subjects will be treated with the C/P + B + volociximab (V)combination for a total of 6
      cycles (3 weeks/cycle). Subjects with stable disease (SD)or better per Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)after the 6th cycle of combination treatment (C/P + B + V)
      will be considered for further treatment in a maintenance phase with B + V at the same dose
      until subject withdrawal from treatment.

      Volociximab will be administered at doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg/kg every 3 weeks.
      Paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab will be administered at their registered doses for
      this combination.

      Follow up for each subject will extend over a 90-day period following the last dose of
      volociximab. End of study is defined as 90 days after the last dose of volociximab for the
      last subject treated in the study.

    <description>Volociximab will be administered via IV infusion once every three week at 10, 20, and 15 or 30 mg/kg with an additional loading dose in the 10, 20, and 15 mg/kg dose levels on Day 8 of the first cycle. Volociximab will be given for up to 6 cycles (3 weeks/cycle). Subjects who have stable disease or better and subjects who have disease that is not progressing at the end of 6 cycles may continue to receive volociximab alone until disease progression. Carboplatin is administered via IV infusion and dosed based on the Calvert formula (with a target area AUC of 6 mg/mL/min) for up to 6 cycles (3 weeks/cycle). Paclitaxel is administered via IV infusion and dosed at 200 mg/m2 for up to 6 cycles (3 weeks/cycle). All four drugs, when given in combination, will be infused on the same day in the following sequence: volociximab, paclitaxel, carboplatin.</description>
