  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson'disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by bradykinesia, rigidity,
      rest tremor and postural instability. Dopaminergic therapy such as L-Dopa and dopamine
      agonists usually leads to a dramatic improvement of symptoms, but disease progression
      nevertheless remains inevitable. Bilateral Deep brain stimulation in subthalamic nucleus is
      now considered the gold standard surgical treatment.

      Parkinson'disease mainly affects the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system which is linked to the
      limbic system and could be responsible of a specific trouble in the recognition in some
      facial expression.

      We hypothesise that patients with Parkinson'disease present a dysfunction of voluntary and
      automatic treatment of emotional information.

      The main purpose of this study is to show if patients with Parkinson'disease present a lack
      of specific facial expression recognition of emotion and determinate more precisely if this
      alteration involves the cortical way (high frequency way) or the under cortical way (low
      frequency way).

      We also examine the role of L-Dopa and the deep brain stimulation on emotion perception

      40 patients with an Idiopathic Parkinson's disease divided in two groups :

        -  20 patients evaluated before surgery and 6 month after surgery

        -  20 patients only evaluated after surgery.

           40 paired healthy volunteers

           1) Study progress (patients):

      Inclusion visit :

      Neurological evaluations .

      Neuropsychological evaluations : MMS, MADRS, MATTIS, BREF, Wisconsin test, Apathy test,
      Bentonâ€¦.

      Ophthalmic visit : VISTECH

      Protocol :

        1. for patients evaluated before surgery Facial expression recognition test Lexical
           decision test Made in two conditions : without the treatment (Med OFF) and one hour
           after the L-Dopa administration (MED ON)

        2. for patients evaluated after surgery Facial expression recognition test Lexical decision
           test Made in four conditions

             -  Without stimulation (STIM OFF) and medication (MED OFF)

             -  MED OFF and STIM ON

             -  MED ON and STIM OFF

             -  MED ON and STIM ON

                2) Study progress (healthy volunteers): Ophthalmic visit MMS Facial expression
                recognition test Lexical decision test
