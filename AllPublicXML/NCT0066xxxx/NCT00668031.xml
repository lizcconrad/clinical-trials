    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if aprotinin (BAY A0128), given intravenously during
      surgery, is safe and can help reduce the amount of bleeding and the need for a blood
      transfusion during hip replacement surgery. Patients undergoing major surgery are at risk for
      significant blood loss. Because of this, there is a need for drugs that will help slow the
      amount of bleeding during surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects requiring elective primary total hip replacement surgery

          -  Documented, signed, dated informed consent obtained prior to any study specific
             procedures being performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with previous exposure to aprotinin in the last 6 months. If the subject has
             undergone cardiac surgery in the last 6 months, all attempts should be made to
             ascertain if aprotinin was administered during cardiac surgery. If no records are
             available, subject should be excluded. If during cardiac surgery in the last 6 months,
             there is a record of aprotinin administration, subject should be excluded

          -  Subjects with a known or suspected allergy to aprotinin - Subjects with impaired renal
             function (serum creatinine &gt; 3.5 mg/dl or 309 micromoles/liter)

          -  Subjects with a history of bleeding diathesis or known coagulation factor deficiency

          -  Subjects with failure of a major organ system or any active significant medical
             illness that in the opinion of the investigator is likely to affect the subject's
             ability to complete the study or precludes the subject's participation in the study

          -  Subjects who refuse to receive allogenic blood products for religious or other reasons
