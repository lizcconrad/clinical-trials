  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid hormones are substances naturally made by the body and are important to many of your
      body's basic functions such as breathing and brain function. We are investigating whether or
      not these hormones are at lower levels in critically ill children which could lead to further
      health problems. We hope to get a better understanding of hormone levels and their effects on
      critically ill children to better help other children in the future.

      We hypothesize that critically ill children that require vasoactive infusions and/or invasive
      mechanical ventilation have thyroid hormone alterations. We will measure TSH, tT3, fT3, rT3,
      tT4, fT4, adn tyrosine concentrations in critically ill children with hypotension and/or
      respiratory failure and correlate thyroid hormone alterations to severity of illness,
      intensity of therapeutic interventions, and associated morbidity and mortality by using
      clinical outcomes parameters.
