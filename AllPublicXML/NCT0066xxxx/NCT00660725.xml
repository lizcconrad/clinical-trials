  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study that will try to find the highest and safest dose of an experimental
      drug, vandetanib, that can be given in combination with two standard chemotherapy agents,
      gemcitabine and oxaliplatin, to subjects with advanced solid malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalating, non-randomized study of the safety and
      tolerability of vandetanib in combination with a fixed dose of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
      (GemOx) in the treatment of patients with advanced solid malignancy. EGFR is an important
      target for therapeutic drug development. It is widely expressed in most cancers and has a
      vital role in the regulation of proliferation signals. EGFR is expressed in a high degree
      (&gt;80%) of pancreatic tumors and is a rational target for therapy. Vandetanib selectively
      inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and VEGF-2 receptor. It has good oral bioavailability
      and has growth inhibitory activity in a wide variety of human cell lines including cells with
      acquired resistance to other EGFR inhibitors. The growth inhibitory property of vandetanib in
      vivo correlates more with its anti VEGF property, especially in cell lines with acquired
      resistance to EGFR inhibition. The combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (GEMOX) is a
      well-established regimen that has demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity in
      pancreaticobiliary cancers in phase II studies. Recent clinical trials have also shown
      activity in hepatobiliary and germ cell tumors. The combination of vandetanib and gemcitabine
      has potential advantages and may result in an additive or synergistic effect. The GEMOX
      regimen is well tolerated, and toxicity does not overlap with the most common toxicity of
      rash or diarrhea observed with vandetanib. Thus, the combination of vandetanib and GEMOX is
      expected to be a well tolerated, and an easily administered regimen with improved efficacy
      and no overlapping toxicities.

    <description>Vandetanib is a pill that will be self-administered orally on Days 1-14 of each 14-day cycle. The dose of vandetanib each subject will receive will be determined by a dose escalation schedule (either 200 mg or 300 mg per day), which will be followed to determine the MTD of the study drug combination (vandetanib + GemOx). In the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or other complications, the vandetanib and GemOx combination may continue per protocol for a maximum of 6 cycles, or 12 weeks. In subjects who show response or stable disease, vandetanib may be continued as a single agent beyond the 6 cycle maximum, at the investigator's discretion.</description>
