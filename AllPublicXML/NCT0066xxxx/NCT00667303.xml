      The Study aims to prospectively survey the incidence of respiratory virus infections using
      molecular methodologies, in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

      Samples will be collected with a nasopharyngeal wash and processed for direct fluorescent

    <description>A total of eight nasopharyngeal washes will be done at the following time points: Prior to conditioning, on the day of admission and thereafter every two weeks until day +100 (Day +14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84 and 98). To allow for flexibility over the weekends and holidays the specimen may be collected on the scheduled day Â± 3 days. The baseline sample obtained prior to conditioning is required for patient to be considered evaluable.</description>

    <description>For IF (Direct IF for hHRSV and indirect IF for the other viruses), the specimens will be spotted onto glass slides. Samples without respiratory epithelial cells will be considered inconclusive. Labelled antibodies against Flu A, Flu B, HPIV 1 to 3, RSV, hMPV and Adv will be used.</description>

    <description>Shell vial culture specimens will be inoculated and incubated for 48 hours. The following RVs: Flu A, Flu B, HPIV 1-3, RSV, Adv and hMPV will be identified on the basis of cytopathic effects in cell cultures and confirmed by staining with fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies.</description>
