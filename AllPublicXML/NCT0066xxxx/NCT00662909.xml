        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Final Visit in Mean Number of Urgency Episodes (Grades 3 or 4) Per 24 Hours</title>
        <description>The average number of urgency episodes (the sudden, compelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult to defer), derived from urgency episodes classified by the patient in a 3-day micturition diary as grade 3 or 4 on the Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale: 0: No urgency; 1: Mild urgency; 2: Moderate urgency, could delay voiding a short while; 3: Severe urgency, could not delay voiding; 4: Urge incontinence, leaked before arriving to the toilet. LS Means are from an ANCOVA with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 post baseline micturition measurement in the visit diary and at least 1 episode of urgency grade 3 or 4 at baseline. LOCF was used for the Final Visit analysis. N is the number of patients included at each time point.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Final Visit in Symptom Bother Score</title>
        <description>Overactive bladder symptoms were assessed using the symptom bother scale of the overactive bladder questionnaire. The symptom bother scale consists of 8 questions answered by the participant on a scale from 1-6. The total symptom bother score was calculated from the 8 answers and then transformed to range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating worst severity. A negative change from Baseline in symptom bother score indicates improvements.
LS Means are from an ANCOVA with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Final Visit in Symptom Bother Score</title>
          <description>Overactive bladder symptoms were assessed using the symptom bother scale of the overactive bladder questionnaire. The symptom bother scale consists of 8 questions answered by the participant on a scale from 1-6. The total symptom bother score was calculated from the 8 answers and then transformed to range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating worst severity. A negative change from Baseline in symptom bother score indicates improvements.
LS Means are from an ANCOVA with treatment group, gender, and geographic region as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. LOCF was used for the Final Visit analysis. The number of participants included in the calculation for each time point is noted as “N”.</population>

        <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) questionnaire was used to assess the degree and extent to which overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms interfered with work productivity in the last 7 days. Percent overall work impairment takes into account both hours missed due to OAB symptoms and the patient’s assessment of the degree to which OAB affected their productivity while working. A higher percentage indicates greater impairment and less productivity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The PPBC scale is a global assessment tool that asks patients to rate their impression of their current bladder condition on a 6-point scale from 1: 'Does not cause me any problems at all'; 2: 'Causes me some very minor problems'; 3: 'Causes me some minor problems’; 4: 'Causes me (some) moderate problems'; 5: 'Causes me severe problems' and 6: 'Causes me many severe problems'. LS means are from an ANCOVA model with treatment group, gender, and geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 and Final Visit in Treatment Satisfaction on Visual Analog Scale (TS-VAS)</title>
        <description>The TS-VAS is a visual analog scale (VAS) that asks patients to rate their satisfaction with treatment by placing a vertical mark on a 10 cm line where the endpoints are labeled ‘No, not at all’ on the left (=0) to ‘Yes, completely satisfied’ on the right (=10). LS means are from an ANCOVA model with treatment group, gender, and geographical regions as fixed factors and baseline as a covariate. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. The number of participants included at each time point (N) only includes those with baseline and post-baseline values. LOCF was used for the Final Visit analysis.</population>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, nondisease-specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing and valuing health status. Participants were asked to indicate which of the following statements best describes their health state:
I have no problems in walking about; I have some problems in walking about; I am confined to bed.
In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available for that Visit.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. LOCF was used for this analysis.</population>

          <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, nondisease-specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing and valuing health status. Participants were asked to indicate which of the following statements best describes their health state:
I have no problems in walking about; I have some problems in walking about; I am confined to bed.
In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available for that Visit.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. LOCF was used for this analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Final Visit in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Usual Activities Score</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized, nondisease-specific instrument for describing health status. Participants were asked which statement best describes their health state with regard to usual activities (work, study or leisure): I have no problems performing my usual activities; I have some problems performing my usual activities; I am unable to perform my usual activities. In the table below, each row title lists Baseline health status first followed by Final Visit health status and reports the number of patients in that category. Missing data indicates patients with no data available at that Visit.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set included all patients who took at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline micturition measurement in the visit diary. LOCF was used for this analysis.</population>

        <description>The EQ-5D is an international, standardized, nondisease-specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing and valuing health status. Participants were asked to indicate which of the following statements best describes their health state:
