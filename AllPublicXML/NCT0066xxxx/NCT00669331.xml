  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No gold standard therapy exists for clearing mucus from the airways of patients with
      bronchiectasis. While rhDNase has a proven place in the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), it
      failed to improve Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in a short-term non-CF
      bronchiectasis study and has been shown to be detrimental after 6 months therapy in non CF
      bronchiectasis, moreover it has no proven effect on mucociliary clearance. Hypertonic saline
      has been shown to have a comparable mode of action to inhaled mannitol, but has yet to be
      examined as a long term treatment option in bronchiectasis.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of 52 weeks treatment with
      inhaled mannitol in subjects with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Previous studies with
      inhaled mannitol have demonstrated improvement in mucociliary clearance; mucus rehydration;
      improvement in quality of life and respiratory symptoms in patients with bronchiectasis and
      pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis. The results of this current study in combination with
      a recently completed 3 month study seek to confirm these early findings and to extend the
      evidence to support its use as a mucoactive therapy in subjects with bronchiectasis.

      We hypothesize that mannitol will improve the overall health and hygiene of the lung through
      regular and effective clearing of the mucus load. As a consequence of the reduction in mucus
      load and inflammatory process, the frequency of bronchiectasis related pulmonary
      exacerbations and the need for exacerbation related antibiotic treatment should fall. Days in
      hospital and community health care costs are expected to change in line with improvements in
      respiratory health.

      Finally, we plan to demonstrate that inhaled mannitol is safe and well tolerated over a 52
      week period. We will test these hypotheses using 400 mg mannitol twice daily (BD) against
      control.

    <measure>Rate of Graded Pulmonary Exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A graded pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a worsening in signs and symptoms requiring a change in treatment (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), 2007). Grade I was required 3 main signs and symptoms, Grade II 2 main signs and symptoms and Grade III 1 main and one or more minor signs and symptoms. Main signs and symptoms were increased cough, sputum volume or sputum purulence. Minor were upper respiratory tract infection, fever, increased wheezing, increased dyspnea, increase in respiratory rate, increase in cardiac frequency of &gt;20%, and increased malaise, fatigue or lethargy. Rate is defined as the number of all GPE events observed in one treatment year</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life as Measured by the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ was collected at baseline, week 6, week 16, week 28, week 40 and week 52. Change in total score was calculated from baseline. Total scores are a weighted sum across all questions. Scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment where 100 represents worst possible health status and 0 indicates best possible health status. Higher scores indicate lower quality of life. Outcome data table gives the raw mean total score at each visit.</description>

        <title>Rate of Graded Pulmonary Exacerbations</title>
        <description>A graded pulmonary exacerbation was defined as a worsening in signs and symptoms requiring a change in treatment (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), 2007). Grade I was required 3 main signs and symptoms, Grade II 2 main signs and symptoms and Grade III 1 main and one or more minor signs and symptoms. Main signs and symptoms were increased cough, sputum volume or sputum purulence. Minor were upper respiratory tract infection, fever, increased wheezing, increased dyspnea, increase in respiratory rate, increase in cardiac frequency of &gt;20%, and increased malaise, fatigue or lethargy. Rate is defined as the number of all GPE events observed in one treatment year</description>

        <description>The SGRQ was collected at baseline, week 6, week 16, week 28, week 40 and week 52. Change in total score was calculated from baseline. Total scores are a weighted sum across all questions. Scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment where 100 represents worst possible health status and 0 indicates best possible health status. Higher scores indicate lower quality of life. Outcome data table gives the raw mean total score at each visit.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days.

    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Relatively few studies in this area -ideal choice of endpoints not well-defined. No widely accepted exacerbation definition. Relies on patients’ accurate &amp; timely symptom reporting.Unclear event end-dates may impact on counting of subsequent events.</limitations_and_caveats>
