  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study adopts a novel strategy for first-line treatment of osteosarcoma by combining
      chemotherapy with anti-angiogenic therapy using bevacizumab (Avastin®), a humanized
      monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Chemotherapy for
      localized disease comprises a 3-drug regimen (cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose
      methotrexate). Chemotherapy for metastatic or unresectable disease comprises a
      cisplatin-based regimen that includes high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and
      etoposide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a comprehensive study that uses a novel agent that targets angiogenesis (bevacizumab)
      in combination with conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of osteosarcoma. Bevacizumab,
      a monoclonal antibody against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been shown
      to stop the growth of new blood vessels of tumors, both in the laboratory and in patients
      with other types of cancers. Bevacizumab has improved the effect of chemotherapy in adult
      patients with different types of cancer by increasing tumor response and increasing the
      chances of survival. This study has two main goals:

        -  To find out if bevacizumab can be combined safely with chemotherapy for osteosarcoma

        -  To find out if adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy will be beneficial in treating
           osteosarcoma.

      The chemotherapy drugs used in this study are commonly used to treat osteosarcoma. Patients
      with non-metastatic and resectable tumors receive bevacizumab and chemotherapy comprised of
      cisplatin, doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate. Patients with metastatic tumors or tumors
      that cannot be removed by surgery receive bevacizumab and chemotherapy comprised of
      cisplatin, doxorubicin and high-dose methotrexate, ifosfamide and etoposide. If the tumor can
      be removed by surgery, surgery will be performed after 10 weeks of chemotherapy and will be
      followed by additional chemotherapy. After completion of active therapy, patient's response
      to therapy will be followed for approximately 5 years.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Unacceptable Toxicity</measure>

    <description>Objective: To study the feasibility of combining: 1) bevacizumab with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate (MAP) in patients with localized resectable osteosarcoma; and 2) bevacizumab with MAP and ifosfamide, and etoposide in patients with unresectable or metastatic osteosarcoma.
The target unacceptable toxicity is defined as grade 4 hypertension, proteinuria, or bleeding excluding petechiae/purpura, grade 3/4 thrombosis/embolism excluding catheter-related thrombosis. The unacceptable toxicity for major wound complication is defined as grade 2, 3, or 4 major wound complications.
A six-stage group sequential stopping rule was developed for monitoring unacceptable toxicity.</description>

    <description>To study the effect of adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy comprised of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) on the event-free survival (EFS) in patients with localized resectable osteosarcoma. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method was used to estimate survival rate.</description>

    <description>The effect of adding bevacizumab to preoperative chemotherapy comprised of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and HDMTX on the histologic response in patients with localized resectable osteosarcoma compared to historical controls treated with preoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and HDMTX without bevacizumab on the Intergroup Study 0133.
Histologic response at week 10 of therapy was evaluated by Huvos grading systems as grade I: tumor not responding to therapy, no effect identified; grade IIA: more than 50% viable tumor left; grade IIB: 5-50% viable tumor remaining; grade III: only scattered foci of viable tumor seen (less than 5% of tumor); grade IV: no viable tumor seen in extensive sampling (at least a full cross-section of the tumor).
The study did not enroll an adequate number of participants, therefore, the comparison to Intergroup Study 0133 participants was not done.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Of the 43 participants enrolled on this trial, 37 met criteria for evaluation of neuropathic pain (NP) following definitive surgery. The 37 participants underwent 38 surgeries: one participant had a limb-sparing surgery followed by an amputation surgery. Six of 43 participants were excluded from evaluation for NP: 1 due to deep vein thrombosis, 2 removed from study prior to surgery, 1 removed immediately after surgery to receive radiation therapy, 1 had non-extremity osteosarcoma, and 1 patient had a fibula resection. Patients were followed for neuropathic pain daily for the first week postoperatively and weekly for up to 6 months postoperatively.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Unacceptable Toxicity</title>
        <description>Objective: To study the feasibility of combining: 1) bevacizumab with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and high-dose methotrexate (MAP) in patients with localized resectable osteosarcoma; and 2) bevacizumab with MAP and ifosfamide, and etoposide in patients with unresectable or metastatic osteosarcoma.
The target unacceptable toxicity is defined as grade 4 hypertension, proteinuria, or bleeding excluding petechiae/purpura, grade 3/4 thrombosis/embolism excluding catheter-related thrombosis. The unacceptable toxicity for major wound complication is defined as grade 2, 3, or 4 major wound complications.
A six-stage group sequential stopping rule was developed for monitoring unacceptable toxicity.</description>
        <time_frame>After all patients have completed therapy, up to 1 year after last patient is enrolled</time_frame>
        <population>Due to slow accrual, the trial was closed to accrual early. Thus, only 31 stratum A patients and 12 stratum B or C patients were enrolled on the study. Therefore, based on the number of patients enrolled and the designed power for the study, we do not have confidence in making a conclusion regarding this feasibility objective.</population>

        <description>The effect of adding bevacizumab to preoperative chemotherapy comprised of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and HDMTX on the histologic response in patients with localized resectable osteosarcoma compared to historical controls treated with preoperative cisplatin, doxorubicin, and HDMTX without bevacizumab on the Intergroup Study 0133.
Histologic response at week 10 of therapy was evaluated by Huvos grading systems as grade I: tumor not responding to therapy, no effect identified; grade IIA: more than 50% viable tumor left; grade IIB: 5-50% viable tumor remaining; grade III: only scattered foci of viable tumor seen (less than 5% of tumor); grade IV: no viable tumor seen in extensive sampling (at least a full cross-section of the tumor).
The study did not enroll an adequate number of participants, therefore, the comparison to Intergroup Study 0133 participants was not done.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Neuropathic Pain (NP) Following Surgery</title>
        <description>Of the 43 participants enrolled on this trial, 37 met criteria for evaluation of neuropathic pain (NP) following definitive surgery. The 37 participants underwent 38 surgeries: one participant had a limb-sparing surgery followed by an amputation surgery. Six of 43 participants were excluded from evaluation for NP: 1 due to deep vein thrombosis, 2 removed from study prior to surgery, 1 removed immediately after surgery to receive radiation therapy, 1 had non-extremity osteosarcoma, and 1 patient had a fibula resection. Patients were followed for neuropathic pain daily for the first week postoperatively and weekly for up to 6 months postoperatively.</description>
