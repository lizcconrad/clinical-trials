    <textblock>
      Part 1: patients with essential hyperhidrosis are treated one time with suction curettage in
      both axillae.

      Part 2: patients with axillary hyperhidrosis receive one treatment with suction curettage in
      one axilla, and at the same time one treatment with BOTOX injections in the other axilla.
