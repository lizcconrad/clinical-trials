    <description>The DAS 28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), C-reactive protein level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient's global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). DAS-CRP scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater disease activity. Individual measures are fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall DAS (a score greater than 5.1 implies active disease; less than 3.2, well controlled disease; and less than 2.6, remission.)</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline) through Day 1093</time_frame>
    <description>LDAS is defined as DAS 28-CRP ≤3.2. DAS 28-CRP remission is defined as DAS 28-CRP &lt;2.6. The DAS 28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), C-reactive protein level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient's global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). DAS-CRP scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater disease activity.

    <measure>Mean Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Scores Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline) to Day 1093</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI assesses patients' functional ability by rating their abilities over the previous week. At least 2 questions are asked from each of 8 categories: dressing and grooming, hygiene, arising, reach, eating, grip, walking, and common daily activities. Patients rate difficulty performing specific tasks: 0=without difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The sum of the categories is divided by the number of categories answered, yielding a score from 0-3.</description>

        <description>The DAS 28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), C-reactive protein level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient’s global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). DAS-CRP scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater disease activity. Individual measures are fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall DAS (a score greater than 5.1 implies active disease; less than 3.2, well controlled disease; and less than 2.6, remission.)</description>

          <title>Mean Disease Activity Score 28 Based on C-reactive Protein (DAS 28-CRP) Scores Over Time</title>
          <description>The DAS 28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), C-reactive protein level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient’s global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). DAS-CRP scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater disease activity. Individual measures are fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall DAS (a score greater than 5.1 implies active disease; less than 3.2, well controlled disease; and less than 2.6, remission.)</description>

        <description>LDAS is defined as DAS 28-CRP ≤3.2. DAS 28-CRP remission is defined as DAS 28-CRP &lt;2.6. The DAS 28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), C-reactive protein level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient’s global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). DAS-CRP scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater disease activity. Individual measures are fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall DAS (a score greater than 5.1 implies active disease; less than 3.2, well controlled disease; and less than 2.6, remission.)</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI assesses patients' functional ability by rating their abilities over the previous week. At least 2 questions are asked from each of 8 categories: dressing and grooming, hygiene, arising, reach, eating, grip, walking, and common daily activities. Patients rate difficulty performing specific tasks: 0=without difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The sum of the categories is divided by the number of categories answered, yielding a score from 0-3.</description>
