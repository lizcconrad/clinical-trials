      The goal of this study is to conduct a survey to better understand the factors associated
      with undertaking cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training and performing CPR in an
      emergency situation.

      Background: Overall survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rarely exceeds 5%. While
      bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can increase survival for cardiac arrest
      victims up to four times, bystander CPR rates remain low in Canada (15%). Survivors have a
      quality of life similar to the general population. Most cardiac arrest victims are men in
      their sixties; they usually collapse in their own home (85%), where bystander CPR rates are
      even lower. The event is witnessed by a family member or bystander 50% of the time. These
      statistics appear to support a strategy of targeted CPR training for an older population that
      is most likely to witness a cardiac arrest event. Interest in CPR training appears to
      decrease with advancing age. Behaviour surrounding CPR training and performance has never
      been studied using the theoretical constructs of a well validated behavioural theory (the
      Theory of Planned Behaviour).

      Objectives: The overall goal of this study is to conduct a survey to better understand the
      behavioural factors associated with successful CPR knowledge transfer in an
      independent-living older population (aged 55 or more). Specific objectives are: 1) To conduct
      semi-structured qualitative interviews to identify factors influencing CPR training and
      performance behaviours; 2) To then develop a survey instrument about factors influencing CPR
      training and performance behaviours based on a systematic review of the literature, the
      results of the semi-structured interviews, and theoretical constructs; and 3) To conduct a
      telephone survey among an independent-living population aged 55 or more using the survey
      instrument, and to identify factors and strategies that might be targeted by KT
      interventions.

      Methods: Objective 1: We will tape-record semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted
      among 20 randomly selected participants aged 55 or older, and perform inductive analyses to
      identify categories and themes. Objective 2: The survey instrument will be developed based on
      a completed systematic review of the literature, and results from objective 1. The two
      behaviours under study will be �seeking CPR training and providing CPR to a cardiac arrest
      victim�. Objective 3: We will develop and conduct a nation-wide telephone survey using random
      digit dialling. The telephone survey will be centrally administered and stratified by
      province and large or small communities in order to obtain a representative random sample of
      the Canadian population. The study population will include all men and women aged 55 or
      older, living independently in the community, with the ability to communicate in English or
      French. We will seek to obtain a participation rate of 60% or greater. We estimate requiring
      approximately 500 respondents to identify factors and strategies for improving CPR KT in our
      target population. Analyses will include measures of sampling bias, reliability of the
      measures, construct validity, as well as multiple regression analyses to identify constructs
      and beliefs most salient to seniors� decisions about whether to attend CPR classes or perform
      CPR.
