      Phase I Study of Bevacizumab and Sorafenib Combined with Low Dose Cyclophosphamide in
      Patients with Refractory Solid Tumors and Leukemia. Patients with solid tumors (including
      central nervous tumors) that are recurrent or refractory to standard therapy, or for whom
      standard therapy is not available. Once a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established
      in patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, the tolerability of this dose will be
      tested in patients with refractory or recurrent leukemia and an expanded cohort of patients
      with refractory or recurrent solid tumors.

      Phase I Study of Bevacizumab and Sorafenib Combined with Low Dose Cyclophosphamide in
      Patients with Refractory Solid Tumors and Leukemia. Patients with solid tumors (including
      central nervous tumors) that are recurrent or refractory to standard therapy, or for whom
      standard therapy is not available. Once a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established
      in patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, the tolerability of this dose will be
      tested in a maximum of 6 patients, in cohorts of 3, with refractory or recurrent leukemia and
      a maximum of 24 evaluable patients, in cohorts of 6, with refractory or recurrent solid
      tumors.

      Approximately 21-24 patients with refractory solid tumors to define the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) and 6 patients with recurrent or refractory leukemia,12 patients with refractory
      or recurrent bone or soft tissue sarcomas and 12 patients with other refractory or recurrent
      solid tumors (including lymphomas) to test the tolerability of this MTD in patients with
      hematological malignancies. Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously at a starting dose
      of 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks with sorafenib by mouth every 12 hrs at a starting dose of 90 mg/m2
      every 12 hours and cyclophosphamide by mouth daily at a dose of 50 mg/m2/day (dose level 1).
      A course of therapy will be considered to be of 21 days duration. Once a maximum tolerated
      dose of sorafenib (sMTD) in combination with bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide has been
      determined, 6 patients with recurrent or refractory leukemia will be then be evaluated at the
      solid tumor MTD to test the tolerability of this combination in patients with hematological
      malignancies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        NOTE: As of May 2013, enrollment of solid tumor participants was completed. Participants
        with a diagnosis of leukemia continue to be enrolled.

          -  Diagnosis: Solid tumors, including central nervous system tumors and lymphomas, that
             are recurrent or refractory to standard therapy or for which there is no standard
             therapy. Histologic verification of diagnosis is required.

          -  Age: &lt; or = 21 years of age at the time of original diagnosis

          -  Life expectancy: at least 8 weeks
