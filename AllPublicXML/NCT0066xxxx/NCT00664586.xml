  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I continuous infusion study designed to explore if constant concentration
      over time adds to the effectiveness of terameprocol without increasing toxicity. It will also
      explore weekly dosing as an option.

      Tumor response assessments will be performed following every two (2) cycles of therapy. All
      subjects will undergo a follow-up visit 30 days following their last dose of terameprocol.
      Circulating tumor cells (CTC) will be quantified pre dosing and on day 15 after first dose of
      each cycle. Needle biopsy specimens will be taken prior to therapy and one week after first
      dose, if possible, to assess for tumor markers (cdc-2 and survivin). Tumor markers, for
      example prostate specific antigen (PSA) will also be measured on day 15 of each cycle (if
      elevated on study entry). Pharmacokinetic parameters will be derived from analysis of blood
      samples collected during the first 24 hour infusion.

      Subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive
      terameprocol as a weekly 24 hour intravenous infusion, three weeks out of four. Serial
      measurements of safety will be performed prior to dosing. Subjects will be screened within 28
      days of Cycle 1. Hematologic, serum chemistry, tumor marker, and pregnancy testing will be
      performed. Circulating tumor cell assays will be performed. Needle biopsy specimens will be
      taken prior to therapy and one week after first dose, if possible, to assess for tumor
      markers (cdc-2 and survivin). Subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      enrolled in groups of 3-6 subjects to receive terameprocol as a weekly 24 hour intravenous
      infusion. The terameprocol dose levels to be studied include 100mg/hr, increasing by 25 mg/
      hr increments in the next cohort assuming no DLT is reached. Serial measurements of safety
      will be performed at each visit. The MTD will be assessed after the first Cycle of treatment
      at a dose level. The use of myeloid colony-stimulating factors will not be allowed
      prophylactically in cycle 1 but may be used if clinically indicated and will be allowed
      during subsequent cycles to prevent the development of neutropenia in subjects with an
      established history of this adverse event in earlier cycles. Each subject in a cohort will be
      treated at the same dose and on the same schedule of weekly infusions. Dose escalation in a
      subject may be allowed after safe evaluation of a higher dosage, and two cycles being
      completed with stable disease or better.

      Terameprocol (EM-1421) will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours, weekly.
      Dose will commence in the first cohort with 100 mg per hour (2400 mg in a 24 hour period)with
      escalation in the 5 cohorts of 3 to 6 patients with increments of 25 mg per hour to a maximum
      of 200 mg/hr (4800 mg/24 hour period) or until MTD is defined. When the MTD has been
      declared, then 11 additional subjects will be enrolled at the MTD dose level (to total 14
      subjects treated in dosage cohort).

      Cohort A. will receive weekly Terameprocol 100 mg per hour (2400 mg in a 24 hour period)

      Cohort B. will receive weekly Terameprocol 125 mg per hour (3000 mg in a 24 hour period)

      Cohort C. will receive weekly Terameprocol 150 mg per hour (3600 mg in a 24 hour period)

      Cohort D. will receive weekly Terameprocol 175 mg per hour (4200 mg in a 24 hour period)

      Cohort E. will receive weekly Terameprocol 200 mg per hour (4800 mg in a 24 hour period)

        participation in the study:

          1. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding (women of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test within one week of entering the study).

          2. Women of child-bearing potential who are unwilling to use two medically acceptable
             forms of contraception during the course of the study (surgical sterilization,
             approved hormonal contraceptives, or barrier method with spermicide).

          3. Subjects unable to comply with the study requirements.

          4. Subjects with a known sensitivity to any of the study medication components.

             interval (repeated demonstration of a calculated QTc interval &gt;450), a history of
             additional risk factors for TdP (e.g. heart failure, hypokalemia, family history of
             long QT Syndrome), and subjects unable or unwilling to refrain from using medications
             that are known to prolong the QT/QTc ratio during the course of the study. Subjects
             having recently taken such medications must have five half-lives off medication before
             participation.
