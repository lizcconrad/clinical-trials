  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation remains limited by four problems: 1) a too high rate of delayed graft
      function, 2) early loss of kidneys from chronic rejection, 3) donor kidney shortages, and 4)
      the need for immunomodulating treatments. Improved cold storage methods can significantly
      impact on the first 3 of these 4 major problems. The device to be tested is a modification of
      the existing Viaspan organ preservation solution. The modification of this solution combines
      four compounds: Bovine neutrophil peptide-1 (BNP-1), Substance P (SP), Insulin-like growth
      factor-1 (IGF-1), and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). This solution will be added to Viaspan for
      preservation of donor kidneys. Preclinical data indicates that trophic factor deprivation
      during cold storage is a significant and previously unrecognized mechanism of injury in cold
      stored kidneys. The aim of this study is improved graft function, decreasing early graft loss
      due to rejection, and decreasing the donor organ shortage.
