  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle changes in high-risk subjects. However,
      controversies exist on nutritional management of diabetes. Recent data suggests that glucose
      and insulin responses are affected by not only the quality, but the quantity of carbohydrate
      consumed. This is referred to as glycemic load.

      To date, there have not been any prospective randomized studies which examine the utility of
      a low glycemic load diet.

      The purpose of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of a Canada Food Guide Diet
      with a low glycemic load diet on blood sugar control in overweight type 2 diabetics.

      The primary objective of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of a low glycemic
      load diet with a Canada Food Guide Diet on weight loss in overweight subjects with
      cardiovascular disease.

      The secondary objective of the proposed study is to compare the effectiveness of a low
      glycemic load diet with both a low glycemic index diet and a low carbohydrate diet on weight
      loss in overweight subjects with cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this portion of the
      study is to try to elucidate the relative contributions of the glycemic index and
      carbohydrate content to the overall effectiveness of a low glycemic load diet. Furthermore,
      through detailed analysis of actual dietary consumption, and correlation with subsequent
      weight loss, we hope to gain greater insight into the role of compliance on the success of
      the various dietary strategies. Restriction of caloric intake is necessary for weight loss
      regardless of the dietary strategy employed, however, long-term success depends ultimately on
      the ability of the patients to comply with the said diet. The success of a low glycemic load
      diet may lie in its superior effectiveness (greater compliance, less calorie consumption)
      rather than a greater efficacy per se.

      A secondary analysis of the effects of all three diets (low glycemic load, low glycemic index
      and low carbohydrate) on modifying other metabolic factors will also be performed. In
      particular, the study will examine the effect of the three diets on lipid and fat metabolism,
      insulin resistance and inflammation.
