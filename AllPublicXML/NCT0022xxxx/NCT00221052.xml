  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight increases the risk to develop chronic diseases including type-2 diabetes and
      cardiovascular disease. The low-grade inflammatory status often seen in overweight subjects
      is thought to play an important role in disease development.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the role of inflammation on glucose metabolism and
      insulin resistance. In this study the effect of the anti-inflammatory treatment diclofenac on
      markers of inflammation and on parameters of glucose metabolism will be studied.
