      -  The primary objective is to study the effect of SR57667B at the dose of 4 mg/d on
           progression of dopaminergic nigro-striatal lesions assessed by 18F-Dopa PET imaging.

        -  Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of SR57667B on symptomatic decline in
           patients with early PD, to assess the safety/tolerability of SR57667B in patients with
           early PD and to document plasma concentrations of SR57667 in patients with early PD.

          -  Age &gt;=35 years at screening.

          -  Diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome, on at least two of the three key Parkinson's
             symptoms, i.e. resting tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity.

          -  Duration of the disease of less than 3 years since diagnosis.

          -  Modified Hoehn and Yahr stage &lt;= 2.5.

          -  Generally healthy and ambulatory.

          -  Patient has given his informed written consent and is capable of following study
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any indication of forms of parkinsonism other than PD.

          -  Severe resting tremor. Presence of either dyskinesia, fluctuations, or loss of
             postural reflexes·

          -  Treatment with amantadine, anticholinergics, catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT )
             inhibitors, selegiline, dopamine receptor antagonists, catecholamine depleters,
             indirect dopamine agonists or alphamethyldopa. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).Use of
             CYP3A4 strong, and moderate inducers or inhibitors. Participation in another clinical
             trial with an investigational drug within two months prior to randomization.

          -  Evidence (detected by history, physical examination and/or laboratory/ECG tests) of
             any clinically significant or unstable medical disorder that could interfere with the
             patient's participation in the clinical trial; interfere with the absorption,
             metabolism or excretion of the study medication; or interfere with the evaluation of
             the study drug. Alterations of laboratory tests or ECG findings of potential clinical
             significance.
