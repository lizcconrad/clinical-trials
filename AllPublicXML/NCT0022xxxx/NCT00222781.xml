  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to use a recently developed triple-tracer positron emission
      tomography (PET) method to study skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Insulin is the hormone
      made by your body to control the blood sugar level. &quot;Resistance' to insulin could cause poor
      blood glucose control (blood sugar levels that are higher than normal). We want to use this
      new method to image (look at) the following three things: 1) how insulin affects blood flow
      in skeletal muscle 2) how insulin affects glucose (sugar) transport (movement) into muscle,
      and 3) how insulin affects glucose metabolism (breakdown) in skeletal muscle of healthy
      individuals.

      PET imaging is a relatively non-invasive way to obtain a &quot;metabolic picture&quot; of body organs
      and has been used successfully to study brain, heart and more recently skeletal muscle. In
      this research study, we will use PET, with three radioactive tracers (markers), to study
      skeletal muscle glucose transport in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM)
      and in non-diabetic individuals who are either normal weight or overweight/obese

      The goal of this proposal is to use a recently developed triple-tracer positron emission
      tomography (PET) method to study skeletal muscle insulin resistance (IR) in research
      volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) and in comparison to age and
      gender-matched, normal weight non-diabetic volunteers, and in comparison to age, gender, and
      weight-matched overweight or obese non-diabetic volunteers. We will use the three tracers to
      obtain data on the respective insulin actions upon tissue perfusion, glucose transport and
      glucose phosphorylation in order to test the hypothesis that insulin resistance (IR) in type
      2 DM is caused by an aggregation of impairments at these steps, thus challenging the
      prevalent concept that IR derives from a solitary impairment in trans-membrane transport.

      Proximal steps of glucose transport and phosphorylation are considered to contribute strongly
      to the pathogenesis of IR in obesity and type 2 DM (1-5). These scientific considerations
      might have potential therapeutic implications. The overall goal of this project is to provide
      clarity in separating the respective roles of these proximal steps of glucose metabolism.
      Glucose transport will be assessed using 11C-3-O-methyl glucose (half-life ~ 20 min; also
      referred to as 3-0-MG), an analog that is transported but not phosphorylated.
      18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose (half-life ~ 109 min; also referred to as FDG), will be used to
      assess glucose transport and glucose phosphorylation. The third tracer that will be used,
      15O-H2O, will provide information on tissue perfusion. The challenge with the use of FDG to
      study insulin action in muscle has been to derive data on two biochemical steps from the
      tissue activity pattern of a single tracer; this has placed a higher reliance upon the
      modeling of the data. However, in this project, because of the use of three tracers and the
      differences in the metabolism of the two glucose analogs, we will be able to address with
      clear resolution the respective roles of transport and phosphorylation in the pathogenesis of
      IR in obesity and type 2 DM.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will recruit eight normal weight (BMI 19 to 25 kg/m2), and eight overweight or
             obese (BMI 27 to 38 kg/m2), non-diabetic, healthy volunteers, who are between the ages
             of 30 to 55 years old. For scientific reasons it is crucial that the groups are age
             matched. Limiting the age range to a period of 25 years will help achieve this goal.
             Volunteers for these two groups must have a fasting glucose &lt; 110 mg/dl; HbA1c &lt; 6.0%;
             Hct &gt; 34; ALT &lt; 60; AST &lt; 60; Alk phos &lt; 150; sTSH &lt; 8; Trig &lt; 300; Chol &lt; 250;
             systolic BP &lt; 150; diastolic BP &lt; 95; and be in good health. A medical history and
             physical exam will be conducted by a nurse practitioner or a medical doctor.

        We will also recruit eight volunteers with type 2 DM; as the large majority of this patient
        population is overweight or obese, inclusion criteria will include BMI 27 to 38 kg/m2, and
        otherwise age- and gender-matched to the non-diabetic volunteers. At screening, HbA1c must
        be less than 8.5%. For scientific purposes we would like to study the volunteers with type
        2 DM without the confounding effects of anti-diabetic medications, therefore, we propose to
        restrict recruitment to those who are either treated by diet and exercise alone, or to
        those who are on oral agents in the sulfonylurea class, metformin, or acarbose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will exclude volunteers taking thiazolidinediones as the washout period for this
             class is uncertain, and exclude those taking insulin as withdrawal likely would cause
             unacceptable levels of hyperglycemia.

        Research volunteers with type 2 DM who are enrolled in the study and who are receiving oral
        diabetic agents (sulfonylureas, metformin or acarbose), will be instructed to withhold
        these medications for five days preceding both PET studies.

        Previous difficulty with lidocaine (xylocaine) will be an exclusion. To be eligible for
        these studies, volunteers must be free of clinical evidence of cardiac, renal, hepatic, and
        vascular disease, or other major medical problems that would endanger the volunteers or
        compromise the scientific validity of the studies. Subjects with a history of myocardial
        infarction, proteinuria (defined as 1+ protein), alcohol or drug abuse, malignancy or
        neuromuscular disease will be excluded. Subjects who have gained or lost more than 3 kg
        during the past 3 months will be excluded. Because of the PET, MR, and DEXA scanning, all
        premenopausal women must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to these
        procedures. To avoid radiation exposure of the infant, women who are currently
        breastfeeding will not be permitted to participate in this research study. Subjects will be
        excluded if they have a contraindication to MRI such as surgical or vascular implants,
        pregnancy, pacemaker, or claustrophobia. In subjects with a questionable history of
        metallic fragments, an X-ray of the suspected area of the body will be performed to rule
        such out.
