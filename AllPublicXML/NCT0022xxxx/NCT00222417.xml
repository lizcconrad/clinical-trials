  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We study audiometric parameters including Transient Otoacoustic emissions, pure-tone
      audiometry for air- and bone-conduction, and spondaic speech recognition thresholds for air-
      and bone conduction in a pre- and postoperative situation in patients due for surgery for
      tympanic membrane perforations and otosclerosis. The hypotheses are that the precision of the
      preoperative assessment may be increased, and our knowledge about the effect on the inner ear
      by middle ear surgery may be increased.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients 12 years or older due for myringoplasty or stapes surgery at the
      ENT-department, University hospital of Tromsø, in an approximate time span of one year, have
      been studied with the following audiometric investigations at the preoperative admission, 2,
      6 and 12 months postoperatively: Transient otoacoustic emissions, pure-tone audiometry for
      air- and bone-conduction, speech audiometry using spondaic recognition for air and
      bone-conduction. Results will be statistically analysed using the Statistical Package for the
      Social Sciences, with the unoperated ear (paired organ) serving as controls. The goal is to
      look at alternative methods for analysing the patients' preoperative hearing in order to
      increase the precision of clinical decision-making. The secondary goal is to elucidate the
      effects of middle ear surgery on the inner ear.
