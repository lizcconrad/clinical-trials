      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of penile vibratory stimulation on the
      muscle spasticity of men with chronic spinal cord injury.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury can result in mild to severe muscle spasms that can both inhibit
      functional capability and increase the likelihood of injury due to fall. Anecdotal reports
      and a recent study suggest that triggering the ejaculatory reflex in men with vibratory
      stimulation can result in a significant decrease in spasm activity over a period of 2 to 42
      hours. This study examines the effects of penile vibratory stimulation on spasticity when
      conducted daily in the home setting.
