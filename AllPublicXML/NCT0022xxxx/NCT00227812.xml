  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether cognitive behavioral therapy and bupropion
      hydrochloride will help cocaine users, who are depressed, reduce or end their cocaine use and
      improve their mood.

      The global aim of this study is to evaluate an &quot;integrated&quot; treatment approach for cocaine
      dependent patients with comorbid unipolar depression. It is hypothesized that a
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy that targets both disorders, in combination with a
      pharmacotherapy, i.e., bupropion, is expected to provide the best coverage for dual disorders
      and thus maximize treatment outcomes. Specifically, we will conduct a double blind,
      placebo-controlled clinical trial involving the random assignment of participants into one of
      four treatment conditions according to a full 2x2 factorial research design. One independent
      variable will be pharmacotherapy (bupropion versus placebo); the other independent variable
      will be psychotherapy (integrated CBT versus clinical management). The study will enroll 140
      cocaine dependent patients with comorbid major depressive disorder. A secondary objective is
      to further elucidate &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; paradigms of depressive illness symptoms in
      cocaine-dependent adults and better understand how this distinction influences treatment
      outcome. This will be accomplished by enrolling a subsample of patients with
      substance-induced mood disorder. Taken together, this proposal will examine the feasibility
      and relative efficacy of a novel integrated treatment model for dually-diagnosed patients.
