      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To examine the engraftment rate in patients receiving in vivo T-cell-depleted G-CSF
           stimulated bone marrow from partially mismatched related donors.

        -  To evaluate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in
           patients receiving in vivo T-cell-depleted G-CSF stimulated bone marrow from partially
           mismatched related donors.

      This study is a single-arm, non-randomized feasibility study. Patients meeting the criteria
      for this study will be entered sequentially until completion or closure of the study. Early
      stopping rules will be employed to ascertain whether an unacceptable rate of toxicity
      (non-engraftment, and/or acute GVHD) occurs.

      Patients will be prepared for transplant through the administration of the following
      conditioning regimen based on their primary disease:

        -  Total body irradiation (1400 rads in 8 fractionated doses) and high dose chemotherapy,
           including cytosine arabinoside, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. Patients with bone
           marrow failure syndrome will not receive etoposide in the conditioning regimen.

        -  Post transplant immunosuppression prophylaxis against acute GVHD will include sequential
           administration of cyclosporine, methotrexate, basiliximab and mycophenolate.

        -  The donor will receive 3 daily G-CSF injections prior to marrow harvest starting on day
           -3. The injections may be initiated by the donor's primary physician prior to donor's
           arrival, or by the BMT service at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.

        -  Patients will receive daily GM-CSF injections (250 mcg/m2) starting from day +7 post
           transplant until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is greater than 2,000/µL for three
           days.

    <description>FILGRASTIM: G-CSF (NEUPOGEN®) is administered as a short IV infusion over 30 minutes or subcutaneously. It is given beginning on day -3 for 3 days to the donor prior to the bone marrow harvest.
Drug Information: FILGRASTIM: G-CSF (Neupogen®) Formulation: G-CSF is available as a preservative-free solution for injection in 1.0 ml and 1.6 ml vials containing 300 mcg/ml.
Administration: G-CSF 5 mcg/kg/d will be given subcutaneously or as a short I.V. infusion over 30 minutes.
Recombinant GM-CSF at the dose of 250 mcg/m2 will be given intravenously from day +7 to help white counts recovery. The drug will be diluted in NS at a concentration of at least 10 mcg/ml.
Drug Information: Sargramostim (Leukine) Formulation: 250 mcg, 500 mcg lyophlized powder for injection</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure syndrome who are
             candidates for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation are eligible for this study.
