      Dialysis patients suffer from many problems with blood vessels and this is even more so for
      patients with the added complication of diabetes. Diabetics have a number of reasons for
      vascular disease and one of the new areas of research is looking at the cells that line the
      blood vessels, called endothelial cells. It is thought that the number of red blood cells in
      the blood (haemoglobin concentration) affects the function of these cells. There is very
      little information available on what haemoglobin level is best for dialysis patients. As
      diabetics account for almost 40% of dialysis patients worldwide it is important to understand
      the effect different haemoglobin levels will have on the blood vessels.

      Hypothesis: Endothelial cell function and the related expansile capacity of blood vessels are
      affected by different haemoglobin concentrations [Hb] in dialysis patients.

      This project is going to ask dialysis patients (both diabetic and non-diabetic) to undergo a
      series of tests at three different time points over a one year period: a baseline set of
      tests, tested when haemoglobin is maintained at 130-140g/L and repeat the tests when
      haemoglobin is maintained at 105-115g/L. The current recommendation for haemoglobin is
      110-120g/L. Patients will not be required to take any study medication but a specialist
      kidney doctor, using their usual medications of iron and erythropoietin therapy, will change
      their haemoglobin levels.
