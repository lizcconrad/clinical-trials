  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determinate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability (how
      well the body accepts the drug) of an investigational Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase
      Inhibitor (NNRTI) called TMC125.

    <textblock>
      Patients who have previously received a first HIV NNRTI containing regimen or who have
      received an NNRTI containing treatment for prevention of mother to child transmission (MTCT),
      and who have never used a protease inhibitor (PI) may be eligible to participate. TMC125 (at
      800 mg b.i.d. of the old formulation and after the formulation switch, 200 mg b.i.d. of the
      new formulation) will be studied versus an active control (investigator selected PI). All
      patients will receive an underlying therapy containing 2 investigator selected NRTIs. 300
      patients will be enrolled in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Costa Rica, Russia,
      South-Africa, Spain, Thailand, UK, USA, Thailand, India and Malaysia. The duration of the
      study is 48 weeks with an optional extension for patients in the TMC125 treatment group until
      virologic failure or commercial availability of the drug. TMC125 at 800mg twice daily of the
      old formulation; after the formulation switch, TMC125 at 200mg twice daily of the new
      formulation. The initial duration is 48 weeks with an optional extension for patients in the
      TMC125 treatment group until virologic failure or commercially availability.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, age 18 years or older

          -  Documented HIV-1 infection

          -  Stable NNRTI-containing ART (minimum 12 weeks) at screening OR treatment interruption

          -  Prior NNRTI-experience with documented genotypic evidence of resistance to currently
             available NNRTIs (defined as at least one NNRTI-associated mutation per IAS-USA Drug
