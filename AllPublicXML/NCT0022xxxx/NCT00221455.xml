  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We seek to determine if patient data entry, data entered based alerts, and data review in a
      secure patient portal may provide a sustainable approach to improve diabetic outcomes in a
      cost effective manner. We plan to study the extent to which the portal can improve diabetic
      outcomes and quality of care. We recognize, however, that some patients will be more
      predisposed to adopting technology and some will be more predisposed to improving their
      compliance than others. Hence, we will also develop and test interventions that may improve
      adoption and compliance. The goals of the proposed study are: 1) to assess whether a web
      portal will improve care outcomes in diabetic patients; 2a) to describe the characteristics
      of patients whose health behavior improves over the study period; 2b) to describe the
      characteristics of patients who adopt the web portal-based disease management technology; 3)
      to develop and test targeted interventions to increase the adoption of the web portal and
      improve patient health behavior; and 4) to monitor the ongoing costs associated with the web
      portal and patient healthcare resource utilization, and to monitor the incremental costs of
      the interventions designed to improve utilization of the technology and patient compliance
      with their diabetic regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, limited research has been conducted to determine if health information technology
      (HIT) is effective in improving the outcomes for patients with chronic diseases. Research is
      required to determine if interventions facilitated by an institutional EMR platform can be
      implemented such that they support patients with chronic diseases to achieve improved
      outcomes in a cost effective fashion.

      At the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) an ambulatory EMR has been implemented to foster
      patient safety and institutional best practice guidelines, to facilitate research, and to
      achieve efficiencies in practice management. Our EMR is the foundation of the CCF patient
      portal. One of the functions of the portal is to allow patients to enter specific data
      elements that become part of their permanent medical record. Diabetics can enter and review
      their home glucometer readings, and view alert messages based on their entries. The entries
      are transferred to the patient's primary care physician's EMR In-Basket for review.

      We recognize that some patients will be more predisposed to technology adoption and some will
      be more health behavior compliant than others. Therefore, in addition to studying our
      portal's efficacy in positive diabetic behavior change, we will test if interventions can
      assist less predisposed and less compliant patients to become more compliant and more
      inclined to adopt the technology.

      The goals of the proposed study are:

      1) to assess whether a web portal will improve care outcomes in diabetic patients; 2a) to
      describe the characteristics of patients whose health behavior improves over the study
      period; 2b) to describe the characteristics of patients who adopt the web portal-based
      disease management technology; 3) to develop and test targeted interventions to increase the
      adoption of the web portal and improve patient health behavior; 4) to monitor the ongoing
      costs associated with the web portal and patient healthcare resource utilization, and to
      monitor the incremental costs of the interventions designed to improve utilization of the
      technology and patient compliance with their diabetic regimens.
