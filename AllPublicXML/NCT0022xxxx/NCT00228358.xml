      This phase I trial studies the safety and the ability to expand laboratory-treated T cells
      when given together with cyclophosphamide or denileukin diftitox in treating patients with
      human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer,
      ovarian cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with HER-2/neu vaccine.
      Laboratory-expanded T cells may help the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells
      from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Biological therapy, such as denileukin diftitox, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving laboratory-treated T cells together
      with cyclophosphamide or denileukin diftitox may allow the immune system to kill more tumor
      cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of expanding HER2 specific T cells ex vivo for infusion into
      subjects who have advanced HER2 overexpressing cancer.

      II. To assess the toxicity associated with infusing autologous HER2 specific T cells into
      patients using either a single dose of cyclophosphamide or ONTAK (denileukin diftitox) prior
      to T cell infusion.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate to what extent HER2 specific T cell immunity can be boosted in individuals
      treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide of ONTAK followed by infusion of autologous
      HER2 specific T cells.

      II. To investigate the potential anti-tumor effects of HER2 specific T cells in patients with
      HER2 overexpressing advanced-stage cancers.

      III. To evaluate how long tumor antigen specific T cell immune augmentation persists in vivo
      after a single dose of cyclophosphamide or ONTAK followed by infusion of autologous HER2
      specific T cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells. Patients
      are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

      GROUP A: Patients receive low-dose cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on day -1 and 3
      escalating doses of autologous ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 10, and 20.

      GROUP B: Patients receive ONTAK (denileukin diftitox) IV over 1 hour on day -1 and 3
      escalating doses of autologous ex vivo-expanded HER2-specific T cells IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 10, and 20.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
