  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment of multiple or recurrent renal tumors may be complicated by renal function
      impairment. Mini-invasive thermotherapy as radiofrequency (RF), induces necrosis of tumoral
      tissue while sparing normal renal parenchyma. The purpose of the study is to compare, in
      patients at risk of renal insufficiency, a strategy based on surgical approach and a strategy
      based on RF approach. 180 patients from 9 centers will be randomized in two groups (surgical
      vs. RF, delivered either percutaneously or under laparoscopy). The proportion of patients
      with a local carcinologic efficacy at 5 years and the general and renal tolerance will be
      analysed and compared between both strategies.

      Background. Surgical treatment of multiple or recurrent renal tumors may be complicated by
      renal function impairment. Mini-invasive thermotherapy as radiofrequency (RF), induces
      necrosis of tumoral tissue while sparing normal renal parenchyma.

      Objectives. The main objective is to assess the 5-year local carcinologic efficacy (no
      residual tumor tissue and no recurrence at the site of treatment) of the radiofrequency
      treatment. Secondary objectives are to assess 5-year overall carcinologic efficacy,
      predictive factors of technical success of RF procedures, and the general and renal tolerance
      5 years after treatment.

      Study design. Open label, randomized, parallel-group, multicentric clinical trial (9
      centers).

      Eligibility criteria. Patients with renal tumor in whom a surgical treatment may result in
      renal function impairment.

      Intervention.

      Experimental group: radiofrequency treatment, percutaneous or under laparoscopy, using RF
      3000™ generator (Radiotherapeutics, Boston scientific) under a standardized heating protocol.
      A second procedure is allowed in case of residual tumoral tissue or tumor recurrence.

      Control group: conservative kidney surgery.

      Outcomes. The principal outcome is the 5-year local carcinologic efficacy (no residual tumor
      tissue and no recurrence at the site of treatment, as assessed by tomodensitometry or MRI
      after injection). Secondary outcomes are 5-year overall carcinologic efficacy (local efficacy
      and no metastases), renal function, technical success of RF procedures (no residual tumor
      tissue 2 months after procedure) and tolerance.

      Follow-up. Clinical, biological and imaging follow-ups are scheduled 2 months, 6 months, 1,
      2, 3, 4 and 5 years after the first treatment.
