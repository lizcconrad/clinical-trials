    <textblock>
      At present, the only recognised prognostic factor for primary high-grade osteosarcoma is the
      histological response to preoperative chemotherapy. Our study was designed to identify new
      diagnostic markers that could eventually have a prognostic value and therapeutic
      consequences. 80 patients under 20 years of age with primary osteosarcomas were studied while
      under treatment by the French Society of Paediatric Oncology OS 94 protocol. Paired normal
      and biopsy samples were collected. In addition, surgical resection specimens, following
      preoperative chemotherapy, were obtained in many cases. After genomic DNA extraction, an
      allelotyping analysis targeting microsatellites was planned. The studied DNA regions
      contained mainly Rb, p53, APC, p16, c-met, TWIST, c-kit, erbB2 and topoisomerases genes. The
      techniques used in this molecular analysis comprised mainly allelotyping study, quantitative
      real-time PCR, gene sequencing , immunohistochemistry. The first results showed the
      prognostic value of 7q31 region containing c-met and 5q21 containing APC (Br J Cancer, 2003,
      Entz-Werlé et al.), 7p21 containing TWIST (Int J Cancer, 2005, Entz-Werlé et al.) and 4q21
      targeting c-kit gene (J Clin Oncol, 2005, Entz-Werlé et al.).
