  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COMMIT/CCS2 is a large randomised trial of the effects of clopidogrel plus Aspirin versus
      Aspirin alone in acute heart disease. Patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of
      suspected acute MI were potentially eligible provided they were thought to have ST elevation
      or other ischaemic ECG abnormality with no clear indication for, or contraindication to,
      trial treatment. All patients were to be given 162 mg ASA daily and, in addition, 75 mg
      clopidogrel daily or matching placebo for 4 weeks or until prior discharge or death.
      (Patients were also randomised separately in a 2 X 2 factorial design between metoprolol
      versus placebo.) The two main study endpoints are death and the composite outcome of death,
      non-fatal reinfarction or stroke during the scheduled treatment period in hospital.

      Clopidogrel

      Despite considerable improvements in the emergency treatment of acute myocardial infarction
      (MI), including the use of aspirin, early mortality and morbidity remain high. The
      antiplatelet agent clopidogrel adds to the benefit of aspirin in acute coronary syndromes
      without ST-segment elevation, but its effects on mortality and morbidity in patients with
      ST-elevation MI were unclear.

      45,852 patients admitted to 1250 hospitals within 24 hours of the onset of suspected acute MI
      were randomly allocated to receive clopidogrel 75 mg daily or matching placebo (both in
      addition to aspirin 162 mg daily). 93% had ST-segment elevation or bundle branch block, and
      7% had ST-segment depression. Treatment was to continue until discharge or up to a maximum of
      4 weeks in hospital (mean 15 days in survivors), and 93% completed it. The two pre-specified
      co-primary outcomes were: (i) the composite of death, reinfarction or stroke; and (ii) death
      from any cause during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons were between all
      clopidogrel-allocated and all placebo-allocated patients (ie, “intention-to-treat”), and used
      the log-rank method.

      Allocation to clopidogrel produced a highly significant 9% (95% CI 3-14) proportional
      reduction in the primary composite outcome of death, reinfarction or stroke (2121 [9.2%]
      clopidogrel vs 2310 [10.1%] placebo; p=0.002), corresponding to 9 (SE 3) fewer events per
      1000 patients treated for about 2 weeks. There was also a significant 7% (95% CI 1-13)
      proportional reduction in the co-primary outcome of any death (1726 [7.5%] vs 1845 [8.1%];
      p=0.03). These effects on death, reinfarction and stroke appeared to be consistent across a
      wide range of patients and independent of other treatments being used. Considering all
      transfused, fatal or cerebral bleeds together, no significant excess risk was observed with
      clopidogrel, either overall (134 [0.58%] vs 125 [0.55%]; p=0.59), or among patients aged 70
      years or older (50 [0.84%] vs 43 [0.72%]; p=0.48) or among those given fibrinolytic therapy
      (74 [0.65%] vs 72 [0.63%]; p=0.88).

      In a wide range of patients with acute MI, adding clopidogrel 75 mg daily to aspirin and
      other standard treatments (such as fibrinolytic therapy) reduces mortality and major vascular
      events in hospital, without any material increase in major bleeding.

      Metoprolol

      Despite previous randomised trials of early beta-blocker therapy in the emergency treatment
      of suspected acute myocardial infarction (MI), substantial uncertainty has persisted about
      the value of adding it to currently standard interventions (eg, aspirin and fibrinolytic
      therapy), and the balance of potential benefits and hazards was unclear even in high-risk
      patients.

      45852 patients admitted to 1250 hospitals within 24 hours of the onset of suspected acute MI
      were randomly allocated to receive metoprolol (up to 15 mg intravenous followed by 200 mg
      oral daily) or matching placebo. 93% had ST-segment elevation or bundle branch block, and 7%
      had ST-segment depression. Treatment was to continue until discharge or up to a maximum of 4
      weeks in hospital (mean 15 days in survivors), and 89% completed it. The two pre-specified
      co-primary outcomes were: (i) the composite of death, reinfarction or cardiac arrest; and
      (ii) death from any cause during the scheduled treatment period. Comparisons were between all
      metoprolol-allocated and all placebo-allocated patients (ie, “intention-to-treat”), and used
      the log-rank method.

      Neither of the co-primary outcomes was significantly reduced by allocation to metoprolol. For
      the primary composite outcome of death, reinfarction, or cardiac arrest, 2166 (9.4%) patients
      had at least one such event among the 22 929 allocated metoprolol compared with 2261 (9.9%)
      among the 22 923 allocated matching placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.96 [95% CI 0.90-1.01]; p=0.1).
      For the co-primary outcome of death alone, there were 1774 (7.7%) in the metoprolol group
      versus 1797 (7.8%) in the placebo group (OR 0.99 [0.92-1.05]; p=0.69). Allocation to
      metoprolol was associated with 5 fewer people having reinfarction (464 [2.0%] metoprolol vs
      568 [2.5%] placebo; OR 0.82 [0.72-0.92]; p=0.001) and 5 fewer having ventricular fibrillation
      (581 [2.5%] vs 698 [3.0%]; OR 0.83 [0.75-0.93]; p=0.001) per 1000 treated. Overall, these
      reductions were counter-balanced by 11 more per 1000 allocated metoprolol developing
      cardiogenic shock (1141 [5.0%] vs 885 [3.9%]; OR 1.30 [1.19-1.41]; p&lt;0.00001). The excess of
      cardiogenic shock was chiefly during days 0-1 after hospitalisation, whereas the reductions
      in reinfarction and ventricular fibrillation emerged more gradually. Consequently, the
      overall effect on death, reinfarction, arrest or shock was significantly adverse during days
      0-1 and significantly beneficial thereafter. There was substantial net hazard among
      haemodynamically unstable patients and moderate net benefit among those who were relatively
      stable, particularly after days 0-1.

      The use of early beta-blocker therapy in acute MI reduces the risks of reinfarction and
      ventricular fibrillation, but increases the risk of cardiogenic shock, especially during the
      first day or so after hospitalisation. Consequently, it may generally be prudent to consider
      starting beta-blocker therapy in hospital only when the haemodynamic condition following MI
      has stabilized (and then, based on previous evidence, to continue such therapy long-term
      following discharge).
