  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a lower-dose and higher-dose
      therapy program for persons recovering from a recent stroke using mechanically-assisted upper
      limb movement with a device called MIME. A control group receives additional occupational
      therapy without the use of MIME.

      This study continues our investigation of the optimal timing, intensity, and duration of
      robot-assisted training to improve motor performance in patients with hemiplegia following
      stroke. These hypotheses will be tested: 1) subjects receiving robot-assisted upper limb
      therapy with MIME in the initial phase of recovery from stroke experience greater functional
      gains than a control group receiving additional conventional therapy of equal intensity and
      duration, 2) robot-assisted therapy results in a dose-dependent response, and 3)
      robot-assisted therapy promotes greater control of movement, greater recovery of strength,
      and greater reduction of co-contraction than the control intervention. Research Plan - A
      multi-site clinical trial is in progress at the Houston VA Medical Center (VAMC), the VA
      Greater Los Angeles Health Care System (GLAHCS), the VA Palo Alto Rehabilitation Research and
      Development Center (RR&amp;DC), and the Central Texas Veterans Health Care System (CTVHCS).
      CTVHCS serves as the coordinating site. The RR&amp;DC provides training and technical assistance
      for the other sites. Methods - Subjects with hemiparesis due to a stroke are randomly
      assigned to 3 groups. Group 1 receives 1 hour/day of robot-assisted upper limb therapy in
      addition to usual physical and occupational therapy. Group 2 receives a total of 2 hours/day
      of robot-assisted therapy. Group 3 receives 1 hour/day of additional upper limb therapy that
      includes exposure to, but no manipulation by the robot. Outcome measures include assessment
      of strength, motor control, functional status, and patient satisfaction at intake, discharge,
      6 and 12 months.

    <description>Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score. The FMA evaluates motor function, sensation, balance, and joint function in hemiplegic patients and provides a cumulative numerical score. It is widely used to evaluate changes in function over time in clinical care and therapeutic trials following stroke. Five domains can be assessed, including motor function (upper and lower limbs); sensory function; balance; joint range of motion; and joint pain. Items within each domain are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale: 0 = cannot perform; 1 = performs partially; and 2 = performs fully. Subscales can be administered without the using the full test. For the upper limb motor function subscale used in this clinical trial, 33 items were evaluated, each rated on a 3-point scale (0-2), then summed for a maximum possible score of 66. A greater increase in the score represents a greater improvement in upper limb motor function.</description>

    <description>Change in the upper limb portion of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) was assessed to determine treatment impact on independence in activities of daily living (ADL). The FIM indicates the level of disability based on how much assistance is required for an individual to carry out ADL. It can be used to assess13 motor and 5 cognitive tasks, each rated on a 7 point ordinal scale (0 = total assistance or complete dependence; 7 = complete independence in the task). Tasks include For this study, a subset of 9 tasks involving the upper limbs was used (maximum score = 63). A greater change represents a greater improvement in independence carrying out tasks requiring functional use of the upper limbs.</description>

        <title>Fugl-Meyer Score Change Immediately Following Study Intervention.</title>
        <description>Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score. The FMA evaluates motor function, sensation, balance, and joint function in hemiplegic patients and provides a cumulative numerical score. It is widely used to evaluate changes in function over time in clinical care and therapeutic trials following stroke. Five domains can be assessed, including motor function (upper and lower limbs); sensory function; balance; joint range of motion; and joint pain. Items within each domain are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale: 0 = cannot perform; 1 = performs partially; and 2 = performs fully. Subscales can be administered without the using the full test. For the upper limb motor function subscale used in this clinical trial, 33 items were evaluated, each rated on a 3-point scale (0-2), then summed for a maximum possible score of 66. A greater increase in the score represents a greater improvement in upper limb motor function.</description>

        <title>Change in FIM Score Immediately Following Study Intervention.</title>
        <description>Change in the upper limb portion of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) was assessed to determine treatment impact on independence in activities of daily living (ADL). The FIM indicates the level of disability based on how much assistance is required for an individual to carry out ADL. It can be used to assess13 motor and 5 cognitive tasks, each rated on a 7 point ordinal scale (0 = total assistance or complete dependence; 7 = complete independence in the task). Tasks include For this study, a subset of 9 tasks involving the upper limbs was used (maximum score = 63). A greater change represents a greater improvement in independence carrying out tasks requiring functional use of the upper limbs.</description>
