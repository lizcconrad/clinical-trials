  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tectal plate gliomas are relatively rare tumors of childhood with a reported incidence of
      10%. Their typical clinical presentation is symptoms and signs of hydrocephalus and are often
      incidentally diagnosed in the imaging work-up of children with hydrocephalus. Tectal tumors
      in children comprise a subcategory of brainstem tumors with unique clinical, imaging, and
      spectroscopic features. There is debate whether they truly represent brainstem tumors or
      whether they are a site of benign cellular overgrowth. The majority of these tumors are
      pathologically benign and show no or minimal growth. Not all tectal plate tumors, however,
      have this typically benign course. Some can manifest a more aggressive behavior. There have
      been reports in the past attempting to analyze the histology and behavior of these tumors.
      None of the prior series looking at these tumors have included Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy (MRS) analysis.

      It is interesting that according to where tumors occur in the brainstem usually indicates
      what their histology and behavior is. Although not absolute, we know that tumors can have a
      very poor prognosis versus an extremely good prognosis depending on their location in the
      brainstem. Yet there are always the cases that do not act in the typical fashion and this is
      where MRS can prove helpful.

      This study is being done to look at a region of the brain, called the tectal plate, in
      children. This part of the brain can be involved by tumors. Because of the location of the
      tectal plate, it is usually very difficult and risky to get a biopsy (tissue sample) from
      this area. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can
      look at the chemical make up of the brain. MRS may allow us to better understand the nature
      and behavior of these tumors. However, in order to understand disease in this area, we need
      to look at the normal chemical make up of the brain in children without tectal plate tumors.
      Healthy patients are being asked to participate as a normal volunteer. We anticipate having a
      total of 10 to 12 normal volunteers in the MRS study.
