        4.3.1 Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be considered for admission to
        the trial:

          1. Male or female adult patients aged between 18 and 64 years (inclusive). A female of
             childbearing potential may be enrolled provided she:

               -  has a negative pregnancy test at Screening and

               -  is routinely using adequate contraception prior to and during the study and

               -  agrees not to attempt to become pregnant during the study and

               -  is not lactating A female of non-childbearing potential will be defined as one
                  who has been postmenopausal for at least one year or has been surgically
                  sterilised.

          2. Patients receiving a first renal transplant.

          3. Patients who fulfil the criteria to receive an allogeneic renal transplant from a
             cadaver (according to the Eurotransplant (ET) manual on organ allocation and the
             Bundes√§rztekammer allocation criteria).

          4. Patients who, after the nature of the study and the disclosure of their data has been
             explained to them, have freely given Informed Consent in writing.

        4.3.2 Exclusion Criteria

        Patients presenting any of the following exclusion criteria must not be included in the
        trial:

          1. Patients who have received a renal transplant.

          2. Patients who have an active infection at the time of entry into the study (Screening).

          3. Recipient and donor pairs who show the following incompatible CMV constellation: the
             donor is CMV positive and the recipient is CMV negative.

          4. Patients and donor who have positive evidence of HIV or have active virus hepatitis B
             and C.

          5. Patients with a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse.

          6. Patients who are pregnant women or nursing mothers.

          7. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to one of the immunosuppressives
             administered during the course of the study: tacrolimus, sirolimus or steroids
             (prednisolone and methylprednisolone).

          8. Patients with a history or present symptoms of autoimmune vasculitis.

          9. Detection of &gt;5% HLA antibodies (current values determined during the last three
             months).

         10. Patients with a malignancy or history of malignancy.

         11. Patients with renal insufficiency due to a vasculitis.

         12. Recipient and donor pairs with complete HLA matching.

         13. Patients whose condition requires continuous systemic steroid administration.

         14. Patients who are simultaneously participating or plan to participate in any other
             clinical study.

         15. Psychiatric or emotional problems or lack of knowledge of the German language which
             would invalidate the giving of Informed Consent or limit the ability of the subject to
             comply with study requirements.

         16. Unwillingness or inability to provide Informed Consent or to participate
             satisfactorily for the entire trial period
