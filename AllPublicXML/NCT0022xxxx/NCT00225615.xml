          -  For females of child-bearing potential only: Negative urine pregnancy test within 24
             hours prior to enrollment. Women using acceptable birth control measures must agree to

             unavailable

          -  Withdrew from, or otherwise did not successfully complete, study PKU-003, except for
             subjects who were removed from the study because their blood Phe exceeded the alert
             level

          -  Expected to require any investigational agent or vaccine prior to completion of all
             scheduled study assessments

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or planning pregnancy

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that would interfere with study participation or
             safety (e.g., seizure disorder, oral steroid-dependent asthma or other condition
             requiring oral or parenteral corticosteroid administration, or insulin-dependent
             diabetes)

          -  Requirement for concomitant treatment with any drug known to inhibit folate synthesis
             (e.g., methotrexate)

          -  Concurrent use of levodopa
