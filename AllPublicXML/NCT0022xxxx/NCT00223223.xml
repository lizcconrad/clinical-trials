  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine whether the memory impairment and manic symptoms
      (feelings of agitation, overexcitement or hyperactivity) typically seen in those on
      corticosteroid therapy is decreased with a seizure medication called levetiracetam compared
      to placebo (an inactive substance). Since increased levels of cortisol (the body's natural
      corticosteroid) in the body are frequently associated with memory impairment interventions
      that may prevent or reverse this are of great importance.

      It is hypothesized that patients who are scheduled to receive prescription corticosteroid
      therapy who are given levetiracetam pretreatment will show lesser memory impairment and manic
      symptoms than those receiving placebo.
