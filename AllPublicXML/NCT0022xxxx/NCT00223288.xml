      This study will examine if depression in a primary caregiver is associated with more
      hospitalization or ER visits in children with asthma. This study will also explore whether
      treatment for depression in the primary caregivers is associated with improvement in asthma
      in school-aged children.

      Asthma is a very common childhood disorder of airway inflammation. The causes include
      environmental irritants, cold temperature, and infection in the respiratory tract, and
      emotional factors can contribute to symptom exacerbation. However, asthma is a disease that
      can be well controlled if there is proper medication compliance and careful control of
      environmental conditions.

      Data suggests that psychiatric symptoms in the mothers of children with asthma are associated
      with more asthma related hospitalizations in children. Thus, we want to explore this question
      further using more specific diagnostic instruments in order to detect what types of symptoms
      are associated with increased asthma related service utilization. Also, we want to explore if
      effective treatment of the caregivers' symptoms is associated with decreased hospitalization
      and emergency room visits for the child.
