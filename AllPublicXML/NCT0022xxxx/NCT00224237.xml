      Sociocultural aspects of using ethnomedical health practices in a community-based Latino
      population will be described using both qualitative and quantitative survey methods. This
      study will rely heavily on its descriptive section, which will use in-depth, open-ended
      questions in a semi-structured personal interview format following qualitative research
      principles. It will also use closed-ended questions in a short survey format to begin to
      explore some variables that may be associated with using traditional healing practices. These
      variables include level of acculturation, degree of family social support, degree of
      adherence to standard medical regimens, perceived health status, presence of depressive
      symptoms, and severity of co-illnesses. These variables will be examined using common,
      validated scales.
