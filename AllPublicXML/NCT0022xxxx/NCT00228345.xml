  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether impaired glucose handling (abnormality in
      the way the body processes blood sugar) can cause a neuropathy (damage to the nerves).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathy of undetermined etiology is a common disease that usually starts at the sixth to
      seventh decades. It can cause significant pain and disability. Previous studies have
      demonstrated increased prevalence of abnormal glucose handling, when these patients were
      tested with oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). On the other hand, many of the neuropathy
      patients suffer from pain and depression and obesity; and abnormal OGTT in these patients may
      be the result of these factors. We assume that if abnormal handling of blood sugar is the
      cause of neuropathy, these patients may have evidence of damage to other organs (like eyes
      and kidneys) as a result of abnormal blood sugar. In a pilot study, we will determine the
      incidence of subtle damage to kidneys, eyes and also look for other factors associated with
      abnormal glucose handling in patients with neuropathy and abnormal OGTT and compare it to age
      matched controls with normal OGTT.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria (for the subjects) will include peripheral neuropathy, age more than 50
        years, and a negative workup for neuropathy (aside from an abnormal OGTT). Age matched
        controls will have no history of diabetes or baseline retinal disease . A workup to rule
        out other causes of peripheral neuropathy, and an OGTT, will be performed prior to
        participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with abnormal OGTT in the diabetic range will not be included.
