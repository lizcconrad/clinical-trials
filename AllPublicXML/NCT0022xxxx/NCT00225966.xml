        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated informed consent

          -  16 years of age or greater

          -  Willing and able to complete voiding diaries and questionnaires at various time points
             during the study

          -  Located geographically near the physician, or willing and able to travel to the
             physician's site as necessary for all required visits

          -  Failed or is not a candidate for more conservative treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe or uncontrolled diabetes; or diabetes with peripheral nerve involvement

          -  Pregnancy or planned pregnancy

          -  Concomitant medical conditions which would limit the success of the procedure such as:
             pelvic pain with uncertain etiology, active degenerative disc disease, spinal cord
             injury less than six months old, bleeding complications, or a cerebrovascular accident
             (CVA) less than six months old.

          -  Anatomical limitations that would prevent successful placement of an electrode

          -  Neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, clinically significant peripheral
             neuropathy or complete spinal cord injury (e.g., paraplegia)

          -  Subject characteristics indicating a poor understanding of the study or poor
             compliance with the study protocol (e.g. subjects with psychological and/or emotional
             problems, subjects unable to adequately operate equipment)

          -  Subjects with knowledge of planned magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diathermy,
             microwave, high output ultrasonics, ultrasound scanning, or radiofrequency (RF) energy

          -  Mechanical obstruction such as benign prostatic hypertrophy, cancer, or urethral
             stricture

          -  Symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI). Upon completion of therapy for UTI, or if
             the subject is receiving prophylaxis for UTI, subjects can be considered for test
             stimulation or the full system implant (whichever is applicable) if symptom free for
             one month prior to the procedure.

          -  Subjects with other implantable neurostimulators, pacemakers, or defibrillators

          -  Primary stress incontinence or mixed incontinence where the stress component overrides
             the urge component

          -  Active participation in another clinical study
