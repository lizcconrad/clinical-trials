      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether EGG readings obtained from both
      normal subjects and dyspeptic patients are reproducible from one EGG recording to another on
      a different day.

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether the EGG readings are analyzed
      and diagnosed consistently when reviewed and compared by multiple blinded readers when the
      same tracing is reviewed.

      This is a single-center study. The duration of this trial is estimated to be six months. A
      total of Forty (40) subjects will be recruited into this study. It will be two Groups; ten
      (10) normal healthy subjects will be recruited by poster advertisement and thirty (30)
      patients who either present to the Gastroenterology Department of Temple University Hospital
      with varying signs, symptoms or complaints of gastric discomfort, or who are scheduled to
      undergo an EGG test by their Gastroenterologist.

      Each study subject/patient will have a total of two (2) EGGs with Water load tests performed
      for this study. Each EGG exam will be performed approximately one (1) week of each other, but
      no more than 4 weeks apart, and will be read in a blinded fashion by three (3) separate
      independent readers, in order to see if the readings are consistent with the previous
      readings that were obtained, as well as, by the readers themselves (Inter-reader rater
      reliability). Each reader will be blinded to the subject status (normal/healthy or patient)
      and also to the specific test they are reading (initial exam [Visit 1], or follow-up exam 1
      week after Visit 1 [Visit 2]). All EGG exam results will be coded in order to keep them
      blind.
