  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To look at the safety and improvement in symptoms of a once a day dosing of esomeprazole in
      children 1 to 11 years old with inflammation of their esophagus or food pipe (&quot;esophagitis&quot;)
      caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and diagnosed by endoscopy.

      To verify the healing of the esophageal inflammation if the endoscopy reveals cuts in the
      lining of the food pipe.

      To collect information that will describe the psychological, social, and economic effects on
      the primary caregiver of raising children ages 1 to 5 years old with GERD.
