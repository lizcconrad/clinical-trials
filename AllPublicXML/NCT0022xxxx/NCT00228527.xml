  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To look at the safety and improvement in symptoms of a once a day dosing of esomeprazole in
      children 1 to 11 years old with inflammation of their esophagus or food pipe (&quot;esophagitis&quot;)
      caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and diagnosed by endoscopy.

      To verify the healing of the esophageal inflammation if the endoscopy reveals cuts in the
      lining of the food pipe.

      To collect information that will describe the psychological, social, and economic effects on
      the primary caregiver of raising children ages 1 to 5 years old with GERD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients' parents/guardians must provide written informed consent prior to the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have used a proton pump inhibitor within 14 days prior to randomization,
             including over-the-counter omeprazole.

          -  Patients who have used any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) treatment (other
             than proton pump inhibitors) for symptoms of GERD, such as histamine 2 receptor
             antagonists or prokinetics, within 72 hours prior to randomization.

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity, allergy, or intolerance to any component of
