      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab
      may also stop the growth of neuroendocrine tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving
      combination chemotherapy together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving combination
      chemotherapy together with bevacizumab and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) with
           bevacizumab in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

        -  Determine the best overall response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to treatment failure and progression in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the biochemical marker response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type
      (carcinoid vs islet cell vs poorly differentiated neuroendocrine).

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1
      and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46-48 hours beginning on day 1. Patients also receive
      bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 26
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39-102 patients (13-34 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
