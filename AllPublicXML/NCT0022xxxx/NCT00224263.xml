  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      This study is to focus on the effects of Lingzhi on non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's
      diseases as the primary outcome and on delaying the disease progression using the delay start
      design as the secondary outcome measurement. Two dosage groups and one placebo control group
      with total 360 subjects will be recruited. The treatment is one year.
