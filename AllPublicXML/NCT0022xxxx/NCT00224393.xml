      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Enbrel in patients with primary
      systemic amyloidosis using a one-stage, phase II study design with an interim analysis. This
      study will also assess survival and progression times, symptom relief, and toxicity
      associated with Enbrel in primary systemic amyloidosis patients. Two groups of patients with
      very different risk profiles can be identified with respect to this disease. Patients with
      symptomatic cardiac disease and/or at least two involved organs ar at high risk and
      historically have a median survival less than six months. Patients without these conditions
      have a significantly better prognosis. Both subgroups will be studied in the present study,
      and essentially two phase-II clinical trials, one for each subgroup, will be run in parallel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &gt;=18 years of age.

          -  Laboratory values obtained &lt;=14 days prior to registration.

          -  No limitation on the cardiac ejection fraction

          -  Bilirubin &lt;3 mg/dL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;=500/microliters

          -  Histochemical diagnosis of amyloidosis as based on detection by polarizing microscopy
             of green bi-refringent material in Congo red-stained tissue specimens or
             characteristic electron microscopy appearance.

          -  Demonstrable M-protein in the serum/urine or clonal population of plasma cells in the
             bone marrow or immunohistochemical stain with anti-light chain anti-sera of amyloid
             fibrils.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1, 2, or 3.

          -  Symptomatic organ involvement with amyloid to justify therapy. This could include
             liver involvement, cardiac involvement, renal involvement, peripheral neuropathy, or
             soft tissue involvement. Must have more than purpura or carpal tunnel syndrome.

          -  Previously treated or untreated. No limit to prior therapy provided there is adequate
             residual organ function.

          -  Ability to provide informed consent.

          -  Ability to self-inject medication or have a caregiver who can administer the drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Amyloid-specific syndrome, such as, carpal tunnel syndrome or skin purpura as only
             evidence of disease. The finding of vascular amyloid only in a bone marrow biopsy
             specimen or in a plasmacytoma is not indicative of systemic amyloidosis.

          -  Presence of non-AL amyloidosis.

          -  Melphalan or other alkylating agents, high-dose dexamethasone or alpha interferon &lt;=4
             weeks prior to registration.

          -  Concurrent use of corticosteroids, but patients may be on chronic steroids if they are
             being given for disorders other than amyloid, i.e., adrenal insufficiency, rheumatoid
             arthritis, etc.

          -  Any of the following:

               -  Pregnant women

               -  Nursing women

               -  Men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to employ adequate
                  contraception (condoms, diaphragm, birth control pills, injections, intrauterine
                  device [IUD], surgical sterilization, abstinence, etc.)

          -  Uncontrolled infection.

          -  Clinically overt multiple myeloma (monoclonal BMPC &gt;30%), and at least one of the
             following:

               -  Bone lesions

               -  Hypercalcemia

          -  Active malignancy with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell
             skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from
             which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which
             the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.
