      A randomized controlled trial design will be used to answer whether a behavioral-educational
      sleep intervention and support from a nurse in the immediate postpartum improves maternal and
      infant sleep 6 weeks later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infant and maternal sleep in the postpartum are related, and influenced by the mother's
      understanding of infant sleep behavior, the environmental and social cues for sleep presented
      to the infant, development of the infant's sleep physiology, maternal sleep habits and
      behaviors, and maternal feelings related to her sleep and her baby's sleep. These factors may
      be modifiable through the use of behavioral-educational interventions. A randomized
      controlled trial design will be used to answer whether a behavioral-educational sleep
      intervention and support from a nurse in the immediate postpartum improves maternal and
      infant sleep 6 weeks later. Sleep-wake patterns will be analyzed through the use of
      actigraphy, a wristwatch-like device that measures sleep-wake activity. This is a pilot study
      which will test the usefulness and practicality of this type of program, so that a larger
      scale study can be developed.
