      During this phase of the study, a focus group will be conducted with young adolescents
      perinatally infected with HIV and with their caregivers to develop and evaluate the content
      of the proposed intervention. The purpose of the focus groups is to identify key issues and
      challenges that often face young adolescents perinatally infected with HIV and their
      caregivers as well as to elicit suggestions to enhance the feasibility and acceptability of
      the proposed intervention. The focus groups will be audio recorded and transcribed and
      reviewed by all involved in future protocol development. Themes will be pulled directly from
      the focus groups to guide examples and areas of emphasis in the intervention. In addition,
      proposed measures will be administered to the adolescents and their caregivers and assessed
      for appropriateness for this population.

      This study is designed to collect information from HIV-1 perinatally infected adolescents for
      the development of a pilot study that will use a life skills intervention model. One focus
      group comprised of adolescents and one focus group comprised of their caregivers will use a
      series of open-ended questions to facilitate a group discussion to define the life skills
      intervention model. Ten young adolescents, ages 11 to 14 years, and their caregivers will
      participate in these focus groups at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland,
      Ohio. The protocol will be site-restricted for participation. The responses from the focus
      group will be used to tailor the proposed life skills intervention model and to provide a
      detailed description of intervention content including: common peer issues of young
      adolescents perinatally infected with HIV, typical sexual knowledge and behaviors, typical
      areas of conflict between adolescents and caregivers, and common ways of managing conflict.
      In addition, those that participate in the focus group will be asked to complete a series of
      questionnaires in order to assess the appropriateness of the proposed measurement battery for
      adolescents perinatally infected with HIV and their caregivers.

      Findings from this study (ATN 045- Part A) will be used in the development of a proposal for
      a pilot study of the life skills intervention model (ATN 045-Part B). The pilot study will
      examine the feasibility of successfully providing a life skills intervention to HIV-1
      infected young adolescents at an ATN clinical site, the acceptability of such an intervention
      in young adolescents, as well as the logistics of providing such an intervention.
