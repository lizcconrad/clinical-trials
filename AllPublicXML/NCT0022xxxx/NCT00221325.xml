    <textblock>
      Rituximab is the first monoclonal antibody to receive approval in the treatment of cancer and
      has been proven to lead to extended survival when administered intravenously in the treatment
      of patients with systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We have previously demonstrated that a
      small fraction of Rituximab administered intravenously is able to cross the
      blood-brain-barrier into the brain.

      We will test the idea that the direct injection into the cerebrospinal fluid of Rituximab, a
      monoclonal antibody which attacks and kills lymphoma cells, is safe and when used in
      combination with methotrexate in patients with recurrent brain and intraocular lymphoma.

      We will also test the idea that the combination of rituximab plus methotrexate has activity
      and is effective in the treatment of recurrent brain and intraocular lymphoma.

      Rituximab is the first monoclonal antibody to receive FDA approval in the treatment of
      cancer. Intravenous administration of rituximab has been demonstrated to lead to prolongation
      of survival when used in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with
      systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We have previously demonstrated that a small fraction of
      Rituximab administered intravenously is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier into the brain
      and we have also previously demonstrated that direct intraventricular administration of
      Rituximab is able to achieve high concentrations within the cerebrospinal fluid ventricles
      and lumbar sac.

      We will test the hypothesis that the direct intraventricular injection of Rituximab in
      combination with Methotrexate is safe and when used in combination in patients with recurrent
      brain and intraocular lymphoma. We will evaluate the safety of this combination by testing
      different dose levels of Rituximab. We will also measure the concentration of Rituximab in
      the intraocular compartments and cerebrospinal fluid at different time points after
      intraventricular administration to determine the pharmacokinetics of intrathecal Rituximab as
      well as the potential impact of Methotrexate on Rituximab distribution.

      We will also test the hypothesis that the intraventricular administration of the combination
      of rituximab plus methotrexate has activity and is effective in the treatment of recurrent
      brain and intraocular lymphoma.

    <description>Intraventricular injection of rituximab into an Ommaya reservoir on day 1 of each week. Intraventricular rituximab plus methotrexate (MTX) on day 4 of each week.
First three patients at dose A : 25 mg rituximab on day 1, and MTX (12 mg) plus rituximab (10 mg) on day 4 each week.
If there are no dose limiting toxicities at Dose A in all of the first 3 patients or in 5 of the first 6 patients, the next 3 patients will receive dose level B: 25 mg rituximab on day 1, and combination MTX (12 mg) plus rituximab (25 mg) on day 4 of each week.
Oral leucovorin rescue 24 hours after each MTX administration. Maximum injections will be 16 over 9-weeks. Subjects who experience a partial response at week 10 will be given the option for extended dosing.</description>
