  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention (reminder and educational
      material) in improving the evaluation of osteoporosis follow-up care of post-menopausal women
      with wrist fractures by their primary care physicians. The intervention is directed at
      improving the gap in continuity of care between emergency/fracture clinics and family
      physicians, and reducing knowledge gaps.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies have demonstrated that women with wrist fractures have lower bone mineral
      density. Despite new guidelines for the care of such women, research has shown that they are
      not generally evaluated for osteoporosis. This care gap exists although it is known that
      wrist fractures are an important marker for subsequent fractures, such as a hip fracture,
      which represents a significant socio-economic burden to society.

      Comparison: Cluster randomized trial of women and their physicians, both of whom receive
      educational material and reminder on post fracture osteoporosis evaluation. Comparison is to
      women and their physicians who receive standard post fracture information. Family practices
      are randomized to intervention or non-intervention group.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Postmenopausal women with low trauma distal radius fracture (confirmed by x-ray).

          2. Can be taking Didrocal (etidronate), Miacalcin (calcitonin),or hormone replacement
             therapy .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women with fractures of the elbow, mid radius, scaphoid, or injury to wrists (without
             actual fracture).

          2. Significant cognitive impairment (which would preclude them from filling out simple
             questionnaires).

          3. Women already taking osteoporosis therapy, ie. either Fosamax (alendronate), Actonel
             (risedronate), or the selective estrogen receptor modulator, Evista (raloxifene).
