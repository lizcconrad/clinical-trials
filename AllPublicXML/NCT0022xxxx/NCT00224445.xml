      To determine the safety and efficacy (viral load suppression and cluster of differentiation 4
      [CD4] changes) of a simple, once-daily (QD) antiretroviral (ARV) regimen consisting of a
      fixed-dose combination tablet containing Truvada combined with the protease inhibitor
      atazanavir (ATV) boosted with ritonavir (ATV/r).

      To evaluate fasting glucose, insulin, C peptide and lipid panel (total cholesterol, high and
      low density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL, LDL), and serum triglycerides) in subjects
      receiving Truvada and boosted atazanavir.

      To evaluate adherence to a QD ARV regimen of Truvada and boosted atazanavir.

             study inclusion.

          -  Adequate renal function defined as a calculated creatinine clearance (CLCr) greater

          -  Male: (140 - age in years) x (wt in kg) divided by 72 x (serum creatinine in mg/dL) =
             CLCr (mL/min.

          -  Female: (140 - age in years) x (wt in kg) divided by 72 x (serum creatinine in mg/dL)
             x 0.85 = CLCr (mL/min).

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential only).

          -  Males and females (of childbearing potential, i.e. less than 2 years post-menopausal)

             following discontinuation of study drug.

          -  Life expectancy greater than or equal to 1 year.
