  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to collect preliminary information about the best way to
      implement an intervention to reduce the risks of heart disease and stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has two types of interventions. The clinics and patients are randomly assigned to
      either a control or intervention group. All clinics have both control and intervention
      patients. In the clinic intervention, we help doctors monitor patient information about the
      risk factors of heart disease and stroke. In the patient intervention, we contact patients by
      phone to discuss these risk factors before their doctor visits.
