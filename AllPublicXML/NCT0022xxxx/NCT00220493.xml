      Scientific background:

      Growing awareness and accumulating data regarding the cognitive impairment and its
      progression in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients has received an important place in
      neurological research in the last decade. Cognitive impairments occur frequently (43 to 65%)
      in MS. Moreover, in up to 50% of patients in whom no cognitive disturbances are found on
      routine neurological examination, cognitive impairments can be elicited using sensitive and
      disease specific neuropsychological tests. Even in patients with short disease duration of
      less than two years, discrete impairment of cognitive function may be found in up to 60% on
      neuropsychological testing without impacting activities of daily living.

      We have recently reported that cognitive impairment occurred in 53.7% of patients with
      probable MS (evaluated within a mean of one month of the onset of new neurological symptoms).
      Verbal abilities and attention span were most frequently affected (43.3 and 41.8%
      respectively). An additional study demonstrated that MS patients within the first 5 years of
      disease onset presented attentional dysfunction only when the cognitive load of the attention
      task was high and when controlled information processing was required. This high rate of
      attention impairment found in MS patients early in the disease process may have a significant
      impact on quality of life and activities of daily living as attention is one of the most
      fundamental cognitive functions essential for normal daily activities and a requisite step
      towards conscious perception. Consequently, we suggest investigating whether treatment with
      Ritalin (methylphenidate) has an effect on patients.
