  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients resuscitated with 4% Albumin will have less incidence and reduced severity of
      pressure injuries than patients resuscitated with 0.9% Sodium Chloride due to the improved
      intravascular oncotic pressure effected from higher albumin levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers incur multiple risks to the patient. The disruption of the skin is a portal
      of entry for infection , which may remain localised to the site or become blood borne. A
      pressure ulcer can lead to protein and fluid losses from the wound exudate. Many authors have
      theorised the existence of a relationship between the development of pressure ulcers and low
      serum albumin levels however, there is no strong evidence to prove this correlation. The
      literature does demonstrate a clear relationship between people with existing pressure ulcers
      and the presence of low serum albumins. Specifically serum albumin levels &lt;30mg/dl have been
      associated with the incidence of pressure ulcer development.
