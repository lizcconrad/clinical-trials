  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To humidify gases during non invasive ventilation, both to heated humidifier (HH) and heat
      and moisture exchanger (HME) are routinely used. Patients receiving non invasive ventilation
      for acute respiratory failure were randomized to HME or HH. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate respiratory parameters and arterial blood gases (ABG) of patients during NIV with
      small dead space HME compared to HH.

      Objective: Few data are reported in the field of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) regarding
      humidification devices. It was previously suggested that standard heat and moisture
      exchangers (HME) had adverse gasometrical and clinical outcomes in acute respiratory failure
      (ARF) of chronic respiratory failure patients (CRF). This study was performed to evaluate
      respiratory parameters and arterial blood gases (ABG) of patients during NIV with small dead
      space HME compared to heated humidifier (HH).

      Design: Prospective randomized cross-over study. Setting: A 16-bed medical intensive care
      unit (ICU) and a 14-bed medico surgical ICU.

      Patients: Patients receiving NIV for ARF in the context of CRF or hypoxic ARF and patients
      with persistent weaning failure receiving NIV just after extubation.

      Measurements: HME and HH were randomly compared during 2 NIV periods of 30 minutes separated
      by a 20 to 30 minutes period of spontaneous breathing with oxygen. ABG were collected at
      baseline and at the end of each period. As well as respiratory parameters including volumes,
      pressures, P0.1, a comfort score, capnometry and oxygen saturation. Two sets of patients were
      successively studied whether they have a flex tube added to the ventilatory circuit or not.
