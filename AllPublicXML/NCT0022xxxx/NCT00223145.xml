  <brief_title>Study on the Role of Hormonal Treatment for Two Dosage Levels of Prostate Radiation Therapy Versus Prostate Radiation Therapy Alone</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the proposed study would be that, due to the six months of total androgen
      blockade, which would include neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for four months and concomitant
      hormonal therapy for two months with irradiation, the investigators could reduce local
      failure rates for these two dosage levels, namely 70 Gy and 76 Gy. Since increasing the dose
      to the prostate also seems to reduce local relapse rates, the results of the two hormonal
      therapy groups would be compared with the results of prostate irradiation at doses of 76 Gy.
      This study would verify the possibility of compensating a six Gy dosage increase of radiation
      therapy with six months of hormonal therapy between the 70 Gy and 76 Gy groups who received
      hormonal therapy, and also match these results with a dose escalation to the prostate of 76
      Gy. In the future, this could result in more therapeutic choices, such as reducing the doses
      of radiation therapy and, consequently, its related complications, if hormonal therapy proves
      to be beneficial; or rather, to continue in the direction of dose escalation for this
      intermediate-risk patient group, everything being correlated to the side effects of hormonal
      therapy and irradiation.
