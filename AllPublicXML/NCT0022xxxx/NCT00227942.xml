      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of estrogen replacement therapy in treating
      depression in menopausal women with hot flashes and insomnia.

      Estrogen is a hormone that plays an important part in the development of the female
      reproductive system. During menopause, estrogen levels drop significantly. The drop in
      estrogen may cause physiologic and psychological changes in women; common symptoms include
      hot flashes, sweating, insomnia, and irritability. In addition, approximately 10% of
      menopausal women experience depression. Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is often
      prescribed to alleviate these symptoms. It is not known, however, exactly how ERT treats
      depression. It may indirectly decrease depression by alleviating insomnia associated with hot
      flashes, or it may directly improve mood and decrease depression by altering chemicals in the
      brain. The purpose of this study is to gain insight into how ERT treats depression and to
      develop strategies to reduce depression in menopausal women. In turn, these findings may help
      categorize populations of women whose depression should be treated with ERT versus
      nonhormonal therapies.

      In this 9-week study, participants will be randomly assigned to receive ERT, a sleeping pill,
      or placebo. Study visits will occur at baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 9; at each study
      visit, blood pressure will be monitored, and standardized psychological tests and
      questionnaires will be used to assess the participant's level of depression and reported
      quality of life outcomes. Blood will be drawn at baseline and Week 9 to measure estrogen and
      follicle stimulating hormone levels.
