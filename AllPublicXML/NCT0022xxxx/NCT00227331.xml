      This is a clinical trial to determine if oral amoxicillin is equivalent in efficacy to
      injectable penicillin (the standard treatment) in the treatment of WHO-defined severe
      pneumonia in children between the ages of 2 and 59 months.

      BACKGROUND Injectable penicillin is recommended treatment for WHO-defined severe pneumonia
      (lower chest indrawing [LCI]). Oral amoxicillin, if found equally effective, could reduce
      referral, hospitalization, and treatment costs. We aimed to determine whether oral
      amoxicillin and parenteral penicillin were equivalent in the treatment of severe pneumonia in
      children aged 3-59 months.

      METHODS This multicentre randomized, open label equivalency study was conducted at tertiary
      care centres in 8 countries. Children aged 3-59 months with severe pneumonia were
      hospitalized for 48 hours and, if improved, discharged with a 5-day course of oral
      amoxicillin. Follow-up evaluation occurred at 5 and 14 days after enrolment. The primary
      outcome was treatment failure (persistence of LCI or new danger signs) at 48 hours. Analyses
      were by intention to treat and per protocol.

      RESULTS 1702 children were randomized to receive either oral amoxicillin (857) or parenteral
      penicillin (845) for 48 hours. Treatment failure was 19% in each group (risk difference –0.4;
      95% CI –4.2 to 3.3) at 48 hours, 22% (cumulative) in each group at 5 days, and 25% in each
      group at 14 days. Relapse at day 5 and 14 occurred in 45/1375 (3.4%) and 65/1330 (4.8%) of
      the children, respectively. Infancy (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.95—3.79), very fast breathing (1.94,
      1.42—2.65) and hypoxia (1.95, 1.34—2.82) at baseline predicted treatment failure by
      multivariate analysis.

      CONCLUSIONS Injectable penicillin and oral amoxicillin are equivalent in the treatment of
      severe pneumonia in developing world areas in a controlled environment. Additional research
      is needed in a public health setting in rural and urban areas before these finding can be
      recommended for widespread implementation. Potential benefits of oral therapy for pneumonia
      include a decrease in the 1) the risk of needle-borne infections; 2) need for referral or
      hospitalization; 3) administration costs and 4) costs to the family. (word count 294).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children aged three to 59 months admitted with severe pneumonia. Severe pneumonia is
             defined as lower chest indrawing in children with cough and/or difficult breathing,
             who are able to drink and do not have central cyanosis, regardless of the respiratory
             rate. Known HIV infected patients in clinical category N or A (CDC) will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any danger sign during current illness (convulsions, abnormally sleepy or
             difficult to awake, stridor in a calm child).

          -  Severe malnutrition defined as weight for age equal or less than -3 SD or
             kwashiorkor).

          -  Hospitalization in the last two weeks. This will exclude cases with possible
             nosocomial pneumonia that could require second line antibiotics.

          -  Known prior episodes of asthma. These patients may have respiratory distress without
             infection and most often do not need antibiotics. Children having had 3 or more
             episodes of wheezing in the past will also be excluded. Wheezing that improves after
             receiving bronchodilator therapy, as explained in the footnote . These children may
             have asthma.

          -  Measles in the last month. These patients may have immune suppression.

          -  Previous history of HIV infection in clinical category B or C (CDC). These patients
             have immune suppression and infections that may require other diagnostic or treatment
             measures (see annex 1, page 39).

          -  Known or clinically recognizable chronic conditions (congenital cardiac or respiratory
             anomalies, chronic lung disease including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neurological
             impairment that affects respiratory function, renal diseases, malignant or
             hematological diseases).

          -  Other diseases requiring antibiotic therapy on presenting, such as meningitis, evident
             tuberculosis, dysentery, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, etc. Use of other
             antibiotics needed for treatment.

          -  Children Lower Chest Indrawing due to non-infective cause such cardiac failure, active
             rickets, or severe anemia, or with signs of severe dehydration according to WHO
             criteria (see annex 2, page 42).

          -  Children with SaO2 &lt;80% in room air at sea level, or SaO2 &lt; 75% in Bogota and Mexico
             (for measurement of oxygen saturation see Study Manual).

          -  Known prior anaphylactic reaction to penicillin or amoxycillin.

          -  Known antibiotic therapy for 48 hours or more prior to admission. Clinically, these
             children would be considered for a change of treatment to second line antibiotics on
             admission. Evidence of antibiotic use include any of the following: a) parental report
             that an antibiotics has been given; b) parent can provide evidence for prescription
             for antibiotics or c) has the container with antibiotic or d) recognizes medication
             when shown appropriate containers for locally available antibiotics. Children that
             have received antibiotics for less than 48 hours prior to admission will be accepted
             in the trial.

          -  Inability to receive oral medications (three or more episodes of vomiting per hour).
             These children should not be given oral antibiotics.

          -  Previous inclusion in the trial or children already included in another trial.

          -  Living outside the catchment area of the hospital. These patients may be difficult to
             follow after discharge.

          -  Parental or caretaker refusal to participate in the trial.
