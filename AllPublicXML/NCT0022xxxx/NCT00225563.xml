  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Taconic IPA, a 2,500 physician independent practice association (IPA) located in
      Fishkill, New York (NY), is involved in an information technology project to improve the
      quality, safety and efficiency of healthcare in the region. Over the past three years, the
      organization has worked with area hospitals and laboratories to create a community wide
      electronic data exchange. Currently, the Taconic IPA is in the midst of implementing a full
      electronic health record in some practices and e-prescribing in other practices. The purpose
      is to study the impact of an electronic health record on safety and quality measures.

      We propose to measure differences in patient safety and quality measures among three groups:
      the control group consisting of physicians with paper-based office practices, a group of
      physicians using the clinical messaging system and electronic prescribing, and a group of
      physicians using the EMR and electronic prescribing.

      We plan to introduce a vendor based electronic prescribing system by July 2005. This system
      will be offered to all physicians using clinical messaging and will be integrated with the
      EMR system. The system will have clinical decision support, such as checks for drug-drug
      interactions.

      Our evaluation will measure differences in rates of medication errors and quality measures
      amongst these three groups. We will use a study design of a pre-post evaluation with a
      comparison control group. We will detect medical errors by prescription and chart review. We
      will determine compliance with quality measures through a combination of electronic data and
      chart review.
