      This is a study to determine if Fosamax (alendronate), a medication approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal
      women, is effective in decreasing the rate of bone loss which often begins to increase in the
      three to five years preceding the menopause (perimenopausal transition).

      During the three to five years prior to the menopause, the rate of bone loss increases. One
      way that physicians treat this is with oral contraceptive medication. However, the incidence
      of complications from oral contraceptives after the age of 40 increases. Therefore, a
      non-hormonal means of preventing bone loss should be useful. Fosamax (alendronate) is in a
      class of compounds called bisphosphonates. This study is being done to determine whether
      Fosamax can be used to prevent the increased rate of bone loss during the perimenopausal
      transition.
