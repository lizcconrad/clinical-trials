  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was set-up to examine the controversial issue whether or not it is safe to drive a
      car or not when treated with methylphenidate.

      On-the-road driving tests during normal traffic are conducted to determine the effects of
      methylphenidate versus placebo on driving ability of adult ADHD patients.In addition, two
      laboratory tests are conducted to examine memory functioning and inhibitory control.
