  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with malnutrition are often low in some nutrients, like zinc or vitamin A, that
      could help them fight off infections like pneumonia. Our study was designed to see if
      children who got supplements of zinc or vitamin A had fewer infections.

      The Vitamin A and Zinc: Prevention of Pneumonia (VAZPOP) study was a multi-year
      nutritionally-stratified, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of low-dose vitamin A and/or
      zinc in 2,582 normal and malnourished urban children aged 6 to 36 months in Quito, Ecuador.
      Four group of ~ 645 children were enrolled in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 with each child
      participating for up to 50 weeks. Children were visited 4 days each week. Outcome measures
      were pneumonia, other respiratory tract infections, diarrheal disease, and growth.
