  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain biologic materials from the blood and lungs of normal
      individuals to establish a set of normal range for various parameters. These will provide
      important information when applied to individuals with various pulmonary diseases, and will
      help in understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of various lung diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study procedures will be performed at the Weill Cornell Medical College-New York Presbyterian
      Hospital and/or Weill Greenburg York Avenue Building. Study procedures done elsewhere that
      are within the protocol timeframe will be accepted if seen fit by the investigators so that
      they are not repeated unnecessarily. Study individuals who undergo bronchoscopy with
      intravenous administration of sedatives and analgesia may be required to stay overnight.
      Bronchoscopy is normally an ambulatory procedure. The subject is observed after the
      bronchoscopy, including vital signs and level of consciousness, until they are back to
      baseline. An overnight stay would only be required if the individual was not, in the judgment
      of the attending physician, safe to be discharged as is standard practice. Follow up of all
      participants are carried out by telephone within 1 wk following the procedure.

      Rockefeller University has been added as a second site.

      Individuals undergoing bronchoscopy without intravenous administration of sedatives and
      analgesia are not required to stay overnight due to the lack of administration of
      CNS-altering drugs and the limited sampling involved (tracheal brushes only).

    <intervention_name>Bronchopulmonary Lung Lavage</intervention_name>
    <description>Lung Lavage is a Washing. Bronchoscopy consists of the passage via the mouth or nose of a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy into the airways. During the lavage (washing) procedure, sterile 0.9% saline (5 x 20 ml aliquots in 1 to 3 sites) is instilled into the lung and immediately suctioned back, washing off cells lining the airways. Once the fluid has been collected, the fluid is centrifuged and the cells are collected and counted.</description>

    <intervention_name>Bronchial Brushing</intervention_name>
    <description>Bronchoscopy consists of the passage via the mouth or nose of a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy into the airways. During the brushing procedure, a small cytology brush is passed through the bronchoscope, and a small area of the airway wall is brushed gently (in up to 20 different sites in the large and small airways) to obtain epithelial cells lining the airway. Cells collected by airway brushing will be washed, counted, and evaluated for viability. They will also be studied for differential cell count by standard procedures. Collected airway cells will be used to carry out studies assess expression of various genes and to study viral gene transfer.</description>

    <description>This is a safe and widely used investigative method in pulmonary medicine. In this procedure, a small biopsy forceps is passed through the bronchoscope and, under direct vision, a small biopsy (in up to 5 sites) is obtained from the bronchial wall. A biopsy obtains tissue to a depth of 2-3 mm, and includes epithelial and subepithelial tissue.</description>

        The source of potential subjects will be the population of 'normal', as defined by the
        eligibility criteria below, individuals in the New York metropolitan area and elsewhere. Up
        to one hundred volunteers will take part in the study each year. Accrual will be random
        with no bias as to gender or racial/ethnic group. All study individuals will be males or
        females that are 18 years or older and are able to provide informed consent. Advertisements
        will be posted at various educational institutions and hospitals and placed in newspapers
        in the New York metropolitan area. Paid volunteer referrals will also be used for patient
        recruitment.
