  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of EC-MPS with tacrolimus
      at both reference and reduced levels. This study will take into account safety aspects such
      as decreased renal toxicity by reducing the overall exposure to tacrolimus.
