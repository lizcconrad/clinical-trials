    <textblock>
      This is a research study looking at the effect of 5-Hydroxy Tryptophan (5-HTP) on urine
      excretion of 5-Hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA). 5-HTP is a common over the counter product
      that is sold in natural food stores and via the Internet. Increased levels of 5-HIAA in the
      urine can be found in a specific type of cancer, called carcinoid tumor. This study will
      examine the effect of oral 5-HTP intake on 5-HIAA excretion. Understanding this effect may
      help to determine which tests should be done in a patient with increased 5-HIAA excretion
      who's also taking 5-HTP.

      5-HTP is a common over the counter product that is sold in natural food stores and via the
      Internet. It is claimed to improve sleep problems, depression, anxiety, compulsive disorders,
      restless leg syndrome, migraines, fibromyalgia, and low pain threshold.Increased levels of
      5-HIAA in the urine can be a of a specific type of cancer, called carcinoid tumor. Urinary
      5-HIAA levels can also be increased by a number of food products and drugs. Oral 5-HTP is not
      known as a cause of elevation of 5-HIAA in urine. However, recent information suggests that
      5-HTP may cause an increase.

      In this study we examine the effect of oral 5-HTP intake (100 mg at bedtime for 10 days) on
      5-HIAA excretion in the urine, following a prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled study
      design.

      Understanding this effect may help to determine which tests should be done in a patient with
      increased 5-HIAA excretion who's also taking 5-HTP.
