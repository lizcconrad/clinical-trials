  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stroke or transient ischemic attach should receive advise on smoking cessation.
      It is however unknown if an intensive smoking cessation program is better than ordinary
      advise on smoking cessation during hospitalisation for stroke or transient ischemic attack.

      The aim of the study was to assess if an intensive smoking cessation program made more
      patients stop smoking after stroke or transient ischemic attack.

      Patients with stroke or transient ischemic attach should receive advise on smoking cessation.
      It is however unknown if an intensive smoking cessation program is better than ordinary
      advise on smoking cessation during hospitalisation for stroke or transient ischemic attack.

      The aim of the study was to assess if an intensive smoking cessation program made more
      patients stop smoking after stroke or transient ischemic attack.

      Patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack are admitted to the department of neurology
      at Odense University hospital. Patient who are smokers on admission and age &lt; 76 years,
      inhabitants in Funen County and with symptoms developed before admission will be offered
      participation in the study unless they have severe stroke, stroke more than 3 weeks before
      admission, other severe disease or unable to participate.

      Study participants will be randomised to either usual short advise on smoking cessation or an
      intensive smoking cessation program. All participants will be followed-up for 6 months with
      regard to smoking habits.
