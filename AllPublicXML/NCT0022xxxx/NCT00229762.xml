  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study was to determine effectiveness of a telephone reminder to increase
      pneumococcal vaccination in a managed care population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to the intervention arm received a telephone call from managed care
      nurses asking about their pneumococcal vaccination status and whether they would like to be
      vaccinated. We compared six month follow-up of pneumococcal vaccination in electronic medical
      records for the intervention versus control group. We tested the percent vaccinated in each
      randomization arm using chi-square tests for proportions.
