      After successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction, 60 patients were randomly assigned to either a control group (n=30)
      that received optimum postinfarction medical treatment, or a bone-marrow-cell group (n=30)
      that received optimum medical treatment and intracoronary transfer of autologous bone-marrow
      cells 4·8 days (SD 1·3) after PCI. Primary endpoint was global left-ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF) change from baseline to 6 months’ follow-up, as determined by cardiac MRI.
      Image analyses were done by two investigators blinded for treatment assignment. Analysis was
      per protocol.

      Global LVEF at baseline (determined 3·5 days [SD 1·5] after PCI) was 51·3 (9·3%) in controls
      and 50·0 (10·0%) in the bone-marrow cell group (p=0·59). After 6 months, mean global LVEF had
      increased by 0·7 percentage points in the control group and 6·7 percentage points in the
      bone-marrow-cell group (P=0·0026).

      Transfer of bone-marrow cells enhanced left-ventricular systolic function primarily in
      myocardial segments adjacent to the infarcted area. Cell transfer did not increase the risk
      of adverse clinical events, in-stent restenosis, or proarrhythmic effects.

      Emerging evidence suggests that stem cells and progenitor cells derived from bone marrow can
      be used to improve cardiac function in patients after acute myocardial infarction. In this
      randomised trial, we aimed to assess whether intracoronary transfer of autologous bone-marrow
      cells could improve global left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 6 months’ follow-up.

      After successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction, 60 patients were randomly assigned to either a control group (n=30)
      that received optimum postinfarction medical treatment, or a bone-marrow-cell group (n=30)
      that received optimum medical treatment and intracoronary transfer of autologous bone-marrow
      cells 4·8 days (SD 1·3) after PCI. Primary endpoint was global left-ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF) change from baseline to 6 months’ follow-up, as determined by cardiac MRI.

      transfer of autologous bone-marrow-cells promotes improvement of left-ventricular systolic
      function in patients after acute myocardial infarction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were eligible if they were admitted within 5 days of the onset of symptoms of
             a first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction

          -  Had undergone successful PCI with stent implantation in the infarctrelated artery

          -  Had hypokinesia or akinesia involving more than two thirds of the left-ventricular
             anteroseptal, lateral, and/or inferior wall, as shown by angiography done immediately
             after PCI.

        Exclusion Criteria:
