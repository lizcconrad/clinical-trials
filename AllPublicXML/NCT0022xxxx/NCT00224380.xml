  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to learn about how well older people with serious mental
      illness (including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, major
      depression) follow prescribed medication regimens, and to evaluate a manualized intervention
      designed to enhance medication management skills and adherence, the Using Medications
      Effectively program. The following four hypotheses will be tested:

        1. Medication adherence will be associated with several variables including insight,
           memory, medication management skill, knowledge about medications, attitudes about
           medications.

        2. People who receive the program will have better medication adherence compared to those
           who do not receive the program as measured by pill counts.

        3. People who receive the program will develop better medication management skills compared
           to those who do not receive the program.

      Individuals who are already participating in a study of a combined skills training and health
      care management intervention for older people with serious mental illness are invited to join
      this study. Half of the individuals have already been randomly assigned to receive the
      intervention and half have already been randomly assigned to continue receiving their usual
      care. The people receiving the intervention receive the skills training module, Using
      Medications Effectively, in 8 group sessions over 8 weeks. The module includes information
      about common medications used for psychiatric and medical illnesses; training on using
      devices to help take medications properly; and instruction on strategies to help incorporate
      medication taking into a daily routine. A trained research assistant conducts pill counts and
      interview sessions with all participants after they sign an informed consent form, 8 weeks
      later, and 3 months after the second interview.
