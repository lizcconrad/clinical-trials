  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to verify superiority of the lafutidine group over the placebo
      group and non-inferiority to the famotidine group in terms of endoscopic healing rate of the
      patients with mild reflux oesophagitis.

      Furthermore, the followings are compared:

      The improvement effect in heartburn and other subjective symptoms, and dosing frequency of
      MALFA ® suspension (neutralizer) as well as incidence of adverse events among the lafutidine
      20 mg/day treatment group, the famotidine 40 mg/day treatment group and the placebo treatment
      group in patients with mild reflux oesophagitis.

      In Japan it is reported that many patients with reflux oesophagitis are relatively mild and
      do not usually require strong treatment, and even H2 receptor antagonists are considered to
      demonstrate sufficient healing effects. Haruma thinks that the first choice should be PPI in
      principle which has the best therapeutic effect as the medical guideline if a patient has a
      strong reflux symptom such as heartburn or is diagnosed with severe reflux oesophagitis
      (Grade C or D according to the Los Angels Classification) as a result of the upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopic test. Later, after healing is confirmed at 8 weeks of treatment
      or after the subjective symptoms have been improved, the dose of PPI should be reduced to
      half to transfer to maintenance therapy. On the other hand, if a patient has mild subjective
      symptoms or develops mild reflux oesophagitis (Grade A or B according to the Los Angels
      Classification) as a result of the upper gastrointestinal endoscopic test, only about 10% of
      such patients aggravate in the long-run and some patients heal in the natural course.
      Therefore, considering that Japanese gastric-acid secretion is lower than Westerners, they
      recommend that antacids such as H2 receptor antagonists or sodium alginates is used to treat
      symptoms as they appear along with the improvement in the lifestyle. As mentioned above,
      lafutidine that strongly suppresses acid secretion during the daytime from the initial phase
      of treatment is expected to demonstrate sufficient effect in treatment of mild reflux
      oesophagitis similar to the conventional H2 receptor antagonists.

      Based on above, the clinical trial is planned with the objective to confirmedly demonstrate
      the efficacy of lafutidine in mild reflux oesophagitis.

      Comparisons: The endoscopic healing rate of lafutidine in the patients with mild reflux
      oesophagitis is compared to the rate of placebo and it is also compared to the rate of
      famotidine.
