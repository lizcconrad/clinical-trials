      The purpose of this study is... To assess whether a behavioral treatment that combines
      motivational enhancement and cognitive skills training therapy (MET-CBT) is more effective
      than brief advice in: 1) decreasing use of a full range of psychoactive substances (e.g.
      marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, alcohol, nicotine, opioids) in pregnant substance using
      and dependent women; 2) decreasing HIV risk behavior; 3) improving birth outcomes (longer
      gestations and greater birth weight).

      We propose an integrated system of counseling services onsite in primary care obstetrical
      clinics, comparing a manualized brief advice (closely approximating &quot;treatment as usual&quot;) to
      manualized motivationally enhanced cognitive behavioral therapy. Treatment providers are
      obstetrical nurses. Therapy patients are taught skill sets designed to enhance motivation to
      abstain from drugs of abuse, as well as designed to prevent relapse during the perinatal
      period. It is our hypothesis that therapy patients will be more successful at achieving
      stated study aims than those receiving brief advice.

          <description>Primary drug was determined by combining a) self-reported recent use of substances and b) preferred substance according to the subject. If the participant used only one substance in the past 28 days, it was designated as primary. If the woman used more than one or did not endorse use of a substance in the prior 28 days, we used patient-identified primary drug. Subjects who reported more than one drug as primary were classified as &quot;other&quot; regardless of substances endorsed.</description>
