    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the effects of the combination of Gleevec and
      Taxotere in lung cancer in terms of control and reduction of the cancer size. The study will
      also test lung cancer to see if the presence of certain protein called receptor for platelet
      derived growth factor can influence the effect of the treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response rate of Gleevec with Taxotere in
      patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer. Also to determine the expression of
      PDGF-R, phosphorylated PDGF-r and C-kit in the original tissue and correlate with response.
      If the patient has a tumor in an accessible location, we will ask for consent from the
      patient to obtain biopsy before and after the therapy to assess the same molecular markers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One prior chemotherapy treatment: use of single chemotherapy or a regimen containing
             more than one drug. Regimen must have a platinum agent (cisplatin or carboplatin).
             Prior biological treatment won't be counted as chemotherapy treatment. Chemoradiation
             or prior induction or adjuvant chemotherapy +/- chemoradiation will constitute one
             prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients may not have received Docetaxel. Taxol as part of
             initial therapy is allowed.

          -  Documented recurrent/progressive disease by radiographic exam (CT scan, MRI, bone scan
             or CXR), clinical exam (presence of palpable nodes) or biopsy.

          -  No signs of clinically active brain metastasis or spinal cord compression. If patient
             has brain metastasis or cord compression, patient will be eligible if stable without
             deterioration of performance status after radiation therapy and off corticosteroids.

          -  Cases with pleural effusion must have another site of disease for measurement and
             follow-up.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Bi-dimensional measurable disease (≥ 1 cm by CT or other radiogram; physical exam
             alone is permissible if there is no radiographically measurable tumor)

          -  Laboratory: ANC ≥ 1,500/mm3, Hemoglobin &gt; 8g/dl, platelet ≥ 100,000/mm3, Total
             Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl, Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl, Transaminase (AST/ALT) ≤ 2.5 X upper
             normal limit if ALK phosphatase is ≤ Upper normal limit OR ALK may be up to 4X ULN if
             transaminase are ≤ ULN.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old

          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of NSCLC, biopsy at diagnosis or on recurrence.
             Histology may include large cell, squamous cell, undifferentiated, bronchioalveolar or
             adenocarcinoma but not small cell lung cancer or mixed small and non-small cell lung
             cancer, or carcinoid. Mixed histology non-small cell lung cancer will be allowed,
             i.e.: large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.

          -  IHC of the biopsy specimen, if available, for PDGF-R. Insufficient tissue will not
             preclude study enrollment.

             mg/dl, unstable angina, active infection on antibiotics, FEV1 less than 800 cc,
             patient with known chronic liver disease (i.e., chronic active hepatitis and
             cirrhosis)

          -  Use of investigational agents or chemotherapy within 4 weeks

          -  Pregnant or nursing women and women or men with reproductive potential unless using

             study drug.

          -  No other active invasive cancer. Patient is &lt; 5 years free of another malignancy
             except for: other primary malignancy isn't currently clinically significant or
             requiring active intervention, or if other primary malignancy is a basal cell skin
             cancer or a cervical carcinoma in situ. Existence of any other malignant disease is
             not allowed.

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to taxane, Polysorbate 80 or gemcitabine
             and who could not tolerate treatment even with 24 H premedication with Decadron and
             Benadryl. (If the patient had prior hypersensitivity, but did not receive 24 H
             premedication for taxane, the patient may be eligible if he/she tolerates one cycle
             with 24 H premedication).

          -  Existing peripheral neuropathy CTC Version 3&gt; grade 2

          -  Patient has known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
