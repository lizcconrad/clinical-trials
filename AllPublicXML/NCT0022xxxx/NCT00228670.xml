      The purpose of this study is to: 1) to develop a method to quantify Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)
      load in lung tissue of humans and to determine whether EBV viral load is significantly higher
      in lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) than in control lung
      tissue; 2) to determine whether EBV localized to epithelial cells in IPF lungs and to relate
      epithelial positivity to tissue viral load; 3) to measure viral load in induced sputum from
      IPF subjects over time in order to determine whether periodic active herpes virus replication
      occurred in the respiratory tract; and 4) to compare longitudinal measures of viral load in
      induced sputum with simultaneously collected saliva in order to assess the clinical utility
      of the two approaches.

      IPF is a progressive disease where there is no proven treatment, other than lung transplant.
      Doctors do not know what causes IPF. We think that IPF is caused by a viral infection,
      particularly herpes virus. The goal of this experiment is to build the case for a causal link
      between IPF and herpes virus. This information is important to help us develop new therapies
      to treat patients with IPF.

      We will collect lung tissue at the time of lung transplant surgery from IPF patients and from
      organ donors as controls. Control lung tissue was collected if it was removed as a part of
      regular care or would otherwise be discarded. No extra tissue was taken solely for this
      research project.

      We will also perform a prospective longitudinal study on IPF patients and their household
      partners. IPF subjects are included if they have no other pulmonary disease and the diagnosis
      of IPF is confirmed by lung biopsy or by clinical and chest CT findings. The control group
      will consist of subjects without respiratory symptoms or pulmonary diseases who are the
      household partner or spouse of an enrolled IPF subject and who accompanies the IPF patient to
      outpatient clinic visits. If there is no household partner, or if the partner is unwilling to
      participate, we will still enroll the IPF subject who qualifies for the study and is willing
      to participate. Saliva, induced sputum, and venous blood will be collected from IPF and
      control subjects after informed consent at each clinic visit. Visits usually are at
      approximately 3-4 month intervals over a one year period.

        For the study on lung tissue, eligible subjects were IPF patients undergoing lung
        transplant surgery and from organ donors who died from non-pulmonary causes. For the study
        in clinic, subjects were IPF patients who had no other pulmonary disease other than IPF and
        the diagnosis of IPF was confirmed by lung biopsy or by clinical and chest CT findings. The
        control group consisted of subjects without respiratory symptoms or pulmonary diseases who
        were the household partner or spouse of an enrolled IPF subject and accompanied the IPF
        patient to outpatient clinic visits.
