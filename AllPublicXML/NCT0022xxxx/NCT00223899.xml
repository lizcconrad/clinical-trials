      To evaluate the safety of intratumorally injected VCL-IM01 at doses of 0.5 mg (1 tumor), 1.5
      mg (1 tumor), 5 mg (1 tumor), 10 mg (2 tumors, 5 mg per tumor) and 15 mg (3 tumors, 5 mg per
      tumor) followed by electroporation.

    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will receive intratumoral injections of VCL-IM01 followed by
      electroporation of the injected tumor(s).

      Subjects will be enrolled to receive one course of treatment. A course of treatment is two
      cycles, each cycle consisting of four weekly injection/electroporation administrations
      followed by an observation period of two weeks.

      Subjects' tumors will be evaluated at Screening, at the end of Cycle 2, and at six months
      (Week 26) from the initial drug administration.
