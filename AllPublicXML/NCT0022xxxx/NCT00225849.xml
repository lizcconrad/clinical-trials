  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the balance between the risks and benefits of
      primary prevention by Aspirin in elderly Japanese patients with one or more
      cerebro/cardiovascular risk factors

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebro/cardiovascular (CV) death accounts for approximately 30% of total deaths in Japan and
      therefore it is important to establish a preventive treatment for CV events from the point of
      public health. The guidelines proposed by a joint study group centering on the Japanese
      Circulation Society, recommend administration of aspirin to patients with multiple risk
      factors for primary prevention of arteriosclerotic diseases. In addition, the 2002 AHA
      guidelines recommend use of aspirin in patients with a 10% or higher 10-year risk of CV
      events. However, these descriptions are founded on randomized, comparative study results and
      epidemiological data obtained outside Japan, while no epidemiological data are available in
      Japan that would allow prediction and selection of patients who could benefit from primary
      prevention with aspirin. Although the benefit of aspirin for secondary prevention has been
      proven in Japanese patients, the benefits of primary prevention are still controversial.

      JPPP is a multicenter, open-label, centrally randomized, controlled trial. In total, 10,000
      elderly patients with one or more CV risk factors (age 60–85 years combined with
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and/or diabetes) will be assigned to enteric-coated aspirin
      (100mg/day) or control. The primary endpoint is composite event of CV death, nonfatal stroke
      (of any cause) and nonfatal myocardial infarction.
