  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that there is no difference in the healing process in those women who have
      a one- or two-layer uterine closure at the time of cesarean delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are recruiting women who are presenting for their first (primary) cesarean delivery. They
      will be randomized to one- or two-layer myometrial closure at the time of their cesarean
      delivery. Ultrasound will be used to serially assess the myometrial thickness and myometrial
      remodeling process.
