  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if giving patients bevacizumab along with the
      chemotherapy drugs oxaliplatin and gemcitabine will improve overall survival.

      In addition, the study will find out what side effects patients may have by taking
      bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and gemcitabine together.

      Design:

        -  A phase II single arm study. All patients receive bevacizumab 10mg/kg and gemcitabine
           1000mg/m2 on day 1 followed by oxaliplatin 100mg/m2 on day 2 of a 14 day cycle.

      Purpose:

        -  The purpose of this study is to find out if giving patients bevacizumab, along with the
           chemotherapy drugs oxaliplatin and gemcitabine, will improve overall survival. In
           addition, the study will find out what side effects patients may have by taking
           bevacizumab, oxaliplatin and gemcitabine together.

      Enrollment:

        -  Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled to the study between the University of
           Oklahoma and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

      Duration:

        -  The study will be conducted over approximately 2 years.

          -  Patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas.

          -  Patients who have recurrent disease post pancreaticoduodenectomy no earlier than 6
             months after resection. Patients with recurrent disease who had completed adjuvant
             therapy in the form of radiation with or without radiosensitizing 5-fluorouracil
             (5-FU) 6 months prior to recurrence may be included.

          -  Signed informed consent/authorization is obtained prior to conducting any study
             specific screening procedures.

          -  No prior chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer

          -  Patient must have measurable disease

          -  Use of effective means of contraception (men and women) in subjects of child-bearing
             potential

          -  Obstructive jaundice must be relieved before inclusion

          -  Adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow function: leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL, absolute
             neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL, platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL, total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 X

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.

          -  Patients who have recurrent disease within 6 months after pancreaticoduodenectomy or
             had received adjuvant therapy within 6 months of disease recurrence.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including:

               -  Active infection

               -  Cardiovascular: New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade II or greater congestive

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day 0, anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of
             the study.

          -  Minor surgical procedures, fine needle aspirations or core biopsies within 7 days
             prior to Day 0

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurological dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurological and other
             adverse events. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain is not needed for
             eligibility and will be done only if the patient presents with symptoms suggestive of
             brain metastases.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents, or have participated
             in any investigational drug study within 28 days preceding start of study treatment.

             pregnant or lactating are excluded.

          -  History of any other malignancy in the last 5 years, except patients with a prior
             history of in situ cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer.
