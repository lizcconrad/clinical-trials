  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-year study proposing to examine the effects of aripiprazole on heart health
      factors such as serum lipids, serum leptin, fasting blood sugar, body weight and blood
      pressure. This study also examines the safety of switching to aripiprazole with respect to
      changes in the clinical state, preexisting or emergent side-effects, how the brain processes
      information and changes in social functioning and quality of life.

      This is a 2-yr study proposing to examine the effects of switching subjects from conventional
      and atypical antipsychotic agents to Aripiprazole on cardiovascular health indices in
      overweight and obese patients with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder. Thirty
      partially remitted patients with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score of less
      than 100, who have body mass index (BMI) of 26 or higher will be switched from their existing
      antipsychotic to aripiprazole over 2-3 weeks period using a clinician determined
      cross-tapering approach.The objective of the study is to examine cardiovascular health
      indices such as serum lipids, serum leptin, fasting blood sugar, body weight and blood
      pressure. This study also examines the safety of switching to Aripiprazole with respect to
      changes in clinical state, preexisting or emergent side-effects, how brain processes
      information and changes in social functioning and quality of life.
