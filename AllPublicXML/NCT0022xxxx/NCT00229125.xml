      The purpose of this study was to evaluate if the medication Gabapentin, which is not approved
      for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, is effective in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal
      syndrome compared to treatment with Lorazepam.

      In the current protocol we evaluated a newer generation anticonvulsant agent, gabapentin.
      Gabapentin does not significantly interact with alcohol or other medications, has no abuse
      potential, and is excreted by the kidneys and not the liver .

      The primary aim of the present application was to evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin in
      comparison to lorazepam (as a benzodiazepine gold standard) for the acute outpatient
      treatment of alcohol withdrawal (AW). In addition, evaluation of the lorazepam “rebound”
      effects observed during the current funding period will be replicated and compared with the
      response to gabapentin. Also, the acoustic startle response was used to evaluate the
      neurobiological effects of the medications on underlying AW-related CNS excitation, both
      during and immediately after AW. In addition, the effect of a history of multiple
      detoxifications on parameters such as withdrawal symptoms, CNS excitability, relapse to
      alcohol use, craving for alcohol, and response to medication treatment was explored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be between 21-70 years of age (both genders will be recruited).

          -  Subjects must meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence and uncomplicated alcohol
             withdrawal syndrome.

          -  Subjects must have a mini-mental state score above 26.

          -  Subjects must be medically stable (not likely to require hospitalization for medical
             complications within 10 days).

          -  Subjects must have a minimum score on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal - - Assessment
             for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) of 10 within 24 hours of initial assessment.

          -  Subjects must be medically acceptable for study treatment. Considerations include no
             past or present physical disorder that is likely to deteriorate during participation.
             No ECG abnormality which would likely worsen during participation and no clinical
             laboratory abnormality that would also suggest deterioration during treatment.

          -  Subjects must exhibit vital signs within the following range: a three-minute sitting
             blood pressure in the range of 90-200 mmHg systolic, 60-120 mmHg diastolic and
             ventricular rates between 56 and 140 beats per minute.

          -  Subjects must be suitable for treatment with oral medications.

          -  Subjects must be able to read, write, and speak English.

          -  Subjects must have a negative urine drug screen for benzodiazepines or other
             sedative-hypnotics, opiates, and stimulants at baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with current (past month) DSM-IV diagnosis of any other substance dependence
             syndrome other than alcohol dependence (excluding nicotine, caffeine, cannabis and
             cocaine dependence).

          -  Use of pharmacological agents within a five half-life period that are known to lower
             the seizure threshold or augment or decrease the alcohol withdrawal syndrome
             (e.g.,tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, some
             centrally-acting antihypertensives such as beta-blockers, alpha-adrenergic agonists,
             and calcium channel antagonists, wellbutrin, buspar, any sedative-hypnotics and
             opiates).

          -  Subjects with a history of idiopathic epilepsy.

          -  Subjects with diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or dementia.

          -  Subjects with liver function tests (AST or ALT) 4 times higher than normal. Serum
             levels will be drawn upon admission to study and study medications terminated if
             necessary.

          -  History of hepatic encephalopathy, jaundice, ascites, insulin dependent diabetes, or
             renal disease.

          -  Females who are pregnant (as determined by a pregnancy test) or nursing.

          -  Subjects with known sensitivity or previous adverse reaction to gabapentin, lorazepam,
             or other benzodiazepines.

          -  History of severe GI disease which might render absorption of the medication difficult
             or produce medical instability of the patient during detoxification which would
             include active peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, regional colitis, or evidence
             by history or physical exam of GI bleeding.

          -  Subjects who decline or who are not competent to give informed consent.
