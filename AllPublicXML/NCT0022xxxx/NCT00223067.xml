        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients must meet all the following inclusion criteria to be considered for admission to
        the trial:

          1. Male or female adult patients aged between 18 and 64 years (inclusive). A female of
             childbearing potential may be enrolled provided she:

               -  has a negative pregnancy test at Screening and

               -  is routinely using adequate contraception prior to and during the study and

               -  agrees not to attempt to become pregnant during the study and

               -  is not lactating A female of non-childbearing potential will be defined as one
                  who has been postmenopausal for at least one year or has been surgically
                  sterilised.

          2. Patients receiving a first renal transplant.

          3. Patients who fulfil the criteria to receive an allogenic renal transplant (according
             to the Eurotransplant (ET) manual on organ allocation and the Bundes√§rztekammer
             allocation criteria) and who are listed on a waiting list.

          4. Patients who, after the nature of the study and the disclosure of their data has been
             explained to them, have freely given Informed Consent in writing.

          5. In vitro demonstration of the suppressive effect of the donor TAIC for the
             donor-recipient pair.

        Exclusion Criteria (for the recipient)

        Exclusion Criteria (for the recipient):

        Patients presenting any of the following exclusion criteria must not be included in the
        trial:

          1. Patients who have received a renal transplant.

          2. Patients who have an active infection at the time of entry into the study (Screening).

          3. Recipient and donor pairs who show the following incompatible EBV or CMV
             constellation: the donor is EBV or CMV positive and the recipient is EBV or CMV
             negative.

          4. Patients and/or donors who have positive evidence of HIV or have active virus
             hepatitis B and C.

          5. Patients with a history of alcohol and/or drug abuse or sepsis.

          6. Patients who are pregnant women or nursing mothers.

          7. Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to one of the immunosuppressives
             administered during the course of the study: ATG, tacrolimus, or steroids
             (prednisolone).

          8. Patients with a history or present symptoms of autoimmune vasculitis.

          9. Detection of &gt; 5% HLA antibodies (all current and historic values).

         10. Patients with a malignancy or history of malignancy.

         11. Patients with renal insufficiency due to a vasculitis.

         12. Patients whose condition requires continuous systemic administration of
             immunosuppressives.

         13. Missing immunosuppressive effect of the donor TAIC for the donor-recipient pair in
             vitro test.

         14. Patients who are simultaneously participating or plan to participate in any other
             clinical study.

         15. Psychiatric or emotional problems or lack of knowledge of the German language which
             would invalidate the giving of Informed Consent or limit the ability of the subject to
             comply with study requirements.

         16. Unwillingness or inability to provide Informed Consent or to participate
             satisfactorily for the entire trial period

         17. Patients with corresponding donors presenting any one of the exclusion criteria
             documented in the Eurotransplant guidelines ( ) must not be included in the trial.
