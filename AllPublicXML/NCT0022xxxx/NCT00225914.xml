      To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Paroxetine treatment in perimenopausal
      and postmenopausal women who present with menopause-related symptoms after discontinuing
      hormone therapy (HT), in the presence or absence of concomitant symptoms of depression or
      anxiety.

      This study is a 10-week double-blinded treatment study of perimenopausal and postmenopausal
      women who present with menopause-related symptoms after discontinuing Hormone Therapy(HT),
      with or without concomitant symptoms of depression and anxiety.

      The menopausal transition is a period of heightened vulnerability to mood and anxiety
      disturbances. It is also a period when women may experience significant vasomotor symptoms
      (i.e. hot flushes and night sweats). More recently, the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms has
      been associated with increased risk for depression in menopausal women.

      The efficacy of estrogens for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms is well established. In
      addition, the literature support a modulatory effect exerted by estrogen on various
      neurotransmitter systems that regulate mood and anxiety.

      Despite the efficacy of hormone therapy (HT) for the treatment of menopause-related symptoms,
      a significant number of women discontinue its use during the first year of treatment.
      Moreover, recent findings from the Women's Health Initiative Study (WHI) have challenged the
      safety and the benefits that were initially thought to be associated with long-term use of
      HT. As a result, many women who have been taking HT decided to discontinue the use of HT,
      which may result in significant changes in their physical well being, quality of life and,
      possibly, their mental health status. Therefore, the efficacy and tolerability of other
      interventions such as antidepressants for these sub-populations warrant further
      investigation.

      Treatment with Paroxetine has shown to be efficacious for menopause-related vasomotor
      symptoms. To date, no studies have examined the extent to which SSRIs may improve physical
      and psychological symptoms in women who discontinued HT.
