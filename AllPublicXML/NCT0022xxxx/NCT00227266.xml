    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center trial to assess safety and efficacy of a combined regimen of oral
      valproic acid (VPA) and carnitine in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) 2 to 17
      years of age. Cohort 1 is a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized intention to treat
      protocol for SMA &quot;sitters&quot; 2 - 8 years of age. Cohort 2 is an open label protocol for SMA
      &quot;standers and walkers&quot; 3 - 17 years of age to explore responsiveness of efficacy outcomes.
      Outcome measures will include blood chemistries, functional testing, pulmonary function
      testing, electrophysiological evaluations, PedsQL quality of life assessment, quantitative
      assessments of survival motor neuron (SMN) mRNA from blood samples, growth and vital sign
      parameters. Six centers will enroll a total of 90 patients.

      This is a multi-center phase II trial of a combined regimen of oral valproic acid (VPA) and
      carnitine in patients with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) 2 to 17 years of age. Cohort 1 is a
      double-blind placebo-controlled randomized intention to treat protocol for SMA &quot;sitters&quot; 2 -
      8 years of age. Subjects will undergo two baseline assessments over 4 to 6 week period, then
      will be randomized to treatment or placebo for the next six months. All subjects will then be
      placed on active treatment for the subsequent six month period. Cohort 2 is an open label
      protocol for SMA &quot;standers and walkers&quot; 3 - 17 years of age to explore responsiveness of
      efficacy outcomes. Subjects will undergo two baseline assessments over a four to six week
      period, followed by one year active treatment with VPA and carnitine. Outcome measures are
      performed every 3 to 6 months, and include blood chemistries, functional testing, pulmonary
      function testing, electrophysiological evaluations, PedsQL quality of life assessment,
      quantitative assessments of survival motor neuron (SMN) mRNA from blood samples, growth and
      vital sign parameters. Six centers will enroll a total of 90 patients.

        <description>The maximum Compound Motor Action Potential (CMAP) is a measurement obtained through EMG testing that is associated with disease progression. In this study, we measure the maximum CMAP by stimulating one nerve in the hand and measuring the response of the muscle. This is done multiple times, the outcome used is the highest peak, or response observed.</description>

        <description>The maximum Compound Motor Action Potential (CMAP) area is a measurement obtained through EMG testing that is associated with disease progression. In this study, we measure the maximum CMAP by stimulating one nerve in the hand and measuring the response of the muscle. This procedure is repeated multiple times. The maximum area is the response that results in the largest area under the response curve.</description>
