    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of a 3 weekly regimen
      containing irinotecan combined with capecitabine in the setting of relapsed or refractory
      upper gastrointestinal tumours. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma
      or squamous cell carcinoma originating from the oesophagus, oesophagogastric junction or
      stomach who have previously received chemotherapy and have either failed to respond or who
      have relapsed within 3 months after an initial response will be eligible for treatment in
      this study.

      The response rate, failure-free survival and overall survival of treated patients will be
      evaluated. Toxicity and quality of life will also be monitored closely.
