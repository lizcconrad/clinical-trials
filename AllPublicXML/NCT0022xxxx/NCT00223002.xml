    <textblock>
      Infection after epidural catheter placement is fortunately rare. When it does happen, the
      affected person can become seriously ill.

      This study examines which skin disinfectant, chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine, decreases the
      number of bacteria that can be grown from the skin washed with each disinfectant prior to
      placing an epidural catheter for pain control in labour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of chlorhexidine for skin asepsis for the placement of intravascular catheters is
      known to decrease the incidence of central line colonization and blood stream infection when
      compared to the use of povidone-iodine. While the development of an infectious complication
      following spinal or epidural analgesia, such as epidural abscess or meningitis, is
      fortunately rare, when it does happen, there can be devastating consequences for the affected
      individual. The low frequency of infection makes a trial with an endpoint of clinical
      infection not feasible, however a reduction in skin and needle contamination following
      attempts at asepsis should reduce the risk of infectious complication. Ongoing work by the
      authors is examining the skin culture rates following randomized standardized skin
      disinfection. The purpose of this randomized trial is to compare needle culture rates to
      further assess effectiveness of skin disinfection following a standardized skin preparation
      with either povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine in pregnant women requesting lumbar epidural
      pain relief in labour.
