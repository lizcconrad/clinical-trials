    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      the use of a sling device in women for stress and mixed urinary incontinence as well as
      vaginal vault prolapse.

    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine and can affect both men and women
      throughout their lives. Women are more likely to develop incontinence as a result of
      pregnancy and childbirth. There are approximately 11 million cases of incontinence in the US
      contributing to several different types of incontinence including :

        -  Urge - 30% of the market

        -  Stress - 30% of the market of which 85% are women

        -  Combination urge and stress - 40%

      Despite advances in behavioral therapy, pharmacological advances as well as development of
      minimally invasive surgical procedures, only one out of every twelve people affected actually
      seek help.

      Prolapse

      Globally, approximately 1 million women suffer uterovaginal prolapse annually and this
      condition can be associated with urinary incontinence. The breakdown of treatments for
      uterovaginal prolapse includes:

        -  20% - no treatment

        -  20% - non surgical management (pessary)

        -  60% - receive a surgical procedure of a suture repair or mesh repair

      There were greater than 600,000 surgeries performed globally to treat prolapse. These numbers
      are projected to increase due to rapid, easy, and less costly methods as well as new products
      that facilitate the easier procedures.
