      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of high and moderate intensity
      exercise training after coronary bypass surgery. The subjects are randomised to training at
      either 60-70% or 85-95% of their maximal capacity daily for four weeks. Primary outcome
      measure is change in maximal aerobic capacity, measured as change in maximal oxygen
      consumption, after the training period. Secondary outcome measures are change in quality of
      life, heart rate variability, ultrasound measures of the heart and blood variables, including
      endothelian markers.

      The exercise part of cardiac rehabilitation today is often composed of low to moderate
      intensity training. Several studies have found interval training with high intensity to be
      more effective in improving physical capacity in healthy subjects and also in different
      patient populations. We therefore wish to compare high intensity interval training with
      moderate intensity training in patients operated with coronary bypass surgery. Maximal oxygen
      consumption is shown to be the best indicator of how many years you life, both in healthy
      persons and in cardiac patients.

      The subjects in this study is attending a four week rehabilitation program at an residential
      institution in Norway. They are randomised to do either a moderate or a high intensity
      aerobic training session each day.

      The hypothesis in advance, was that high intensity interval training lead to a greater
      improvement in maximal oxygen consumption than training with moderate intensity. We also
      hypothesised that there would be no difference between the two groups after 6 months, since
      then the patients had to administer their own exercise training.
