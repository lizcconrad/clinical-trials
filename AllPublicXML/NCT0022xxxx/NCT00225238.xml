      The high incidence for colon cancer make it an ideal target for screening. In the United
      Staes there are approximately 100,00 new cases of colon cancer yearly. Typically the
      progression from polyps to cancer requires years. This permits a screening procedure to
      identify polyps befoere they are cancerous. Colon cleansing is required prior to colonoscopy.
      The gastrointestinal syptoms associted with colonic preps are common and oftn assoicated
      wwith upper gastrointestinal disorders including GERD, non-ulcer syspepsia, and gastric
      dysmotoility such as gastropareesis.
