      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical cure rate of ceftobiprole medocaril (the
      water-soluble prodrug [form] of ceftobiprole) referred to as ceftobiprole versus a comparator
      in the treatment of patients with nosocomial pneumonia.

    <textblock>
      Ceftobiprole medocaril (the water-soluble prodrug [form] of ceftobiprole) referred to as
      ceftobiprole is a cephalosporin antibiotic with anti-MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant
      Staphylococcus Aureus) activity. Ceftobiprole is not yet approved for the treatment of
      nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia. This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter
      study of ceftobiprole versus a comparator (linezolid plus ceftazidime) to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of ceftobiprole in patients with nosocomial pneumonia. The patients
      will be randomized to ceftobiprole plus placebo or the comparator. The primary endpoint is
      the clinical cure rate of ceftobiprole at the test-of-cure visit. The patients will receive
      either ceftobiprole plus placebo or the comparator for 7 to 14 days (unless extended at
      discretion of medical monitor). Patient safety will be monitored throughout the study. In
      December 2006, this study (BAP00248) and another similar study (BAP00307, see NCT00210964)
      were amended (changed) to create 1 study (BAP00248/307).Therefore, the results reported for
      this study will be combined with the results reported for study BAP00248 Patients will
      receive either ceftobiprole plus placebo or a comparator by intravenous infusion for 7 to 14
      days (unless extended at discretion of medical monitor).
