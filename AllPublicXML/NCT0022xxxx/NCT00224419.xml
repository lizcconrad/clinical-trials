  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine dependence has not been sufficiently addressed in current state-of-the-science
      cessation interventions for pregnant smokers. The weight of the evidence from the general
      population of smokers suggests that nicotine replacement therapies may be beneficial
      cessation aids for pregnant smokers who are unable to stop smoking. The tremendous potential
      of these therapies for promoting smoking cessation among pregnant women creates a pressing
      need for decision tools and protocols to encourage treatment adherence that is essential for
      rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of OTC NRT when provided as part of prenatal care.
      The results of this research could be directly translated to the improvement of obstetrical
      care providers' clinical practices. Medically supervised use of OTC NRT by pregnant smokers
      is an alternative to continued smoking that has the potential to substantially increase rates
      of smoking cessation during pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed five-year study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of providing
      over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy, choice of gum, lozenge or patch, (NRT)
      to promote prepartum smoking cessation. Proposed is a two-arm design. Eligible pregnant women
      (N=300) will be randomized to either: Arm 1, Tailored Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (TCBT,
      n=100) that provides women with customized risk information about smoking and nicotine, the
      potential harms to the fetus and encouragement of appropriate behavioral skills building; or
      Arm 2, TCBT + NRT - the tailored intervention incorporating NRT information plus choice of
      patch or gum (n=200). The intervention will include 5 face-to-face contacts as part of
      prenatal visits and 1 telephone counseling session. Primary outcome measures will be
      biochemically validated 7-day prevalent abstinence rates at the 19-27th and 29-37th week of
      pregnancy. Secondary outcomes will include 7-day prevalent abstinence rates at 12 weeks
      postpartum, serious quit attempts, compliance with NRT, and use of materials. Saliva cotinine
      will be measured among all women at baseline, the 27-35th week of pregnancy, and 12 weeks
      postpartum. The significance of this project is that it relies on transdisciplinary
      collaborations to extend the science in nicotine replacement therapies to a population that
      could derive substantial health benefits. Moreover, the study results have immediate
      potential to inform clinical recommendations for integrating nicotine replacement into
      prenatal care.

    <description>Participants in this arm received a tailored CBT (TCBT) intervention that included: a written self-help guide, feedback about the importance of reducing nicotine exposure to the fetus, 5 face to face and 1 telephone counseling session.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Women in this arm received the TCBT described in Arm 1, plus their choice of NRT. To minimize fetal exposure to nicotine for women in the TCBT+NRT arm, the dose of NRT are customized to the woman's current level of smoking. Women who smoke 5-10 cigarettes a day will be given the 14 mg patch or instructed to use one 2 mg lozenge or 2 mg piece of gum to replace each cigarette she usually smokes per day. Those who smoke 11 cigarettes or more per day will be given the 21 mg patch or instructed to use no more than one lozenge (2 mg) or piece of gum (2 mg) to replace each cigarette she usually smokes per day, not to exceed 15 lozenges or pieces of gum per day.</description>

    <description>All participants received a tailored CBT (TCBT) intervention that included: a written self-help guide, info about the importance of reducing nicotine exposure to the fetus, 5 face to face and 1 telephone counseling session. Women in the TCBT + NRT arm were guided through a process of deciding on nicotine gum, lozenge or patch. To minimize fetal exposure, the dose of NRT was customized to the woman's current level of smoking. Women who smoked 5-10 cigarettes a day were given the 14 mg patch or instructed to use one 2 mg lozenge or 2 mg piece of gum to replace each cigarette she usually smoked per day.
