  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution Phase II study for patients with unresectable Stage IIIA and
      IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. The treatment started with 2 cycles of gemcitabine and
      carboplatin followed by concurrent chemotherapy with radiation. The chemoradiation included
      using paclitaxel and carboplatin with daily thoracic radiation to a total dose of 74 Gy.
      Response rate was determined following the chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin and
      evaluated again after the chemoradiation. Treatment toxicities were also assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial we adopted the approach of using both induction and concurrent chemotherapy
      together with Thoracic Radiation Therapy (TRT) planned conformally to a tumor dose of 74 Gy.
      Substitution of gemcitabine for paclitaxel in the induction chemotherapy allowed us to
      evaluate the impact of RRM1 expression on the activity of this agent. The expression of
      Ribonucleotide Reductase, M1 Subunit (RRM1) was evaluated prior to initiation of therapy,
      following induction chemotherapy but prior to concurrent chemoradiation, and following
      completion of all therapy by CT-guided core needle biopsies. This is a single institution
      phase II clinical trial, of induction treatment with gemcitabine and carboplatin followed by
      concurrent chemoradiation using paclitaxel and carboplatin and daily thoracic radiation to a
      total dose of 74 Gy for patients with unresectable Stage IIIA and IIIB NSCLC. The specific
      clinical objectives of this study are as follows: To determine the response rate (both CT
      scan and PET scan assessment) to two cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and
      carboplatin; To determine the response rate (both CT scan and PET scan assessment) to
      concurrent thoracic radiation and weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin; To evaluate the patterns
      of local and distant failure for patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by
      concurrent chemoradiation according to this regimen; To estimate the median, 1 year, and
      overall survival; To assess acute and long term toxicities of treatment.
