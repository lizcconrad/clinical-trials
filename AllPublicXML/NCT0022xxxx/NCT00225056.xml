  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II study, we plan to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of weekly
      docetaxel and capecitabine on a 21-day cycle followed by maintenance single agent
      capecitabine for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, Based on the efficacy and
      toxicity of the combination regimen dosages previously reviewed; weekly docetaxel 30mg/m2 on
      days 1 and 8 plus capecitabine 1600mg/m2 (800mg/m2 orally twice daily)on day 1 through 14 of
      each cycle will be utilized.
