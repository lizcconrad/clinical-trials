      This protocol is for a clinical trial evaluating the clinical success of root canal therapy
      performed on teeth with chronic apical periodontitis of pulpal origin with either large or
      small apical root canal preparation techniques.

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will compare the clinical success of two commonly used
      techniques for performing non-surgical endodontic procedures on teeth with chronic apical
      periodontitis of pulpal origin. The first method, termed the &quot;GT method&quot; uses a commercially
      available rotary file system to instrument the root canal systems from the crown to the
      apical portion of the root. After completion of this technique, the apical portion of the
      root is prepared to the same standardized ISO size #20 in all roots (i.e., 0.2 mm
      cross-sectional diameter). The second method, termed the &quot;Lightspeed method&quot; uses a different
      commercially available rotary file system to shape the root canal systems from the apical to
      the crown portion of the root. After completion of this technique, the apical preparation is
      often larger in cross-sectional diameter than that observed after the GT method; however, an
      equally important distinction is that the Lightspeed method customizes the final
      cross-sectional diameter for each root canal system, and thus each root has a similar
      enlargement of apical preparation size due to proportionate removal of infected dentin at the
      end of the root. Although the Lightspeed method may result in reduced bacteria in the apical
      portion of root canal systems, there is no evidence to date that this effect improves
      clinical success rates. This study will test the hypothesis that the larger apical
      preparation size produced by the Lightspeed instrumentation system will produce a higher
      percentage of clinically successful treatments of teeth with apical periodontitis (AP) as
      compared to the GT method
