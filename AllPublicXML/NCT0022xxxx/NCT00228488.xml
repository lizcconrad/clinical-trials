  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two different patient populations will be targeted for this study. The first population (SP1)
      will include patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancers, excluding salivary
      gland carcinomas. The second population (SP2) will include treatment-naïve patients with
      locally advanced squamous cell head and neck cancer (SCHNC).

      SP1 will be treated with palliative intent and the patients can be treatment-naïve or have
      received prior chemotherapy. Study treatment will consist of Iressa (gefitinib) alone.

      SP2 will be treated with radical intent. The patients must be treatment-naïve and study
      treatment will consist of induction Iressa for 3 weeks followed by a combination of Iressa
      plus cisplatin and concurrent irradiation.
