      Radiation therapy is an important part of the treatment for lung cancer when treatment intent
      is for cure. Radiation is a local modality of treatment, that is, it only treats the area
      that the radiation can target. Therefore it is critical to be able to visualize all the areas
      of tumor involvement. With current imaging tests such as computed tomography scans (CT), the
      scans may not be sensitive enough to detect all areas of cancer involvement but with newer
      imaging tests, such as positron emission tomography (PET), the investigators may be able to
      better target all the tumor that the CT scan may miss. There are two clinical trials being
      conducted by the Ontario Clinical Oncology Group (OCOG)looking at PET in lung cancer. This
      proposal is a companion study to the OCOG PET lung trials. In brief, this study will evaluate
      the ability of CT alone versus combined PET CT imaging to determine the size of the tumor (or
      gross tumor volume) along with the tiny extensions of cancer cells (or microscopic
      extension). The gross tumor volume and its extension as determined by CT or PET CT will then
      be compared to measurements made on the surgically removed tumor. Treatment with radiation
      therapy must include all the gross tumor and its extension in order to be successful for
      cure. If the radiation treatment does not treat all the identified tumor then the chance for
      cure is lost. There have only been two previous reports of the ability of CT to determine the
      gross tumor volume and its extension. There are no similar reports using PET CT. This study
      will be the first of its kind to evaluate how accurate PET CT can be in detecting the gross
      tumor and its microscopic extension using the surgically removed tumor measurements as the
      gold standard. If PET CT is able to more accurately determine the tumor volume including its
      microscopic extension, then this will help oncologists to better treat lung cancer using more
      accurate radiation treatment volumes.

      Radiation therapy is an important component in the curative treatment of non-small cell lung
      cancer. Targeting of the gross tumor has been facilitated by the use of CT simulation
      allowing for more accurate delineation of the tumor. In addition multi-modality imaging
      combining functional and anatomical information have allowed for further refinement in the
      treatment planning process with significant impact on the planning target volume due to the
      addition of PET imaging information. PET using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) allows for more
      precise detection of tumor since it is a functional image based on glucose metabolism rather
      than structural abnormalities. Biochemical changes often precede any gross anatomical
      abnormalities, therefore making PET a very powerful imaging modality. FDG PET has been shown
      to be more sensitive and specific than CT in the staging of NSCLC.Radical radiation therapy
      is indicated for early stage NSCLC when the patient is medically inoperable primarily due to
      co-morbidities. In contrast for locally advanced NSCLC, radical radiation is used as part of
      induction therapy or in the definitive treatment of NSCLC. In order to avoid a geographical
      miss with precision radiation therapy, the gross tumor volume (GTV) is outlined and a margin
      around the GTV is added to incorporate microscopic extension of disease, also known as the
      clinical target volume (CTV). Standard margins of 1.0 to 1.5 cm are used to encompass the
      gross tumor, microscopic extent and treatment setup uncertainties.There is surprisingly very
      little data on what constitutes an adequate margin to encompass the microscopic extent around
      the gross lung tumor. Studies involving conformal radiation therapy and dose escalation in
      NSCLC have primarily used an empirical margin to define the CTV. A literature review revealed
      only two studies evaluating the ability of CT to define the gross tumor and its microscopic
      extension correlated with histopathological measurements [P Giraud et al 2000, R Chan et al
      2001]. The two studies have produced conflicting results with recommended margins being from
      zero mm to 6-8 mm around the GTV. There have been no studies evaluating the ability of PET to
      define the size of the gross tumor and its microscopic extension.This is a companion study to
      the two OCOG PET trials in NSCLC. It will evaluate the ability of CT alone versus PET CT to
      define the gross tumor and its microscopic extension. The methodology will be based on
      contouring the GTV with imaging modalities of CT and PET CT and correlating the findings with
      histopathology.This proposed study will add new information on the ability of combined PET CT
      to determine the microscopic extension of tumor in NSCLC. While no imaging modality can
      detect microscopic extension, the newer technology of PET CT may give better resolution over
      CT alone in the detection of tumor. The strength of this proposal is the required correlation
      with pathological findings. If PET CT is able to accurately determine the extent of disease,
      this will have major implications on treatment volumes and subsequent targeting for radiation
      therapy using 3D conformal radiation therapy.
