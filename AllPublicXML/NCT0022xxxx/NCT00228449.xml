      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple intravenous doses of peginesatide in participants with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on hemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, sequential, dose-finding trial designed with up
      to 12 treatment cohorts of 15 participants per cohort. Each participant received an
      intravenous dose of peginesatide administered once every 4 weeks (Q4W) for a total of 6
      doses. Dosage regimens varied by cohort. Participants were followed for a minimum of 42 days
      after the last administration of peginesatide.

             for at least 4 weeks prior to study start, and must be willing to continue
             contraception until at least 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. A highly
             effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate
             (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as implants,
             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual
             abstinence (only acceptable if practiced as a life-style and not acceptable if one who

             8 weeks prior to study drug administration. In the last 3 weeks prior to study drug
             administration, variation in prescribed total weekly dose must be ≤ 25% from the mean
             of the last three prescribed total weekly doses;

          -  Three mid- or end-of-week hemoglobin values of ≥ 10.0 and ≤ 12.5 g/dL in the 3 weeks

             values;

             100 mm Hg on repeat readings);

          -  Any history of multiple significant drug allergies;

          -  History of severe or unstable reactive airway disease within the previous 10 years;

          -  Epileptic seizure in the 6 months prior to screening;

          -  Chronic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class IV);

          -  High likelihood of early withdrawal or interruption of the study (e.g., myocardial
             infarction, severe or unstable coronary artery disease, stroke, respiratory,
             autoimmune, neuropsychiatric, or neurological abnormalities, liver disease including
             active hepatitis B or C, active HIV disease, or any other clinically significant
             medical disease or conditions in the prior 6 months that may, in the Investigator's
             opinion, interfere with assessment or follow-up of the patient);

          -  Evidence of malignancy within the past 5 years (except non-melanoma skin cancer which
             is not an exclusion criterion);
