    <textblock>
      This randomized study will test a behavioral intervention, based on social cognitive theory
      (SCT), to improve regimen adherence in three different groups of people with type 2 diabetes;
      (1) those with well controlled blood glucoses and no concurrent chronic renal insufficiency,
      (2) those with less well-controlled glucoses and no chronic renal insufficiency, and (3)
      those with chronic renal insufficiency regardless of glucose control. The primary aims of
      this study are to: (1)determine whether the intervention improves behavioral adherence to the
      diabetes self-management regimen including dietary adherence, physical activity, and
      capillary glucose self-monitoring; (2)determine whether the intervention improves clinical
      outcomes; (3) explore the extent to which self-efficacy is a mediator of adherence,(4)
      explore the extent to which the effectiveness of the intervention varies with respect to
      glycemic control and nephrovascular complications at baseline, and (5)explore the impact of a
      variety of covariates on the effectiveness of the intervention.

      Hypothesis #1 is that intervention group participants will perform better than attention
      control group participants on various measures of adherence to the diabetes management
      regimen. Primary adherence variables will be dietary intake, and physical activity.
      Hypothesis #2 is that intervention group participants will have lower HbA1c levels than
      attention control group participants.

      This randomized study, the ENHANCE Study (Enhancing Adherence to Diabetes Self-Management)
      will test a behavioral intervention, based on social cognitive theory (SCT), to improve
      regimen adherence in three different groups of people with type 2 diabetes; (1) HbA1c &lt; 8%
      and no concurrent chronic renal insufficiency, (2) HbA1c&gt;8% and no chronic renal
      insufficiency, and (3) those with evidence of chronic renal insufficiency regardless of
      glucose control.

      The primary aims of this study are to:

        1. . Determine whether the intervention improves behavioral adherence to the diabetes
           self-management regimen including: 1.a. dietary adherence, as measured by self-report
           using dietary recalls and the Nutrient Data System, 1.b. physical activity as measured
           by the CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire as well as pedometer readings, and 1.c.
           adherence to capillary glucose self-monitoring as assessed by the FreeStyle monitor.

        2. . Determine whether the intervention improves clinical outcome measures including: 2.a.
           glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c), 2.b. weight loss, 2.c. anthropometrics.

        3. . Explore the extent to which self-efficacy is a mediator of adherence.

        4. . Explore the extent to which the effectiveness of the intervention varies with respect
           to glycemic control and nephrovascular complications at baseline.

        5. . Explore the impact of a variety of covariates (medications, depression, social
           support, severity of disease, and general health and sociodemographic characteristics,
           clinic from which they were recruited, health literacy, and trust in research) on the
           effectiveness of the intervention.

      Hypothesis #1 is that intervention group participants will perform better than attention
      control group participants on various measures of adherence to the diabetes management
      regimen. Primary behavioral adherence variables will be dietary intake, and physical
      activity. Hypothesis #2 is that intervention group participants will have lower HbA1c levels
      than attention control group participants.

      The 6-month intervention includes group classes, held weekly during months 1&amp;2, biweekly
      during months 3&amp;4, and monthly during month 5&amp;6. Classes focus on building a sense of mastery
      over the diabetes regimen and features the use of PDA-base dietary self-monitoring.
      Intervention group participants are compared to an attention care group, that receives
      monthly contacts. Measurements are made at baseline, 3, and 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria: Study subjects will include those with: type 2 diabetes mellitus
        defined according to the 1997 ADA criteria and age of 18 years or greater. We will sample
        from three different patient populations: (1) 96 individuals who have HbA1c &lt; 8%, and no
        evidence of chronic renal insufficiency (a serum creatinine &lt;1.3mg/dl for women and
        &lt;1.5mg/dl for men). (2) 96 individuals with HbA1c &gt; 8%, and no evidence of chronic renal
        insufficiency, and (3) 96 individuals with evidence of chronic renal insufficiency (a serum
        creatinine &gt;1.3mg/dl for women and &gt;1.5mg/dl for men, but who have not yet progressed to
        dialysis), regardless of HbA1c level.

        Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria were selected to enhance safety and ability to
        complete the study protocol. They include: (1) history of hypoglycemic coma/seizure within
        the last 12 months, (2) hypoglycemia requiring 3rd party assistance within the last 3
        months, (3) history consistent with type 1 diabetes, (4) unwillingness to do capillary
        blood testing using the FreeStyle monitor, (5) unwillingness or inability to participate in
        scheduled group classes or individual counseling sessions, (7) subjects currently on renal
        dialysis, (8) any factors likely to preclude adherence to the study protocol including
        dementia, alcohol or substance abuse, plan to move within the next 8 months, lack of
        support from the subject's primary health care provider (i.e. PCP is aware of significant
        risks such as extreme variation in blood glucoses and/or comorbidities that would make
        participation in the study unsafe), failure to obtain informed consent from the
        participant, current participation in another clinical trial, and (9) subjects who are not
        available by telephone during the hours of 8am to 6pm.
