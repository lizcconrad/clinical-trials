  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore carrier and infection status of T.tonsurans tinea capitis and characterize the
      host-pathogen interaction as it relates to the disease presentation. The general hypothesis
      for this study is as follows: the type of genotypic and phenotypic variant to which a child
      is exposed accounts for the presentation status observed in Trichophyton tonsurans
      infection.The global outcome of this investigation is to reveal potential new drug targets
      designed to improve treatment outcomes in these children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinea capitis is an overwhelmingly prevalent disease of childhood estimated to be present in
      approximately 1 in 20 children at any point in time with an equal number of children serving
      as carriers of the fungal pathogen. Despite the widespread nature of the disease, the natural
      course of the infection remains incompletely described. The study will be driven by the
      following hypothesis: the type of genotypic and phenotypic variant to which a child is
      exposed accounts for the presentation status observed in Trichophyton tonsurans infection.

      A fungal scalp culture will be acquired from all participants using a brush culture
      technique. Samples will be collected once a month over a two year time period.
