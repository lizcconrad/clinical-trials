    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of capecitabine and oxaliplatin in the
      1st, 2nd or subsequent line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and also in the
      neo-adjuvant and adjuvant setting of resectable metastases.

      Primary Endpoint: Objective response rates

      Secondary Endpoints: Treatment related toxicity Progression free survival (If not resected)
      Disease free Survival (From metastastectomy, if resected) Overall Survival 60 Day all cause
      mortality Number undergoing liver resections/curative resection (Ro) rate
