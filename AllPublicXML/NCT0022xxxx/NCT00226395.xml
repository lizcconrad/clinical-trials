  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of two doses of
      oxymorphone immediate release (IR) compared to placebo and oxycodone in post-surgical pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following abdominal surgery and after sufficient washout from post-surgical analgesia,
      patients were randomized to one of the following four treatment groups; 1) oxymorphone IR 10
      mg, 2) oxymorphone IR 20 mg, 3) oxycodone IR 15 mg, or 4) placebo. Total duration of
      treatment was 48 hours. Patients were required to take the study medication every 4-6 hours.
      After the first dose, periodic pain assessments were performed for the first six hours.
      Subsequently, patients were required to assess their current pain intensity and average pain
      intensity since the last dose of study medication just prior to every dose.
