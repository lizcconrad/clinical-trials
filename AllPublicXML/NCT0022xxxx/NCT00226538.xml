  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CYP2C9, is one of the major drug metabolism enzymes accounting for about 20% of the hepatic
      cytochrome P450 content and being second only to CYP3A4.

      The proposed study will explore different possible drug interactions with CYP2C9 substrates
      by evaluating the effect of prototype inducers and inhibitors on the phenotypic trait
      measurement. It is expected that the identification of drugs that might interact with CYP2C9
      substrates will be used to rationalize future drug interaction studies designed to evaluate
      the actual magnitude of effect and its clinical implications. This approach should be
      particularly useful when applied to those CYP2C9 drugs characterized by a narrow therapeutic
      index (i.e. warfarin).

      This study will consist of three study periods separated from each other by a two weeks
      washout period. In the course of the study the subjects will receive in a double blind,
      crossover fashion, rifampin 300 mg. twice daily, diclofenac 50 mg twice daily. and
      fluconazole 200 mg. twice daily, each for one week. All drugs will be administered as
      identical looking tablets that will be prepared at the pharmacy of the Hadassah University
      Hospital and their order of administration will be randomized.On the day prior to, on day 6
      of and 7 days following each drug period, the activity of CYP2C9 will be evaluated by the
      administration of a single phenytoin 300 mg. dose. The subjects will be requested to collect
      their urine for 24 hours and a single blood sample will be obtained 12 hours post phenytoin
      intake.
