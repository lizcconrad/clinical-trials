  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has been popularized as a simple,
      effective and cheap treatment achieving 50-70% symptomatic patency rates in patients with
      peripheral occlusive disease.. However, the fact remains that the indication for performing
      PTA are still more based on opinions than on scientific data.

      The purpose of the trial was to randomize patients primarily referred for intermittent
      claudication into two groups: One group was offered conservative treatment; the other group
      was offered conservative treatment combined with PTA.

      Primary outcome: The patient quality of life. Secondary outcome:Pain-free walking distance;
      pain-score; death; amputation; changes in relevant biomarkers
