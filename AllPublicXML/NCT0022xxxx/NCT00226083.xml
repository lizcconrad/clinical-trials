    <textblock>
      We are studying if sickle cell disease blood platelets are larger than normal and how they
      may cause obstruction of blood vessels. We are also trying to study the reasons why large
      platelets are found in patients with sickle cell disease.

      Research volunteers are seen in the Outpatient Research Center by the Principal Investigator
      or another physician. A detailed history is obtained, a physical examination is performed,
      and blood (usually 4 tablespoons) is obtained for additional tests. The research volunteer's
      previous medical records will be requested. Upto 5 additional blood samples may be obtained
      in a subgroup of patients.
