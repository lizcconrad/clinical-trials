      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of a 2 weekly regimen
      containing irinotecan combined with leucovorin-modified 5-fluorouracil in the setting of
      relapsed or refractory upper gastrointestinal tumours. Patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic adenocarcinoma originating from the oesophagogastric junction, stomach or pancreas
      who have previously received chemotherapy and have either failed to respond or who have
      relapsed after an initial response will be eligible for treatment in this study.

      The response rate, failure-free survival and overall survival of treated patients with the
      two different regimes will be evaluated. Toxicity and quality of life will also be monitored
      closely.
