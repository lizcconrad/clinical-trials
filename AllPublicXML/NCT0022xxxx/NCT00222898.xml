  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assist with early and accurate diagnosis of cancer in
      pancreatic cysts based on the analysis of DNA obtained by endoscopic ultrasound guided fine
      needle aspiration

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study of pancreatic diseases is hindered by the organ's deep seated location and
      especially lack of symptoms during the early stages of disease development and progression
      e.g. pancreatic cancer. This is particularly true of pancreatic cysts, the variety and the
      malignant potential of which encompass a broad spectrum. The radiological features
      distinguishing a benign from a pre-malignant to a frankly malignant cyst in the pancreas are
      frequently underwhelming and have lead to the clinical practice of sampling all but the most
      obvious. The yield of the aspirate in turn is frequently not of a quality upon which a
      clinical decision can be based.

      Most would agree that the best approach for management of pancreatic cystic neoplasm lies in
      early diagnosis, ideally at a precancerous stage. The effectiveness and applicability of this
      study is the based on the ability of the cyst DNA analysis to stratify the patients at risk
      of developing pancreatic cancer based on the extent of accumulated mutational damage.
