      Bipolar affective disorder is a medical illness with substantial morbidity and mortality.
      Further fueling the severity of this illness is the substantial co-occurrence with substance
      abuse that together poses an enormous public health problem.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of divaproex sodium (DVPX) vs. olanzapine (ZYP) vs. for
      alcohol relapse prevention and secondary mood stabilization. Bipolar patients who are
      actively drinking will be randomized to either Depakote ER ® (flexible dose schedule up to
      2500 mg) or Zyprexa® (flexible dose schedule up to 20 mg). Adjunctive benzodiazepine will be
      utilized for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and as an adjunct anxiolytic during the
      early titration of DVPX and ZYP. Patients who, after 2 weeks, have stabilized will continue
      in the prophylaxis study which will last up to 46 weeks. Flexible dose scheduling and
      adjunctive antidepressant treatment as clinically indicated will be done to maximize
      tolerability, treatment compliance, and mood stability.

      The primary outcome measure will be alcohol abuse relapse which will be defined, a priori, as
      5 drinks in a 24 hour period. Patients who have a relapse as such defined will be terminated
      from the study. Secondary alcohol outcome measures (i.e. number of drinking days, % drinking
      days per month, standard drinks per drinking occasion, craving) will be assessed through the
      time-line follow-back method. Secondary outcome measures of mood stabilization (major mood
      relapse and adjunctive medication) will be assessed by prospective life charting.
