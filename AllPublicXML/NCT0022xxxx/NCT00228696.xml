      The Late Effects Study is being conducted in order to answer scientific questions and to
      serve as a resource for Wilms tumor patients and their families. Patients must have been
      enrolled on the NWTS-5 protocol in order to be eligible for this study.

      The Late Effects Study is being conducted in order to answer scientific questions and to
      serve as a resource for Wilms tumor patients and their families. Although most people in this
      study enjoy good health, some may be at risk for certain health conditions. We are collecting
      information from as many participants as possible in order to determine if they or their
      offspring are at risk for adverse medical conditions. If there is more than one case of Wilms
      tumor in a given family, we plan to work with geneticists to try to estimate heritability and
      recurrence risks.
