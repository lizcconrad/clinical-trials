  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is for a clinical trial to evaluate the reliability of the bite fork as a
      diagnostic instrument in subjects with pulpal necrosis and apical periodontitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial consists of two parts. We will first use the bite fork in normal
      volunteers to evaluate its test-retest and inter-rater reliability. We will then use the bite
      fork in subjects with differing endodontic diagnoses and compare these results with the
      standard clinical diagnostic test (percussion).
