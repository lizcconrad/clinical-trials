  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A long-term low carbohydrate, high monounsaturated fat diet, compared to a high carbohydrate,
      low glycemic index diet, results in more rapid progression of diabetes; i.e. increased
      fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin, reduced beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity
      and increased free fatty acids. The deleterious effects of a high carbohydrate diet on plasma
      lipids are only temporary and do not persist beyond 6 months. A long-term high carbohydrate,
      low glycemic index diet, compared to a high carbohydrate, high glycemic index diet, improves
      glycemic control and beta-cell function
