  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The abuse of alcohol is especially common in people with bipolar disorder. However, very
      little is known about the pharmacotherapy of people with both bipolar disorder and alcohol
      abuse/dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine if alcohol use and cravings are
      decreased with quetiapine add-on therapy compared to placebo and to determine if quetiapine
      add-on therapy is associated with greater improvement in mood, impulsivity, functioning and
      decreased alcohol use than placebo.

      Experimental: After obtaining informed consent, 100 patients with bipolar I, or II disorders
      and alcohol abuse/dependence confirmed by a structured clinical interview (SCID) will be
      enrolled. from referral sources in the community we have developed over the past 3 years. A
      medical history and physical examination, including an eye exam with an ophthalmoscope, will
      also be performed at baseline to rule out serious medical illnesses and cataracts. Baseline
      labs including a liver panel and CBC will be obtained. Women of child-bearing potential will
      be given a urine pregnancy test. Baseline measures of psychiatric symptoms will be assessed
      with the HRSD, YMRS, and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Alcohol cravings will be assessed with
      the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). Alcohol use including number of drinks/2
      weeks, days used in the past two weeks, and days of heavy use will be obtained as will a
      urine drug/alcohol screen. Alcohol use and cravings will also be recorded throughout the
      study. Side-effects will be assessed with a general side effects scale, the Abnormal
      Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), and Barnes Akathesia Rating
      Scale (BARS). GGT levels will also be repeated at weeks 6 and 12. The subjects will be
      randomized and receive quetiapine or identical appearing placebo add-on therapy in a
      double-blind fashion for 12 weeks. Subjects will return every two weeks for reevaluation with
      the above outcome measures and for upward titration of study drug. All subjects will be given
      the option of receiving open-label quetiapine for an additional 4 weeks (with continuing
      assessment of mood and alcohol use/cravings every 2 weeks) at the end of the study or
      discontinuing medication.
