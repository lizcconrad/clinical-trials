      Safety Study in subjects with Parkinson's Disease

    <textblock>
      In a patient with Parkinson's disease, the part of the brain called the substantia nigra
      progressively loses the ability to send dopamine signals to the striatum.

      To compensate for the loss of striatal dopamine, most patients take L-dopa, an approved drug
      which is converted to dopamine by an essential enzyme - AADC.

      With time, however, the brain loses its remaining ability to convert L-dopa to dopamine and
      thus the drug becomes progressively less effective.

      In the therapy being studied, the gene coding for the enzyme that converts L-dopa to dopamine
      (AADC) is inserted into a common, non-pathogenic virus (AAV) to which &gt; 90% of humans have
      been exposed.

      The AAV will help to transport the AADC into the brain cells.

      AAV-hAADC-2, the investigational drug being studied, is injected into the striatum during a
      surgical procedure.

      Patients who undergo the procedure would continue to take L-dopa; AAV-hAADC-2 is intended to
      provide, directly to the brain, the missing enzyme needed to convert L-dopa to dopamine.

             bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability - plus early dopaminergic
             responsiveness of symptoms and absence of any cardinal signs of more widespread
             neurological disease).

          -  Age at diagnosis ≥ 40 years.

          -  Duration of levodopa therapy ≥ 5 years (number of years is cumulative since diagnosis,
             does not need to be continuous).
