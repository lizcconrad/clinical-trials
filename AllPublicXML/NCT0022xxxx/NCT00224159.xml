      This study explores the impact of initiating statin therapy on subsequent dietary as well as
      other lifestyle beliefs, attitudes and behaviors.

      Specific aims:

        1. To test whether the initiation of statin therapy increases dietary saturated fat intake
           among statin naive patients.

        2. To determine what role attitudes, beliefs, expectations, motivation, intention and
           self-efficacy regarding drug or diet therapy may play in observed changes in dietary
           behavior after starting statin therapy.
