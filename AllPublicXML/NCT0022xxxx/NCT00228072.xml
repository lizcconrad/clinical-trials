  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if suction-curettage of the axilla is favorable in
      regard to effect, recovery and cosmetic appearance compared to standard surgical excision of
      the skin of the axilla in case of excessive sweating.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The surgical standard treatment for isolated excessive axillary sweating is excision of the
      hair-bearing area of the axilla. This technique is associated with a risk of impaired wound
      healing, infections, wide scars and a risk of impairment in the movement of the arm (seldom).

      A new technique suction-curettage, much alike the liposuction technique, in which the dermis
      is curettage from a sub-dermal approach with a cutting and sucking devise, may be promising
      in regard to recovery and cosmetic appearance postoperatively, but the effect of the sweat
      production is not well known. This study compares liposuction vs. standard excision in
      individuals with isolated excessive isolated axillary sweating randomized to treatment with
      one of each technique in both axillas.
