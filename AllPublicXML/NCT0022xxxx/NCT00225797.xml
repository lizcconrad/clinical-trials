  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of oxymorphone
      extended release in non-cancer patients with chronic low back pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with low back pain who are sub-optimally responsive to their current analgesic
      treatment begin open-label treatment with oxymorphone extended release (ER). During the
      Open-Label Titration Period, patients will receive daily oxymorphone ER by mouth (PO) q12h.
      The investigator will initiate the Open-Label Titration Period using study drug at a dose of
      5 mg PO q12h for 2 days; thereafter, patients will continue receiving 5 mg q12h or be
      titrated at increments of 5-10 mg q12h every 3-7 days until stabilization is achieved. The
      goal of the Open-Label Titration Period is to determine for each patient a fixed dose of
      study medication that is tolerated and achieves adequate analgesia. Stabilized patients will
      be randomiozed to either continue with current dose of oxymorphone ER or receive placebo for
      a total duration of 12 weeks.
