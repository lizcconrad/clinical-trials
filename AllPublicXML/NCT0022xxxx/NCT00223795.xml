      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the single point cane will relieve pain and
      disability in overweight or obese people with knee OA through altered joint biomechanics and
      what factors influence acceptance of cane use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee OA is an important cause of disability and falls in overweight or obese individuals and
      limits their attempts at exercise and subsequent weight loss. Walking aids such as canes have
      been recommended in the management of knee OA in order to decrease pain by reducing loading
      across the knee and to increase physical activity. Little information is available regarding
      the impact of walking aids on psychosocial function and quality of life in individuals with
      limited mobility. No randomized controlled trials have studied the efficacy of walking aids
      on quality of life, pain, and function in overweight or obese individuals with symptomatic
      knee OA (5,6). The proposed research will evaluate the effects of walking aids in knee OA by
      testing the following hypothesis that the use of a single-point cane ipsilateral and
      contralateral to the affected limb will decrease pain from knee OA by altering gait
      biomechanics and will improve walking function and quality of life in overweight or obese
      individuals with symptomatic knee OA.

    <description>An in-shoe dynamic, pressure distribution system (Pedar-X System, Novel Electronics, Inc., St. Paul, MN) was utilized to measure the vertical ground reaction force at the baseline visit and at the end of the first intervention period (two months) gait evaluations for both the control arm and cane user arm. The control arm was not given a cane to use at home during the two month intervention period. Peak vertical force on the affected limb was measured in the laboratory setting when both control group and cane user group walked with and without a cane at baseline and at the end of the first intervention period (2 months).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  45-85 years old

          -  Able to walk 30 feet without postural sway and able to stand unaided

          -  Knee pain on movement with a WOMAC pain subscale of &gt;35mm

          <title>Peak Vertical Force on Affected Limb</title>
          <description>An in-shoe dynamic, pressure distribution system (Pedar-X System, Novel Electronics, Inc., St. Paul, MN) was utilized to measure the vertical ground reaction force at the baseline visit and at the end of the first intervention period (two months) gait evaluations for both the control arm and cane user arm. The control arm was not given a cane to use at home during the two month intervention period. Peak vertical force on the affected limb was measured in the laboratory setting when both control group and cane user group walked with and without a cane at baseline and at the end of the first intervention period (2 months).</description>
