  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a process that uses low intensity electrical
      pulses generated by an electric stimulator to create muscle contractions. By contracting
      muscles in a specific sequence, one can generate various body functions such as grasping,
      walking, and standing. Final goal of the study is to evaluate if FES training when applied
      early during rehabilitation will help stroke patients to use their hands more effectively
      after discharge from a rehabilitation facility, compared to those patients who have not
      received FES training.

      Neuroprosthesis are systems that apply functional electrical stimulation to cause muscle
      contractions. If the muscle contractions are sequenced properly one can generate various
      functions such as grasping, standing, and walking. Recent studies of others and our pilot
      study indicate that a neuroprosthesis can be successfully applied as a training device to
      help stroke patients who have hemiplegic arm to relearn how to reach and grasp various
      objects. The objective of this research program is to confirm these preliminary results with
      the broader population of stroke patients, and if successful to propose a method to introduce
      this rehabilitation treatment into Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Stroke Unit as a primary
      intervention for hand function recovery. Specifically, our aim is to1)develop an exercise
      protocol that uses a neuroprosthesis for reaching and grasping developed by our team in
      combination with the standard physiotherapy treatments to enhance recovery of hemiplegic arm
      and hand; and 2) assess qualitatively and quantitatively improvements in the reaching and
      grasping functions achieved with standard rehabilitation treatment.

    <description>The Compex Motion neuroprosthesis, developed by Drs.R. Popovic and Thierry Keller, and company Compex SA, is a flexible device designed to improve grasping function in both SCI and stroke patients. This multi-channel surface stimulation system for grasping provides both palmar and lateral grasp, and holds a number of advantages over the other existing neuroprostesis.</description>
