    <textblock>
      This is a single institution phase I / II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      intratumoral CpG injections combined with local radiation in patients with mycosis fungoides.
      Patients will receive low-dose radiotherapy to a single tumor site on days 1 and 2 (2 Gy each
      day). CpG injections will be administered into the same tumor site within 24 hours before or
      24 hours after each radiation treatment. Weekly doses of (intratumoral or peritumoral
      injections) CpG will be then administered subcutaneously in the region of previous injections
      for 23 additional doses. The total treatment duration is 24 weeks.
