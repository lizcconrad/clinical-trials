      The purpose of this study is to improve the survival rate of those patients with acute
      fulminant hepatitis through treatment with the MARS® extra-corporal liver-purification system
      by:

        1. Reducing the number of patients who die before a graft is available

        2. Increasing the chances of survival without a liver transplant

        3. Reducing the pre- and post-operative mortality in transplant patients

      Patients with fulminant or subfulminant hepatitis with either an indication or a relative
      contraindication to a liver transplantation, are randomized to two groups:

        1. A group treated with the conventional medical intensive treatment (including the
           hemodialysis techniques, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration, if
           necessary) and the gold standard surgical treatment (liver transplantation) compared to

        2. A group receiving, in addition to the conventional medical intensive treatment, albumin
           dialysis using the MARS device and the gold standard surgical treatment (liver
           transplantation).
