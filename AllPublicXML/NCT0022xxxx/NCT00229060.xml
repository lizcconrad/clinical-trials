  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical response rate of doripenem versus a
      comparator in the treatment of hospitalized patients with complicated intra-abdominal
      infections.

    <textblock>
      Doripenem is an antibiotic medication not yet approved by the US FDA. This is a phase 3,
      multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind study of doripenem versus comparator
      antibiotic to assess the effectiveness and safety of doripenem in the treatment of
      complicated intra-abdominal infections in hospitalized adults. Doripenem or comparator is
      administered. The primary endpoint is the clinical response measured at late follow-up visit.
      The patients will receive either doripenem or comparator; treatment duration is 5 to 14 days.
