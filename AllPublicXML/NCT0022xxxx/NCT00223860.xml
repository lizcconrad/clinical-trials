    <textblock>
      There is evidence that has shown that serum testosterone levels are low in persons with
      chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). The question arises as to whether the defect in
      testosterone production is from the hypothalamic pituitary system (part of the brain that
      plays a role in testosterone release) or from the male testes. Studies to date are
      inconclusive. This study, will examine if persons with SCI has a normal hormonal regulation
      of the male hormone testosterone in comparison to persons who are able-bodied. This will help
      understand the physical and metabolic changes that occur in persons with SCI.

      Absolute or relative testosterone deficiency is associated with loss of lean body tissue and
      gain of fat, with associated adverse carbohydrate, lipid, and energy expenditure changes that
      increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Impotence and infertility are common in patients
      with SCI. Of the many possible explanations of poor semen quality, one possible etiology is
      dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Early reports have been
      inconclusive with regard to testicular function. These apparent discrepancies could, at least
      in part, be attributed to varying factors in population selection, including health and
      nutrition parameters, medication effects, and level and duration of injury, or to differences
      in methodology. Recently, two large population studies found a sizeable proportion of persons
      with SCI having testosterone deficiency. Huang et al. (1993) found significantly elevated
      luteinizing hormone (LH) responses to LH releasing hormone (LHRH) in subjects with SCI
      compared to controls. Of those studied with LHRH stimulation, 16/30 subjects with SCI had
      exaggerated LH responses and 6/30 had elevated follicular stimulation hormone (FSH)
      responses. Bulat et al., (1995) have shown that persons with tetraplegia tend to have
      increased gonadotropin release to standard provocative stimulation compared with able-bodied
      controls or those with paraplegia. In a preliminary report, testicular stimulation with
      standard doses of hCG for 2 days was similar in 10 subjects with SCI and 8 able-bodied
      controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. SCI with serum total testosterone 3.0 ng/ml (SCI eugonadal, n=25),

          2. SCI with serum total testosterone &lt;3.0 ng/ml (SCI hypogonadal, n=25),

          3. able-bodied controls with serum total testosterone 3.0 ng/ml (control eugonadal,
             n=25), and

          4. able-bodied controls with serum total testosterone &lt;3.0 ng/ml (control hypogonadal,
             n=25). All SCI and control subjects will be screened for serum gonadotropin levels
             within the normal range as an inclusion criterion.

          3. pyschotropic medications,

          4. anti-hypertensive medications (centrally acting, i.e., guanethidine, reserpine,
             methyldopa, b-adrenergic blockers, clonidine, etc.),

          5. H2-blockers,

          6. digoxin,

          7. alcoholism,

          8. anti-convulsant medications (dilantin or barbiturates)

          9. diuretics (thiazides or spironolactone),

         10. chemotherapeutic agents,

         11. antibiotics,

         12. opiates,

         13. hormones (other than replacement doses),

         14. history of pituitary or testicular surgery. Abstinence from alcoholic beverages will
             be required for 48 hours prior to study.
