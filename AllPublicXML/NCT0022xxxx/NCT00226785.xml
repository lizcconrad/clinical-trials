  <brief_title>Dexmedetomidine for Continuous Sedation</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to demonstrate that dexmedetomidine is non-inferior to current best practice
      sedation with propofol/midazolam and daily sedation stops, in maintaining a target depth of
      sedation in long-stay intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and that dexmedetomidine, compared
      with current best practice, reduces the length of ICU stay.
