    <textblock>
      This is a prospective 24-week, randomized, parallel-group, multi-center, active-controlled
      (pioglitazone 45 mg) open-label study designed to assess the effects of tesaglitazar 2 mg per
      day on components of renal excretion of creatinine in type 2 diabetics. The study comprises a
      2-week enrollment period, followed by a 24-week double blind treatment period and an 8-week
      follow-up period
