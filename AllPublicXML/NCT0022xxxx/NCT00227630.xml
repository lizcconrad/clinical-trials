      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Pemetrexed disodium may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill
      tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it
      can be removed. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain
      after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving pemetrexed disodium and cisplatin
      followed by surgery and radiation therapy works in treating patients with malignant pleural
      mesothelioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising pemetrexed disodium and
           cisplatin followed by extrapleural pneumonectomy and high-dose postoperative
           3D-conformal radiotherapy, in terms of 90-day progression-free survival, in patients
           with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

        -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and
           cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 3 courses
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are evaluated 3
           weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients without disease progression
           proceed to surgery.

        -  Extrapleural pneumonectomy: Within 21-56 days after completion of neoadjuvant
           chemotherapy, patients undergo extrapleural pneumonectomy. Patients are evaluated 30
           days after surgery. Patients without disease progression undergo high-dose 3D-conformal
           radiotherapy.

        -  High-dose 3D-conformal radiotherapy: Beginning 30-84 days after surgery, patients
           undergo high-dose 3D-conformal radiotherapy daily for 30 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed on days 42 and 90, every 3 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52 patients will be accrued for this study.
