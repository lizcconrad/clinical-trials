  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a brief motivational intervention on
      marijuana use and sex-risk behavior in young women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study holds the promise of developing a brief, efficacious intervention to reduce
      marijuana use and related sexual risk-taking behavior among the large populaton of late
      adolescent women who are regular marijuana users. In the abscence of intervention, these
      women are at heightened risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.
      Therefore it is crucial to develop an intervention that will reduce their marijuana and
      subsequent sexual risk taking behavior. The intervention employed in this study represents a
      novel adaptation of interventions that are well-supported with similar populations. If the
      current intervention is found to be efficacious, it can be readily integrated into a variety
      of treatment settings, particularly other primary care settings. In addition, this study will
      contribute valuable information about the relationship between marijuana use and sexual risk
      taking behavior and about the mechanisms of change in marijuana use in late adolescent women.

      Comparison(s): Participants will be assigned, in this 6 month longitudinal study, to an
      assessment-only group or an assessment plus intervention group. Those in the intervention
      group will receive 2 motivational intervention sessions during the first 3 months of their
      study participation.
