      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy given prior to having lung
      cancer surgically removed. Patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer will receive
      gemcitabine and pemetrexed together for 4 times biweekly. Patients will be seen by a medical
      oncologist prior to each cycle of chemotherapy given. The medical oncologist will review
      patient's bloodwork and symptoms prior to approving next cycle of chemotherapy. All patients
      will then be evaluated with scans to determine response to chemotherapy and to determine if
      patient is a surgical candidate. These patients will then proceed to surgery to have the lung
      cancer removed. Follow up visits include bloodwork, scans, and a visit with the medical
      oncologist every three months for two years, then every six months for three years to monitor
      for disease recurrence.

      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine
      and pemetrexed given together 4-times biweekly in patients with resectable NSCLC. All
      patients will be seen by members of the Thoracic Oncology Program at the H. Lee Moffitt
      Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa, Florida, and they will be discussed in our
      weekly multidisciplinary thoracic oncology conference. The conference includes pathologists,
      radiologists, thoracic surgeons, pulmonologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists,
      oncology nurse specialists, case managers, social workers, and clinical trials coordinators.
      They will have initial tests as outlined in the study timetable. Patients will receive
      gemcitabine biweekly on days 1, 15, 29, and 43 at a dose of 1,500 mg/m2. They will also
      receive pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m2 on days 1, 15, 29, and 43. Gemcitabine will be
      given first over a period of 30 minutes i.v. followed by pemetrexed over 10 minutes i.v. All
      patients will get a post induction chemotherapy PET scan, CT scan, and PFT's including a
      DLCO. They will then go on to thoracotomy including bronchoscopy and mediastinal lymph node
      dissection between days 64 and 77 if the tumor is deemed completely resectable on restaging
      studies.

      The administration of chemotherapy at the earliest time (neoadjuvant or induction
      chemotherapy) following diagnosis in an effort to reduce the risk of disease recurrence. This
      approach also allows for investigations of molecular parameters that may affect response to
      chemotherapy and patients' survival. It is our hypothesis that the expression of genes
      associated with activation, inactivation, and efficacy of the drugs gemcitabine and
      pemetrexed will predict response to therapy and prognosis. We further hypothesize that the
      expression of these genes will be altered during chemotherapy, and that the global assessment
      of tumor proliferation, apoptosis, and genome damage is associated with response to therapy.
      We propose a phase II study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and pemetrexed in
      patients with resectable NSCLC, specifically correlating molecular and genetic parameters to
      the primary clinical study endpoint disease response (radiographic CR+PR) and the secondary
      endpoints complete pathological response at surgery, disease-free survival, and overall
      survival.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Microscopically confirmed non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, which may be confirmed
             at the initial bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy, or by transthoracic needle biopsy.

          -  No prior therapy for lung cancer.

          -  Patients must have disease stages IB (T2N0M0), IIA (T1N1M0), IIB (T2N1M0 and T3N0M0),
             or IIIA (T3N1M0 and T1-3N2M0). Patients with 2 lesions in one lobe (T4) (Stage IIIB)
             are eligible.

          -  Patients must be deemed medically fit for surgical resection by a thoracic surgeon.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of Zero or One.

          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Measurable Disease: Any mass reproducibly measurable in one diameter (RECIST
             criteria).

          -  Evaluable disease: Lesions apparent on chest CT, which do not meet the criteria for
             measurability. These include ill-defined masses associated with post obstructive
             changes.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Patient must be able to understand and sign the informed consent.

          -  Patients must be &gt;12 weeks from prior major surgery, such as a coronary artery bypass
             graft.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  White blood cell count &lt;3000/mm3

          -  Platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;9.0 g/dl

          -  Creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dl

          -  Total bilirubin &gt;1.5 mg/dl

          -  SGOT, SGPT, or AP &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  Metastatic disease (except peribronchial/hilar lymph nodes=N1 and
             ipsilateral/subcarinal mediastinal lymph nodes=N2) or malignant pleural effusion
             detected on preoperative evaluation. Non-malignant effusions are cytology negative,
             are non-bloody, and are transudates. Effusions visible only on CT and not large enough
             for safe thoracentesis will not result in ineligibility. Exudative effusions, even if
             cytologically negative are excluded. Pleural fluid is considered exudative if: the
             ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein is &gt;0.5 or the ratio of pleural fluid
             LDH to serum to serum LDH &gt;0.6 or Pleural fluid LDH is &gt;200 IU/liter. A staging PET
             scan will be used to exclude patients. If there are multiple areas of FDG uptake
             outside the area of the primary tumor and the hilar and ipsilateral mediastinal lymph
             nodes, the patient will be excluded by virtue of having metastatic disease. If
             however, only one area shows an increase in FDG uptake, the area of concern will need
             further evaluation such as a biopsy to exclude metastatic disease.

          -  N3 lymph nodes (contralateral mediastinal/hilar and supraclavicular/scalene) or T4
             primary tumor (malignant pleural effusion or mediastinal invasion) by clinical staging
             criteria (N3 as seen on CT or PET scan, which may be proven by mediastinoscopy at the
             investigators discretion).

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Other active malignancy within 2 years with the exceptions of non-melanoma skin cancer
             and cervical carcinoma in situ.

          -  Psychologic, familial, sociologic, or geographic conditions, which do not permit
             biweekly medical follow-up and adherence to the study protocol.

          -  Prior radiation therapy for any cancer to the thorax.

        <description>Number of participants with partial or Complete Response. Complete response (CR) is defined as the total disappearance of all malignant and evaluable clinical evidence of cancer without the development of any new malignant lesions documented on the post chemotherapy chest CT and PET scan.
Partial response (PR) (measurable disease only): When compared with pre-treatment measurements, a reduction of &gt;30% in the sum of the largest diameters of all measurable lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
