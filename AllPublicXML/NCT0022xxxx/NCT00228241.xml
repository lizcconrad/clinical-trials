  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Background - Pacemaker treatment gives asynchronous activation of the heart that often
           results in decreased heart function and clinical heart failure. New pacemaker types that
           stimulates both left and right ventricle ( biventricular pacemakers ) is introduced to
           the treatment of patients with heart failure, decreased left ventricular function and
           ECG signs with left bundle branch block.

        2. Hypothesis - Ventricular pacing results in remodelling of the left ventricle and
           decreased left ventricular function. Biventricular pacing do not do this. Ventricular
           pacing results in heart failure and increased wall stress with decreased 6 minutes walk
           test and increased BNP in blood samples. This is not seen by biventricular pacing.

        3. Materials and methods - 3 studies. All patients are examined by echocardiography
           2-dimensional, M-mode, 3-dimensional and with tissue harmonic imaging. Study 1) Patients
           with AV-conduction disorder that needs pacemaker treatment are randomized to
           DDD-pacemaker or biventricular pacemaker. Study 2) Patients with sick sinus syndrome
           included in DANPACE are randomized to AAI- or DDD-pacemaker. Study 3 ) Acute study to
           examine the changes in patients AV-block before DDD-pacemaker implantation and after
           implantation.
