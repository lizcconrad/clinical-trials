    <textblock>
      This study offers narrowband UVB light therapy to patients with both light and dark skin
      types who have 10% of their body involved with psoriasis vulgaris.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of patients, having 10% of their body surface area involved with psoriasis
      vulgaris, will receive narrowband phototherapy. One group will have skin type I-IV, or light
      skin and the second group will have dark skin, or type V-VI.

      All patients will receive phototherapy, with narrowband UVB, three times a week for six
      weeks, or a total of 18 treatments. 6mm punch skin biopsies will be done prior to starting
      therapy and at the completion of the study. Clinical assessments and photography will be done
      parallel to the skin biopsies. Results (clinically and histologically) of both groups will be
      compared.

    <description>The patient begins total body NBUVB that day at a dose that is 50% of the MED. Patients are treated 3-7 times per week, with increasing doses at every treatment if no burning occurs. This is continued until clearance of disease or maximum efficacy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must have stable psoriasis vulgaris, which covers at least 10% of their bodies,
        for at least six months. Patients can not have not been treated with narrowband UVB in the
        past, although other light therapies are acceptable (i.e. broadband UVB and PUVA). Patients
        are not allowed to receive other therapies for their psoriasis, internal and topical, while
        they are participating in the study. Patients may continue using non-medicated moisturizer.
