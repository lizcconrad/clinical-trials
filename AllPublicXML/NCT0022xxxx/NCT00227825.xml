      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot study of Motivational Enhancement Therapy
      (MET), an empirically validated behavioral change strategy, with young adults who are HIV +.
      The aim is to determine if MET is effective in increasing general health promotion behaviors,
      adherence to HIV+ specific medical treatment over and above taking medication, and decreasing
      risky behaviors in young adults who are HIV positive. The longer-term objective is to
      identify and way to decrease HIV transmission rates, disease progression, illness episodes,
      and hospitalizations in this high-risk population.

      Hypotheses: 1)Youth receiving the motivational intervention plus referrals will report
      greater reductions in risky behaviors than youth in the control group receiving standard care
      plus referrals at 3-months post-baseline. This hypothesis will first be tested in the whole
      sample using an overall risk index. Then, the hypothesis will be tested with each behavior
      (reduced drug and alcohol use, condom use, taking medications,) within the subgroups
      reporting problem levels of that behavior; 2)Youth in the intervention group will demonstrate
      improved viral loads, will report greater improvement in perceived health status, depression,
      general psychological distress, disclosure to sexual partners, and will demonstrate greater
      attendance of medical and support service appointments than youth in the control group at 3
      months post-baseline; 3)Youth in the intervention group will report greater reductions in
      temptation to engage in risky behaviors, increased self-efficacy, and improvements in
      readiness to change their behavior than youth in the control group at 3 months post-baseline;
      4)The differences between the intervention and control group from pre- to post- intervention
      will be maintained at 6, 9, 12, and 15 months post-baseline (3, 6, 9, and 12 months after
      intervention completion).

      The proposed study is a randomized clinical trial with a wait-list control. The sample will
      be 60 HIV+ young adults between the ages of 16 to 24 years recruited from the DMC Horizons
      Project and other community based HIV programs. Self referred persons meeting the diagnostic
      criteria of HIV+ will also be accepted. There are no exclusion criteria. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: MET NOW or MET LATER. MET LATER is the wait list
      control group. The only difference between the groups is the timing of the intervention and
      data collection. All subjects will complete 5 research visits and 4 MET therapy sessions.
      Research visits consists of an interview, completion of self-report questionnaires, a 20cc
      blood drawn for complete blood count (CBC), viral load and CD4 count, and adherence rating
      completed by the physician. Established questionnaires are used to measure health behaviors,
      sexual risk behaviors, substance use, self-efficacy, stage of change, social support, health
      beliefs, and mental health status. Research visits take about 1 = hours. Therapy sessions
      consist of MET provided by a trained therapist. Sessions last about 1 hour and focus on
      changing behavior to improve health, increase medical adherence, and/or reduce risk. Subjects
      choose the behaviors they want to change. There are a total of 4 sessions over 3 months. The
      MET NOW group will begin session immediately after the first (baseline) research visit and
      the MET LATER group will begin therapy sessions approximately 9 months after the first
      research visit. All subjects will be paid $25.00 for the first research visit with a $5
      increase for each subsequent research visit, a total of $175.00 for the 5 research visits.
      Subjects will receive $10 gift certificate at each therapy session. Cab vouchers or parking
      fees will be provided for each therapy or research session.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A sample of 60 HIV+youth, ages 16-24, will be recruited from the four health care
             sites in the Michigan Title IV Project.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In order to increase the likelihood that the current intervention will be easily
             transportable to real world settings, exclusion criteria are kept to a minimum. No
             exclusions will be made due to co-morbid mental health problems ( i.e. ADHD, conduct
             disorder, depression, anxiety disorder), with the exception of thought disorder (i.e.
             schizophrenia, autism). It is assumed that severe psychosis in conjunction with HIV
             may require management strategies beyond the scope of the MET interventions (i.e.
             residential placement). As resources are not available in the current grant to hire
             and train therapists who are bilingual or translate study questionnaires/measures,
             subjects will required to speak English fluently. Hispanic or Arabic families who meet
             this criterion will be included in the study. Currently, all clients at the clinic
             sites meet this last criterion.
