    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study of Caldolor administered to febrile hospitalized
      pediatric patients every 6 hours for 24 hours is to determine the clinical equivalence of a
      single dose of Caldolor compared to acetaminophen (paracetamol; APAP) for the treatment of
      fever as measured by the AUC Tº within the first 6 hours of treatment (as compared to a
      target temperature of 98.6ºF [37.0ºC]).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be hospitalized

          2. Be between 6 months and 17 years of age, inclusive

          3. Have new (not chronic, within last 7 days) onset of fever, documented by temperature
             greater than or equal to 101.0ºF (38.3ºC) (The preferred method of temperature
             measurement is core. The route of temperature measurement used immediately before
             randomization should be used immediately before dosing and for all temperature
             measurements during the Treatment Period.)

          4. Have written informed consent provided by legal parent, guardian, or authorized agent,
             and have same agree to abide by the study restrictions and to return for the required
             assessments (Where appropriate, participants of appropriate intellectual maturity
             should personally provide written informed assent; age of assent may be determined by
             Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) or be
             consistent with local legal requirements.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have inadequate intravenous access

          2. Have received antipyretic drug therapy within 8 hours before dosing

          3. Be pregnant or nursing

          4. Have any history of allergy or hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, aspirin, APAP, or any
             component of Caldolor or APAP.

          5. Have a history of severe head trauma that required the current hospitalization, had
             intracranial surgery or stroke within the previous 30 days, or have any history of
             intracerebral arteriovenous malformation, cerebral aneurysm, or central nervous system
             mass lesions

          6. Have a history of febrile convulsion or have a sibling with a history of febrile
             convulsion

          7. Have a history of congenital bleeding diatheses (e.g., hemophilia) or any active
             clinically significant bleeding, or have underlying platelet dysfunction, including
             (but not limited to) idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular
             coagulation, or congenital platelet dysfunction

          8. Have gastrointestinal bleeding that has required medical intervention within the
             previous 6 weeks, unless definitive surgery has been performed

          9. Have platelet count less than 30,000/mm3

         10. Be receiving full dose anticoagulation therapy (Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin
             is acceptable.)

         11. Have fever secondary to blood or drug reaction

         12. Have an expected life span of less than 14 days because of imminent withdrawal of life
             support or severity of illness

         13. Be receiving ongoing or imminent treatment with corticosteroids

         14. Have neurogenic fever

         15. Be on dialysis, have oliguria or calculated creatinine clearance of less than 70
             mL/min (calculated using the Schwartz formula), have impaired renal function, be
             receiving nephrotoxic drugs, or be expected to be unable to tolerate the extra fluid
             required for administration of CTM

         16. Have had major surgery within the past 12 hours, unless adequate hemostasis has been
             achieved

         17. Have received another investigational drug within the past 30 days

         18. Be otherwise unsuitable for the study, in the opinion of the Investigator
