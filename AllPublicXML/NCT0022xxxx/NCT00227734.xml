      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and oxaliplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways.
      Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known
      whether giving capecitabine and oxaliplatin together with cetuximab is more effective than
      capecitabine and oxaliplatin in treating colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine and
      oxaliplatin together with cetuximab works compared to capecitabine and oxaliplatin in
      treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin with vs without cetuximab in
           patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-positive metastatic unresectable
           colorectal cancer.

        -  Compare the objective response (complete and partial response) in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the safety of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or stable disease for
           at least 18 weeks) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival, time to progression, and time to treatment failure in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0 vs 1), type of metastases (synchronous vs metachronous), prior adjuvant
      chemotherapy (yes vs no), and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-15 and oxaliplatin IV
           over 2 hours on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive capecitabine and oxaliplatin as in arm I and cetuximab IV over
           1-2 hours on days 1 and 8.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 74 patients (37 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 1.5 years.
