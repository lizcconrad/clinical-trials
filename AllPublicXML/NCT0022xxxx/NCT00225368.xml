  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insecticide-impregnated bed nets and curtains (ITN) have been shown to be effective against
      malaria. However, given that most ITN studies were of limited length, researchers have
      postulated the hypothesis that in areas of intense malaria transmission and due to possible
      interactions with immunity development, ITN interventions may cause no effect at all or even
      a long-term increase in malaria morbidity and mortality.

      The overall objective of the trial is to analyse the long-term effects of ITN on child
      morbidity and mortality in an area of intense malaria transmission. The specific objective is
      to analyse if there is a difference in the rates of malaria morbidity and mortality as well
      as in all-cause mortality in children being protected with ITNs from birth compared to
      children protected with ITNs from age 6 months onwards.

      The study is conducted in the Nouna Health District, in Burkina Faso, and specifically in a
      sub-portion of the District under demographic surveillance since 1999. The sub-portion of the
      District under demographic surveillance includes a total population of 70 000 individuals,
      distributed in 42 villages and in the town of Nouna. The region is a dry Savannah
      characterised by high levels of malaria transmission.

      The study design entails a prospective community-based trial, with newborn children being
      identified at the village level and then individually randomised to receive either
      intervention A or intervention B. Intervention A is defined as ITN protection from age 0 to
      59 months (i.e. protection from birth). Intervention B is defined as ITN protection from age
      6 to 59 months (i.e. protection from 6 months onwards). Enrollment in the study cohort in
      continued until the sample size is reached (n = 2 600, 1 300 group A and 1 300 group B).

      Detailed data on morbidity is collected through means of a prospective follow up on a
      sub-sample of 420 children from 6 sentinel villages (210 from group A and 210 from group B).
      These 420 children are visited daily by field workers who measure their temperature. In case
      of fever, field workers take a blood sample through finger prick to be analysed for malaria
      parasitaemia. Treatment free of charge is organised for all children in this subsample. In
      addition, these children are visited twice a year for the collection of clinical (malaria
      episodes, anaemia) and parasitological (rates of malaria parasitaemia, parasite density)
      parameters. Data collection on this subsample of children is meant to last from June 2000 to
      December 2003. For study purposes, falciparum malaria is defined as 37.5 C or more plus at
      least 5 000 parasites per micro-litre.

      All-cause mortality in the overall study sample (2 600 children) are ascertained through
      means of a demographic surveillance system (DSS), which regularly monitors deaths (as well as
      births and migration) in the region. The causes of death are identified through means of
      verbal autopsy. All children enrolled in the study are followed up through means of the DSS
      from birth up to 5 years of age.

      The primary study outcome will be the five-year all-cause mortality in the total number of
      children enrolled in the study (2 600). Secondary outcomes will be the study of
      malaria-specific mortality, clinical parameters, and parasitological parameters in a
      sub-sample of the study cohort (420).
