  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the relationship between frequency of meals and hepatic
      fat content and insulin sensitivity. We, the researchers at Rockefeller University,
      hypothesize that low plasma insulin levels (as achieved by periods of fasting) will prevent
      insulin resistance and reduce hepatic lipid content. In contrast, frequent, carbohydrate-rich
      meals will predispose to hepatic steatosis (non-alcoholic) and insulin resistance.

      This is a 6 week inpatient study.

      The hypothesis will be tested by studying two groups of normal subjects who will receive a
      defined weight maintenance diet: one group will be given meals twice a day and other group
      will be given eight meals (snacks) per day. At the beginning of the study period and after 4
      weeks following the specified frequency of meals, the study subjects will have their whole
      body insulin sensitivity and hepatic fat content measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic
      clamp and MRI of the liver, respectively.
