    <textblock>
      Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a safe and effective tool for the assessment of obscure
      gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). However, its real efficacy and its position in the
      diagnostic algorithm of OGIB vs. push enteroscopy (PE) remain unknown since in previous
      studies both techniques were performed in all included patients The purpose of this protocol
      is to conduct a randomized prospective controlled trial in patients with OGIB comparing a
      strategy based on CE or PE followed by the alternative exploration only when the first line
      exploration was negative. The main outpoint of this study concerns the diagnostic yield of
      the two explorations. Second endpoint concerns the clinical relevance of the two strategies
      tested (CE ± PE vs. CE ± PE) in terms of diagnostic yield, clinical outcome, therapeutic
      impact and added explorations

      This was a prospective randomized multicentric study. After the screening visit, eligible
      subjects were randomly assigned to be explored by CE or PE (first line exploration). The
      alternative exploration was only performed if no diagnosis was evidenced by the examination
      assigned by randomization. An independent staff member assigned subjects in 1:1 ratio between
      CE and PE strategies with stratification for overt and occult bleeding and centers according
      to consecutive number that were kept in serialized sealed opaque envelopes. After the
      completion of these explorations, the patients returned at month 3, 6 and 12 thereafter. At
      each visit, clinical evaluation and laboratory tests were performed and patients were managed
      according to published recommendations2 (AGA medical position). The first line exploration as
      well as the alternative exploration could be done during the one year follow-up period only
      in case of severe relapse of OGIB or necessity to perform biopsies or a therapeutic
      procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may suffer from episodes of active bleeding within the last 6 months or
             chronic iron-deficiency anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl).

          -  A gynecologic or proctologic bleeding source had to be excluded.

          -  All patients had to have negative workup including upper gastrointestinal endoscopy,
             colonoscopy and small-bowel barium series or computed tomography enteroclysis.

          -  Medical reports and/or the imaging documents were available and reviewed in all
             patients. Usually these investigations were repeated several times before inclusion.

          -  Abdominal angiography was only performed when there were signs of active bleeding
             during the diagnostic work-up (n = 3). Meckel scintigraphy was usually carried out in
             patients under 30 years of age (n = 14).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient presenting a digestive bleeding with an echo hemodynamic major and\or
             requiring urgent therapeutic measures

             syndrome of malabsorption or deficiency of contribution not formally excluded

          -  Patient presenting an occlusive syndrome or a hurt of stenosis hail objectivized by a
             radiological exploration

          -  Surrounding wall(Speaker) or in age waits to procreate without effective contraception

          -  The mental or physical state of the patient not allowing a maid compliance in the
             conditions of the try(essay) and or in the correct use of the device Patient carrier
             of a pacemaker or another electromechanical implant

          -  Patient that must undergo an examination by MRI before having been able to eliminate
             the capsule

          -  Enteroscopy or video capsule prerequisite technically satisfactory and in touch with
             same pathological episode or dating at least less than 6 months Patient participating
             at present in another clinical trial without direct profit which can directly or
