  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the first line treatment for acromegaly is surgery, in order to remove the adenoma
      causing overproduction of growth hormone which leads to acromegaly. The objective of this
      study is to assess the safety and efficacy of long-acting repeatable formulation of
      octreotide and to compare it to the safety and efficacy of surgery in patients with
      acromegaly who have not had any previous treatment for acromegaly.
