      The aim of this study is to establish the additional effectiveness and costs of routine
      thoraco-abdominal computed tomography (CT) in blunt trauma patients versus conventional
      radiological imaging and to determine which clinical parameters predict a high additional
      value of routine thoraco-abdominal CT.

    <textblock>
      The technological advances in computed tomography (CT), with faster image acquisition
      resulting in higher resolution, result in making CT a more widely and intensively used
      imaging modality in trauma patient care. Thoraco-abdominal CT in addition appears to have
      additional diagnostic value compared to conventional radiography, especially in severely
      injured trauma patients.

      Nowadays, both clinical data and conventional radiology are used to determine which patient
      should undergo body CT scanning. Currently there are no widely accepted guidelines for the
      use of a &quot;standard&quot; TRAuma CT (TRACT). Although many retrospective and several prospective
      cohort studies have been published on this topic, the data are not sufficient to sustain
      evidence-based practice in decision-making.

      The aim of this study is, to establish the additional effectiveness and costs of routine
      thoraco-abdominal CT in blunt trauma patients versus conventional radiological imaging and to
      determine which clinical parameters predict a high additional value of routine
      thoraco-abdominal CT.

      Consecutive trauma patients, who are at least 16 years old and are suffering from severe
      injuries, undergo a standard trauma CT of the cervical spine, the thorax and abdomen after
      clinical evaluation and conventional radiological workup.

      Clinical, conventional and computed tomographic radiological assessment, costs, therapeutic
      consequences and 6 months patient follow up are recorded and will be statistically analyzed.
