  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinically significant macular edema (CSME) is one of the leading causes of vision loss in
      diabetic retinopathy. The current standard of care for CSME is focal/grid laser
      photocoagulation. However, many patients experience further vision loss and/or require
      multiple laser treatments. In recent studies, intraocular (intravitreal) injection of
      triamcinolone acetonide has been shown to be beneficial for CSME, however, risks of this
      procedure include endophthalmitis and increased risk of steroid-induced intraocular pressure
      (IOP) elevation. Posterior sub-Tenon injection (PST) of triamcinolone acetonide is commonly
      used for inflammatory conditions of the eye and recently, has been increasingly used for
      diabetic macular edema. The objective of this study is to determine whether combined
      treatment with PST triamcinolone acetonide and laser photocoagulation for CSME has decreased
      rates of moderate vision loss, increased visual gain, and decrease in central macular
      thickness compared to laser photocoagulation alone. Both primary (no previous history of
      focal/grid laser) and refractory (previous history of focal/grid laser) CMSE will be studied.
      Thirty (30) eyes with primary CSME and thirty (30) eyes with refractory CSME will be
      randomized into one of two groups: 1) PST/Laser group and 2) Laser alone group. All patients
      will have an Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) at the initial and final visits. Patients
      assigned to PST/Laser group will use topical steroid (1% prednisolone acetate) four times a
      day for two weeks. Patients who have elevated IOP with topical steroids will not receive PST
      steroid injection. Following treatments, patients will be evaluated at 1 and 2 months for a
      dilated eye exam, visual acuity, and assessment of IOP. Moderate vision loss (loss of 15
      ETDRS letters), vision gain (in ETDRS letters), and central macular thickness (measured by
      OCT) will be compared between groups. Multivariate analysis will also be used to compare
      outcomes from the two arms of the study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The criteria listed below must be satisfied in order for the patient to be eligible for the
        study.

          -  Age 25 to 80, inclusive.

          -  Primary CSME: CSME secondary to diabetic retinopathy as defined by the ETDRS in one or
             both eyes with no previous history of focal/grid laser photocoagulation.

          -  Refractory CSME: CSME secondary to diabetic retinopathy as defined by the ETDRS in one
             or both eyes with at least one session of focal/grid laser photocoagulation.
             Additionally, the eye must have a central macular thickness of at least 300 μM
             (normal, 200 μM) as measured by OCT and vision loss from baseline.

               -  All patients in the Hines VA Eye Clinic with suspicion of CSME will be referred
                  to the Hines VA Retina Clinic where they will be evaluated by a Retina specialist
                  (Dr. De Alba) and where the diagnosis of CSME will be confirmed by clinical
                  examination and fluorescein angiography.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        If any of the exclusion criteria listed below is/are present, the patient will not be
        eligible for the study.

          -  Unwilling or unable to give consent.

          -  Unable to return for scheduled follow-up visits.

          -  No light perception, light perception, count fingers, or hand motion vision.

          -  History of glaucoma (any form).

          -  History of ocular hypertension.

          -  History of IOP elevation with ocular and/or systemic steroid treatment.

          -  Baseline IOP greater than 22 mmHg.

          -  All patients with IOP elevation greater than 22 mmHg following treatment with topical
             prednisolone acetate.

          -  All patients with IOP elevation greater than 5 mmHg from baseline measurement
             following treatment with topical Prednisolone acetate.

          -  Advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

          -  History of retinal detachment in either eye.

          -  Any ocular disease (anterior or posterior segment) obstructing the view of the fundus
             (i.e., dense cataract, vitreous hemorrhage).

          -  History of PST or intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection in either eye six
             months prior to the study.

          -  History of 20/200 vision or worse from any cause in the fellow eye.

          -  Active inflammatory, infectious, or idiopathic keratitis.
