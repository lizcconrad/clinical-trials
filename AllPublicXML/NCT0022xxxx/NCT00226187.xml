      A randomized, double-blind trial of docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acid supplementation in
      breast-fed preterm infants

      Background:

      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) are essential for preterm infants. Human
      milk and preterm formulas contain DHA and AA, but at lower concentrations than required to
      approximate utero accretion rate.

      Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of a high dose DHA and AA supplement to breast-fed preterm infants in
      the early neonatal period. Primary endpoints are neurodevelopment at 6 and 20 months of age.

      Design:

      A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study is carried out in four Norwegian neonatal
      centers.

      Subjects and methods:

      Infants with birth weight &lt; 1.5 kg are randomized to either an intervention or a control
      group. All infants receive fortified human milk, and a daily dose of 0.5 ml study oil per 100
      ml milk. Infants in the intervention group receive oil with DHA and AA (Formulaid, Martek,
      USA), while the control oil contains vegetable oil without DHA or AA. Blood samples are
      collected at birth (cord), and at start and stop of the intervention. Plasma is analyzed for
      fatty acid pattern using high performance liquid chromatography.
