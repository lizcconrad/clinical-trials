  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1062 children at the age of 7 months and their families were randomized 1:1 in an
      intervention arm and a control arm. The intervention families has received child-oriented and
      individualized nutritional and life-style counseling that aims at decreasing child's exposure
      to the known environmental atherosclerosis risk factors. The controls children receive
      information as given at the well-baby clinics and in school health care of children and
      adolescents. The hypothesis is that the intervention children have healthier food habits and
      serum serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations than the controls, fewer of them start
      smoking, and their physical activity level is higher than that of the controls.

      1062 children at the age of 7 months and their families were randomized 1:1 in an
      intervention arm and a control arm. The intervention families has received child-oriented and
      individualized nutritional and life-style counseling that aims at decreasing child's exposure
      to the known environmental atherosclerosis risk factors. The controls children receive
      information as given at the well-baby clinics and in school health care of children and
      adolescents. The hypothesis is that the intervention children have healthier food habits and
      serum serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations than the controls, fewer of them start
      smoking, and their physical activity level is higher than that of the controls. We further
      hypothesised that the life-style intervention had no adverse mental or somatic effects on the
      children. Intima-media thickness of the carotid and brachial arterias and aorta and
      vasodilatation of the brachial artery induced by endogenous NO production have been also been
      measures at 2-year intervals since the age of 11 years. Recruitment to the study began in
      1990 and continued for 2 years. The children are now between 14 and 16 years of age. 550
      children remain in the study, which will continue until the last children have reached the
      age of 20 years.
