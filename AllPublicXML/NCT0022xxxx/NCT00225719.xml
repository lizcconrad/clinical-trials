  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently available therapies to treat Acute Coronary Syndromes(ACS) have several limitations
      including; the relatively long treatment duration required before apparent significant
      benefit; the inability to achieve reversal of the atherosclerotic process; and poor patient
      compliance due to chronicity of therapy. This study will assess the effects of rHDL compared
      with placebo on indices of atherosclerosis progression and regression as assessed with
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in patients after acute coronary syndromes (ACS).
