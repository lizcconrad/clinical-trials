      The purpose of the study is to check whether training mixed teams of physicians and nurses
      from intensive care units on patient simulators improves teamwork within the teams.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient safety and the prevention of medical error are primary goals of healthcare
      organizations. One of the means of reducing such errors is teamwork improvement. Simulation
      training, using advanced patient simulators, has been shown to improve diagnostic,
      resuscitation and technical skills amongst physicians and nurses. We intend to compare
      simulation training of a mixed team of physicians and nurses, using specifically designed
      scenarios based on real life experience, to frontal teaching sessions designed to enhance
      teamwork, by assessing teamwork, using accepted behavioral scales, during routine work,
      before and after both interventions.
