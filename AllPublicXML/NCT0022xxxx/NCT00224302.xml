      We evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of duloxetine in the treatment of major depressive
      episodes during the course of psychotic disorders

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive episodes (MDE) frequently occur during the course of schizophrenic
      psychoses, both as as &quot;post-psychotic&quot; depressions, and also independently from psychotic
      episodes. A number of clinical studies reported the application of different antidepressive
      substances, such as Imipramine, Reboxetine or Venlafaxine. In general, the treatment of
      schizophrenic patients with antidepressive drugs can be considered as necessary and save,
      resulting in therapeutic guidelines of different psychiatric societies. However, since 5 to
      10 % of the schizophrenic patients commit suicide, there is still much effort necessary in
      order to improve the treatment of affective symptoms in schizophrenic psychoses.The recently
      introduced antidepressive substance Duloxetine selectively inhibits as a SSNRI the reuptake
      of serotonine and noradrenaline from the synaptic cleft. Duloxetine was proven as
      antidepressive, anxiolytic and analgetic in a series of multi-centre, placebo-controlled
      investigations. Based on these considerations and on successful experiences in single case
      reports we aim to investigate the therapeutic effects of duloxetine in patients with lifetime
      diagnoses of the schizophrenic spectrum.
