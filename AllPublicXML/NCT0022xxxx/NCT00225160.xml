  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Acetyl L-carnitine can prevent the
      development of nerve damage, known as neuropathy, in individuals taking anti-HIV drugs over a
      48-week period. In addition the safety and tolerability of Acetyl L-carnitine will be
      assessed.

      This study compares the use of Acetyl L-carnitine or placebo (a dummy drug) in the prevention
      of nerve damage. The current standard of care is to use painkillers to manage the pain, with
      little or no effect. The possible beneficial effects of taking Acetyl L-carnitine is to
      prevent nerve damage as a result of anti-HIV medication.

      The main purposes of the trial are:

        -  to look at the differences in between those on Acetyl L-carnitine versus those on
           placebo

        -  to look at the effect on state of your nervous system in the two treatment groups by
           measuring nerve activity

        -  to learn more about the safety and tolerance of Acetyl L-carnitine

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged &gt; 18 years of age

          -  HIV-1 infected as documented by a licensed HIV-1 antibody ELISA

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum (beta-HCG; performed by a
             medical doctor - Austria only) pregnancy test within 28 days of starting study drug
             (and at monthly intervals for the duration for the trial (-Austria only)

          -  Ability to assess level of pain and complete a pain log

          -  Ability to understand and provide written informed consent to participation in this
             trial

          -  All clinical laboratory values must be considered not clinically significant - for the
             potential response to the planned new regimen - in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Distal diminution of either vibration sense in the legs (defined as perception
             vibration &lt; 10 seconds at the great toe with a tuning fork initially struck hard
             enough to be audible) or pain or temperature sensation.

             period.

          -  Subjects with current alcohol or illicit drug use which, in the opinion of the
