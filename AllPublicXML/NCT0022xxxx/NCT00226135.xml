      The purpose of this study is to compare lamotrigine with lithium in the long term treatment
      of bipolar disorder in terms of new episode preventive potentials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a recurrent lifelong illness. Lithium is still the drug of first choice
      in the prophylactic treatment. However, lithium’s side effects are considerable. Thus the
      interest in developing alternatives to lithium has increased, and various antiepileptic drugs
      have been studied. Among these, lamotrigine, which generally is well tolerated, has been
      evaluated in industry generated trials. However, for various reasons, the generalisability of
      the results from these studies is limited. Also the follow-up time is limited. This study is
      a pragmatic effectiveness study, overcoming some of these limitations, and comparing
      lamotrigine with that of lithium in terms of their potentials for preventing new episodes in
      patients with bipolar disorder.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Age above 18

          2. Inclusion is preceded by an affective episode requiring hospitalisation or outpatient
             drug treatment (index episode) which can be a manic episode (ICD-10 research
             criteria), a depressive episode of at least moderate degree (ICD-10 research criteria)
             or a mixed manic state (manic episode with at least additional three ICD-10 depressive
             symptoms except for difficulties with concentration or thinking, agitation or
             dyssomnia). The episode can be with or without psychotic symptoms including
             Schneiderian first-rank symptoms or bizarre delusions as long as the psychotic
             symptoms do not occur outside the affective episode.

          3. No more than 12 months may pass between the onset of the index episode (or admission
             if that is the case)and date of randomisation (in order to ensure a current risk of
             relapse as well as reliable psychopathological information).

          4. Besides the index episode, at least one previous episode must have occurred within the
             last five years which meets the criteria mentioned in point number two above. This
             episode may not necessarily have led to hospitalisation. Two episodes are separated by
             at least two months without significant symptoms or change in polarity (depression to
             mania/mixed mania or vice versa).

          5. At least one manic episode (or mixed manic episode) within the last 5 years.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Contraindications to the protocol drugs.

          2. Severe somatic disease, e.g. epilepsy, which may interfere with study treatment or
             effect evaluation.

          3. Pregnancy (or risk of pregnancy).

          4. Subject has prior to randomization received prophylactic treatment with lithium or
             lamotrigine conducted adequately in the sense of sufficient time and dose and ensuring
             compliance, and experienced a definite lack of prophylactic effect

          5. An ICD-10 diagnosis of abuse within the last year with a subsequent risk of protocol
             violation. Therefore, subjects with a secondary abuse can often be included in the
             study.

          6. Anticipated protocol violation for other reasons.

          7. No written informed consent from the subject can be obtained.

          8. The subject has previously been randomised in the study.
