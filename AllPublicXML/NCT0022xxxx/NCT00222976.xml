  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the route of administration of
      naproxen (either by mouth or rectally) influences post-vaginal delivery perineal pain
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum perineal pain is common after vaginal delivery. Naproxen suppositories have been
      shown to be effective at reducing postpartum perineal pain. To date, no studies have
      investigated the efficacy of oral naproxen for perineal pain control. Currently, rectal
      naproxen is used postpartum because of an assumption that there is a &quot;local effect&quot; compared
      to oral administration. However, this effect has never been documented in the literature.

      Principles of pharmacology dictate that the least invasive route of drug administration
      should be used when two or more routes are equally effective. If oral and rectal naproxen are
      equally efficacious at controlling post-vaginal delivery perineal pain, then current practice
      would be challenged.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the route of administration of
      naproxen influences post-vaginal delivery perineal pain control. Pain scores will be measured
      using a visual analog scale. The secondary outcome measures are three-fold: patient
      preference of route of administration, medication adverse effects, and additional requests
      for analgesia. The working hypothesis is that there is no difference in pain control between
      oral and rectal administration and that patients will prefer the oral route.
