      The purpose to measure the concentration of budesonide in breast milk of asthmatic mothers on
      their normal maintenance treatment with budesonide (Pulmicort Turbuhaler), and to estimate
      the exposure of budesonide to infants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be willing and able to comply with study procedures and provide informed consent.

             months.

          -  Be asthmatics that have been on maintenance treatment with Pulmicort Turbuhaler 200 or
             400 µg bid for at least 3 months prior to visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormalities in physical examination, laboratory assessments,
             blood pressure or pulse as judged by the investigator.

          -  Clinically relevant disease and/or abnormalities, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the patient or infant at risk because of participation in
             the study or may influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to
             participate in the study.
