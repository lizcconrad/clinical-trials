  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to examine the effect of atomoxetine on quality of life and negative
      symptoms such as social withdrawal, lack of interest in things, lack of thought content, flat
      emotions, slowed body movements and lack of drive and motivation in patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. This study also examines the safety of using
      atomoxetine along with the conventional antipsychotic in these patients.

      This study proposes to examine the effect of Atomoxetine (Strattera), a selective
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor on Negative Symptoms and Quality of Life and its safety
      when used in conjunction with an atypical antipsychotic agent in remitted community dwelling
      subjects with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder. Atomoxetine was recently approved by
      the FDA for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children and adults.
      All subjects will receive various psychometric assessments at 2-week intervals for a period
      of 26 weeks. It is hypothesized that subjects treated with Atomoxetine in this 26 week random
      assignment, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, will have a significantly
      greater improvement in quality of life and social functioning.
