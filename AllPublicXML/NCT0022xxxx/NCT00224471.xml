    <textblock>
      Evaluate, one month after the third dose, the lot-to-lot consistency of 3 different
      commercial scale production lots of the candidate vaccine in healthy HSV 1-/2- females aged
      10-17 years, determined by ELISA. Absence in significant variation for both parameters among
      the tested lots was hypothesized.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At month 0, 1 and 6, 3 groups of 184 subjects received each 3 doses of herpes simplex vaccine
      lot A, B or C, respectively. The study took 14 months to complete, including screening, and 6
      visits were required. The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA
      Amendment Act, Sep 2007.

          -  Written informed assent obtained from the subject and written informed consent
             obtained from a parent or legal guardian of the subject prior to enrolment. If the
             subject is above the legal age of consent in her country, written informed consent

             birth control for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative urine pregnancy test
             and must agree to continue such precautions for two months after completion of the
             vaccination series. Subjects who reach menarche during the study and therefore are of
             childbearing potential must agree to follow the same precautions.

          -  A subject who (or whose parents/guardian) the investigator believes can and will
             comply with the requirements of the protocol

          -  Any previous history of, or current clinical signs or symptoms of oro-labial (cold
             sores), genital or non-genital HSV disease, such as swelling, papules, vesicles,
             pustules, ulcers, crusts, fissures, erythema, discharge, pain, burning, itching,
             tingling, or dysuria.

          -  Previous vaccination against herpes.

          -  History of erythema multiforme.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study

          -  Planned administration/administration of a non-study vaccine within 30 days before and
             after the first dose of study vaccine with the following exceptions: Administration of
             routine meningococcal, hepatitis B, inactivated influenza, diphtheria/tetanus and/or
             diphtheria/tetanus containing vaccine up to 8 days before the first dose of study
             vaccine is allowed.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the study vaccines

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  History of a current acute or chronic autoimmune disease.

          -  History of any neurologic disorders or seizures, with the exception of a single
             febrile seizure during childhood.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by medical history or physical examination.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment

          -  Oral temperature ≥99.5°F (&gt; 37.5°C) / axillary temperature ≥99.5°F (&gt; 37.5°C) at the
             time of enrolment

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose or planned
             use during the study period

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study
             period.
