  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Octreotide, somatostatin and pentoxyfilline commercially available drugs that are used in
      various clinical situations. They are safe and known for years. Octreotide and somatostatin
      have been used in many studies for the prophylaxis and treatment of pancreatitis and
      post-ERCP pancreatitis, while pentoxyfilline has shown effect on patients with alcoholic
      hepatitis, obstructive vasculitis etc. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      any of those treatments for the prophylaxis and treatment of post-ERCP pancreatitis. In
      addition some molecular markers of acute and chronic inflammation will be measured before and
      after the endoscopic procedures according to the study protocol.
