  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy (LOD) is currently offered to infertile women with polycystic
      ovarian syndrome (PCOS) who fail to conceive on clomiphene citrate (CC). However, using LOD
      before CC may result in a better reproductive outcome since LOD may reduce risks associated
      with CC such as miscarriages and multiple pregnancies. The aim of the study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of LOD and its potential value in improving the success rates in infertile
      women with PCOS. This study will recruit 72 women with PCOS suffering from infertility due to
      lack of ovulation from the infertility clinic. After initial assessment, patients will be
      given explanation about the study and will receive an information leaflet. They will then be
      randomized into two groups: Group1 (36 patients) will receive CC as per infertility clinic
      protocol to induce ovulation for up to 6 months. Group 2 (36 patients) will undergo
      laparoscopic ovarian diathermy under general anaesthetic. Blood samples will be taken from
      both groups before any treatment, shortly after treatment and at 3 and 6 months after
      treatment to measure various hormones. Patients will be contacted every month after treatment
      for follow up. The reproductive outcomes particularly the pregnancy and livebirth rates will
      be compared between the two groups.
