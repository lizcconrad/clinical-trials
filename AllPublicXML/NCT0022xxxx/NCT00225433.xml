    <textblock>
      In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a common procedure used to assist couples who have difficulty
      conceiving a pregnancy. IVF is a process where oocytes (eggs) are retrieved from a woman's
      ovaries and fertilized with sperm in the laboratory. In order to maximize the number of
      oocytes that can be retrieved, a women undergoes ovarian stimulation with recombinant
      follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Typically 6-20 oocytes are retrieved, but in some cases
      there is a limited response to the stimulation, producing a limited number of oocytes. This
      is called poor ovarian response.

      This study is designed to objectively compare two treatment regimens currently advocated in
      clinical practice, but never compared directly. The purpose is to assess ovarian response to
      starting treatment at the end of the preceding cycle may increase the number of developing
      oocytes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Infertile women planning to undergo IVF

          2. Poor ovarian response in most-recent previous IVF cycle within the past 18 months as
             defined by the following criteria:

             A) &lt;5 dominant follicles day of hCG, B) &lt;5 oocytes retrieved, or C) cancellation of a
             previous IVF cycle due to poor response to ovulation stimulation.

          3. Aged 20-42 (inclusive) at the time of randomization

          4. Presence of both ovaries

          5. Normal pap smear within past three years

          6. At least 45 days after the last IVF cycle

          7. Be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study

          8. Have given written informed consent, prior to any study-related procedure, not part of
             normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the
             patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the
             medications used

          5. Abnormal, undiagnosed gynecological bleeding

          6. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to human gonadotropin preparations

          7. Simultaneous participation in another investigational drug or device trial

          9. For subjects randomized to the Luteal Phase Regimen, failure to ovulate in 2 separate
             menstrual cycle attempts, as evidenced by ovulation predictor kit, progesterone level,
             and /or visualization of corpus luteum cyst on an ovary by ultrasound exam at the
