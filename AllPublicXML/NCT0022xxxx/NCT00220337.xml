    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if lacosamide (SPM 927) is safe if taken for a
      longer period of time and whether it continues to work well to treat pain.

      Subjects will receive lacosamide at a dose that will be individually determined to be the one
      that provides most pain relief with the least side effects. The maximum dose will be
      600mg/day. Subjects may participate in this trial until October 2007. This time may be
      extended to allow them to participate until lacosamide is commercially available.

      If a subject meet the requirements for the study at Visit 1 and after a two weeks phase
      without trial medication, s/he enters a Titration Phase to determine the personal optimal
      dose of lacosamide. When this dose is reached s/he will enter the Maintenance Phase and will
      be asked to return for visits every 4 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks
      thereafter.
