      The purpose of this study is to identify genes involved in depression. Specifically, the
      investigators will analyze some genes that may be related to whether or not a person responds
      to antidepressant medication. This project is part of basic scientific research to increase
      understanding of the role of genetic influences in psychological and mental processes
      involved in the response to treatment for depression.

        Patients will be recruited from previous studies conducted at the Laboratory of Brain,
        Behavior, and Pharmacology, where subjects' response to treatment has already been
        determined. This strategy offers the advantage that no new subjects need to be enrolled in
        placebo-controlled treatment studies.
