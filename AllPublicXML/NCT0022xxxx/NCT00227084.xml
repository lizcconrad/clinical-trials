  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether Arista AH which contains microporous polysaccharides used as a powder
      applied to the wound area during mammary surgery reduces the amount of bleeding and the
      duration of surgery. Both mammae are operated on in the same procedure, and one side without
      Arista serves as control side

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the operation,before the first incision a randomization envelope is opened. Always
      starts on the same side, with or without Arista according to the envelope. After surgery,
      vacuum drains are placed and the amount of drained material and hgb content is measured 24
      hours later by nursing staff blinded to what side had Arista.Patients scores postoperative
      pain with VAS score bilaterally.

      Three months postoperatively the patients are checked by a physician blinded for what side
      had Arista
