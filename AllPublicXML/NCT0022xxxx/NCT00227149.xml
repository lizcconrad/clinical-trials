      This is a long-term evaluation follow-up study of neurocognitive performance and emotional
      state in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and a former (peg)interferon
      alfa-2b-based therapy.

      M.R. Kraus, G. Teuber, NN, NN (MPsych), M. Scheurlen

      Questions:

        -  Neurocognitive and psychiatric changes induced by interferon alfa-2b therapy in patients
           with chronic hepatitis C - are they fully reversible in long-term follow-up after the
           end of antiviral treatment?

        -  At least 12 months after the end of antiviral treatment - are neurocognitive and
           mood-related parameters even significantly improved as compared to pretreatment values?
           Is this possibly only true of patients with successful virus eradication?

        -  At least 12 months after the end of antiviral treatment, is there a significant
           difference between patients with and without sustained virological response with respect
           to neurocognitive performance, emotional state and quality of life?

        -  In the absence of clinically significant liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis
           C - does the mere presence of the hepatitis C virus have any significant influence on
           neurocognitive or attentional performance?

        -  Does the study data support an additional indication for antiviral therapy in chronic
           hepatitis C? In the case of successful virus eradication, emotional state and - above
           all - is neurocognitive performance significantly improved even in the absence of severe
           liver damage?

           difference between patients with and without sustained virological response with respect
           to neurocognitive performance, emotional state and quality of life?

        -  Can the results of the current and previous studies be confirmed by alternative /
           additional psychometric instruments in specified subsample? (Fatigue Impact Scale;
           FIS-D, SF-36)

        -  In the absence of clinically significant liver damage in patients with chronic hepatitis
           C - does the mere presence of the hepatitis C virus have any significant influence on
           neurocognitive or attentional performance?

        -  Does the study data support an additional indication for antiviral therapy in chronic
           hepatitis C? In the case of successful virus eradication, is emotional state and - above
           all - neurocognitive performance significantly improved even in the absence of severe
           liver damage?

      Methods:

        -  Multifactorial analysis of test results: pre- vs. post-therapy; sustained virological
           response vs. nonresponse/relapse.

        -  Psychometric evaluation instruments / psychometric questionnaires (HADS-D, SCL-90-R,
           Subsample : SF-36, FIS-D)

        -  Evaluation of neurocognitive performance by the Test battery of Attentional Performance
           (TAP)

        -  Evaluation in a prospective, longitudinal study design.

      Planned sample size / sample size considerations

        -  N = 150 patients (hepatitis C patients in a longitudinal study design: t1[before onset
           of interferon therapy] … t5[at least 12 months after the end of antiviral treatment]

      Power calculations / power considerations:

        -  Given: 2-factorial design (time course x SVR); type I error = 0.050; type II error =
           0.20 (power = 0.80) - as usually assumed in clinical trials.

        -  With respect to the independent factor SVR (&quot;sustained virological response&quot;, 2 factor
           levels), optimum / optimal sample sizes range from 42 (large effect size d = 0.8) to 102
           (medium effect size d = 0.5). Smaller effect sizes - according to previous work in this
           field - do not appear to bear any clinical relevance.

        -  (Pairwise comparisons of dependent samples [e.g. pre- vs. post-therapy or pre-therapy
           vs. long-term follow-up] require even smaller optimal sample sizes ranging from 16 to 43
           for large or medium effect sizes.)

      Patient recruitment:

        -  Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection and therapy with (peg)interferon alfa-2b.

        -  Patients with informed written consent (with respect) to a long-term follow-up of
           psychiatric side effects and neurocognitive performance.

        -  Patients with baseline monitoring of neuropsychiatric symptoms and neurocognitive
           performance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic hepatitis C and indication for interferon-based antiviral
             therapy.

          -  Written informed consent to study participation, especially to long-term follow-up
             monitoring of psychiatric and neurocognitive side effects of combination therapy with
             (peg)interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin.

          -  Age of study participants: between 18 and 65 years.

          -  All patients need to have documented antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and
             circulating HCV-RNA as measured by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
             (Cobas Amplicor HCV Monitor™ test, Roche Diagnostics)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Insufficient knowledge of the German language or cognitive impairment (due to the
             indispensable application of questionnaires and the TAP, test battery of attentional
             performance).

        Further Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age under 18 years or over 65 years

          -  Coinfections such as hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus

          -  Severe internal diseases (e.g., cancer, ischemic heart disease, autoimmune disease)

          -  Major depressive disorder (according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV] criteria), psychosis, active intravenous
             drug use or alcohol abuse.

        These additional exclusion criteria are important in order to avoid interfering or
        confounding effects by other variables that are not linked to the hepatitis C infection.
