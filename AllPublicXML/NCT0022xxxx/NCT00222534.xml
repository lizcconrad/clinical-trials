  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure is a common consequence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
      A concurrent metabolic alkalosis may worsen the respiratory failure, as a higher pH in blood
      (and thus in cerebrospinal fluid) results in a weaker respiratory drive. Use of diuretics is
      the most common cause of metabolic alkalosis.

      When a patient with an acute exacerbation of a respiratory failure is also alkalotic, there
      are (at least theoretical) reasons to lower the pH in order to increase the respiratory
      drive. Among other alternatives, the drug acetazolamide can be used for this purpose.

      In some hospitals there is a tradition for the use of acetazolamide on this indication, but
      any evidence for the effect of such a treatment is rather weak.

      Thus, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the effect of acetazolamide as an adjuvant
      treatment for hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of respiratory failure in
      combination with metabolic alkalosis.
