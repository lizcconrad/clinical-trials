      The purpose of this study is to determine if stem cell therapy with one's own cells
      (autologous cells) delivered intramuscularly to one's leg with ulcer and/or gangrene due to
      poor blood flow will be safe and if it will relieve leg pain, increase blood flow, and/or
      cure the leg wound.

      Chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a progressive disease, which arises as a result of
      atherosclerosis or vasculitis in leg arteries. Prognosis of chronic CLI is poor, and no
      effective treatments have been established in patients who are not eligible for the
      traditional revascularization therapies such as angioplasty and bypass procedures due to the
      inappropriate anatomy of the leg arteries or frequent reocclusion following
      revascularization. Therefore, it is necessary to establish novel revascularization treatment
      to improve prognosis of the no-option patients. We will study the safety and clinical
      efficiency of vascular regeneration by means of transplantation of autologous peripheral
      blood endothelial progenitor cells (CD34 positive cells) in patients with chronic CLI who are
      not eligible for traditional revascularization treatments. The primary endpoint is the
      primary efficacy score identified by toe brachial blood pressure index (TBPI), absolute
      claudication distance (ACD) and Wong Baker's pain rating scale, while the secondary endpoints
      are evaluation of safety, ankle brachial blood pressure index (ABPI), percutaneous tissue
      oxygen pressure (TcPO2), etc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic severe CLI patients fulfilling all the following criteria are considered
             suitable for inclusion in the study.

               1. At least 6 months since the onset of CLI (Chronic peripheral artery disease or
                  Buerger disease)

               2. Patients with luminal stenosis &gt; 50% by leg angiography

               3. Age is between 20 and 80.

               4. Patients whose Rutherford's class is II-4, III-5, or III-6（Patients with rest
                  pain or ischemic ulcer/necrosis)

               5. Patients for whom angioplasty and bypass surgery are not indicated because of
                  anatomical or procedural reasons or frequent reocclusion/ restenosis following
                  the traditional revascularization (No option patients)

               6. Patients who can give informed consent themselves in writing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any one of the following exclusion criteria is sufficient to disqualify a patient from
             the study.

               1. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 25%

               2. Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions or side effects to G-CSF
                  preparations or apheresis.

               4. Patients with unstable angina, with a treatment rating of 3 in the Braunwald
                  system, but a severity of III and a clinical rating of B or C.

               5. Patients with diabetic proliferating retinopathy (new Fukuda classification BI to
                  BV).

              19. Patients with gait disturbance for reasons other than CLI (such as sciatic
                  neuralgia, or vasculitis), making exercise tolerance evaluation on a treadmill
                  with stress ECG difficult.

              20. Pregnant or nursing patients, those who may be pregnant, or those who plan on
