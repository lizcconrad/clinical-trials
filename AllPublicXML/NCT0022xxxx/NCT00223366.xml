    <textblock>
      This protocol is for a number of in vitro studies using human surgical biopsies and
      evaluating the pharmacology and genetics of human nociceptors (&quot;pain detecting&quot;) neurons

      Purpose/Objectives

      a. Specific Aims Specific Aim 1: Characterize in humans the effects of inflammation and
      neuronal degeneration on peripheral levels of NPY, and related Y receptors (Y1, Y2, Y5) in
      periradicular tissue.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine whether NPY inhibits neurosecretion from peripheral terminals of
      capsaicin-sensitive neurons innervating normal versus inflamed tissue.

      Specific Aim 3: Determine whether peripheral administration of NPY is analgesic and/or
      anti-allodynic in patients experiencing spontaneous pain and mechanical allodynia in a
      clinical model of inflammation with associated neuronal degeneration.

      Specific Aim 4: Evaluate whether population characteristics are associated with altered pain
      reports. First, we will determine whether patients with the C1128 single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) of the PreProNPY gene, whose phenotype confers substantially augmented
      peripheral NPY neurosecretion, report less pain compared with patients without this genetic
      polymorphism. Second, we will determine whether ethnic/cultural factors associated with an
      underserved minority population (Hispanics in the San Antonio area) are associated with
      altered pain reports.

    <time_frame>Immediately following tooth extraction and dental pulp procurement.</time_frame>
    <description>Extracted human teeth are sectioned to obtain the crown dental pulp which is placed in a well plate. The pulp is moved every twenty minutes through proprietary substances for a total of 60 to 120 minutes depending on the specific experiment. After each 20 minute fraction, the buffer solution in each well plate is collected, labeled and placed in the -80 freezer along with the pulp sample.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Altered pain reports.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hour post-tooth extraction.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients provide perceived pain within the first 24 hours post-extraction via a take-home pain postcard. The postcard has a Visual Analog Scale pain graft that the patient marks and returns via mail.</description>
