      To look at the cognitive effects of abilify in children with a primary diagnosis of Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. To examine the safety, effectiveness and tolerability of
      abilify in children with a primary diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

      This will be a prospective, open-label, 6-week trial of APZ in outpatient children 8-12 years
      of age with a primary diagnosis of ADHD free of other major psychopathology. The six-week
      treatment phase will be proceeded by a 1-3 week screening phase.

      The study cohort will consist of 10 children with ADHD combined type and 10 children with
      ADHD predominantly inattentive type who complete the study.

      Cognitive measures will be assessed prior to APZ therapy and after 6 weeks of APZ treatment.

      Safety assessments and measures of ADHD symptomatology will be collected prior to and during
      APZ therapy.

      While receiving APZ treatment, patients will be seen at baseline, Week 1,2,3,4, and 6.

             diagnosis of ADHD (either predominantly inattentive type or combined type) based on
             the results of semi-structured diagnostic assessment (K-SADS-PL)(Kaufman et al., 1997)
             and based on the results of a clinical interview with a child and adolescent
             psychiatrist

          3. Patients with an active or prior neurological/medical disorder for which treatment
             with APZ would be contraindicated (such as tardive dyskinesia or neuroleptic malignant
             syndrome)

         15. Patients who are unable to swallow pills or capsules

         16. Patients for whom the need for hospitalization during the course of the study appears
