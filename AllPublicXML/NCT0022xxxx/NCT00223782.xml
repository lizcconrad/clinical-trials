  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether individuals with diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy can learn to change the way they walk in order to reduce the pressures underneath
      the feet, which may lead to a reduced risk of foot ulceration.

      This study suggests that teaching a new strategy is beneficial to decrease the forefoot peak
      plantar pressure in individuals who are susceptible to plantar ulcerations. It has not,
      however, been studied whether these changes would be maintained long-term or if they had any
      effect on the ulceration rate. Additionally, no analysis of the amount of visual feedback
      necessary to elicit the desired motor pattern was discussed. It has been suggested that
      proprioception plays an integral role in the use of feedback to develop error-detection
      mechanisms by integrating visual feedback and kinesthetic variables. In the diabetic
      peripheral neuropathy subject population, proprioception and kinesthesia may be compromised.
      This may have effects on the ability of this population to maintain changes in inappropriate
      movement patterns. A significant portion of patients continue to develop plantar ulcers even
      with prescriptive footwear compliance, so gait training to change inappropriate patterns
      which result in the high plantar pressures may be critical to prevent ulceration.

      Comparisons: Two groups of subjects will receive gait training, one group will receive
      feedback of performance while the other will only receive training, and one control group.
      Comparisons will include whether plantar pressures are decreased in the training groups, and
      if those changes are maintained long-term.
