  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to construct a prognostic model to identify risks of poor outcomes
      at one year following hospital discharge of patients treated in an ambulatory cate setting.
      The study will incorporate pre-hospitalization characteristics, hospitalization events,
      comorbidity burden, psychosocial measures and post-hospitalization care characteristics to
      predict re-hospitalization and mortality at one year.

      This model will identify potentially modifiable variables in the post-hospitalization clinic
      setting that result in increased rates of hospital readmission and mortality. Specifically,
      it is hypothesized that longer time to first outpatient visit after hospitalization, multiple
      providers, poor follow-up with scheduled appointment and discrepancies between discharge and
      outpatient medication lists will be predictors of adverse outcomes. Utilizing statistical
      modeling methods, it will be possible to recognize at risk patients, to identify modifiable
      risk factors and outpatient care characteristics, and in the future, to direct patient
      specific interventions to improve outcomes.
