    <textblock>
      Subjects completing the HMR 1726D/2001 study are given the opportunity to continue or switch
      to teriflunomide for 528 weeks or until teriflunomide is commercially available in the
      country where patient lives;

        -  subjects on Teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg continue on the same dose of teriflunomide.

        -  subjects on placebo are randomized to teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg.

      The total study period per subject is 532 weeks or until teriflunomide is commercially
      available in the country where patient lives, broken up as follows:

        -  Treatment: 528 weeks or until teriflunomide is commercially available in the country
           where patient lives,

        -  Post-washout follow-up: 4 weeks after last treatment intake.
