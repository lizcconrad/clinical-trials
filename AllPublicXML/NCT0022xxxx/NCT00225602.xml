      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of assertive community treatment in Copenhagen
      in two regions compared with two regions where this treatment was not implemented. The effect
      on user satisfaction, use of bed days, social network, global assessment of functioning,
      substance misuse will be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      In area where assertive community treatment was implemented 100 patients had filled in a form
      regarding their social situation. They were interviewed after one year and asked about user
      satisfaction and followed up in Danish registers. Register information was extracted
      concerning vital status, cause of death, use of psychiatric services and criminal record. The
      same procedure was carried out for a comparison group, carefully matched, from other regions
      in Copenhagen, where assertive community treatment was not implemented.
