  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at the stress hormone response to medication-induced
      stress and a placebo (an inactive compound) in non-drinking, recovering male and female
      alcoholics, with a specific emphasis on the differences between men and women in the two
      recovering alcoholic groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women and men differ in the ways stress affects the development and maintenance of
      alcoholism. However, no published studies in alcohol dependent patients have examined sex
      differences in stress responsiveness that most likely mediate these effects and influence the
      clinical course and treatment of the disorder.

      The long-range goal of this research program is to define aspects of the neural, genetic and
      environmental mechanisms differentially regulating the stress response in alcohol dependent
      women and men. The proposed study extends prior work revealing sex-dependent alterations in
      basal and serotonin-induced stress hormone concentrations in abstinent alcoholics. Our
      central hypothesis is that sex differences in serotonin function or HPA sensitivity conspire
      with genetically influenced alterations in serotonin signaling to produce maladaptive stress
      responses in some alcoholic women. These altered stress responses may serve as the target of
      novel, sex-specific pharmacotherapies.

          -  Are actively engaged in a recovery program for alcoholism;

          -  Have a current (within the past 12 months) diagnosis of DSM-IV alcohol dependence in
             early- (modified to a minimum of 4 months) full remission; and

          -  Are residing in a controlled sober living environment; and

          -  Agree to provide at least one collateral informant who knows the subject well and can

          -  Are pregnant, or planning to become pregnant during the next 9 months;

          -  Have taken other psychotropic drugs (including SSRIs, MAO inhibitors and other
             antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics or
             hypnotics) within 6 weeks of the first laboratory session;

          -  Have taken any investigational drug within 90 days of the first laboratory session; or

          -  Are making efforts to quit smoking or have taken any pharmacotherapies for smoking
             cessation (i.e., bupropion, nicotine-replacement patches or gum; clonidine, buspirone)
             within 90 days of the first laboratory session.
