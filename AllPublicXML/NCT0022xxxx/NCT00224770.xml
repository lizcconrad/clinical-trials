      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety of using a combination of minimally
      invasive surgery and clot lysis with rt-PA to remove intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The ICES
      arm of the trial will determine the safety of endoscopic surgery to remove ICH. All MISTIE
      intention to treat subjects represent the hypothesized test group. The ICES cohort is to be
      analyzed separately.

      The purpose of this trial is to determine the safety of using a combination of minimally
      invasive surgery and clot lysis with rt-PA to remove intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The
      procedure is to use image-based surgery (MRI or CT) to provide catheter access to ICH for the
      intervention, which is a one-time clot aspiration followed by instillation of rt-PA over 72
      hours.

      The Intraoperative stereotactic CT-guided Endoscopic Surgery (ICES) arm of the trial will
      determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of endoscopic surgery to remove ICH. This
      tests the first step of the MISTIE surgical procedure with an endoscope, not a rigid cannula.

      We propose to test if these interventions facilitate more rapid and complete recovery of
      function and decreased mortality from this condition compared to conventional medical
      management without subjecting the patient to craniotomy. The specific objective of this trial
      is to test the safety of these interventions and assess their ability to remove blood clot
      from brain tissue.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>110 patients were randomized to the trial, and 31 were recruited as pilot patients.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Each study center was required to demonstrate proficiency in the technical aspects of enrollment, stabilization, surgery, and drug administration. This proficiency was demonstrated on at least one pilot patient prior to randomization of the first patient in the investigational cohort of 110 randomized patients.</pre_assignment_details>

The mRS measures the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale ranges from 0-6: (0) no symptoms at all, (1) no significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities, (2) slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance, (3) moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance, (4) moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, (5) severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention, (6) dead.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with dichotomized mRS score in 0-3 range. The mRS measures the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The scale ranges from 0-6: (0) no symptoms at all, (1) no significant disability despite symptoms; able to carry out all usual duties and activities, (2) slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities, but able to look after own affairs without assistance, (3) moderate disability; requiring some help, but able to walk without assistance, (4) moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, (5) severe disability; bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention, (6) dead</description>
