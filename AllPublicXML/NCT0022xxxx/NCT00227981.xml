  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious medical illness that can recur more than once in a person's lifetime.
      Effective treatment methods are needed to maintain a state of remission in people who have
      had prior episodes of depression. IPT is a brief and highly structured type of psychotherapy
      that addresses interpersonal issues associated with depression. Previous studies have shown
      that it is an effective method for treating depression. This study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of maintenance ITP in preventing relapse of depression in women who have
      required combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment to obtain remission of
      depressive symptoms.

      Participants in this open label study will be recruited from a previous study, &quot;Maintenance
      Psychotherapy in Recurrent Depression: Study I.&quot; In this study participants will initially
      receive weekly sessions of IPT as well as medication treatment with fluoxetine. Any
      participants who do not reach remission of depressive symptoms after 6 weeks will be given
      other standard treatments for depression. Once remission of depressive symptoms is reached,
      participants will continue receiving weekly IPT and fluoxetine treatment for 20 weeks. After
      20 weeks, fluoxetine treatment will be discontinued, and all participants will receive IPT
      alone for 6 weeks before entering the maintenance phase of the study. Upon entrance into this
      phase, participants will be randomly assigned to receive IPT weekly, biweekly, or monthly for
      18 months. Functioning and depressive symptoms will be assessed at Month 24.
