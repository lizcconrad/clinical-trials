      In this phase II study besides evaluating for safety, the primary efficacy parameter is to
      evaluate the incidence of patients who have had a response to Trisenox by evidence of
      increased blood counts (red, white, or platelets) and/or by decrease or transfusion
      dependency. The secondary efficacy parameter is the assessment of the tolerability of the new
      dosing schedule.

      Arsenic trioxide will be administered intravenously over 1 to 2 hours with a loading dose of
      0.30mg/kg for days 1-5 of the first week and then twice weekly for 27 weeks for a total of 28
      weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Myelodysplastic Syndrome by FAB. Can be made with cytogenetic analysis of
             Bone Marrow or Hematologist evaluation

          -  Patient must have had bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to confirm diagnosis within 60
             days prior to treatment

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  An EKG must be performed within 7 days prior to treatment to confirm QT interval
             &lt;460msec.

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Serum bilirubin less than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Serum potassium greater than or equal to 4.0 mEq/dL and serum magnesium greater than
             or equal to 1.8 mg/dL. If these serum electrolytes are below the specified limits on
             the baseline laboratory tests, electrolytes should be administered to bring the serum
             concentrations to these levels before administering arsenic trioxide.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age to participate in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing women, and men or women of childbearing potential who are
             unwilling to employ adequate contraception.

          -  Corrected QT interval of greater than or equal to 460msec in the presence of serum
             potassium and magnesium values within normal range.

          -  Significant CHF, coronary is ischemia or serious Arrhythmias including conduction
             delays.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy greater than or equal to 2.

          -  Evidence of active infection

          -  Concurrent treatment with maintenance therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, or
             investigational agents.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with the treatment protocol, follow up, or
             research tests.
