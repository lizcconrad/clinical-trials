      Depression is a serious illness that can interfere with a person's ability to work, study,
      sleep, eat, and enjoy activities that once were pleasurable. It is characterized by several
      symptoms, such as the following: persistent sad, anxious, or &quot;empty&quot; mood; feelings of
      hopelessness or pessimism; and feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness. If left
      untreated, depression symptoms can last for years, and may worsen as time goes on. Even with
      treatment, however, it is possible for depression to recur. Remission is a main goal in the
      treatment of depression and it may be accomplished through various strategies. This study
      will evaluate the effectiveness of five combinations of treatments, including medication
      therapy and psychotherapy, in maintaining remission of depression symptoms.

      All participants in this study will first be treated with imipramine for 7 to 11 months. Once
      remission of depression symptoms has been achieved and maintained for 20 weeks, participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of the following five maintenance treatments for 36 months:
      psychotherapy plus imipramine; psychotherapy plus placebo; psychotherapy alone; medication
      clinic treatment plus imipramine; or medication clinic treatment plus placebo. Assessments
      will be made at Weeks 12 and 20 and Months 7, 11, and 36, and will include the time it takes
      for depression symptoms to recur, as well as scores on depression and mania severity scales.
