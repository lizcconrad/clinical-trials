  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a common surgical procedure performed in people with hip
      osteoarthritis and appears to be effective in relieving pain and improving function. However
      significant wasting and weakness of the hip and knee muscles persists post-operatively.
      Although relief of pain and improvement of function are important outcomes following THR,
      weakness of the hip and knee muscles reduces a person's ability to manage stairs, slopes,
      public transport and results in persistent gait abnormalities. Since lower limb weakness is
      one of the risk factors for falls, it is important that patients undergo a strengthening
      program post-operatively. The hypothesis is that lower limb strength and function will be
      better in patients who undergo a strengthening program post-operatively than in those who
      have usual care.

      Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a common surgical procedure performed in people with hip
      osteoarthritis and appears to be effective in relieving pain and improving function. However
      significant quadriceps atrophy and weakness persist post-operatively. Although relief of pain
      and improvement of function are important outcomes following THR, weakness of the hip and
      knee muscles reduces a person's ability to manage stairs, slopes, public transport and
      results in persistent gait abnormalities. Since lower limb weakness is one of the risk
      factors for falls, it is important that this is appropriately addressed.

      The study examines the effect of an eight-week task-specific strengthening program on lower
      limb function in patients following THR in a randomized controlled trial. The experimental
      program is being conducted as a circuit in a gymnasium environment. Changes on specific
      measures of physical function of patients in the Experimental Group will be compared with
      those of patients in a Control Group who will continue with the standard care program
      provided at Austin Health.

      Outcome measures include:lower limb muscle strength using a step test, pain, stiffness, and
      function as reported on the WOMAC questionnaire, quality of life using the AQoL
      questionnaire, the Timed Up-and-Go test. Walking tests will also be conducted. These include:

        1. Walking pattern, recorded on an instrumented mat

        2. Walking endurance measured by the 6-minute walk test.

        3. Analysis of hip joint torques using 3-D motion analysis.
