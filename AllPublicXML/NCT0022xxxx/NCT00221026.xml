      his study will explore the safety and activity of ECP treatment with UVADEX in inducing a
      clinical response (i.e., a CDAI decrease greater than or equal to 100 from baseline and/or a
      CDAI &lt; 150) over a 12-week period in moderately active Crohn's disease (CDAI greater than or
      equal to 220 to &lt; 450) patients who are refractory or intolerant to immunosuppressants and/or
      anti-TNF agents. This study will also assess response to continued treatment during a 12-week
      Extension Period in patients who have a clinical response at Week 12 of the Treatment Period
      and elect to participate in the Extension Period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed and dated informed consent must be obtained prior to conducting any study
             procedure.

          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have a body weight greater than or equal to 40 kg (88 lb).

          -  Patients must have had Crohn's disease for at least 6 months duration (with colitis,
             ileitis, or ileocolitis) confirmed by radiography or endoscopy.

          -  Patients must have a CDAI greater than or equal to 220 to &lt; 450.

          -  Patients must have a CRP concentration &gt; 10.0 mg/L (1.0 mg/dL) or evidence of active
             inflammatory luminal Crohn's disease as demonstrated by superficial and/or deep
             ulcerations, pseudopolyps, and/or ulcerated stenosis on colonoscopy within 8 weeks of
             screening.

          -  Patients who are receiving corticosteroids must be on a prednisone equivalent dose
             less than or equal to 25 mg/day or an oral (PO) budesonide dose less than or equal to
             9 mg/day.

          -  Patients who are receiving any of the following concomitant Crohn's disease
             medications must have been on a stable dose of these medications for the specified
             period of time PRIOR TO confirmation of eligibility (this time period may include
             screening): aminosalicylates, antibiotics, and immunosuppressants (i.e., 6 MP, MTX, or
             AZA) for at least 4 weeks; corticosteroids or PO budesonide for at least 2 weeks;
             anti-TNF agents (i.e., infliximab or adalimumab) for at least 8 weeks.

          -  Patients who have failed treatment with immunosuppressants and/or anti-TNF agents.

          -  Patients who have fistulae are permitted, provided: patients have predominantly
             luminal Crohn's disease, and fistulae are not associated with abscess formation.

          -  Patients must have a platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000/microL (50.0 x
             109/L).

          -  Female patients must be: postmenopausal, surgically incapable of bearing children, or
             practicing an acceptable method of birth control (acceptable methods include hormonal
             contraceptives, intrauterine device, and spermicide and barrier). Abstinence or
             partner/spouse sterility may also qualify at the Investigator's discretion. If a
             female patient is of childbearing potential, she must have a negative urine pregnancy
             test at screening. Male patients must also commit to using adequate contraceptive
             precautions (condoms). All patients (both males and females of childbearing potential)
             must commit to using adequate contraceptive precautions throughout their participation
             in the study and for at least 3 months following their last ECP treatment

          -  Patients must be able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are concomitantly using biologic agents other than anti-TNF agents;
             cyclosporine (CSA), tacrolimus (FK506), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or
             investigational Crohn's disease therapies.

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, may not be able to remain on a
             stable dose of a concomitant Crohn's disease medication during the 12-week Treatment
             Period.

          -  Patients with currently symptomatic untreated diarrhea, due to conditions other than
             inflammatory Crohn's disease (e.g., bacterial or parasitic gastroenteritis, bile salt
             diarrhea, or bacterial overgrowth).

          -  Patients with symptomatic intestinal strictures.

          -  Patients with stomas.

          -  Patients with other local manifestations of Crohn's disease such as abscesses, or
             other disease manifestations for which surgery might be indicated, or which might
             preclude utilization of a CDAI to assess response to therapy (such as &quot;short gut&quot;
             syndrome).

          -  Patients who are unable to tolerate the extracorporeal volume shifts associated with
             ECP treatment due to the presence of any of the following conditions: uncompensated

             disease, severe asthma, renal failure, or hepatic failure.

          -  Patients receiving total parenteral nutrition, as the sole source of nutrition, within
             3 weeks of screening.

             10.0 g/dL at screening.

          -  Patients with a poor tolerability of venipuncture or a lack of adequate venous access
             for required treatments and blood sampling.

          -  Patients who have a known hypersensitivity or allergy to psoralen (methoxsalen).

          -  Patients who have a known hypersensitivity or allergy to both heparin and citrate
             products.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant and/or lactating.

          -  Patients who have been enrolled in any investigational study for the treatment of
             Crohn's disease within 4 weeks of enrollment for non biologic therapies and within 8
             weeks of enrollment for biologic therapies.

          -  Patients who have any of the following: a co-existing melanoma, squamous cell skin
             carcinoma, aphakia, photosensitive disease (e.g., porphyria, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, or albinism), a white blood cell count &gt; 25,000 mm3, a previous
