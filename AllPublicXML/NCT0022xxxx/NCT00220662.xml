      This research examines the efficacy of a 5-session individual psychotherapy intervention
      designed to enhance readiness and motivation for change in individuals with anorexia nervosa,
      bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified.

      It is hypothesized that individuals randomly assigned to receive Readiness and Motivation
      Therapy (RMT) will have higher readiness and motivation scores and improved eating disorder
      and psychiatric symptomatology following the intervention than individuals assigned to a
      no-treatment control condition.

      Readiness and motivation for change is a significant concern in the treatment of individuals
      with eating disorders, as evidenced by frequent treatment drop-out, refusal, and relapse.
      This research examines the efficacy of a 5-session intervention designed to enhance readiness
      and motivation for change in individuals with anorexia nervosa. A manualized treatment
      protocol of Readiness and Motivation therapy (RMT) has been developed. It is hypothesized
      that individuals randomly assigned to RMT will have improved readiness and motivation for
      change as assessed using the Readiness and Motivation Interview (RMI) at post-treatment,
      3-month, and one-year follow-up than individuals assigned to a no treatment control
      condition. If RMT proves to be effective, it could be added to the menu of treatment options,
      to permit for better tailoring of treatment to client readiness for change.
