      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of high frequency TENS and compare to
      the placebo effect by sham TENS in a randomized control study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 50% of American women suffered from dysmenorrhea and 10% of them will take sick leave
      for 1-2 days. Previous randomized control studies have demonstrated the pain relief effect of
      using high frequency TENS in dysmenorrheal pain. However, no investigation has been conducted
      to investigate the effect of high frequency TENS in female population in our country. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of high frequency TENS and compare to the
      placebo effect by sham TENS in a randomized control study.
