      Inhibition of gastric acid is the key to satisfactory relief of symptoms with esomeprazole in
      NUD patients

    <textblock>
      Enrolled patients will undergo 24h gastric pH monitoring and subsequently (if gastric pH
      drops below pH 4 during 24h monitoring) will be randomized to receive placebo (40 mg QD) or
      esomeprazole (40 mg QD) for 16 weeks of therapy. 24h gastric pH monitoring will be repeated
      2nd and 3rd time in all participating patients at the end of 4th and 8th weeks of therapy.
      Additionally, in all participants NUD symptoms will be re-assessed at the end of 4th, 8th,
      12th and 16th weeks of therapy.

        unrelated to exercise.

        C. Patients may have other symptoms of NUD including heartburn, regurgitation, bloating
        (abdominal distension), early satiety (feeling of fullness), belching (burping), or nausea;
        however, the dominant symptom must be epigastric pain/discomfort.

        D. Capable of and willing to give informed consent and comply with all study requirements.

        Exclusion criteria:

        A. H. pylori positive serology. B. Regular use of NSAIDs or more than 100 mg of aspirin. C.
        Patients requiring chronic treatment with any medication inducing GI symptoms (e.g.,
        certain antibiotics, codeine, etc.).

        D. History or presence of endoscopic/radiological evidence of esophagitis. E. History or
        presence of chronic gastric or duodenal ulcer. F. History or presence of duodenal erosions.
        G. History or previous upper GI surgery. H. Presence of concomitant symptoms of irritable
        bowel syndrome (IBS) as assessed by three or more of the Manning or Rome criteria.

        I. History or presence of other known organic disease that might explain the dyspepsia
        symptoms (e.g., symptomatic gallstones).

        J. Pregnancy or lactation. K. Inadequate contraception. L. Regular consumption of greater
        than 2 fluid ounces of beverage alcohol (corresponding to 2 cocktails or 40 fluid ounces of

        M. History of substance abuse. N. Unwillingness or expected inability to tolerate absence
        of antisecretory medications (antacids, H2 receptor antagonists or PPIs or other GI
        pharmacotherapy for a period of time of study protocol (16 weeks maximum).
