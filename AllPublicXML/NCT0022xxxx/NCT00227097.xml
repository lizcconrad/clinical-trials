  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the project &quot;Educ'Avk&quot;, is to document the efficacy of a strategy combining
      a specific follow up-notebook and education of attending patient with a pedagogic support,
      comparatively to an usual education on the impact of clinical events at three months (minor
      or major hemorrhagic events + recurrence of thrombi-embolic's disease).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard strategies for the implementation of recommendations are exclusively focused on
      practitioners. But often they do not appear to be effective (insufficient time accorded per
      patient, lack of training…).

      However some qualitative surveys have shown the benefit of a greater role on the part patient
      in the process of transmitting recommendations through the practitioner.

      In this study, patient education is begun by the angiologist or a pharmacy student under the
      responsibility of the hospital investigator. Follow-up is realized by the patient’s general
      practitioner.

      More patient involvement in the realization of the recommendations could increase the
      proportion of practitioners who follow the recommendations and decrease the iatrogenicity of
      antivitamin K (AVK).
