  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated study whose primary aim is to determine the effectiveness
      of aripiprazole (AbilifyÂ®) in helping persons with symptoms of mania whose current
      medications do not completely control those symptoms. Aripiprazole is a medication that has
      been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      Schizophrenia.

      A secondary aim of this research is to explore whether CYP 2D6 polymorphisms are related to
      side effects with aripiprazole. The goal of this research is to identify individuals who
      metabolize aripiprazole more rapidly or slowly, which will potentially help the clinician
      make dosing adjustments and decrease the risk of adverse events.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of
      aripiprazole for the treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. The
      secondary aim of this study is to determine if common polymorphic variations in the CYP 2D6
      gene underlie the inter-individual variability in aripiprazole systemic drug exposure and the
      occurrence of treatment emergent side effects.
