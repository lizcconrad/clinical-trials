  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The allograft of marrow in its technique of reference (myélo-ablative (MA) condition by
      cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) with strong amounts) therapeutic is
      recognized acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) of the adult for the patients of less than 55 years,
      because it offers chances of cure higher than chemotherapy or the auto-graft. However,
      mortality related to the traditional graft is approximately 30% to 1 year. The recent use of
      the non-myélo-ablative graft (NMA), in which the anti-leukaemia effect rests exclusively on
      the allogenic effect &quot;graft-versus-leukaemia&quot; makes it possible to obtain among patients of
      more than 55 years in complete reemission (CR), survivals without relapses comparable with
      the traditional allograft among patients of more than 35 years. The major interest of NMA
      graft is to reduce early mortality related to the graft. This reduction should be all the
      more significant as the patient is younger, and thus bring to a better survival. There is
      not, at the present hour, of prospective comparative study of the two procedures of graft.
      Taking into account the results observed after NMA graft among patients of more than 55
      years, and taking into account the toxicity of the standard graft between 35 and 55 years, it
      is essential to now compare the 2 approaches among patients who do not have a
      counter-indication for one or the other, in the age bracket where the toxicity of the
      traditional graft is highest.

      Will not be included in CR1 nor the patients with good forecast under chemotherapy, (Inv 16;
      t(8;21)), nor patients at the very high risk of relapse (anomalies complex cytogenetics). The
      conditioning of MA graft will be Cyclophosphamide and ICT with strong amounts. NMA graft will
      be made according to the protocol Seattle (fludarabine 30 mg/m2/j X 3 and ICT of 2 Gy). The
      study will be undertaken in 12 French centers of allograft taking part in the protocols
      ESPARTO or EORTC.
