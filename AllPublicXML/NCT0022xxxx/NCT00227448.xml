      The ultimate goal of this multicenter, phase II study is to increase blood pressure until
      either a neurologic response is seen or a target mean arterial pressure of 30% above baseline
      is achieved. IV fluids, IV phenylephrine and/or IV norepinephrine are used to rapidly raise
      mean arterial pressure in a controlled manner as serial assessments of neurologic function
      are performed.

      This is a multicenter, pilot clinical trial. The primary outcome variables will be the
      presence or absence of improvement in NIHSS during treatment with induced hypertension and
      the number of adverse events. The secondary outcome variables will be final infarct size on
      MRI at 1 month and Barthel Index and Modified Rankin Scale at 3 months.

      All patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who are willing to
      participate will receive intervention to induce hypertension, including intravenous saline,
      phenylephrine (neosynephrine) or levophed, and possibly oral midodrine. Blood pressure will
      be increased to a maximum mean arterial pressure (MAP) that is 30% above the baseline MAP as
      measured in the emergency department. The acute phase of the study will last for 3-5 days
      (for responders) and all patients will be followed up at 1 and 3 months post stroke onset.
      All patients will undergo neurologic, cognitive, and physical examinations as well as serial
      MRI studies with diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging.

      Primary hypotheses will be measured using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
      (NIHSS) and MRI. Improvement following induced hypertension will be measured by comparing
      NIHSS performed at multiple time points throughout the study. The ability to predict
      diffusion-perfusion mismatch will be determined by comparing MRI #1 and MRI #2. NIHSS and MRI
      will also be compared to determine if NIHSS correlates with reperfusion area on MRI.

      The secondary hypothesis of improved long-term outcome will be measured using the Barthel
      Index, the modified Rankin Scale, and MRI/Flair at 1 and 3 months post stroke symptom onset.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with acute ischemic stroke in whom treatment can be initiated within 12 hours
             of a clearly defined symptom onset. (If the patient awakens with a deficit, time of
             onset is considered the time the patient was last seen functioning normally.)

          -  Age older then 18 years of age.

          -  Measurable neurologic deficit other than isolated facial weakness, sensory loss or
             ataxia. NIHSS must be &gt; 4 points.

          -  Head CT showing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass lesion which might
             increase the risk of bleeding.

          -  Absence of ischemic changes on EKG (i.e. &gt; than 1mm ST segment elevation or depression
             in at least two contiguous leads, new T waves inversion in two leads).

          -  No contraindication to MRI studies, including allergy to gadolinium.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of unstable angina, any recent angina (defined as chest pain) in the past 3
             months, recent myocardial infarction (less then 3 months), any history of ventricular
             arrhythmia, presence of left ventricular bundle branch block on EKG.

          -  History of severe and symptomatic cardiac valvular disease.

          -  History of congestive heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic obstructive
             cardiomyopathy, or known ejection fraction &lt; 25%.
