      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Chemotherapy drugs may have different effects in older patients.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well docetaxel works in treating older patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the quality of life of older patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the mood status and autonomy of activity of patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV twice in week 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed during study therapy in weeks 3-4, 7-8, and 11-12, and then at 6
      and 12 months after completion of study treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58 patients will be accrued for this study.
