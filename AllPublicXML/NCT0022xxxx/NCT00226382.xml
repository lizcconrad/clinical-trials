      This study is to investigate the HBV DNA suppression (and HBeAg seroconversion among HBeAg
      positive patients) pegylated interferon treatment at 24 weeks after end of treatment among
      patients who have failed anti-viral treatment in the past.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B is the commonest cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in
      Hong Kong. Persistent high viraemia and necro-inflammation is associated with higher risk of
      liver-related complications.

      Lamivudine and adefovir dipivoxil are the two anti-viral agents that can suppress the
      replication of the virus. However, these drugs using either alone or in combination only
      induce HBeAg seroconversion in less than 20% of patients. Most patients therefore required
      long-term treatment, which has a risk of development of drug resistance. Premature cessation
      of these anti-viral agents is usually accompanied by relapse of viraemia and hepatitis.

      Pegylated interferon-alfa-2a is modified form of interferon with a 40 kDa polyethylene glycol
      strand attached to a recombinant interferon. This formulation increases the product's
      half-life from 7-10 hours to 77 hours. Therefore it can be administered on a more convenient
      once weekly basis. Pegylated interferon-alfa-2a monotherapy for 24 weeks has been shown to
      induce sustained HBeAg seroconversion in 35% of patients at the optimal dose of 180 mcg
      weekly. This drug has been found to be more effective than conventional interferon-alfa in
      the treatment of chronic hepatitis B as well as chronic hepatitis C.

      Data on interferon-based treatment among chronic hepatitis B patients who have failed
      previous anti-viral treatment is scanty. It is uncertain whether pegylated interferon-alfa-2a
      treatment will be effective in this group of patients. This is a single-center, pilot study
      on the virological response of chronic HBV infection to pegylated interferon-alfa-2a among
      patients who have failed anti-viral treatment in the past. This study will investigate the
      HBV DNA suppression (and HBeAg seroconversion among HBeAg positive patients) pegylated
      interferon treatment at 24 weeks after end of treatment.
