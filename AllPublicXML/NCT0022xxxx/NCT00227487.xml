      The purpose of the study is to find correlations between non-invasive fecal tests of
      intestinal inflammation and macro- and microscopic evaluation of duodenal and colonic
      histology, disaccharidase activity, and intestinal permeability in children with autism.

    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal disorders in children with autism receive little attention. However,
      symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and flatulence have been considered
      contributing to the behavioral problems. These symptoms are associated partially with the
      deficiency of enzymes digesting carbohydrates and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.
      The effect of intestinal inflammation on neurological disorders experienced by autistic
      children remains unclear. We will study this problem using recently developed non-invasive
      tests based on two proteins (calprotectin and lactoferrin) analysis in children's stool.
      Activity of enzymes needed for carbohydrate digestion will be tested in small samples of
      intestinal tissue. Intestinal permeability will be assessed by measuring urinary excretion of
      carbohydrate substances (lactulose and rhamnose) administered via the endoscope. This test
      will help to determine if intestinal inflammation contributes to a &quot;leaky&quot; gut syndrome. The
      study will provide valuable information for understanding the association between
      gastrointestinal disease and behavioral problems in autistic children.

    <description>A carbohydrate solution (lactulose + rhamnose dissolved in tap water) will be administered during the procedure (upper endoscopy) through a catheter directly into the duodenum to allow for intestinal permeability analysis.
Clinically indicated pinch biopsies will then be obtained.
The endoscopy procedures will take at least 1 - 1 ½ hours.
Children will then typically recover in the endoscopy suite for 2 - 2½ hours or less, if the child is medically cleared to leave the endoscopy suite sooner.
Urine for intestinal permeability analysis will be collected during 5 hours after carbohydrate solution administration. If the child has not voided, an additional 60 minutes will be allowed for the child to void. If the child is not continent for urine, a bag will be applied to catch the specimen.</description>

    <description>Parents/legal guardians of subjects will be asked to complete five (5) questionnaires: the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Inventory; a Developmental Screening for Autism - based on the child's age, either the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), or the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ); the Behavior and Sensory Interest Questionnaire (BSI), the Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI), and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). It should take parents/guardians no longer than eighty-five (85) minutes to complete all 5 surveys. Results from these questionnaires will be correlated with documented gastrointestinal and/or neurological diagnostic information from subject medical records and with research study test results.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 months to 17 years inclusive.

          -  Subjects referred to a Massachusetts General Hospital for Children (MGH Main Campus or
             satellite clinic) for pediatric care or pediatric gastroenterology care.

          -  Subjects with documented gastrointestinal symptoms requiring endoscopy and duodenal
             pinch biopsy for disaccharidase activity evaluation for the standard medical treatment
             of gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e. endoscopy and biopsy cannot be performed solely for
             research purposes).

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Use of any proteolytic digestive enzyme supplements: prescription or over-the-counter
             (e.g., Pancrease [Creon-10], Lactase, etc.) up to 7 days prior to EGD with biopsy.

          -  Diagnosed bleeding disorder

          -  Hypoalbuminemia

          -  Unstable respiratory status evidenced by a diagnosed respiratory condition (such as
             asthma) that is not adequately controlled (e.g. evidence of repeated hospitalizations
             for exacerbations in asthma symptoms, etc.).

          -  Unstable cardiac status evidenced by a diagnosed cardiac condition.

          -  Nasal or menstrual bleeding. Additional blood in stool may effect calprotectin and
             lactoferrin concentration.
