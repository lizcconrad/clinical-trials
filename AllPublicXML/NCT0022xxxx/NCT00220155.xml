      To assess the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine given by fixed dose rate intravenous
      infusion in patients with pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous lines of treatment recorded. Adjuvant and palliative.

      Treatment will continue until clinical indication due to PD or toxicity, or until completion
      of 6 cycles of gemcitabine, whichever comes first.

      All patients will be assessed for toxicity and followed up for disease
      recurrence/progression.

      The study will be divided into two accrual stages - the first consisting of 17 patients. If 6
      or more patients achieve tumour response or stabilisation in the first stage, the second
      stage will commence accrual of a further 20 patients. Hence, the total planned accrual will
      be 37 patients.
