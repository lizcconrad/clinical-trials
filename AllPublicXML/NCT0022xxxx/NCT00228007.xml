      Depression and injection drug use often come hand-in-hand. This is especially true in
      populations with limited access to mental health care and with a high risk of illness and HIV
      transmission. Depressed injection drug users in these populations usually continue their drug
      use for extended periods of time, thereby further promoting the spread of HIV. This cycle has
      created a significant public health problem. It is necessary to explore new approaches to
      facilitate and maintain long-term behavior changes within this population. This study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with antidepressant medications in reducing HIV risk
      behaviors in depressed intravenous drug users.

      Participants in this open label study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      antidepressant treatment or no treatment. Participants in the treatment group will meet with
      a psychiatrist monthly for 12 months. Based on psychiatric evaluations and participants'
      medical histories, doctors will prescribe an appropriate antidepressant medication or a
      combination of medications. Participants in the treatment group may also receive referrals
      for other services if necessary. Participants assigned to receive no treatment will be
      contacted at Months 3 and 9 to verify their contact information; they will also receive any
      necessary referrals. All participants will partake in interviews at baseline and Months 6 and
      12 to assess changes in HIV risk behavior and depressive symptoms.
