  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if lamotrigine therapy is associated with
      improvement in mood, memory and hippocampal size and function in patients receiving chronic
      corticosteroid therapy. Standard care for mood changes associated with corticosteroid
      therapy, if severe, includes antidepressants or other medications which can influence mood.
      No therapies, other than dose reduction or discontinuation, are currently available for
      memory loss associated with corticosteroid treatment. However, very little information is
      available on the treatment of either mood or memory changes associated with corticosteroid
      treatment, thus the proposed project may improve standard care.
