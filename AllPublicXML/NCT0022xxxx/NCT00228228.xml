  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, we, the investigators at Sheba Medical Center, intend to evaluate T
      cell vaccination (TCV) in patients with probable multiple sclerosis (MS) within up to 3
      months after the first clinical attack. It is of the utmost importance to evaluate the
      treatment effects at the onset of disease, i.e. in patients with probable MS, in order to
      evaluate whether early treatment can prevent the second attack (conversion to definite MS).
      Moreover, at disease onset, the immunological process of epitope spreading associated with
      the exposure of the immune system to myelin antigens is still limited. With additional
      attacks, increased recognition of new self-determinants of encephalitogenic peptides
      presented to the immune system during the inflammatory process occurs, and enhances further
      disease activity. The aim of the early TCV treatment approach is to stop this process as
      early as possible, during the onset of the disease, thus preventing additional attacks and
      disease progression.

      We will evaluate the effect of TCV on clinical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) parameters in patients with probable MS.
