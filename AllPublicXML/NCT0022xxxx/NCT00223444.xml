      The purpose of the study is to better understand how genetic factors influence individual
      sensitivity to alcohol.

      We want to find out if there are specific characteristics of a person's genes which will
      cause them to respond differently to alcohol. Genes are parts of the chromosomes found in the
      cells of our bodies which control our physical characteristics such the color of our hair,
      eyes, and other features. Genes are made up of molecules called &quot;DNA&quot; which carry the genetic
      information we receive from our parents. Just as genes control our physical characteristics,
      differences in genetic information may also explain why some people are more sensitive to
      alcohol or have problems drinking too much.

      Specifically, we will determine whether the subject's gene for a brain protein called
      GABA-alpha-6 is of the &quot;Pro&quot; type or &quot;Ser&quot; type.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is male or female with at least one Hispanic birth parent of Mexican
             ancestry, 21-25 years of age, and able to read the English-language consent form.

          -  The subject self-reports current use of 3-30 standard drinks

          -  The subject is in good physical health as determined by history, physical and
             laboratory studies of hematology and chemistry

          -  The subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 20-28

          -  The subject is not concurrently using psychoactive medication or illicit drugs

          -  If subject is female, she is not pregnant (determined by weekly urine pregnancy
             screens), is practicing barrier or chemical methods of birth control, and not nursing
             babies

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject meets DSM-IV criteria for any lifetime history of alcohol dependence, or
             dependence or abuse on any other drug in the past two years excepting tobacco
             dependence

          -  The subject currently meets DSM-IV for any other psychiatric (Axis I) disorder,
             excepting tobacco dependence

          -  The subject cannot consistently provide alcohol-free breath samples and drug-free
             urine samples

          -  The subject uses &gt; 20 cigarettes per day or &gt; 500 mg caffeine per day

          -  The subject's physical exam, lab tests, and medical histories indicate medical illness
             requiring treatment or interacting with the alcohol or benzodiazepine treatments

          -  The subject has a sleep apnea or narrow angle-glaucoma (contraindications for
             benzodiazepines)

          -  The subject reports extreme hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to benzodiazepines
             or unusual hypersensitivity to multiple medications

          -  The subject is unwilling or unable to consent to all experimental procedures including
             confidential family history interviews and genetic testing specified by the protocol
