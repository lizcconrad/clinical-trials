  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate that dapoxetine can prolong intravaginal
      ejaculatory latency time (IELT) compared with placebo in men with premature ejaculation (PE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature ejaculation (PE) is a form of male sexual dysfunction. An objective measurement of
      PE in clinical studies is the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). This is a
      multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in men with
      PE. The study will consist 3 phases: pre-randomization phase (a screening visit and a 4-week
      baseline period); 24-week double-blind treatment phase during which patients will receive
      dapoxetine or placebo for use on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis; and, 1-week double-blind withdrawal
      phase (dapoxetine or placebo) with a post-study telephone contact approximately 2 weeks after
      the end of treatment. The total duration of the study is approximately 31 weeks. Assessments
      of effectiveness include the average intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, as measured by
      stopwatch during sexual intercourse, during the treatment period; control over ejaculation,
      satisfaction with sexual intercourse, and severity of symptoms, based on questions asked at
      monthly intervals through the treatment phase. Safety assessments include the incidence,
      severity, and type of adverse events throughout treatment and follow up (Week 27), as well as
      laboratory tests and questionnaires to monitor possible changes in mood, anxiety, motor
      responses, and sexual function at specified times during the study. The study hypothesis is
      that treatment for 24 weeks with dapoxetine prolongs intravaginal ejaculatory latency time,
      compared with placebo, in men with PE. Oral tablets of dapoxetine (30 milligrams[mg] or 60mg)
      or placebo taken as needed during 24 weeks of treatment. No more than 1 dose within a 24-hour
      period.
