      To explore the meaning, causes and treatment of hypertension in eligible patients. In

      1. The first goal is to explore the meaning, causes and treatment of hypertension in
           eligible patients. In addition the cultural, social, and psychological factors that
           either facilitate or serve, as barriers to behavioral change will be illuminated in this
           patient population. Through a series of open-ended questions we will explore and build a
           better understanding of how hypertensive African American patients view their illness
           and the difficulties they have in taking their antihypertensive medications as
           prescribed.

        2. The second goal of the qualitative phase is to use the responses obtained to inform how
           we should operationalize and tailor the positive affect induction and self-affirmation
           intervention methods in hypertensive African American patients.
