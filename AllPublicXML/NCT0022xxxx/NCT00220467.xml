  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims for the study will be to determine if aerobic exercise enhances cognition
      for older adults who are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, and to evaluate
      whether change in insulin sensitivity predicts cognitive performance for subjects randomized
      to the aerobic exercise group. Sedentary older adults diagnosed with mild cognitive
      impairment will participate in a 6-month supervised protocol of either aerobic exercise or
      stretching. Cognitive testing and blood collection will occur at baseline, and months 3 and
      6. Before and after the 6-month intervention, insulin sensitivity, maximum aerobic capacity,
      and body fat composition and distribution (via CT scan) will be assessed for all subjects.
      The results of this study may provide support for a relatively simple and inexpensive
      treatment strategy that specifically targets many of the health factors that directly
      influence risk of cognitive decline for older adults.

      The specific aims for the study are 1) to determine if aerobic exercise enhances cognition
      for older adults with mild cognitive impairment, 2) to evaluate whether change in insulin
      sensitivity predicts cognitive performance for subjects in the aerobic exercise group, and 3)
      to relate exercise effects on insulin sensitivity and cognition to growth factor expression,
      inflammatory markers, catecholamines, beta-amyloid, and body-fat composition. Using a
      randomized controlled parallel group design, 40 sedentary older adults diagnosed with mild
      cognitive impairment will participate in a 6-month supervised protocol of either aerobic
      exercise or stretching. Cognitive testing and blood collection will occur at baseline, and
      months 3 and 6. Before and after the 6-month intervention, insulin sensitivity (via
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp), maximum aerobic capacity (via respiratory gas exchange
      and cardiopulmonary fitness measures), and body fat composition (via DEXA scan) and
      distribution (via CT scan) will be assessed for all subjects. The results of this study may
      provide support for a relatively simple and inexpensive treatment strategy that specifically
      targets many of the health factors that directly influence risk of cognitive decline for
      older adults.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, at least 55 years of age, sedentary
             (elevated HR &amp; SOB &lt;3x/wk and &lt;30min on each occasion), overall good general health,
             willing to exercise at least 4 times/wk for 6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant neurologic disease that might affect cognition, such as a diagnosis of
             Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or severe head
             injury with loss of consciousness; significant medical illness or organ failure such
             as liver disease, significant elevations in liver function tests, kidney disease,
             uncontrolled hypertension (BP&gt;140/90 on medication); cardiovascular disease defined as
             any acute cardiovascular abnormality, such as new or unstable angina, uncontrolled
             irregular heart beat (treated a-fib and occasional PVC's are OK) or symptomatic heart
             failure, acute shortness of breath for any reason, or clinically significant edema;
             chronic lung disease, or musculoskeletal impairment (impaired walking); current use of
             anti-psychotic, anti-convulsant, anti-coagulant, sedative, or any cognition-enhancing
             medications; current or previous use of hypoglycemic agents or insulin.
