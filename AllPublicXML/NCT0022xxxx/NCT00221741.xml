  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite experts' recommendations, the consumption of Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is very
      heterogeneous among French cardiac surgery centers. This probably reflects heterogeneous
      practices that are not characterized and whose outcomes on morbidity and mortality are not
      documented.

      The principal objective of the study is to describe transfusional strategies of FFP in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The other objectives are: to assess the conformity of
      FFP transfusion or lack of transfusion to current French authorities' recommendations, to
      describe the post-operative mortality and morbidity and to assess the prognostic role of FFP
      on mortality and morbidity. Prognostic analyses will take into account other prognostic
      factors of mortality and morbidity.

      1500 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and presenting with a serious bleeding (or
      transfused with FFP without bleeding) will be included in the study.

      Background

      Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions recommendations are essentially based on experts'
      opinions. However, disparity in consumption of FFP by cardiac surgery centers in France
      probably reflects heterogeneous practices that are not well characterized. Furthermore,
      health outcomes of these strategies on morbidity and mortality are not documented.

      Objectives

      Primary: to describe transfusional strategies of FFP in patients undergoing cardiac surgery
      and either presenting a serious bleeding during pre, per or post-operative periods or
      transfused by FFP without a serious bleeding.

      Secondary:

        -  To estimate the conformity of transfusion or lack of transfusion of FFP to French
           authorities recommendations.

        -  To describe the post-operative mortality and morbidity.

        -  To evaluate the prognostic role of FFP transfusion on mortality and morbidity

      Study design

      Prospective prognostic cohort study, with an exhaustive recruitment in participating cardiac
      surgery centers during the study period.

      Eligibility criteria

      Centers: 16 French cardiac surgery centers.

      Patients:

        -  Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valvular replacement, surgery for thoracic aorta
           aneurysm or dissection, heart graft.

        -  Serious bleeding or FFP transfusion during pre, per or post-operative period.

        -  Patient's consent for collecting medical data

      Analysis

      Descriptive analysis of transfusional strategies according to patients' characteristics, type
      of surgery and circumstances of transfusions.

      Conformity to French authorities' current recommendations. Multivariate analysis of the
      prognostic role of FFP transfusion on 30-day mortality.
