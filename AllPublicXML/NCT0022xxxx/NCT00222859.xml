  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are to determine the treatment prescription rates for
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in a cohort of HCV mono-infected, and human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-HCV co-infected patients and to identify the reasons for
      non-treatment of HCV in these two groups.

    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in treatment modalities, a large proportion of patients with HCV do
      not receive treatment. The reasons for non-treatment need to be elucidated to properly
      address these factors. Appropriate evaluation and treatment of HCV is important in providing
      the optimal care to these persons. It is also important to document and characterize
      treatment patterns and prescription rates for policy, resource allocation and funding
      purposes. This study will determine the rates of treatment for HCV monoinfected and HCV-HIV
      co-infected patients, and determine the reasons for non-treatment. It will also directly
      compare the two populations to determine if any differences exist in the reasons for
      non-treatment. This study has implications for patient care, their health outcomes, policy
      making, funding and resource allocation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be recruited from the Pittsburgh AIDS Center for Treatment (PACT) Clinic
             and Pitt Treatment and Evaluation Unit (PTEU) and the Center for Liver Diseases (CLD)
             at the University of Pittsburgh. There are approximately 800 patients in the
             University of Pittsburgh's PACT/PTEU clinic. Consecutive patients with HCV-HIV
             co-infection who present to the clinic upon initiation of data gathering would be
             eligible for participation in this study. An estimated 500-800 patients are seen at
             the CLD clinic per year, and consecutive patients enrolled in the CLD HCV registry
             would be considered eligible for this study. To maintain uniformity and consistency of
             data, only patients seen by one of the study investigators would be enrolled.
             Recruitment would continue till the study has enrolled 100 HCV-HIV coinfected and 200
             HCV mono-infected subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There are no exclusion criteria, except if the patient refuses to participate in the
             study.
