  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects received rTMS daily on 10 consecutive weekdays (five sessions per week), during 20
      minutes per session.During the rTMS session, the coil was centered flat over the right
      parietal cortex.

      We follow the patient during 12 weeks after the 2 weeks of tms (follow-up period) to measure
      the depression with different rating scales.

      We hypothesized that rTMS has a positive effect in the treatment of depression

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the depression (and so the effect of the treatment)we use the 10-item Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)and we measure before tms (T=0), at week 1 (T=1), at week 2 (T=2), at week 4 (T=3), at week 8 (T=4), at week 14 (T=5)</measure>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In and outpatients aged between 16 and 65 who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive
             episode, and who had a score of 25 or higher on the 10-item Montgomery Asberg
             Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of epilepsy and any other medical disorder that should preclude the
             administration of rTMS. Only SSRI's, Mirtazapine and Promethazine as psychotropic
             medication was accepted if the dosage of antidepressive medication had not been
             changed for 6 weeks, and if the dosage of Promethazine had not been changed for 2
             weeks prior to inclusion. Antidepressive medication had to remain stable during the 14
             weeks of the study.

        Furthermore: schizophrenic disorder, a piece if metal in the brain, pacemaker and
        left-handed patients.
