      This study evaluates the efficacy of shunt operation for idiopathic normal pressure
      hydrocephalus, and determines the diagnostic value of noninvasive procedures commonly
      practiced in the clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a syndrome characterized by ventricular
      dilatation due to disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, accompanied by gait
      disturbance, dementia and/or urinary incontinence without causative disorders. With the aging
      of Japanese society, the number of patients is increasing, requiring diagnostic and
      therapeutic guidelines for the improvement of the patients' quality of life and social care.
      Under such conditions, this project was made as the prospective study of iNPH on Neurological
      Improvement (SINPHONI ). This study aims 1) to establish methods for non-invasive diagnosis
      of iNPH, and 2) to demonstrate therapeutic outcome of shunting operation by Codman Hakim
      programmable valve (CHPV). In this protocol, the evaluation of validity on MRI, tap test, CT
      cisternography, and CBF (3D-SSP) will be done in the diagnosis, and manual of initial setting
      pressure in CHPV for prevention of overdrainage problems will be estimated by modified Rankin
      scale (as primary endpoint) and some another scales during 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients who had at least one more points of the triad (gait disturbance, cognitive
        impairment, and urinary incontinence) in Japan NPH grading scale revised, and had
        disproportionate ventriculomegaly (Evans index &gt;0.3) with closing of the CSF space at high
        convexity on MRI. These patients must be diagnosed clinically other causative disorders,
        and ventricular dilatation due to disturbance of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.
        Be able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Cannot have an MRI scan 2) Has a problem with bleeding tendency and other serological
        examination. (liver enzyme and renal dysfunction, blood coagulopathy, and etc.) 3) Is
        unable to understand the risks of the testing and surgical therapy. 4) is tolerable for one
        year follow up after shunting operation.
