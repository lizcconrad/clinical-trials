  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell
      transplants (PBSCT) frequently develop organ dysfunctions, much of which may be initiated by
      damage to the liver and to cells lining blood vessels.

      We, the researchers at Vanderbilt University, propose to perform a randomized, prospective,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 144 patients undergoing allogeneic marrow
      transplantation. The treatment is aimed at supporting hepatic urea cycle function in patients
      receiving escalated dose chemotherapy/BMT. By so doing we hope to prevent development of
      hepatic venoocclusive disease (HVOD) and acute lung injury (ALI), two morbid complications of
      BMT. Patients will be randomized to receive oral citrulline, a urea cycle amino acid
      intermediate, or placebo beginning before conditioning therapy and continuing until 21 days
      after BMT. All patients will be followed for 100 days after study enrollment with intensive
      data collection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We propose to study 144 patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or
             peripheral blood stem cell transplant over a 4 year period.

          -  Patients of either sex and of any race or ethnic origin, older than age greater than
             or equal to13, and admitted to the Myelosuppression Unit (MSU) of Vanderbilt
             University Hospital or the VA Hospital to undergo bone marrow transplantation will be
             recruited for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if pregnant (unlikely) or if informed consent cannot be
             obtained.

          -  Because of the intrinsic toxicity of the treatment regimens, BMT is not usually
             offered to patients with severe underlying derangements in organ function.
             Nevertheless, other exclusions that will prevent entry of patients into the study
             include advanced renal or hepatic failure (serum creatinine &gt; 6mg/dl, serum bilirubin
             &gt;3.5 mg/dl), moribund patients, and patients whose primary physician is not committed
             to full support of the patient (i.e. &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot;).

          -  Other exclusions will include patients enrolled in another experimental
             (interventional) protocol aimed at reducing transplant related complications during
             BMT, patients testing positive for HIV, those who have had previous BMT, and patients
             actively bleeding at the time of initiation of induction therapy. We will not exclude
             patients undergoing newer regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy.
