  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COAT-platelets stands for collagen and thrombin stimulated platelets, which are two things in
      the body that make platelets stick together. These platelets may be important in the
      initiation of a heart attack (myocardial infarction). A chemical in the body called serotonin
      maybe responsible for COAT-platelet production. Paroxetine causes a significant reduction in
      platelet serotonin and therefore may have value in preventing heart attacks. Therefore, the
      current study is designed to determine whether paroxetine will decrease COAT-platelet
      production in normal volunteers and patients with cardiovascular disease.
