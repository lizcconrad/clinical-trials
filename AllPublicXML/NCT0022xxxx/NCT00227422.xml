      The purpose of this study is to evaluate that the vaccine produced with the new process and
      administered as a single dose is at least as good as the existing Mencevax™ ACWY vaccine in
      terms of immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity, in healthy subjects aged 2-30 years.

             preceding the administration of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the vaccine dose.

          -  Vaccination with a meningococcal vaccine within the last five years.

          -  Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             during the period starting from 15 days before vaccine administration and ending 30
             days after.

          -  History of or known exposure to meningococcal serogroup A, C, W135 or Y disease or
             contacts with subjects who had meningococcal disease.
