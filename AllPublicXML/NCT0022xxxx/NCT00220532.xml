  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial to see whether giving a low dose
      of the vitamins folic acid and riboflavin is beneficial to women who have very low grade
      abnormalities of the cervical cells.

  <detailed_description>

      The overall aim of the study is to evaluate interactions between intakes of folic acid and
      riboflavin with a common polymorphism relevant to folate metabolism, in determining the risk
      of cervical cancer in women who carry high risk human papillomavirus.

      We will test the following hypotheses:

      Supplements of riboflavin and folic acid will increase the rate of regression of low grade
      cervical intra epithelial neoplasia (CIN1).

      Effects of supplemental folic acid and riboflavin on CIN1 regression are modulated by a
      common polymorphism in the MTHFRC677T gene.

      We will recruit women with biopsy-proven CIN1 and carrying high risk HPV infection, and
      randomise to a 12month intervention of 1.2mg folic acid and 5mg riboflavin or placebo. The
      primary outcome will be regression of biopsy-proven CIN1, and secondary outcomes will include
      measures of DNA stability.
