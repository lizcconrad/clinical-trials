      A Multi-Center, Open-Label, Parallel Group Study of the efficacy and safety of Ferrlecit in
      the Maintenance of Iron Stores and Serum Hemoglobin Concentration in Hemodialysis Patients
      Receiving Erythropoietin. Patients with normal iron indices receive one of two doses of
      Ferrlecit administered weekly throughout the treatment period. Efficacy was assesses at
      designated timepoints throughout the study and after the last Ferrlecit dose.
