  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally-invasive operative techniques have been introduced in cardiac surgery. These
      techniques may have several advantages such as a decrease in post operative pain, lower
      morbidity and mortality, faster recovery, and a shorter hospital stay. However, these
      advantages have rarely been documented in the setting of a formal randomized controlled
      trial.

      Background:

      Minimally invasive techniques for cardiac surgery should be formally evaluated.

      Design:

      Randomized, single-blind, monocentric trial.

      Interventions Compared:

      Median sternotomy versus minimally invasive technique.

      Eligibility Criteria:

      Indication of isolated aortic valvular replacement, preoperative American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) class &lt; = 3, left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; = 40%.

      Primary Outcome:

      Forced expiratory volume and peak expiratory volume/second at 48 hours.
