  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are doing this pilot study to learn more about four aspects of treating depression:

        1. The features of a depressed person’s mood and anxiety and how these features affect a
           person’s capacity to get better and stay better.

        2. If depressed people with certain features of mood and anxiety respond better to therapy,
           medication or a combination of therapy and medication.

        3. Whether or not a person’s personality traits affect how they respond to treatment.

        4. The gene involved in processing antidepressant medication

      This pilot study is an experimental investigation designed so that consenting subjects are
      randomly assigned to pharmacotherapeutic or psychotherapeutic interventions for depression.

      For the initial phase of treatment, subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with an
      SSRI, (escitalopram oxalate or citalopram hydrobromide), or with interpersonal psychotherapy
      (IPT). Escitalopram will be prescribed for all patients randomized to the medication arm of
      the study, unless the study psychiatrist determines that citalopram is more clinically
      appropriate. Escitalopram and citalopram are FDA-Approved SSRI antidepressants indicated for
      the treatment of depression. In order to optimize outcomes and emulate usual clinical
      practice, subjects who do not meet response criteria (defined as a 50% reduction in baseline
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRS-D]) or meet stabilization criteria (defined as a
      mean HRS-D &lt; 7 for 3 weeks) at acute phase Visit 7 or Visit 13 of treatment will have the
      other treatment added. Subjects who meet stabilization criteria (mean HRS-D &lt; 7 for 3 weeks)
      at any time between acute phase Visit 13 and 21 will enter the 6-month continuation phase and
      continue with the treatment that led to their stabilization. Subjects who have not met
      stabilization criteria by acute phase Visit 21 will remain in active treatment and be offered
      alternative pharmacotherapy. Subjects who have not responded by acute phase Visit 32 will be
      discontinued from the protocol and referred for alternative treatment and care.
