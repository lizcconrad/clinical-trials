  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if two nutritional supplements, Orotic Acid and
      Glutathione will have any effect on the immune system response and if there will be any
      effect on the symptoms of seasonal allergies. It is our thinking that they will have an
      positive effect.

    <textblock>
      Current therapy for most immune-based diseases center around the use of anti inflammatory
      agents, many of which have unpleasant or dangerous side effects. Allergic rhinitis affects
      over 40 million Americans and its morbidity results from a combination of physical and
      psychological symptoms. The primary immunopathology has been defined as an imbalance of
      TH1/TH2 cytokines production resulting in increased allergen-specific IgE production, mast
      cell activation and eosinophil recruitment/activity. Metallic salts of orotic acid (OR), a
      natural intermediate in pyrimidine nucleic acid synthesis have been utilized to improve the
      signs and symptoms of a variety of maladies including the common cold, allergies and as
      preventatives for cancer and heart disease. Recent studies have reported that moderate doses
      of OR can mitigate or prevent endocrine and subjective psychological stresses in an acute
      laboratory stress model. All these findings lead us to hypothesize that OR salts
      administration will alleviate or eliminate the signs and symptoms associated with seasonal AR
      through a protective effect that involves direct anti-inflammatory immune effects and/or
      immunomodulation that include leukocyte trafficking, immunoregulatory cytokine balance and/or
      decrease inflammatory cell activity.
