      Combination Therapy in Dual Diagnosis Bipolar Rapid Cycling: This study recruits males and
      females age 18 and older who currently meet diagnostic criteria for rapid cycling bipolar
      disorder (type I or II) and who have met the criteria for substance abuse or dependence of
      cocaine, marijuana and/or alcohol within the past six months. Patients begin treatment with a
      combination of lithium and divalproex. Once these medications are tolerated, they are
      randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with lamotrigine or placebo. Patients remain in
      this study until they experience a marked bimodal response for four consecutive weeks. This
      study is sponsored by the Stanley Foundation.

    <description>Lithium monotherapy was initiated at 450 mg once daily and titrated slowly over 3 weeks to a minimum blood level of 0.5 mEqlL. Divalproex was then initiated at 250 mg twice daily and increased slowly over 5 weeks to a minimum blood level of 50 μg/mL. Patients meeting the criteria of being non-responsive to lithium plus divalproex were randomly assigned to receive lamotrigine or placebo. Patients randomized to the lamotrigine group were titrated up to a minimum dose of 150 mg and maximum dose of 200 mg per day.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has given written informed consent.

          -  Males or females 16 years of age and older. For patients less than 18 years old,
             concurrent written informed consent will also be required from the parents or legal
             guardians.

          -  Must meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
             (DSM-IV) criteria for major depression at the time of study entry.

          -  Must meet DSM-IV criteria for rapid-cycling bipolar disorder in the last 12 months.

          -  Must meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol or drug abuse within the past 3 months or
             dependence in the last 6 months (unless most recent period of abstinence occurred
             while in a controlled environment).

          -  Must have no medical illness precluding the use of lithium, divalproex sodium and/or
             lamotrigine.

          -  Regardless of treatment response, patients who have been exposed to lithium or
             divalproex sodium will be included as long as the medication was adequately tolerated
             and all three medications were not administered concurrently.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had intolerable side effects to lamotrigine, lithium at levels of
             0.6 mEq/L or divalproex sodium at levels of 50ug/ml.

          -  Patients who have previously been treated with lithium, divalproex sodium and
             lamotrigine concurrently.

          -  Patients who have previously been treated with an adequate trial of lamotrigine, which
             was considered to be a treatment failure.

          -  Patients who do not have a recent history of, or are not currently abusing or
             dependent on alcohol or drugs.

          -  Patients with a prior history of seizure disorder, cerebral vascular disease,
             structural brain damage from trauma, clinically significant focal neurological
             abnormalities, closed head injury, EEG abnormalities with frank paroxysmal activity or
             a previous CT/MRI scan of the brain with gross structural abnormalities.

          -  Patients who have clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic, hematologic, or oncologic diseases. Clinically
             significant evidence of thyroid failure will be defined as a decreased free thyroxine
             index with several clinical signs and symptoms of overt failure.

          -  Patients who are pregnant, at-risk of becoming pregnant or intend to become pregnant
             during the study. Patients who are not at risk of becoming pregnant are females who
             are post menopausal, who have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or
             sterilization, who agree to use an IUD, barrier protection, a contraceptive
             implantation system (e.g., Norplant), oral contraceptive pills, or who, in the
             investigator's judgment, will continue to be sexually inactive.

          -  Patients who have received haloperidol decanoate or fluphenazine decanoate within the
             last 10 weeks.

          -  Patients who have a central nervous system (CNS) neoplasm, uncontrolled metabolic,
             demyelinating or progressive degenerative disorder, active CNS infection, or any
             progressive neurological disorder.

          -  Patients who are taking exogenous steroids.

          -  Patients who have ultra-fast rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, but do not formally meet
             DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder. This is designed to exclude patients with
             episode frequencies too high to permit objective quantification.

          -  Patients who are currently suicidal in the opinion of the investigator or have a score
             of greater than 4 on the suicide item of the (Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS).

          -  Patients who have been treated with any dose or duration of a tricyclic antidepressant
             within the last three months.
