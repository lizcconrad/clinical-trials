      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in safety and efficacy between
      Parkinson's disease patients who either received transplantation of fetal porcine cells or
      placebo treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has idiopathic Parkinson's disease. a) with bradykinesia and either rest
             tremor or rigidity, b) history of asymmetry of Parkinson's disease signs, c) history
             of progression of Parkinson's disease signs, d) no other suspected cause of
             Parkinson's disease, e) the patient is L-DOPA responsive (based on the Treating
             Investigator's clinical judgment, the patient demonstrates a predictable ON response
             after the first daily dose of L-DOPA)

          -  The patient has had Parkinson's disease for at least 5 years (from onset of symptoms).

          -  The patient demonstrates unequivocal Clinical Off periods.

          -  Patient has been on a stable regimen of L-DOPA and any other anti-Parkinsonian
             medications for at least one month prior to start of screening.

          -  The patient demonstrates L-DOPA-or dopamine agonist-induced dyskinesias.

          -  The patient's age is 40-70.

          -  The patient is currently under &quot;optimal medical therapy&quot;, as determined by the
             Treating Investigator.

          -  The patient has had a UPDRS assessment as per a modified CAPIT protocol at screening
             and the total UPDRS score in the defined OFF state was at least 60.

          -  If the patient is a woman of child bearing potential, she must not be nursing and an
             adequate form of birth control must be used for the duration of this trial.

          -  The patient has a normal chest x-ray and does not exhibit any signs or symptoms of
             coronary artery disease (on exam or on EKG) dysrhythmia (in order for surgery to be
             safely performed).

          -  The patient is able to understand and is willing to comply with study requirements;
             this may include travel within or outside the United States for neuroimaging testing
             and surgery. It will be necessary for a companion to travel with the patient.

          -  The patient is able to provide written informed consent.

          -  The patient understands that the Sponsor recommends that all patients in this trial
             avoid pregnancy and minimize the sharing of secretions with sexual partners.

          -  The patient is willing to participate in the life-long xenotransplantation registry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has a likely alternative diagnosis for Parkinsonism based on history,
             physical examination or laboratory testing. Atypical Parkinsonian variants (such as
             Shy-Drager, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and
             striatonigral degeneration) and secondary Parkinsonism (e.g., secondary to trauma or
             metabolic abnormalities; history of encephalitis, oculogyric crises or use of
             dopaminergic antagonists/depleting drugs) will be excluded.

          -  The patient has had a prior cranial neurosurgical procedure.

          -  The patient has MRI or CT evidence of abnormalities which could lead to Parkinsonism
             or make the patient an unsuitable neurosurgical candidate.

          -  The patient has a history of intracranial pathology (e.g., tumor, vascular
             malformation) that might make the patient an unsuitable neurosurgical candidate.

          -  The patient has a pre-existing medical condition that may interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety and/or effectiveness of the study agent or prevent study
             completion (e.g.:, symptomatic cardiac disease, impaired renal function or seizure
             disorder).

          -  The patient has a known sensitivity to products of porcine origin (e.g. pork).

          -  The patient has a known steroid or cyclosporine intolerance.

          -  The patient has significant cognitive impairment; specifically, a MMSE score of &lt; 25,
             and, in the investigators judgment, the patient is demented.

          -  The patient has a Hamilton Depression score of &gt; 16.

          -  The patient has hallucinations, delusions, psychosis or chronic psychiatric illness,
             with the exception of mild, L-DOPA induced hallucinations, or those caused by
             concomitant medications, which resolve with dose adjustment.

          -  The patient has a positive response to a tuberculin skin test (with the exception of
             patients who have either been inoculated for TB, or treated for the disease in the
             past).

          -  The patient has been treated during the 6 months prior to Screening with dopaminergic
             antagonists.

          -  (Females only) The patient is nursing or pregnant.

          -  The patient has taken tolcapone within 6 weeks of the Screening UPDRS exam.
