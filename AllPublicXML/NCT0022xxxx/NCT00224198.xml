  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to obtain biologic materials from the blood and lungs from
      patients with lung disease in order to develop an understanding of the etiology and
      pathogenesis of these disorders. General admission criteria for this project will require at
      least one of the following: (1) symptoms consistent with pulmonary disease; (2) chest X-ray
      consistent with lung disease; (3) pulmonary function tests consistent with lung disease; (4)
      lung biopsy consistent with lung disease; (5) family history of lung disease; and (6)
      patients with diseases of organs with known association with lung disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo a general medical evaluation by a pulmonary physician (and consultants
      as appropriate for other organs). The typical routine medical studies to be carried out may
      include: chest X-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral), non-contrast high resolution CT scan
      of the chest, pulmonary function tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, general
      hematologic studies, general serologic studies, /immunologic studies, biochemical analyses
      (including carboxyhemoglobin to measure blood carbon monoxide levels in order to accurately
      evaluate the diffusion capacity in individuals who smoke since smoking increases the blood
      levels of carbon monoxide), alcohol blood test, urinalysis, urine chemistries (including
      blood or urine nicotine and cotinine test to evaluate urine for active or passive exposure to
      nicotine), blood or urine drug screening (to evaluate use of recreational drugs and/or mood
      altering medications), pregnancy test (if applicable) and HIV serology. Also, a sweat
      chloride and sweat rate test may be performed by the physician to evaluate participants with
      a possible diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

      The study individual will undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy with a combination of bronchial
      brushing and/or bronchoalveolar lavage and/or bronchial wall biopsy. The primary factor for
      determining if an individual will have bronchial alveolar lavages (BAL) and/or brushings
      and/or biopsies is the particular lung disease affecting the individual. This will depend on
      the known mechanism relevant to the pathogenesis of the particular disease. For example, in
      individuals with asthma, the samples may include airway brushing and airway biopsies; in
      contrast, in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sampling may
      include airway brushings, airway biopsies, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Other determining
      factors include: the amount of moderate sedation (if used) and the amount of analgesia used;
      the maximal dosage of topical lidocaine that is allowed per procedure; allergic reactions to
      any of the medications used in the procedures; and individual's tolerance to the procedure.

    <description>Bronchoscopy consists of the passage via the mouth or nose of a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy into the airways. In the lavage (washing) procedure, sterile 0.9% saline (5 x 20 ml aliquots in 1 to 3 sites) is instilled into the lung and immediately suctioned back, washing off cells lining the airways.In the brushing procedure, a small cytology brush is passed through the bronchoscope, and a small area of the airway wall is brushed gently to obtain epithelial cells lining the airway. Certain individuals may have bronchial wall biopsy carried out. In this procedure, a small biopsy forceps is passed through the bronchoscope and a small biopsy is obtained from the bronchial wall.</description>

        The source of potential subjects will be the population of individuals defined by the
        eligibility criteria below, individuals in the New York metropolitan area and elsewhere. Up
        to one hundred volunteers will take part in the study each year. Accrual will be random
        with no bias as to gender or racial/ethnic group. All study individuals will be males or
        females that are 18 years or older and are able to provide informed consent. Advertisements
        will be posted at various educational institutions and hospitals and placed in newspapers
        in the New York metropolitan area. Paid volunteer referrals will also be used for patient
        recruitment.
