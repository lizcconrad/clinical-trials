  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The advance of communication technology has changed medical practice. The concept of medical
      telemedicine centers receiving, assessing and managing calls from patients or their carers on
      a 24 hour, 7 days a week basis is spreading in the US as well as in European countries.
      Usually specially trained nurses using dedicated decision support software provide the
      service. One aspect is the so-called triage, i.e. the decision on urgency and optimal
      treatment path of a stated medical problem, which has the potential to contain overall
      treatment costs.

      Despite proliferation of these services, little is known about the quality of the services
      provided.

      In October 2000 the first 24-hour medical telemedicine centre staffed by medical doctors
      started operating in Switzerland. The aims of this study are to assess the quality of service
      provided by doctors using decision support software and to determine potential predictors of
      incorrect triage.
