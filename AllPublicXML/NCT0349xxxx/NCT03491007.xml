      The purpose of this research is to determine if a study medication called
      Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) helps to reduce PTSD symptoms in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. In
      addition to finding out if DHEA is effective for treating PTSD symptoms, this research seeks
      to determine if DHEA is effective in treating other symptoms, such as depression and anxiety.
      Depression and anxiety are symptoms that are frequently present in Veterans who are
      experiencing PTSD. Another purpose of this research is to takes pictures of the brain using
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood levels of various small molecules including
      neurosteroids and also proteins, which may be affected by the study drug and/or related to
      symptoms in Veterans with PTSD. This study seeks to determine if DHEA is changed to other
      compounds after it is taken by mouth and the safety and effectiveness of DHEA in Veterans
      with PTSD. This is an &quot;add-on&quot; study and Veterans enrolled in the study will continue to take
      all of their current medications without any changes (also called &quot;usual care&quot;), and DHEA or
      a sugar pill (also called a &quot;placebo&quot;) will then be added to their current medication
      regimen.

      This is a parallel-group, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled, randomized Phase 2 pilot
      study using adjunctive dehydroxyepiandrosterone [DHEA (400 mg)] to establish Proof of Concept
      (POC) for use of this agent in Veterans with PTSD.

      The investigators' first objective is POC target engagement to evaluate a one-time adjunctive
      oral dose of DHEA (400 mg) relative to PBO on the neuronal circuity of fear-anxiety-emotion
      connectivity. This will be achieved by comparing pre- to post-treatment changes in
      amygdala-hippocampal functional connectivity to DHEA and PBO during fMRI activation. The
      investigators hypothesize that compared with PBO, DHEA will increase task-associated fMRI
      functional connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus (primary outcome).

      The second objective is to determine if an 8-week treatment with adjunctive DHEA is superior
      to PBO in reducing symptoms of PTSD (CAPS-5) and depression (BDI) in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans,
      and enhancing resilience (CD-RISC). The investigators hypothesize that 400mg DHEA will result
      in reduced PTSD and depression symptom severity relative to PBO, as determined by a pre- to
      post-treatment decrease in CAPS-5 and BDI scores, respectively, with enhancement in
      resilience scores using the CD-RISC at 6-weeks.

      The third objective is to evaluate the impact of DHEA relative to PBO on serum neurosteroid
      levels in OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with PTSD. The investigators hypothesize that DHEA will result
      in a statistically-significant increase in serum neurosteroid levels (DHEA, DHEAS,
      androsterone) relative to PBO, as determined by pre- to post-treatment reductions in PTSD
      symptoms severity. This association will be evaluated by correlating neurosteroid levels with
      PTSD, depression, and resilience scores over 6 weeks of treatment.

      The exploratory objective is to determine preliminary evidence for an association of fMRI and
      myelin integrity measures of fear-anxiety-emotion circuits with serum neurosteroid levels and
      treatment response to DHEA. Changes in myelin integrity following DHEA treatment will be
      evaluated using novel susceptibility diffusion imaging [STI]), as DHEA impacts myelination in
      preclinical rodent models. The investigators will also determine if serum neurosteroid levels
      are correlated with myelin integrity on STI. The investigators hypothesize that fMRI and
      myelin integrity of fear-anxiety circuits will correlate with serum neurosteroids and
      treatment response.

          -  Abnormal prostate specific antigen (PSA; &gt;2.5ng/ml in males age 49 or less; &gt;4ng/ml in

             cancer.

          -  A family history of prostate, breast or endometrial cancer in a first-degree relative.

          -  Presence of any factors/conditions, medical or non-medical, that may interfere with
             conduction of study assessments in the judgment of the study team.

          -  Serious or unstable cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, metabolic, respiratory, or
             hematologic illness, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or other medical
             condition or psychiatric conditions or behaviors that would compromise participation
             and/or likely to lead to worsening of symptoms during the course of the study in the
             opinion of study physician and research team.

          -  Are non-ambulatory or require the use of crutches or a walker.

          -  Taking Narcotic medications or benzodiazepines for any reason.
