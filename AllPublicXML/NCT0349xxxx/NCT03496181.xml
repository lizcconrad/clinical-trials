  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive test used to detect changes in
      brain activity by taking picture of changes in blood flow. The imaging helps doctors better
      understand how the brain works. Task based fMRI (TB fMRI) prompts patients to perform
      different activities (e.g. word selection in a reading task), and is routinely performed on
      patients in preparation for a Neurological surgery (surgery that involves the nervous system,
      brain and/or spinal cord). The purpose is to locate areas of the brain that control speech
      and movement; these images will help make decisions about patient surgeries. However, there
      are however gaps in knowledge specific to the language areas of the brain, especially for
      non-English patients and bilingual patients (those who are fluent in more than one language).
      This study proposes to evaluate if resting state fMRI (RS fMRI) that does not require any
      tasks, along with a novel way to analyze these images using &quot;graphy theory,&quot; may provide more
      information. Graph theory is a new mathematical method to analyze the fMRI data. The overall
      goal is to determine if graph theory analysis on RS fMRI may reduce differences in health
      care treatment and outcomes for non-English speaking and bilingual patients. We hope that the
      results of this study will allow doctors to perform pre-operative fMRI in patients who do not
      speak English.

    <description>Bilingual (English and Spanish speaking) patients will be recruited from the clinical service of the Department of Neurosurgery of MSK. All patients on the Neurosurgery service scheduled to undergo a resection of a tumor in or adjacent to the primary language areas will be screened to participate in this study.
The study will be performed in concert with patient's regularly scheduled clinical care for his/her brain tumor. Clinical care (which will be performed whether or not the patient participates in the current study) will include: 1) pre-operative routine (anatomical) MRI and fMRI, 2) the surgery to remove the tumor, 3) intra-operative cortical stimulation to identify the essential motor and/or language areas. It should be stressed that neither the brain tumor surgery, nor the intra-operative cortical mapping will be changed in any way from routine practice.</description>

    <description>Normal, healthy volunteers who express interest in participation and who meet the eligibility criteria will be recruited for this study. It is anticipated that healthy volunteers will mostly consist of medical professionals. They will consist of 10 monolinguals (defined as native English speakers), 10 early bilinguals (defined as acquiring proficiency in the second language before 10 years of age), and 10 late bilinguals (defined as acquiring proficiency in the second language after 10 years of age).</description>

    <description>For patients only prior to MRI scans.
The MAE contains eleven subtests in five categories which may be used to assess both languages in bilinguals and the participant's primary language in monolinguals: Oral Expression, Spelling, Oral Verbal Understanding, Reading, and Rating Scales. Subtests are scored for accuracy of individual items on a three-point scoring system (0, 1, 2). Contained within these domains are The Token Test, Aural Comprehension of Words and Phrases and Visual Naming which naturally parallel fMRI and direct cortical stimulation behavioral assays already in place for clinical use (phonemic fluency, auditory responsive naming and confrontation naming respectively). The MAE is expected to take under 50 minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients/ healthy volunteers â‰¥ 18 years old

          -  Patients/ healthy volunteers must be able to perform the language paradigms on cue
             while inside the scanner

          -  Patients/ healthy volunteers who are monolingual English speakers, early bilinguals

             Department of Radiology's standard guidelines (e.g.: claustrophobia, high levels of
             anxiety, pacemaker etc.)

          -  Patient/ volunteers who are unable to perform the language paradigms on cue while
             inside the scanner (due to weakness, deafness, inability to understand or follow
