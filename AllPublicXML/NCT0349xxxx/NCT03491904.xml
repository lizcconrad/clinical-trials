  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the Prefilled Syringe (PFS) and the
      auto-injector(AI) are suitable to be used to administer fasinumab at home by patients or
      their caregivers, as measured by collecting 12 weeks of actual-use data on the technical
      performance of each device. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the
      successful injection of fasinumab by patients or their caregivers using an AI or PFS in an
      unsupervised setting, evaluate patient/caregiver satisfaction with the AI and the PFS for
      fasinumab injection in an unsupervised setting, evaluate exposure in serum for fasinumab
      administered by patients or their caregivers using an AI, or a PFS that has been used in the
      phase 3 program, characterize the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of fasinumab
      administered by patients or their caregivers using an AI or PFS in an unsupervised setting.
