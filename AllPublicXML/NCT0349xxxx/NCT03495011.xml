  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, prospective observational clinical trial for women with
      mammographically detected suspicious calcifications who have been recommended breast biopsy.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether quantitative, multiparametric breast MRI
      performed prior to biopsy can biologically characterize a common pre-invasive malignancy,
      ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which typically presents in asymptomatic women as suspicious
      calcifications on mammography.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will assess whether MRI signatures can determine which calcifications
      identified as suspicious on mammography actually harbor DCIS, and whether these imaging
      features correlate with pathologic markers of proliferation (Ki-67) and inflammation (cox-2)
      within DCIS lesions.

      The investigators will also explore whether quantitative MRI features in the peri-tumoral
      region correlate with prognostic microenvironment markers of inflammation (TNFα) and
      angiogenesis (VEGF). Finally, investigators will assess whether a multivariate model using
      these markers can accurately predict risk of recurrence based on a multi-gene assay (Oncotype
      DX DCIS score).

        Women aged 18 or older with suspicious calcifications identified on mammogram without an
        associated mass. Study participants will undergo an experimental 3 Tesla breast MRI prior
        to surgical resection, including both DWI and DCE techniques. Participants who are
        diagnosed with pure DCIS on both core needle biopsy and surgical resection will remain on
        study. Tissue from all DCIS lesions will also be sent for outside multi-gene assay testing
        (Oncotype DX DCIS score, Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA).
