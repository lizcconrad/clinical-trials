  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and PK characteristics of the
      following three combinations: i) LAG525 + spartalizumab; ii) LAG525 + spartalizumab +
      carboplatin, and iii) LAG525 + carboplatin in subjects with metastatic TNBC and up to one
      prior line of systemic treatment for metastatic disease. A thorough biomarker strategy to
      address key aspects of tumor immunogenicity will be implemented in the study.

      LAG525 and spartalizumab are two immuno-agents targeting different immune checkpoints, and
      have been tested as single agents and in combination. To further enhance the efficacy of
      checkpoint inhibition, carboplatin will be given with LAG525 or with LAG525 and
      spartalizumab, based on the observation that the addition of chemotherapy can change the
      tumor microenvironment to be more favorable to immune response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has advanced (loco-regionally recurrent not amenable to curative therapy or
             metastatic) breast cancer.

          -  Patient must have measurable disease, i.e., at least one measurable lesion as per
             RECIST 1.1 criteria (Tumor lesions previously irradiated or subjected to other
             loco-regional therapy will only be considered measurable if disease progression at the
             treated site after completion of therapy is clearly documented)

          -  Patient progressed after adjuvant or 1 prior systemic treatment in the metastatic
             setting. Patients with de novo metastatic disease are eligible if they received 1
             prior line of therapy

          -  Patient must have received prior systemic treatment that included taxane-based
             chemotherapy for adjuvant or metastatic disease

          -  Patient must have a site of disease amenable to biopsy, and must be willing to undergo
             a new tumor biopsy at screening and during therapy on this study, the latter if
             medically feasible. Patients with an available archival tumor tissue do not need to
             perform a tumor biopsy at screening if patient has not received anti-cancer therapy
             since the biopsy was taken.

          -  Patient has histologically and/or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of TNBC (based on
             most recently analyzed biopsy, local lab) meeting the following criteria: HER2
             negative in situ hybridization test or an IHC status of 0 or 1+, and ER and PR
             expression is &lt;1 percent as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received prior treatment with anti-LAG-3, anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or
             anti-PD-L2 antibody (any line of therapy).

          -  Patient received prior therapy with a platinum agent or mitomycin and experienced
             recurrence within 12 months after the end of the platinum-based or mitomycin
             containing therapy

          -  Patient has had major surgery within 14 days prior to starting study treatment or has
             not recovered to grade 1 or less from major side effects.

          -  Patient with presence of CTCAE ≥ grade 2 toxicity (except alopecia, peripheral
             neuropathy and ototoxicity, which are excluded if ≥ CTCAE grade 3) due to prior cancer
             therapy.

          -  Patient has received radiotherapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to randomization (≤ 2 weeks for
             limited field radiation for palliation), and has not recovered to grade 1 or better
             from related side effects of such therapy (with the exception of alopecia).

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies,
             platinum-containing compounds, or to any of the excipients of LAG525, spartalizumab,
             or carboplatin.

          -  Patient with history or presence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases, treated
             or untreated.
