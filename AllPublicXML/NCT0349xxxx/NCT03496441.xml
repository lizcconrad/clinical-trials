  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is based on the hypothesis that patients with postoperative anastomotic leakage
      have a different bacterial profile contributing to poor tissue healing, and that patients
      operated for colon cancer presumably have a different preoperative microbiota than healthy
      patients. This different composition is probably induced by the high heme level in the light
      intestinal tract that tumor spoliation generates.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of a larger study to evaluate the
      difference between microbiota composition of patients with and without colorectal cancer,
      with inflammatory bowel disease and those with and without anastomotic leakage
      postoperatively of a colonic resection.

      Stool samples will be taken from 20 patients, including 5 without intestinal pathology, 5
      with colorectal cancer undergoing colorectal surgery, 5 with inflammatory bowel disease and 5
      with anastomotic leakage after colectomy for colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease.

      The stool samples will be analyzed at CRCHUM to draw up a profile of the bacteria that make
      up the microbiota of each patient.

      For participants included in groups 1, 3 and 4, stool samples will be collected prior to
      surgery. For participants included in group 1 only, a stool sample will also be collected
      after surgery.

      For patients included in group 2, a sample of the digestive content (stool) will be collected
      during surgery.
