  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer patients receive chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells against mesothelin
      (CARTmeso) or CD19 (CART19) cells administered at 3 days via pancreatic artery infusion or
      i.v. after preconditioning of cyclophosphamide. Both CART cells are autologous. CARTmeso
      cells target pancreatic cells which highly express mesothelin, while CART19 cells target
      tumor-associated B cells expressing cluster of differentiation antigen 19 (CD19) which are
      mostly immunosuppressive. The investigators hypothesize that this combination therapy may
      enhance the efficacy of CARTmeso cells in the body. Additionally, a medium dose of
      cyclophosphamide is used to enhance the engraftment of CART cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, pilot study to determine the safety and feasibility of
      combination CARTmeso cells and CART19 cells in patients with pancreatic cancer following
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide. Both cells contain CAR proteins consisting of a
      murine-derived single chain antibody fragment (scFv), cluster of differentiation antigen 137
      (41BB) co-stimulatory domain and cluster of differentiation antigen 3 zeta chain (CD3ζ)
      signaling domain transduced by lentivirus
