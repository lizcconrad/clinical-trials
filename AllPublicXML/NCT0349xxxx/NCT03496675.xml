  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of two music-based approaches - group music therapy
      and recreational choir singing - for reducing depression symptoms in people living with
      dementia. It also examines mechanisms and heterogeneity of treatment effects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia and depression are highly prevalent and comorbid conditions in older adults and are
      associated with individual distress, substantial carer burden, and high societal costs.

      Music interventions represent a highly promising type of non-pharmacological interventions
      for both dementia and depression in older adults. They are widely used, but have yet to be
      rigorously tested in large trials.

      The MIDDEL trial is the largest trial of music interventions to date, and the first to
      compare different music-based interventions - group music therapy (GMT), and recreational
      choir singing (RCS) - alone and in combination across countries.

      MIDDEL is designed as a large, pragmatic, international cluster-randomised controlled trial
      with a 2x2 factorial design that will compare the effects of GMT, RCS, both, or neither, for
      care home residents aged 65 years or older with dementia and depressive symptoms.

      Study sites will be located in Australia and in six European countries, and a total of 100
      care home units will be randomised to one of the four study conditions.

    <masking_description>Blinding of assessors will be ensured by using assessors who do not participate in the daily care of each unit. Assessors will also remind participants not to reveal the unit's allocation to them. At the time of the last assessment, success of blinding will be verified by asking assessors whether they inadvertently discovered the unit's allocation. Intervention providers and study participants (PLWD and staff) cannot be blinded due to the nature of the interventions. However, efforts will be made to ensure that no differential expectations are created and equipoise is maintained (e.g., by careful wording of the patient information and consent form).</masking_description>
