  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      JointCOACH is a web-based communication platform that enables joint replacement patients to
      communicate with their care team via computer or smartphone throughout their episode of care,
      from the time that surgery is scheduled until at least 90 days postoperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive the following information at key intervals: 1) instructions about how
      to prepare for surgery, 2) information about the procedure, 3) information about medications
      and pain control, 4) information about postoperative recovery and rehabilitation. In
      addition, several surveys will be distributed using JointCOACH to keep patients involved in
      their own recovery and to keep the surgical team informed of their progress. The proposed
      research will help determine if JointCOACH can improve patient satisfaction and clinical
      outcomes.
