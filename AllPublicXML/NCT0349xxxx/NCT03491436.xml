    <textblock>
      Background: Remote monitoring (RM) is a new screenings- and or diagnostic tool in healthcare.
      In 2015, the PREMOM study (Pregnancy Remote Monitoring), in which patients with gestational
      hypertensive diseases did received a RM prenatal follow up, has started. The first results
      showed an added value of RM in the prenatal follow-up. Due to these results, a RM program for
      pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) will be developed and evaluated.

      Protocol: Women (at risk of) GDM will be included in this study. They receive a iHealth Align
      (a glucose monitor) and associated glycemiestrips. The app of iHealth will be downloaded on
      the pregnant women's Smartphone to collect the data and to send them to the researcher in the
      hospital.

      The women is asked to perform four glycemie controls/day (sober and two hours after every
      mail) with the received glucose monitor. The monitor is connected via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
      with the computer of the researches who controls and evaluated these data. Additionally, the
      pregnant women has to check daily her body weight with a weight scale of her own. They have
      to upload these data manually in the app on her smartphone.

      When the pregnant women has an prenatal consultation, an overview with the data will be send
      to the responsible gynecologist. The gynecologist will also be alarmed when the pregnant
      women has three abnormal values at the same moment of the day (ex. Every morning after
      breakfast). When necessary, advice among life-style can be given or a referral to an
      endocrinologist can be made. The researches will not perform interventions by herself, only
      the responsible doctor can do this.

      By analyzing the patients parameters when she's at home, a better vision can be achieved of
      the health of the mother and the child. This study will be conducted as a first research to
      get a better insight in the added value of RM in pregnancies complicated with GDM.
