  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two different surgical protocols for socket preservation were compared. Soft and hard tissue
      outcomes were measured clinically and radiographically at baseline and six months post
      operatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of different surgical techniques for socket preservation on soft tissue parameters
      has seldom been investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate One with a cross-linked
      membrane used in secondary intention healing and the other with a non-cross-linked membrane
      used in primary intentional healing. Thirty subjects requiring tooth extraction were randomly
      allocated to either control group C (allograft covered with a non-cross-linked collagen
      membrane with primary closure) or experimental group E (allograft covered with cross-linked
      collagen membrane left exposed). Sites were surgically re-entered at 6-months. Soft and hard
      tissue measurements, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and cast measurements were taken at
      baseline &amp; 6-months.
