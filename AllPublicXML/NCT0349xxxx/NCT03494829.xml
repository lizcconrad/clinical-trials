      Observation study about physical activity, motor competence, pulmonary function, and health
      related quality of life in children, surgically treated for early onset scoliosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) defines patients who develop deformities of the spine and/or
      thorax in the embryologic development or in the early childhood. The exact prevalence of EOS
      in Norway is unknown, but it is assumed to be approximately 200-300 new EOS patients every
      year. EOS is a severe condition, whereby some of the most common and also most severe
      consequences of the deformity are severe pulmonary problems. The patients may require
      extensive orthopedic treatment from early childhood and until maturity to avoid serious
      consequences with severe pulmonary problems and shortening of life.

      EOS' secondary problems, including severe consequences on the pulmonary function might
      contribute to enhanced inactivity. Inactivity contributes to further negative impact on
      development of the musculoskeletal system, motor competence and pulmonary function.
      Considering the severity of EOS and children's reduced life expectancy, it is extremely
      important that EOS children achieve the favorable impact of physical activity during their
      growth. Insufficient level of activity might worsen the prognosis, thus counteracting the
      treatment's ambitions. The investigator's aim is to extend the knowledge about level of
      activity, motor competence, pulmonary function, and health related quality of life in
      Norwegian children, surgically treated for EOS.
