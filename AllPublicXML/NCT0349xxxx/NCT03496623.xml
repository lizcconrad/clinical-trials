               2. Males with a partner of childbearing potential must agree to use a condom for the
                  duration of treatment and for at least 48 hours after discontinuing study drug.

          3. The subject has a clinical diagnosis of WHO Group 3 PH associated with COPD using the
             Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) diagnostic criteria and
             post-bronchodilator spirometry.

          4. The subject has a resting peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≥90%, with or
             without supplemental oxygen, not to exceed 10 L/min.

          5. The subject's baseline 6MWD must be at least 100 meters.

          6. Subjects are required to have a right heart catheterization (RHC) including a
             vasodilator test, with and without oxygen challenge, prior to randomization with the
             following documented parameters:

               1. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) &gt;4 Wood Units (WU) and

               2. A pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) or left ventricular end-diastolic
                  pressure (LVEDP) of ≤15 mmHg

               3. A pulmonary arterial pressure mean (PAPm) of ≥30 mmHg

          7. Subjects on a supportive medication therapy must be on a stable and optimized dose for
             ≥30 days prior to Screening Visit. Exceptions are the discontinuation or dose changes
             of anticoagulants and/or dose changes of diuretics.

          8. Subjects must be post recovery from an acute respiratory event or hospitalization for
             respiratory insufficiency, on a stable and optimized dose of chronic medications for

             other conditions, such as congestive heart disease, coronary artery disease, or
             valvular heart disease.

         12. The subject has a Body Mass Index ≥45 kg/m2 at Screening Visit 1.

             limit ambulation.

         14. Use of any investigational drug/device, or participation in any investigational study
             with therapeutic intent within 30 days prior to Screening Visit 1.
