  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to find out if using additional MRIs and biomarker testing
      can help researchers learn to predict how the tumor may change during radiation therapy.

      Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to participant's reaction to
      treatment. Biomarker testing in the study may include genetic biomarkers.

      This is an investigational study. MRIs on this study are performed using FDA-approved and
      commercially available methods. Having added scans and blood tests is investigational.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study (up to 80 patients and up to 20 healthy
      volunteers in another part of the study). All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Visits:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will have the
      following tests and procedures performed.

      If participant is receiving chemotherapy before radiation therapy, blood (about 3 teaspoons)
      will be drawn for biomarker testing before participant starts chemotherapy and then before
      each cycle of chemotherapy until participant starts radiation therapy.

      For all participants, the following tests and procedures will be performed before participant
      starts radiation therapy:

        -  Participant will have an MRI.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  Participant will complete a questionnaire about participant's quality of life.
           Completing this questionnaire should take about 5-10 minutes.

      Treatment is given outside of the study, as recommended by participant's doctor. Taking part
      in the study will not affect participant's treatment plan.

      After participant's first radiation treatment, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for
      biomarker testing.

      Every week while participant is receiving radiation therapy:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam and endoscopy.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

      Every week during radiation therapy:

        -  Participant will have an MRI. This may be done as often as 1 time a day during radiation
           therapy if participant is having image-guided radiation therapy (GRT).

        -  Participant will complete the quality-of-life questionnaire.

      Wherever possible, blood samples will be collected at the same time as routine blood draws
      and/or when a catheter (needle and tube) is placed. However, if a blood draw is not planned,
      one will be scheduled for this study.

      Length of Study:

      Participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visit. Participant will be taken
      off study early if radiation treatment is stopped early.

      Follow-up:

      One (1) time a week for as long as needed during routine follow-up, participant will complete
      the quality-of-life questionnaire.

      At 2-3 months after treatment:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam and endoscopy.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  Participant will have a CT, MRI, and PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.
