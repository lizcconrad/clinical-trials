      Primary Objective:

      -To demonstrate that, efpeglenatide doses 1 and 2 is noninferior to placebo on 3-point major
      adverse cardiac event (MACE) in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients at high
      cardiovascular (CV) risk.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that efpeglenatide doses 1 and 2 is superior to placebo in T2DM patients
           with high CV risk on the following parameters:

        -  3-point MACE.

        -  Expanded CV outcome.

        -  Composite outcome of new or worsening nephropathy.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of efpeglenatide doses 1 and 2, both added to
           standard of care in T2DM patients at high CV risk.
