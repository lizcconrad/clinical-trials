    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the influence of body position and additional axial
      load on spinal stiffness in young healthy adults.

    <textblock>
      Spinal stiffness plays an important role in the assessment of the spine in the clinical daily
      routine. It is often performed as a manual PA-pressure test in the prone position. The spinal
      stiffness is the result of the resistance from the active, passive and neurological
      subsystems, like muscles (active), ligaments, joint capsule and the skin (passive). Further
      research had shown, that the spinal stiffness depends also from other factors. It is
      increased by axial compression. A better understanding of spinal stiffness leads to novel
      insights into spinal stabilization mechanisms.

    <description>posterior-to-anterior spinal will be assesd in prone and upright body position and in upright body position with additional axial.
The device measures tissue compliance according to the concept of impulse-response. A force of exact 80 Newton will be applied from the device to the process spinous. The expected impulse-response (result) will be between 40 Newton and 70 Newton.</description>
