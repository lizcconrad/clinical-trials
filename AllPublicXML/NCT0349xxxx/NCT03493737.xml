  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib needs repetitive visits at hospital for injections. Hospital-at-Home (HaH) might
      be an attractive and suitable alternative in this situation.

      This study aim to perform a cost-utility analysis of two different strategies in several HaH
      structures within the Grand Est region in France.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib is a standard therapy of newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma and is also approved for
      relapsing disease, requiring the patients to travel to the outpatient-hospital (OH) once a
      week for several months. Hospital-at-Home (HaH) might be an attractive and suitable
      alternative in this situation.

      This study aim to perform a cost-utility analysis of two different strategies in several HaH
      structures within the Grand Est region in France: exclusive hospital-based Bortezomib
      administration versus combined administration in both OH and HaH.
