  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the dosage for oral and IM Cabotegravir LA and IM
      Rilpiverine LA and evaluate the safety, acceptability, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      oral and long-acting injectable cabotegravir and long-acting injectable rilpivirine in
      virologically suppressed HIV-infected children and adolescents.

      This study will confirm the dose and evaluate the safety, acceptability, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of oral cabotegravir (CAB), long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB
      LA), and long-acting injectable rilpivirine (RPV LA) in virologically suppressed HIV‐1
      infected children and adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years.

      The study will include two cohorts of participants and two steps of study participation in
      each cohort. Cohort 1, Step 1 and Cohort 2, Step 3 are both a lead-in phase in which
      participants will receive oral formulations of the study products for at least 4 weeks, and
      up to 6 weeks (maximum). In Cohort 1, Step 2 and Cohort 2, Step 4, participants will receive
      injectable formulations of the study products. In each cohort, participants will enter the
      study in the oral lead-in phase (Step 1, or Step 3) and then transition to the injectable
      phase (Step 2, or Step 4) if eligibility criteria for the injectable phase are met.

      The study will open to accrual in Cohort 1, in which participants, in addition to continuing
      their pre-study combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen, will receive either oral
      CAB or oral RPV (Step 1) followed by either CAB LA or RPV LA (Step 2). Cohort 1 participants
      will be assigned either CAB (Cohort 1C) or RPV (Cohort 1R) based on their pre-study cART
      regimen. Participants will not stop their cART. An interim analysis of safety and PK data
      will be performed, and Cohort 2 will initially open to accrual based on these interim
      analyses; however, accrual at this stage will be limited to Cohort 1 participants who meet
      criteria to enter Cohort 2. After Cohort 1 is fully enrolled and a full cohort data analysis
      is performed, accrual into Cohort 2 will be opened to additional participants who were not
      previously enrolled in Cohort 1. Upon Cohort 2 Entry (i.e. Cohort 2, Step 3), all Cohort 2
      participants will discontinue their pre-study cART regimen and receive both study products —
      CAB and RPV — at the doses confirmed in Cohort 1.

      Upon permanent discontinuation of injectable study product (during Cohort 1, Step 2, and
      Cohort 2, Step 4), participants will be followed for an additional 48 weeks after their last
      study product injection. Participants in Cohort 1 will be followed for up to 64 weeks, and
      participants in Cohort 2 will be followed for up to 144 weeks. Enrolled parents/caregivers
      will complete a single qualitative phone interview.

                  eligibility determination.

          -  For participants enrolling into Cohort 1, Step 1 and on an atazanavir-containing (ATV)

                  prescribed time, per the respective contraceptive method, to be considered
                  effective at the time of Entry. The site IoR or designee is responsible for
                  ensuring that the contraceptive is used in accordance with the approved product
                  label, and counseling participants on proper use of chosen methods of

        lead-in phase (Step 1) to the injection phase (Step 2) primarily based on the safety
        assessments from the Cohort 1 Step 1 Week 4a study visit. Clinical assessments conducted
        prior to administering the first injection at the Week 4b visit will also be used to
        confirm eligibility to receive the injectable study product. See the study protocol for
        Week 4a and Week 4b visit scheduling, order of procedures, and visit windows, respectively.

        All of the following criteria must be met in order for participants to be included in
        Cohort 1 Step 2:

          -  Currently enrolled in Cohort 1, Step 1

             1 Step 1 Week 4a study visit laboratory tests, has Grade 2 or lower of all the
             following laboratory test results:

                  laboratory test result values from the Week 4a visit may be repeated within the
                  target visit window, and if confirmatory testing results in Grade 2 or lower, the
                  participant may be eligible to continue onto the injection phase, should all
                  other eligibility criteria be met.

             adequate evaluation of safety and tolerability as part of the oral lead-in phase prior
             to entry into the injection phase

          -  Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from Cohort 1

               -  Occurrence of any grade 3 or higher adverse event assessed as related to study
                  product during participation in Step 1

               -  Any other condition or social circumstance that, in the opinion of the IoR or
                  designee, would make study participation unsafe, complicate interpretation of
                  study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives.

        Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, Step 4 (Cohort 2 Progression Criteria, Step 3 to Step 4)

        Cohort 2 Step 3 participants will be assessed for eligibility to progress from the oral
        lead-in phase (Step 3) to the injection phase (Step 4) primarily based on the safety
        assessments from the Cohort 2 Step 3 Week 4a study visit. Clinical assessments conducted
        prior to administering the first injection at the Week 4b visit will also be used to
        confirm eligibility to receive the injectable study product. See the study protocol for
        Week 4a and Week 4b visit scheduling, order of procedures, and target visit windows,
        respectively.

             2 Step 3 Week 4a study visit laboratory tests, has Grade 2 or lower of the following
             laboratory test results:

               -  ALT (u/l)

               -  Lipase (u/l)

                  visit may be repeated, within the target visit window, and if confirmatory
                  testing results in Grade 2 or lower, the participant may be eligible to continue
                  onto the injection phase, should all other eligibility criteria be met.
