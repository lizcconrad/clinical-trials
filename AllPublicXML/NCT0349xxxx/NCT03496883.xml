  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the rFVIIa for Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke Administered at Earliest Time
      (FASTEST) Trial is to establish the first treatment for acute spontaneous ICH within a time
      window and subgroup of patients that is most likely to benefit. Our central hypothesis is
      that rFVIIa, administered within 120 minutes from onset with an identified subgroup of
      subjects most likely to benefit, will improve outcomes at 90 days as measured by the modified
      Rankin score (mRS) and decrease ongoing bleeding as compared to standard therapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a global, Phase III, randomized, double-blind controlled trial
      of rFVIIa plus best standard therapy vs. placebo and best standard therapy alone. The
      investigators will include subjects with a volume of ICH &lt; 60 cc, no IVH or a small volume of
      IVH (IVH score ≤ 7), age ≤ age 80, Glasgow Coma Scale of ≥ 8, and treated within 120 minutes
      from stroke onset. To minimize time-to-treatment, the study will use exemption from informed
      consent (EFIC) and mobile stroke care units (MSUs) with a goal of ½ of patients treated
      within 90 minutes as accomplished in the NINDS t-PA trials. At 100 hospital sites and 15 MSUs
      in the NINDS-funded StrokeNet, and key global institutions with large volumes of ICH patients
      and ability to treat them within 2 hours of onset, we plan to recruit 860 participants over 3
      1/2 years. Countries planning to participate in the trial include the United States, Canada,
      Australia, Japan, Germany and Spain.

      The investigators will randomize participants in a double-blinded fashion to rFVIIa 80 µg/kg
      dose (maximum 8 mg dose) or placebo. Subjects in both arms will receive best medical therapy
      as per published AHA Guidelines for ICH, including a target blood pressure of 140 mm Hg.
      Primary outcome (ordinal mRS) will be determined at 3 months, but we will follow participants
      by a telephone assessment at 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. To measure growth of ICH, all
      subjects will have baseline non-contrast CT of the head and a repeat CT at 24 hours. The
      investigators will perform centralized volumetric measurements of ICH, IVH, and edema for
      both time points.

      Novo Nordisk will manufacture and supply recombinant FVIIa as a research medication for use
      in the FASTEST Trial. Novo Nordisk will also manufacture and supply matching placebo that is
      identical in appearance and administration for the FASTEST Trial.
