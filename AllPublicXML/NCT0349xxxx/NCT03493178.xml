  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly humans have an increased risk of dementia which begins as mild defects in memory
      called mild cognitive impairment. Glutathione (GSH), a key endogenous antioxidant has been
      linked to cognition. This exploratory study will investigate mechanisms linked to GSH for
      cognitive impairment (and improvement) by studying humans with mild cognitive impairment who
      will be evaluated 12-weeks after receiving either N-acetylcysteine and glycine (GSH
      precursors), or receiving alanine, and a further 12-weeks after stopping these supplements.

      Subjects with MCI will be recruited by written informed consent using forms approved by the
      Baylor IRB. Subjects will stop nonvitamin supplements for 4wks before screening labs (blood
      count, HbA1c, glucose, lipid profile, liver profile, blood urea nitrogen, Creatinine, thyroid
      stimulating hormone, free T4), and for the entire 24wks duration of the study. 60 fasted
      subjects will have the following measures before and after 12wks of supplementation with
      cysteine (as N-acetylcysteine) plus glycine vs alanine: (1) Cognitive function using
      ADCS-PACC (Alzheimer's Disease Co-operative Study-Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite
      which includes Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, Immediate and Delayed paragraph recall
      score, Digit-Symbol Substitution Test, Mini mental state examination; (2) Red-cell
      concentrations of GSH, cysteine, glycine, glutamic acid; plasma malondialdehyde,
      F2/F3-isoprostanes, sICAM, sVCAM, E-selectin; endothelial function; (3) Mitochondrial glucose
      oxidation by calorimetry. Measures will be repeated for washout effects 12-wks after stopping
      supplements.
