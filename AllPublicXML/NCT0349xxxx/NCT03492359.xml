    <textblock>
      To demonstrate differences in tidal breathing patterns measured by SLP(Structured Light
      Plethysmography) between healthy subjects and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
      The correlation between SLP parameters and standard lung function parameters measured by body
      box and spirometry will also be assessed. Trends in SLP breathing patterns between the
      different GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) stages of COPD, and
      between those and healthy subjects, will be investigated to assess whether SLP can detect
      differences between groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Structured light plethysmography (SLP) is a novel, non-contact method for assessing quiet
      'tidal' breathing. A number of studies have reported the effects of conditions such as
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on tidal breathing patterns, and a previous
      study has shown that SLP is able to detect differences in ten tidal breathing patterns
      between healthy subjects and patients with COPD. In this present study, the investigators
      will aim to confirm the previous findings and also to examine the relationship between SLP
      tidal breathing parameters and traditional measurements of lung function measured by
      spirometry and body box plethysmograph. The correlation between SLP parameters with lung
      Function parameters measured by spirometry and body box plethysmography: forced expiratory
      volume in one second (FEV1); Forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC (forced expiratory volume
      in one second/forced vital capacity); total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV).
      Trends in tidal breathing patterns between varying severities of COPD (based on the (Global
      initiative for lung disease (GOLD) grading system.
