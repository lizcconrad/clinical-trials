  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial is for investigating the effects of multidisciplinary
      intervention program on cognition and activity of daily living ability in community dwelling
      healthy elderly. The intervention consists of cognitive group training every month, daily
      home cognitive training using cognitive training smartphone application, record of weekly
      physical activity and body weight and feedback program, and alcohol and smoking cessation
      monitoring and feedback program. The total duration of intervention is 1 year, and the
      table-based cognitive screening test and the patient-reported questionnaires to evaluate
      subjective memory decline, quality of life, depression, and activity of daily living are used
      for outcome measures.
