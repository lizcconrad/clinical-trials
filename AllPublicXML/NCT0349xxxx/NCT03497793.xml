  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin-to-skin care (placing the nappy-clad baby on the mother's bare chest and draping both in
      a blanket) is known to benefit both baby and mother. Benefits to the baby include warmth,
      reduced crying, and stabilisation of heart rate, breathing and blood sugar, and promotion of
      breastfeeding while simultaneously reduces mother's anxiety, improves bonding, and increases
      breastmilk production. Although these benefits are even more pronounced for preterm, studies
      show most preterm babies do not receive adequate skin-to-skin care due to fears such as
      dislodging intravenous lines, ventilation tubes, monitor wires and concerns about safety and
      privacy. Measures are therefore required to increase maternal confidence and awareness and
      facilitate skin-to-skin care for preterm infants.

      SNUBY® (SNUggle baBY) is a purpose-built garment for facilitation of skin-to-skin care in
      preterm infants. It is made of comfortable, breathable bamboo fabric with an attractive
      appearance such that it can be worn as a normal garment.

      In addition, it has distinctive features that allow the baby to be placed in a specially
      designed pouch, in direct contact with the mother's skin, with supports for lines and tubes
      that may be attached to the baby. Although many garments are commercially available for
      mothers to carry babies, no such specially designed garment has ever been tested
      scientifically and none are specifically designed for preterm babies. In this observational
      study, the investigators will initially test the feasibility of using the SNUBY® in preterm
      infants by inviting five mothers-preterm infant pairs, with mother's written informed
      consent, to use the garment under direct supervision. Following this, the investigators will
      analyse the safety and acceptability of using it on a larger scale to facilitate skin-to-skin
      care in preterm babies. The investigators will gather information on the staff and mothers'
      knowledge of skin-to-skin care and their experience of using SNUBY®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin-to-skin contact is used as part of a package of Kangaroo Mother Care across the world.
      This has been demonstrated to reduce neonatal morbidity, mortality, and inpatient stays for
      low birth weight and preterm infants (Charpak and Ruiz 2016).

      This study examines the effect a facilitating garment, the Snuby® has on neonatal health
      outcomes associated with skin-to-skin contact, such as neonatal thermoregulation,
      breastfeeding status, and self-reported mother-infant bonding. It uses a mixed methods
      approach to address quantitative and qualitative outcomes including participant's
      perspectives, and measurable health markers.

    <description>Following written informed consent, mother will be issued with an appropriate sized SNUBY® for her use only. The infant will be placed in skin-to-skin in SNUBY®, infant chest to mother's chest whilst the mother is seated on a reclining chair, allowing the infant to be further stabilised by gravity. Monitor wires, IV lines and/or ventilation tube will be secured using the ties on the SNUBY®. The infant's temperature, pulse and SaO2 will be recorded prior to skin-to-skin, repeated as required for the infant's clinical condition or at 30min intervals for the duration of skin-to-skin. Maternal and infant behaviour will be recorded, including spontaneous breastfeeding. The time taken to put the infant into skin-to-skin care, time in skin-to-skin care and time to return to cot will be recorded.</description>
