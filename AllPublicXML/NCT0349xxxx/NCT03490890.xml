  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GGO was commonly observed recently.Radiofrequency ablation has been widely applied in the
      treatment of patients with GGO. No study had explored the microwave ablation in the treatment
      of GGO.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GGO was common with the development of image. Treatments of GGO include radical surgery and
      irradiation. For patients who were poor candidate of surgery, image guided thermal ablation
      could be an alternative.Radiofrequency ablation has been widely applied in the treatment of
      eary-stage non small cell lung cancer and those patients with GGO. However, up to date, no
      study had explored the microwave ablation in the treatment of GGO.
