      The purpose of this clinical research study is to examine whether Embozene treatment of the
      genicular artery is a safe and effective way to treat arthritic knee pain. Embozene is a
      medical device made by Boston Scientific approved in the United States for the treatment of
      hypervascular tumors and arteriovenous malformations. It consists of thousands of microscopic
      spheres that are injected into the artery in the knee going to the region of pain. One of the
      causes of pain in the setting of knee arthritis is increased blood flow going to the specific
      area of pain. The goal of this procedure is to decrease the blood flow (embolize) to the
      specific region of the knee that is causing your pain. This is done by infusing Embozene
      particles into the specific blood vessel (genicular artery) supplying the area of pain in the
      knee.

      This is a phase 2, single-center, prospective, single arm investigational study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of genicular artery embolization (GAE) for treatment of symptomatic
      knee osteoarthritis (OA). Subjects will be treated with a genicular artery embolization (GAE)
      procedure performed with Embozene Microspheres. The microspheres will be delivered in a
      saline-contrast medium solution and will be delivered to the arteries supplying the areas of
      the subject's pain. The primary objective of this investigation is to assess safety of
      genicular artery embolization (GAE) for knee osteoarthritis (OA) using Embozene particles.
