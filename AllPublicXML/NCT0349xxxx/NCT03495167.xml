      To assess tolerability of SyB C-1101 when administered orally BID for 21 days followed by a
      7-day observation period in patients with recurrent/relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic

    <measure>Identification of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Number of Patients with DLT in Each Cohort</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Based on the number of patients with DLT and administration dose in each cohort, recommended dosage will be defined for the following clinical phase.
A DLT is defined as an adverse event that occurred during the Cycle 1, for which a causality with the investigational products (IP) cannot be ruled out and meets the following criteria.
Criteria: ≥ Grade3 non-hematological toxicity (except pyrexia). However nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis and esophagitis/dysphagia are excluded (≥ Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea persist for ≥ 48 hours and uncontrolled by antiemetic or antidiarrheal agents, and ≥ Grade 3 stomatitis and esophagitis/dysphagia lasting for ≥ 4 days are regarded as DLTs). ≥ Grade 2 pyrexia uncontrolled by antipyretic agents. However, in case pyrexia of ˃ 39°C occurred within 24 hours after administration of SyB C-1101 and its cause is unclear, it is deemed that the causality to the IP cannot be ruled out.</description>

    <description>SyB C-1101 (rigosertib sodium) will be administered to two cohorts of patients; each receives either twice daily (560 mg before breakfast and 560 mg before dinner) or twice daily (840 mg before breakfast and 280 mg before dinner. SyB C-1101 will be administered orally twice daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day observation period. The treatment period of 28 days (21 days of administration + 7 days of observation) constitutes 1 cycle.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Patients who meet all of the following criteria are eligible for enrollment in the study:

          1. Histologically or cytologically diagnosed as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) according
             to WHO criteria or FAB classification. For patients with RAEB in transformation
             (RAEB-t), peripheral WBC is ≦25,000 /mm3 and the disease is stable for at least 4
             weeks.

             immunosuppressive therapy, protein anabolic steroids, and chemotherapy including

               -  Serum creatinine: &lt;2.0 mg/dL

               -  ECG: Absence of abnormal findings that require treatment

               -  Echocardiography: Absence of abnormal findings that require treatment

          9. The patient must sign an informed consent form indicating that s/he understands the
             purpose of and procedure required for the study and is willing to participate in the
             study.
