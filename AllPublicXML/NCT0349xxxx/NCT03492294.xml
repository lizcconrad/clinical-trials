      The aim of the present study was to evaluated the neural effect of music on the cerebral
      activation in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) by
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      Background: Sensory stimulations were used widely to evaluate the preserved cerebral
      functions for these patients with disorders of consciousness. Among these, the most alerting
      or common stimuli are probably familiar voice and music.

      Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluated the neural effect of music on the
      cerebral activation in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state
      (MCS) by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      Methods: Eleven severely brain-damaged patients (6 UWS and 5 MCS) were assessed by functional
      magnetic resonance imaging while they were exposed under the condition of their personal
      music. To examine the prognostic value of these patients, longitudinal behavioral assessments
      were repeatedly conducted by means of the CRS-R after fMRI acquisition.
