  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label, single-center, phase 1/2 study, to determine the safety and
      efficacy of TriCAR-T-CD19, an autologous tri-functional anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor
      (CAR)-positive T cell therapy, in refractory/Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tri-functional anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor contains an anti-CD19 scFv, a PD-L1
      blocker, and a cytokine complex, enabling the TriCAR-T-CD19 to simultaneously targeting the
      CD19 positive NHL，blocking the inhibitory PD-L1 signal and stimulating T/NK cell activation
      and expansion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All subjects must personally sign and date the consent form before initiating any
             study specific procedures or activities;

          2. All subjects must be able to comply with all the scheduled procedures in the study;

          3. Histologically or cytologically confirmed CD19 positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma;

             chemotherapy; Disease progression or relapsed in ≤12 months of ASCT (must have biopsy
             proven recurrence in relapsed subjects); If salvage therapy is given post-ASCT, the
             subject must have had no response to or relapsed after the last line of therapy.

             years;

          2. History of allogeneic stem cell transplantation;

          3. Prior other CAR therapy or other genetically modified T cell therapy;

          4. Presence of fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is uncontrolled or

             with a history of CNS lymphoma, cerebrospinal fluid malignant cells or brain
             metastases;

          6. Lactating women;

          7. Active infection with hepatitis B (HBsAG positive) or hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV

          9. History of any gene therapy;

         10. Subjects need systematic usage of immunosuppressive drug;

         11. Known history of infection with HIV;

         12. Planed operation, history of other related disease, or any other related laboratory
             tests restrict patients for the study;

         13. Other reasons the investigator think the patient may not be suitable for the study.
