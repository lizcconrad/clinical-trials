  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if sustained exercise can affect the outcomes in
      patients with a specific type of colorectal cancer called Lynch Syndrome .

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson and
      in the local community.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked screening questions to complete
      the eligibility requirement and if you are eligible you will have the following study visits.

      Study Visits:

      Visit 1 (Day 0):

        -  You will have a lower GI endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy). During an
           endoscopy, you will be mildly sedated and a thin, flexible tube (called an endoscope)
           will be inserted inside the anus, rectum, and colon. Tissue samples will also be
           collected during this procedure. Up to 15 normal tissue biopsies will be taken during
           these procedures for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers. Biomarkers are
           found in the blood/tissue and may be related to the disease and the impact of exercise
           on the disease. If the doctor finds any abnormal tissue in your bowel during the
           procedure, they will be counted and removed. You will sign a separate consent for this
           procedure which will describe it in more detail, including its risks.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected for biomarker testing. You must
           fast (have nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 12 hours before each blood
           draw as part of this study.

      Visit 2 (Day 15):

        -  You will have a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) to check your lung function. The
           CPET checks how well your lungs are working by measuring how much oxygen and carbon
           dioxide your lungs take in and release when you breathe. To perform this test, you will
           be asked to bicycle at increasingly higher resistance until you reach a point that you
           can no longer exercise. You will be breathing into the machine while you cycle. This
           test will take about 30 minutes to complete. The study doctor and an exercise
           physiologist will be present for each CPET and available to respond to any complication.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  You will complete a questionnaire about your demographics, health history, and physical
           activity.

      Cycling Classes and FITBIT:

      Starting at Day 15 of the study, you will enroll in 3 cycling classes every week (for a total
      of 12 cycling classes each month). You will continue with these classes for up to 1 year.
      These cycling classes can be done at any fitness center in your local community. You will not
      be responsible for the cost of these cycling classes. You may choose any cycling class at any
      location you prefer.

      You will be given a FITBIT to wear while you attend cycling classes. You are encouraged to
      wear the FITBIT during the day as well, but this is not required. The FITBIT will record your
      exercise frequency and intensity. The exercise physiologist will tell you how to use it, if
      you have any questions. The FITBIT will be yours to keep. Data from your FITBIT will be
      linked to your medical record.

      After Day 15, you will be contacted, either phone or email, every 2 weeks by the study staff
      and asked about your FITBIT and FITBIT data and your exercise schedule. The exercise
      physiologist will discuss any barriers to exercise you may be having and/or answer any
      questions you may have related to physical activity, including the cycling classes.

      Visit 3 (between Day 300-360):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an endoscopy as described above in Visit 1.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be collected for biomarker testing.

      Visit 4 (within 30 days after Visit 3):

        -  You will have a CPET to check your heart and lung function.

        -  You will also complete the questionnaires about your demographics, health history, and
           physical activity.

      Length of Study:

      Your active participation in this study will be over after Visit 4. If you continue to use
      the FITBIT after your participation in this study is over, the data will not be viewed,
      collected, or entered into your medical record.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants must have Lynch syndrome defined as meeting any of the following: (1)
             Mutation-Positive Lynch syndrome: carriers or obligate carriers (by pedigree) of a
             pathogenic mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes (i.e. MLH1,
             MSH2/EPCAM, MSH6, or PMS2) or (2) Mutation-Negative Lynch syndrome: patients with a
             personal history of a non-sporadic MMR deficient premalignant lesion (i.e. polyp) or a
             non-sporadic MMR deficient malignant tumor (where non-sporadic MMR deficient is
             defined by: microsatellite-instability high by either immunohistochemistry or MSI
             testing or both, but no evidence of MLH1 promoter methylation in cases with loss of
             both MLH1 and PMS2, and/or no evidence of BRAF mutation in cases with loss of both
             MLH1 and PMS2) but germline MMR genetic testing showed either a variant of unknown
             significance or mutation negative result or had declined germline MMR genetic testing.

          2. Participants must not have evidence of active/recurrent malignant disease for a
             minimum of 6 months.

             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

          4. Individuals with a history of diabetes, hypertension, or have smoked cigarettes in the
             last 12 months.

          5. Individuals who are unable to participate in cycling due to musculoskeletal
             limitations.

          6. Individuals who are unable to identify cycling classes in their community for
