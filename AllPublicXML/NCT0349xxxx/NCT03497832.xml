  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      technique. It allows the quantification of cerebral metabolite concentrations. Currently,
      MRS-1H is used regardless of the examination schedule. However, it is not possible to say if
      the brain metabolite concentrations are stable over 24 hours. Thus, the main objective was to
      study the diurnal variation of cerebral metabolite concentrations in 1H-MRS in healthy
      subjects.

      Moreover, the investigators also want to investigate the association between choline
      concentrations (Cho, parameter reflecting membrane metabolism) in 1H-MRS and fractional
      anisotropy (AF) values, obtained with the diffusion tensor imaging sequence (DTI), in the
      white matter of the centrum ovale. The results obtained from this objective will allow to
      obtain reference values of an estimate of the association between Cho concentrations and AF
      values in healthy subjects. These data are intended to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic
      management of patients with neurological pathologies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, it is not possible to say if the brain metabolite concentrations are stable over
      24 hours in 1H-MRS. Few studies, with small samples (&lt; 10 subjects), have investigated this
      point. Their conclusions remain inconsistent. Without an available study with sufficient
      statistical power, it is not currently possible to state that concentrations of brain
      metabolites are stable over 24 hours. Therefore, it is not possible to formally conclude on
      differences in concentrations of metabolites between a healthy subject and a patient.

      It is known that the human circadian rhythm leads to changes on many parameters such as
      hormonal secretions (TSH, cortisol, melatonin, growth hormone, and carbohydrate metabolism)
      and body temperature. It therefore seemed relevant to choose 3 of the most critical periods
      of the human circadian rhythm (7:30, 13:30 and 18:00) to assess the diurnal variations of
      cerebral metabolite in 1H-MRS. The DTI sequence will only be performed once.

      The study will take place at the University Hospital of Poitiers, in the department of
      Medical Imaging. 3 appointments are planned: the pre-inclusion one D0, the inclusion one D1
      including the signature of the consent, and the D3 one for the realization of the 3 MRIs at
      7:30 am, 1:30 pm and 6 pm. Each MRI scan lasts an average of 20 minutes.
