  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single
      ascending dose, sequential group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PB2452 with and without ticagrelor pretreatment
      when administered to healthy male and female subjects.

      Up to 6 dose levels will be evaluated. This study will have up to 9 cohorts and up to a total
      of approximately 60 subjects with either 4 or 8 subjects in each cohort depending on the
      dose. The starting dose of PB2452 will be 100 mg and the planned doses for subsequent cohorts
      are 300, 1000, 3000, 9000, and 18000 mg.

             determined by medical history, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign
             measurements, 12 lead ECG results, and physical examination findings at screening.

             Specific inclusionary laboratory values at screening and check-in require the
             following:

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total serum bilirubin
                  and alkaline phosphatase levels within the normal range as defined by the
                  clinical laboratory

               -  White blood cell (WBC) count, platelet count and hemoglobin level within the
                  normal range as defined by the clinical laboratory

               -  Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level within the normal range as defined by the
                  clinical laboratory at screening

               -  Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) level within the
                  normal range as defined by the clinical laboratory

          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant, lactating, or planning
             to become pregnant before 3 months after the last dose of study drug, and have a
             negative serum pregnancy test at screening and check-in. Female subjects of
             childbearing potential must use 2 effective methods of birth control (ie, oral,
             implantable, patch, or injectable contraceptives in combination with a condom,
             hormone-containing intrauterine device that has been in place for at least 2 months
             prior to screening in combination with a condom, double-barrier method [ie, condoms,
             sponge, diaphragm, or cervical cap with spermicidal gels or cream], or vasectomy for
             male subjects or male partners of female subjects) from 30 days before study drug
             administration through the end of the study. Women are considered not to be of
             childbearing potential if they have fulfilled one of the following criteria:
             documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization (ie, hysterectomy, or bilateral
             oophorectomy [not tubal ligation]), or postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for 12
             consecutive months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, and
             documented plasma follicle-stimulating hormone level &gt;40 IU/mL). Male subjects with
             partners of childbearing potential must agree to use appropriate and effective
             measures of contraception (eg, condom plus diaphragm with spermicide; condom plus
             spermicide) during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug, and to
             refrain from donating sperm for at least 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug
             until at least 90 days following the last dose of study drug.

          5. The subject agrees to comply with all protocol requirements.

          6. The subject is able to provide written informed consent.

             exclusion begins 30 days after the final dose or 5 half-lives of the experimental
             medication has elapsed, whichever is longer.

         14. The subject has involvement with any PhaseBio or study site employee or their close
