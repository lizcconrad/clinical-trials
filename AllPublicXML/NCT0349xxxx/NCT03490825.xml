  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to enhance circadian signals to improve cardiometabolic functions in older
      adults though meal timing interventions and melatonin supplements. Cardiometabolic disease
      (CMD) is prevalent among older adults, but despite vigorous research to prevent it, it
      remains on of the greatest public health challenges. Previous research has shown that
      extended overnight fasting and melatonin supplements may enhance circadian signals which in
      turn would enhance cardiometabolic function in older adults.

      This study will place subjects in one of four intervention groups, 1) Meal timing +
      Melatonin, 2) Meal timing + Placebo, 3) Melatonin, or 4) Placebo in order test out the
      effects of meal timing and melatonin both separately and together and cardio metabolic
      functions. The study will explore the effects of these interventions in acute-based (1-week)
      setting and extended-based (5 week) settings. This will allow us to test out the hypotheses
      of the study that meal timing can improve amplitude of circadian signals and improve
      cardiometabolic functions and sleep quality as well as melatonin improving cardiometabolic
      function and sleep quality. Finally, we will determine if the the addition of melatonin will
      further enhance the effects of the meal timing intervention for improving cardiometabolic
      function and sleep.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial where each participant will receive one of four intervention types. Subjects will be randomized at baseline visit to one of four arms using a randomized block design to achieve balanced groups. Randomization will be stratified by sex. The allocation will be created using an online randomization tool. This study will include a 6 week four arm field intervention to evaluate the independent effect of meal timing or melatonin as well as their combined effects</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Melatonin (3mg) will be administered daily during the intervention. Melatonin capsules will be obtained from Life Extension (Ft. Lauderdale, FL). The investigational drug pharmacy (IDP) at Northwestern Memorial Hospital will encapsulate the melatonin pills so the placebo (lactose) and melatonin pills appear identical. We have worked with this IDP on other projects. The investigators on this study have experience in administering melatonin for investigational and clinical purposes.</description>
