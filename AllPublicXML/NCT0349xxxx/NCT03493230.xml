  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this project is to perform a longitudinal monitoring of BRAF and NRAS
      cell-free DNA in a large cohort of metastatic melanomas patients before treatment and during
      the follow-up. Results will be compared with clinical data as imaging (based on RECIST
      criteria) and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase in serum (LDH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a consultation of follow-up for an advanced malignant melanoma (stage IIIb or IIIC or
      IV), an investigator presents the study to the patient and give him the note of information
      and the informed consent.

      The patient can benefit from a reflexion period of of 7 days.

      In case of agreement, a first blood draw will take place before initiation of any treatment.
      Between D15 and D30 a second blood draw will be taken. Then a blood draw will be necessary
      every two months until recurrence or progression of the disease for a maximum of 22 months.
