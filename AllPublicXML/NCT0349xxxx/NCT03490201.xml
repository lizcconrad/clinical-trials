  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is intended to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of
      ventricular ablation therapy using the FlexAbility Sensor Enabled Ablation Catheter in
      patients with drug-refractory monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in whom ventricular
      tachycardia recurs despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy or when antiarrhythmic drugs are not
      tolerated or desired.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Structural heart disease (ischemic or non-ischemic) with one of the following:

               -  Confirmed diagnosis via echocardiography and/or cardiac MRI, or

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) &lt;40% (documented within the last 6 months
                  via TTE, or

               -  Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (per 2010 ARVC/D Task Force
                  Criteria).27

          -  At least one documented episode of sustained MMVT by either EGM or ECG in the 6 months
             prior to enrollment

          -  Implanted with a market released ICD or CRT-D for at least 30 days prior to index
             ablation procedure

          -  Refractory (i.e. not effective, not tolerated or not desired) to at least one
             anti-arrhythmic medication (either amiodarone or sotalol) for treatment of MMVT

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Informed of the nature of the study, agreed to its provisions and has provided written
             informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
             (IRB/EC) of the respective clinical study site.

          -  Able and willing to comply with all study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Implanted with a subcutaneous ICD

          -  Implanted with a ventricular assist device (VAD) (e.g. TandemHeart)

          -  Currently receiving support, or anticipated to receive support prior to the index
             ablation procedure, via extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)

          -  Chronic NYHA Class IV heart failure

          -  Ejection fraction &lt; 15%

          -  Thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet count &lt;80,000) or coagulopathy

          -  Contraindication to systemic anticoagulation (i.e. heparin, warfarin, or a direct
             thrombin inhibitor)

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing

          -  Active uncontrolled infection

          -  Other anatomic or co morbid conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, could
             limit the patient's ability to participate in the study or to comply with follow up
             requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the study results

          -  Enrolled in an investigational study evaluating another device or drug that would
             confound the results of this study
