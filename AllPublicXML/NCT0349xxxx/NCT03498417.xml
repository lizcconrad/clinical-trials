        1. Patients with Graves' disease, with or without GO. The presence of GO will be
             established in any patient who had at least one of the following eye features: a)
             exophthalmometry ≥17 mm in women and ≥19 mm in men, based on measurements conducted
             for the normal population; b) eyelid aperture ≥9 mm; c) clinical activity score ≥1/7;
             iv) presence of diplopia; v) presence of corneal alterations; vi) presence of
             GO-related alterations of the fundi; and vii) reduction in visual acuity that could be
             attributed to GO.
