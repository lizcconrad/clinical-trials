  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out if the study drugs Avelumab, Cetuximab, and
      Palbociclib will slow or stop your cancer from getting worse, and whether it causes side
      effects. The second purpose is to measure whether your cancer responds to the study drugs
      Avelumab, Cetuximab, and Palbociclib. The study drugs Avelumab, Cetuximab, and Palbociclib
      are types of drugs called a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are made to recognize,
      target, and bind to specific proteins on cells the building blocks making up your tissues.

      This is an open-label phase I trial with a 3+3 dose escalation design. All patients will
      receive avelumab, cetuximab, and palbociclib. This study will enroll patients with head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma not amenable to curative intent therapy.

      Treatment will be administered in 28 day cycles with a pre-defined dose escalation schedule.

    <description>Dose Escalation Schedule Dose Level Dose Palbociclib (PO daily, days 1-21 of 28 day cycle) Avelumab (IV on days 1 and 15 of 28 day cycle) Cetuximab (IV 400 mg/m2 x 1, then weekly) Level -1 50 mg 10 mg/kg 125 mg/m2 Level 0 (Starting) 75 mg 10 mg/kg 250 mg/m2 Level 1 100 mg 10 mg/kg 250 mg/m2 Level 2 125 mg 10 mg/kg 250 mg/m2
Each cycle of therapy will be 28 days. The principal investigator will evaluate each individual cohort within a dose level and make a recommendation regarding dose escalation or de-escalation. If there are 2 DLTs in Dose Level 0, Dose Level -1 will be enrolled. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose at which &lt;1 of 6 of patients in the cohort experiences a study treatment related DLT.
Additional dose cohorts may be added based on emerging data. Before applying the dose escalation rules, all patients in one cohort must have been evaluated for toxicity.</description>

    <description>Palbociclib will be administered in capsules of 125 mg, 100 mg, and 75 mg, depending on dosage. Patients will be instructed to take their assigned dose once daily with food for 21 days followed by 7 days off therapy. Patients will be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day.
Palbociclib will be supplied by Pfizer as an investigational drug.
If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken that day. The next prescribed dose should be taken at the usual time. Palbociclib capsules should be swallowed whole, and should not be chewed, crushed, or opened prior to swallowing.
Patients will be instructed to keep a diary of pill compliance and pill counts will be monitored by study personnel.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cetuximab</intervention_name>
    <description>Cetuximab is administered intravenously once weekly via infusion pump or syringe pump with infusion rate not to exceed 10 mg/min. Patients will be monitored during and after each cetuximab infusion with assessment of vital signs per standard procedure. Premedications will be used as per institutional protocols.
Commercial supply of cetuximab will be used.
Patients will be monitored for the presence of infusion-related reactions. Dose modification and toxicity management for infusion-related reactions are outlined in the dose modification section.
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. Appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis. The study site must have immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to admit subjects to an intensive care unit if necessary.</description>
