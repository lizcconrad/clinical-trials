    <textblock>
      Assessment of the effects of OMN54 (Aneustat) in a population of men with indolent prostate
      cancer who are otherwise healthy and free of significant co-morbidities and have chosen
      active surveillance for disease management. The investigators will assess how OMN54 affects
      PSA, overall tumor burden in addition to any changes in urinary flow. Other biomarkers will
      be tested to follow disease evolution.

          5. No previous treatment for prostate cancer (including hormonal therapy, radiation
             therapy, surgery, or chemotherapy).

          6. ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1.

          7. Patient has elected Active Surveillance as preferred management plan for prostate
             cancer.

          8. Written informed consent obtained prior to any patient participation.

          9. Participant is accessible and compliant for follow-up.

         10. Prostate biopsy requirements:

               1. If diagnosis was within one year of baseline visit, participant must have at
                  least one biopsy with at least 10 cores.

               2. If diagnosis was more than 1 year prior to baseline visit, participant must have
                  a minimum of 2 biopsies, one of which must be within 2 years prior to baseline
                  visit.

         11. Voiding requirements: IPSS score of at least 15 and Qmax &lt; 15 cc/s.

         12. Adequate hematopoietic function as demonstrated by:

               -  hemoglobin of ≥ 9.0 g/dL without need for sustained blood transfusions
