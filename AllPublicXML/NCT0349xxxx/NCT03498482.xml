  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children either living in the streets of Bujumbara or that are similarly affected by extreme
      poverty or violence are regularly exposed to traumatic events. Additionally, they often find
      themselves in situations where engaging in violent behavior appears to be useful or even
      necessary for survival. The Narrative Exposure Therapy for violent offenders (FORNET) aims to
      reduce both PTSD symptoms and aggressive behavior. It helps the children to anchor fearful
      experiences and potential positive emotions linked to violent behaviour in the past.
      Additionally, visions for the future are developed in order to enable reintegration into the
      family.

      The investigators want to provide evidence, that FORNET effectively reduces PTSD symptoms and
      ongoing aggressive behavior which in change facilitates reintegration into society.

    <description>During FORNET, the client, with the assistance of the therapist, constructs a chronological narrative of his or her entire life with a focus on exposure to traumatic stress and committed violence. Empathic understanding, active listening, congruency and unconditional positive regard are key components of the therapist's behavior. The therapist asks in detail for the client's emotions, cognitions, physiological reactions, and sensory informations during traumatic and aggressive events to link them to an autobiographical context, namely time and place. In total the individuals receive 8 sessions of FORNET, every session lasting between 1.5 and 2 hours depending on the needs of the participant.</description>
