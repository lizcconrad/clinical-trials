  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect data about how well U-100 Regular Human Insulin can be
      used in the V-Go Insulin Delivery Device compared to U-100 Rapid Acting Insulin in the V-Go
      Insulin Delivery Device. The data collected will be used to see how much subjects' blood
      sugar levels change over time after they switch from using U-100 Rapid Acting Insulin to
      U-100 Regular Human Insulin within their V-Go Insulin Delivery Device.

          3. Screening visit A1C ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 12.5%

          4. Prescribed a stable (less than 20% change in the past 30 days) of rapid acting U-100
             insulin delivered via V-Go insulin delivery device

          5. Ability to read and understand English

          6. Willing to complete all study related activities

          7. Willing and able to understand and sign a written ICF indicating that they agree to
             participate and have been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study

          8. Must be willing to take and record 7 glucose measurements per time period (pre-morning
             meal (fasting), pre-midday meal, pre-evening meal, and 2-hours after the start of the
             morning, midday, and evening meals, and at bedtime) three times throughout the study
             (prior to Visit 2, 3, and 4).

          9. Completed a 7-point glucose profile prior to Visit 2

         10. Able (by insurance or financial means) to cover the initial investment and ongoing
             cost of the V-Go insulin delivery device, insulin (current rapid acting insulin or
             potential new regular human insulin), personal glucometer and supplies for the length
             of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject with confirmed Type 1 diabetes

          2. More than 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia (defined as requiring third party
             assistance) within 3 months of study entry

          3. History of hypoglycemia unawareness

          4. Require supplemental insulin in addition to V-Go therapy

          5. Woman of child-bearing potential who has a positive pregnancy test at screening or

         10. Current use of U-500 RHI in V-Go within 90 days of screening

         11. Currently on dialysis

         12. Medical or other problems which in the opinion of the investigator will render study
             participation unsafe.
