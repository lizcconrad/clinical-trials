  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is reaching epidemic proportions in the aging U.S. and European
      populations, but the mechanisms of increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation are still
      unknown. In this study, we look to further examine genetic and medical co-morbidity influence
      of atrial fibrillation duration and response to medications. In Specific Aim 1, we propose
      the creation of a Veterans Affairs AF Biorepository (VAAFBio), which is a resource that will
      collect and store clinical, demographic, blood and DNA samples from patients with atrial
      fibrillation to aide this study and future studies of this type in the VA population. In
      Specific Aim 2, examine common genetic polymorphisms in veteran patients with atrial
      fibrillation and examine gene-environment interactions with risk factors for atrial
      fibrillation.

      Patients will be identified through the VA inpatient and outpatient clinic, and will be
      approached for inclusion in the study. The target enrollment for the research and
      biorepository is 600 participants. A detailed family history, medical background, study
      questionnaires and a blood sample will then be obtained by the principal investigator or a
      research coordinator, following written informed consent under a protocol approved by the
      Jesse Brown VA Institutional Review Board. Once enough samples are collected, coded DNA
      samples will be sent out to analyze for linkage to known/candidate loci for AF.
