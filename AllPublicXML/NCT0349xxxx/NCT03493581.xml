  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PIONeeR study is a prospective, multicenter study without administration of an
      investigational product.

      The promotion and funding will be done by the Assistance Publique Hôpitaux de Marseille
      (APHM), the coordination by AMU. There will be 3 principal investigational clinical centres
      in France:

        -  Centre d'Essais Précoces en Cancérologie de Marseille (CEPCM)-Unité de Phase I Oncologie
           labélisée CLIP² in APHM, Marseille, supervised by Prof. F. Barlesi

        -  Medical Oncology Department of Centre Léon Bérard, Lyon, supervised by Prof. M. Pérol

        -  Unité d'Oncologie Thoracique, CHU Larrey /Oncopôle, Toulouse, supervised by Prof. J.
           Mazières.

      Some secondary centres, nearby the three principal mentioned above, will be associated to
      ensure recruitment of patients, in accordance to provisional planning.

        -  The primary objective is to validate the existence and distribution of the hypothetical
           immune profile (within blood and tumoral tissue) explaining primary or adaptive
           resistance to standard PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy, in NSCLC patients.

        -  The secondary objectives are to better characterize :

             -  PK/PD relationships,

             -  inter-patient PK variability,

             -  If systemic exposure levels could be predictive of efficacy of PD-1 ICI, in NSCLC
                patients.

        -  Some exploratory objectives are :

             -  to assess a predictive value of a panel of endothelial biomarkers, in NSCLC
                patients.

             -  to compare predictive immune &amp; endothelial biomarker profiles with those of
                sensitive tumors.

             -  to better understand which profiles track significantly with progression following
                PD-1 ICI administration, in order to improve advanced NSCLC patients'
                stratification, for future clinical trials.

      Visits will match with usual schedule of patient's appointments with their referent
      oncologist or for injections of ICIs, when blood sampling or biopsies will be done. Feces
      will be collected by patients themselves, at home (optional).

      The same day of registration for a standard 2nd or 3rd line PD-(L) 1 ICIs monotherapy (to
      date, Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab), 450 advanced NSCLC patients will undergo a
      screening visit (Vs). If they are eligible, after signing an informed written consent, they
      will be blood-sampled specifically for the study:

        -  after 3 or 4 weeks (V1-1st assessment of PK/PD, after the 2d course),

        -  after 6 weeks (V2),

        -  after 8 or 9 weeks (V3-2nd assessment of PK/PD, after the last course),

        -  and after 12 weeks of treatment (V4). Patients will also be re-biopsied (primitive tumor
           or metastasis) specifically for the study, at V2. Referent patients'oncologist will opt
           for the simplest technical approach with a minimal risk exposure for patients. Standard
           procedures will be implemented for subsequent patient's monitoring.

      Patients will also provide remaining samples from pre-treatment surgical resections/biopsies
      (primitive tumor or metastasis).

      If they are amenable to collect feces samples at home, an auto collection kit will be
      supplied to them, before the first injection (Vs) and after the 2nd (V2 - 6 weeks or V3- 8
      weeks), depending on courses timelines.

      Following the last study visit (V4), patients will enter to the follow up period (a maximum 2
      years period). They will be followed by their usual referent oncologist, no additional visit
      is required. Subsequent response to the anti-PD (L) 1 treatment, anti-cancer therapy,
      survival will be collected via patient medical records and analysed for current study.
