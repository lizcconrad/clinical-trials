  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modified corneal epithelial autograft (EA) uses a smaller graft of the donor eye, which
      decreases iatrogenic injury greatly. The purpose of this study is to explore whether modified
      corneal EA combined with allogeneic middle lamellar keratoplasty (AMLK) is more effective
      than limbal autograft (LA) with AMLK for ocular surface reconstruction in patients with
      severe corneal burn.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Unilateral severe corneal burn with more than half limbal stem cells deficiency
             (LSCD). The history of the disease is at least 12 months at the time of screening
             visit.

          2. Presence of superficial neo-vascularization affecting at least 2 cornea quadrants and
             involving central cornea.

          3. Informed consent signed by a patient or legal guardian, or having the ability to
             comply with study assessments for the full duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. LSCD of mild degree, with less than 2 quadrants of neo-vessel invasion and without

             corneal lamellar opacity.

          5. High myopia with a spherical equivalent of -15.0 D or less.

          6. Corneal or ocular surface infection within 30 days prior to study entry.

          7. Ocular surface malignancy.

          8. Uncontrolled diabetes with most recent HgA1c greater than 8.5%.

             accepting anticoagulant therapy; An international normalized ratio greater than 3 in
             patients accepting anticoagulant therapy.

         14. Pregnancy (positive test) or lactation.

         15. Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or clinical trial.

         16. Severe cicatricial eye disease; Conjunctival scarring with fornix shortening.

         17. Ocular comorbidities that affect the prognosis of transplantation, such as advanced
             glaucoma or retinal diseases.

         18. Severe dry eye disease as determined by Schirmer's test &lt; 2mm at least in one eye.

         19. Any medical or social condition that in the judgment of the investigator would
             interfere with or serve as a contraindication to adherence to the study protocol or
             ability to give informed consent.
