  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind, comparator therapy, parallel
      group study for symptomatic patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. The aim is to
      demonstrate superior efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as compared to hyaluronic acid
      (HA) in treating knee osteoarthritis. This aim will be objectively measured by endpoint
      consisting of changes in cartilage thickness from baseline in the MRI. The Western Ontario
      and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), total score at 12 months, will
      measure changes in pain and function from baseline. Approximately 100 subjects will be
      treated at NorthShore University HealthSystem as part of this study. This study has the
      potential to improve outcomes in a very common chronic degenerative disease, osteoarthritis,
      which can have a significant effect on individuals' quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, comparative clinical trial with an
      allocation ratio of 1:1. The primary endpoint is the MRI-based cartilage thickness
      measurement. The secondary endpoint is the WOMAC total score. There are 2 arms: PRP treatment
      and HA treatment. Due to the treatment procedure, the study will not be blinded to either the
      subject or PI. However, the radiologist that scores the cartilage thickness will be blinded
      with regard to clinical characteristics and treatment of subjects.

      The subjects are randomized with 1:1 block randomization with a block size of 4 patients. The
      patient population is symptomatic patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis K-L grade 2 or
      3. The sample size is 100 total subjects (50 in each arm). The duration is approximately 13
      months, final data accumulated at month 12 after treatment at single site - NorthShore.

      All potential subjects will complete screening blood work which will consist of a complete
      blood count to include platelets and differential (CBC with Diff), c-reactive protein (CRP),
      and a sed rate (ESR).

      Patients randomized into the PRP group will also have at the time of the procedure whole
      blood and PRP analyzed for PLT, WBC, and RBC per injection, and a CBC with leukocyte
      differential will be performed on the PRP to evaluate the fold increase in platelet
      concentrations. The amount of blood taken for the procedure will be approximately 15 ml (3-4
      teaspoons). Four to six milliliters are injected back into the knee as plasma rich platelets.

      Patients randomized to the HA group will not undergo any laboratory testing.

      Data will be summarized as mean±sd for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages
      for categorical variables. For the primary analysis, repeated measures ANOVA will be
      performed on both primary and secondary endpoints using baseline and 12 months data to
      examine the differences in changes between PRP and HA groups. In addition, linear mixed
      models will be used to analyze KOOS scores (baseline, 1m, 3m, 6m, and 12m) and MRI data
      (baseline, 6m, 12m) using all available data collected from all time points. All analysis
      will be performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC). A p value &lt;0.05 will be considered
      statistically significant.

    <description>PRP is injected using 22 gauge needles through the classic approach (lateral midpatellar) in a sterile setting. The PRP is obtained from a maximum 16 cc sample of the patients' blood drawn at the time of treatment. Using sterile technique, the venous blood is transferred to a centrifuge and prepared by the centrifugation process for 5 minutes. 4-7 mL of PRP is transferred from the large outer syringe into the small inner syringe and injected within 30 minutes of being spun to negate the need of anticoagulants. The procedure will take approximately 20-30 minutes.</description>
