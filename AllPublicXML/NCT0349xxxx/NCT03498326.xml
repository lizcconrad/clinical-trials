  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of pancreatic cancer is extremely poor, even in those patients who had
      underwent surgery, the 5-year survival is still less than 10%. Current guidelines recommend
      Gemcitabine monotherapy for R0 resection of pancreatic cancer. Inflammation plays an critical
      role in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer. Here we intend to assess the
      synergistic effect of using celecoxib in combination with gemcitabine on the treatment of R0
      resection of pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>

      We choose those patients who had underwent the R0 resection of pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma patients, and divided them into two groups randomly, one group patients were
      given gemcitabine only according the current guidelines, while the other group patients were
      given gemcitabine combined with the anti-inflammation agent Celecoxib. The disease free
      survivals, drugs related side effects, overall survivals and other endpoints events were
      recorded and analyzed, to assess the celecoxib could or couldn't synergist the gemcitabine
      anti tumor effect on R0 resection pancreatic cancer patients.
