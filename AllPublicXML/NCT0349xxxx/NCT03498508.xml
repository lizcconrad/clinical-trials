  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theoretical knowledge of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the foundation of being able
      to perform CPR in a cardiac arrest situation. The knowledge and skills received in training
      is easily lost and after one year the level is equal to pretraining. International studies
      regarding knowledge of CPR among healthcare professionals, mostly nurses, show poor results.
      The knowledge of CPR among Swedish healthcare professionals is poorly studied.

      The aim of this study was to describe the knowledge of CPR and self-perceived skills of
      performing CPR among healthcare professionals working in four hospitals in Sweden.

      A questionnaire will be handed out containing a knowledge test of nine questions at a basic
      level. The questionnaire also contains Likert-scales that measures four perveived CPR-skills
      of the respondents (the ability to take leadership, give compressions, to ventilate and to
      defibrillate).

    <description>Four perceived CPR-skills among 3044 respondents will be measured on a Liker scale of 1-7. The skills are the ability to take leadership, give chest compressions, to ventilate and to defibrillate. The skills will be correlated to independent variables such as profession, years in profession, workplace and time since last CPR-training.</description>
