    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of Lucentis (ranibizumab) in patients with well
      controlled compared to those with poorly controlled diabetes.

      The primary endpoint for the study will be the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA) from baseline to Month 12.

      Two groups of patients, based on HbA1c levels will be entered into the trial -

        1. patients with a recent HbA1c level &lt; 7.5 % (the 'well controlled' subgroup) and

        2. patients with a recent HbA1c level ≥ 10.0% (the 'poorly controlled' subgroup).

      Ranibizumab treatment will be administered over the 12-month period, initial 3 monthly
      injections, followed by 'as needed' protocol using the following principles:

      Monthly ranibizumab injections would be suspended when:

        -  No further BCVA improvement from treatment at the last 2 consecutive follow up visits OR

        -  BCVA letter score &gt;84 (6/6) at the last 2 consecutive follow up visits

      Monthly ranibizumab injections would be reinitiated when:

      • Decrease in BCVA due to DME progression in the opinion of the investigator Laser treatment
      could also be administered from 3 months after study initiation, according to the
      investigators decision, in accordance with ETDRS guidelines, and at intervals of at least 3
      months from the last treatment.

      Visit schedule: Screening visit then monthly visits for 12 visits (total of 13 visits)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients with diabetes &gt; 21 years of age who have signed an informed
             consent

          -  Patients with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (according to ADA or WHO
             guidelines) with HbA1c levels either &lt; 7.5% or ≥ 10.0% at screening (visit 1) as
             measured within the last 3 months.

          -  Patients with visual impairment due to either focal or diffuse DME in at least one eye
             who are eligible for laser treatment in the opinion of the investigator. The study eye
             must fulfill the following criteria at Visit 1 (if both eyes are eligible, the study
             eye will be selected by the investigator, based on potential for improvement): i) BCVA
             score between 73 and 39 letters, inclusively, using LogMAR visual acuity testing
             charts at 4 metres (or at the equivalent appropriate testing distance for the chart
             size) (approximate Snellen equivalent between 6/12 (20/40) and 6/48 (20/160); ii) the
             decrease in vision is due to DME but not due to other causes, in the opinion of the
             investigator
