  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stool and blood samples from patients with a non-typhoid Salmonella infection will be
      collected during an observation period of six months and analyzed for changes in the
      microbiota diversity and composition, mutation rates in the Salmonella strains and the
      specific immune response evoked by the infection. Findings are compared to healthy
      individuals and individuals with acute, infectious diarrhea caused by other microorganisms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection processes of a non-typhoid Salmonella infection in humans are not well understood
      and so far, only little research has been conducted in this area. Findings from preclinical
      studies, using mouse models, attributed a fundamental role in infection control to the gut
      microbiota and the host immune system (antibody response). In mouse models a non-typhoid
      Salmonella infection provokes a pronounced antibody response and salmonella-inflicted gut
      inflammation alters the microbiota diversity and composition in the gut lumen. To date there
      is only scarce evidence on similar effects in humans.

      During the study, longitudinal stool and blood samples will be collected from patients with a
      non-typhoid Salmonella infection at different study time points (2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6
      months after positive Salmonella stool culture) and analyzed for changes in the microbiota,
      mutation rates in the Salmonella strains and the specific immune response evoked by the
      infection (e.g. anti-bodies). At each study time point clinical information will be
      investigated with a questionnaire to assess current symptoms, medication etc. Findings will
      be compared to healthy individuals and patients with acute, infectious diarrhea caused by
      other microorganisms than non-typhoid Salmonella.
