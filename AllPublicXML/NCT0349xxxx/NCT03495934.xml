    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to generate data for the investigation of absorption,
      distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME) processes of pracinostat in humans, as well
      as generating samples for metabolite profiling and structural identification. The mass
      balance recovery of pracinostat following administration of [14C]-pracinostat will be
      assessed, as well as metabolite profiling and identification of pracinostat in healthy male
      subjects. In addition, this study will provide further PK and safety data in healthy
      subjects.
