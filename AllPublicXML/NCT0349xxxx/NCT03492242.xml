    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) might have high grade immune-related adverse events
      (irAEs) from rhumatologic, endocrinologic, cardiac or other system origin. This study
      investigates reports of drug induced irAEs with treatment including anti-PD1, Anti-PDL-1, and
      Anti-CTLA4 classes using the World Health Organization (WHO) database VigiBase and the french
      database Base Nationale de PharmacoVigilance (BNPV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically improved clinical outcomes in multiple
      cancer types and are increasingly being tested in earlier disease settings and used in
      combination. However, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) can occur. Here the investigators
      use VigiBase (http://www.vigiaccess.org/), the World Health Organization (WHO) database of
      individual safety case reports, and in the Base Nationale de PharmacoVigilance (BNPV) which
      is the french pharmacovigilance database, to identify cases of adverse drug reaction
      including arthiritis, auto-immune induced diseases, cardiac diseases, endocrinologic
      diseases, following treatment with ICIs.
