    <textblock>
      The Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block is the current standard of care for patients
      undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgeries with the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
      Protocol. The Quadratus Lumborum (QL) is another established abdominal fascial plane block
      that is comparable in procedure and risks and may potentially be more beneficial. The study
      compares the two blocks in hopes of establishing a new standard of care for patients
      undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgeries with the ERAS protocol.

      The Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) block is the current standard of care for patients
      undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgeries with the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
      Protocol. The Quadratus Lumborum (QL) is another established abdominal fascial plane block
      that is comparable in procedure and risks and may potentially be more beneficial. The study
      compares the two blocks in hopes of establishing a new standard of care for patients
      undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgeries with the ERAS protocol.

        -  Compare QL and TAP blocks cephalad spread via mapping in the Postoperative Acute Care
           Unit (PACU) within 6 hours after block placement.

        -  Compare efficacy of blocks via Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores in PACU and
           postoperative day (POD) 1.

        -  Compare amount of opioid pain medications consumed within 24 hours after block.
           Hypothesis

        -  The QL block will prove superior to the TAP block in both cephalad spread and pain
           control for abdominal surgery patients and decrease the amount of opioid pain
           medications required while in effect up to 24 hours after surgery.

        -  The quadratus lumborum will have increased cephalad spread. We predict mapping will show
           greater (2 or more dermatomal levels) or equal analgesic coverage by the QL block when
           compared to the TAP block.

    <intervention_model_description>The expected cephalad dermatomal distribution of the TAP block is T10. A positive outcome is a QL block with patient anesthesia at 2 or more dermatomes higher than the TAP block. The investigators will assume that there is a 30% difference between the two blocks, which leads to between 24 and 33 patients in each arm (ideally aiming for 30 patients in each group).
The investigators have included other sample sizes should they find that there is a higher or lower percentage difference between the QL and TAP blocks.
Outcome: A positive block is considered anesthesia at T8 or above and a negative block is considered analgesia below T8</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The primary outcome of interest is the proportion of subjects reporting a positive block. This is determined by dermatomal mapping in cephalad direction in PACU within 6 hours of TAP or QL placement. A positive outcome is one where the QL block measures 2 or more dermatomal levels higher than the TAP block</description>
