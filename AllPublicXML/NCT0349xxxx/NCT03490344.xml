    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of short course Daratumumab in combination
      with lenalidomide and to find out what effects, if any, short course Daratumumab in
      combination with lenalidomide has on people and their risk of multiple myeloma. The study is
      also designed to test the amount of remaining myeloma cells in your body after treatment with
      daratumumab which is known as minimal residual disease (MRD).
