  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to enroll 30 evaluable patients with (1) a histological diagnosis of advanced
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who have demonstrated at least stable disease following ≥16
      weeks of treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and (2) who have signed consent to
      participate in a clinical trial that contains PARP inhibitor therapy and are anticipated to
      receive this treatment or (3) will receive PARP inhibitor therapy as part of their clinical
      care.

      A pre-treatment 18F-FluorThanatrace ([18F]FTT) positron emission tomography/computed
      tomography (PET/CT) scan will be done prior to the start of treatment with a PARP inhibitor.

      PET/CT imaging will be used to evaluate PARP-1 expression in sites of pancreatic cancer using
      the investigational radiotracer [18F]FTT. This is an observational study in that [18F]FTT
      PET/CT will not be used to direct treatment decisions. While patients and referring
      physicians will not be blinded to the [18F]FTT PET/CT results, treatment decisions will be
      made by the treating physicians based upon clinical criteria.

      Patients will undergo approximately 60 minutes of dynamic scanning starting at the time of
      injection of [18F]FTT. This procedure will be followed by a skull base to mid-thigh scan,
      starting at approximately 60 minutes post injection. PET/CT imaging sessions will include an
      injection of approximately 10 mCi (approximate range for most studies is anticipated to be
      8-12 mCi) of [18F]FTT. Data will be collected to evaluate uptake of [18F]FTT in sites of
      pancreatic cancer, which will be compared with PARP-1 expression in tissue, when available.

      All 30 evaluable patients are expected to start PARP inhibitor therapy following the [18F]FTT
      PET/CT scan. It is expected that due to patient preference and time considerations,
      approximately 24 patients (80%) will also undergo a second (optional) scan that will be
      performed approximately 3 weeks (± 1 week) after therapy has started. The second scan is
      obtained to evaluate whether the PARP inhibitor therapy decreases [18F]FTT uptake, which
      would suggest PARP blocking by the therapy.

          -  Histologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma. .

          -  Deemed to have achieved stability following ≥16 weeks of platinum based therapy, in
             the opinion of an investigator

          -  Considered a candidate for PARP inhibitor therapy, with or without additional agents,
             either on a clinical trial or as part of clinical care.

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast feeding at the time of screening will not be
             eligible for this study; a urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of
             child-bearing potential at screening.

             physician

          -  Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the
             study.
