  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension is a common complication in pregnant women after spinal anesthesia and related
      with the dose of local anesthetic. Injecting small dose local anesthetic into subarachnoid
      space can decrease the incidence of hypotension, but increase the risk of incomplete
      analgesia and muscle relaxation. The investigators hypothesize there is an optimal dose of
      bupivacaine and ropivacaine for subarachnoid injection in pregnant women, which can cause
      enough anesthesia and obviously decrease the incidence of hypotension without prophylactical
      prehydration and vasopressors. To verify this hypothesis, full-term pregnant women who were
      scheduled for elective cesarean section were recruited.Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia
      was performed for pregnant women after written informed consents. The dose of bupivacaine or
      ropivacaine is small and depends on height of pregnant women. The blood pressure, heart rate,
      respiratory rate, SpO2 and fetal heart rate were recorded and the blood flow volume of
      uterine artery was monitored The sensory and motor block were evaluated. After delivery,
      umbilical blood samples were taken for blood gas analysis. APGAR scores and neurological
      behavior of infant were evaluated and recorded. In the intraoperative period, side-effects
      and requirement for sedation, epidural injection or general anesthesia were noted. The
      quality of anaesthesia (judged by the anaesthetist), the quality of muscle relaxation (judged
      by the surgeon) and the degree of intraoperative comfort (judged by the patient) were
      recorded as excellent, good, fair or poor.

      1. General: This was a single-centre randomized controlled trial performed at ShenZhen
           People's Hospital of Jinan University. Study protocol was approval was by the Ethics
           Committee of ShenZhen People's Hospital of Jinan University, ShenZhen, China (Permit No.
           SZY-00251, Chairperson Prof. Xiaofang Yu) on 8 February 2017. Pregnant women who were
           scheduled for cesarean section were recruited. Written informed consents were obtained
           from all patients. Women with cardiovascular disease, fetal abnormalities, placental
           abruption, placenta previa, placental abnormalities, sidewall placenta, abnormal fetal
           heart rate and spinal anesthesia contraindications were excluded from the study.

        2. Sample Size Calculation: When systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or 70% of baseline value
           was defined as hypotension, in the study by Langesaeter et al in Anesthesiology
           magazine, the incidence of hypotension was 20% with prophylactic phenylephrine, and the
           preliminary results of the investigators showed that the incidence of hypotension was
           10%. Sample size for a non-inferiority test (margin Δ=0.03) was estimated using the
           normal approximation to the binomial distribution. Each group needed ninety-three
           subjects.

        3. Anesthesia: Women were randomly divided into three groups, Bupivacaine group,
           Ropivacaine group and Control group. After entering the operation room, patients were
           placed supine with left lateral tilt and blood pressure was measured three times at
           1-min intervals. The arithmetic average of the three measured values was regarded as the
           basal pressure of pregnant women. Next, electrocardiogram and pulse oximetry were also
           monitored. Supplementary oxygen was given through a facemask. Venipuncture was performed
           in the forearm vein. In Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine group, 500 ml Ringer's lactate was
           slow given for subjects before anesthesia without prehydration. In Control group, 1000
           ml hydroxyethylstarch (6%) was first infused for subjects in the ward, after that 500 ml
           Ringer's lactate was slow given for subjects before anesthesia.

           Then, with the subjects in left lateral position, combined spinal-epidural anesthesia
           was performed as follows: skin was infiltrated by lidocaine at the L3-4 or L4-5
           interspace; epidural puncture needle was slowly perpendicularly advanced until the tip
           passed through the ligamentum flavum and reached to epidural space, which was verified
           with the loss-of-resistance; then intrathecal injection was carried out by spinal needle
           of 25G, and the epidural catheter was inserted 4-6 cm. Subjects were then immediately
           recovered in supine with left lateral tilt. In Bupivacaine group, 0.5 % bupivacaine
           (0.75% bupivacaine (2 ml) + cerebrospinal fluid (1 ml)) was injection. The dose of
           bupivacaine depended on height of subjects (1.7 ml for 173~174cm, 1.65 ml for 170~172cm,
           1.6 ml for 168~169cm, 1.55 ml for 165~167cm, 1.5 ml for 163~164cm, 1.45 ml for
           160~162cm, 1.4 ml for 158~159cm, 1.35 ml for 155~157cm, 1.3 ml for 153~154cm, 1.25 ml
           for 150~152cm, 1.2 ml for 148~149cm)，1.15 ml for 145~147cm). In Ropivacaine group, 0.5 %
           ropivacaine (1% ropivacaine (1.5 ml) + cerebrospinal fluid (1.5 ml)) was injection. The
           dose of ropivacaine depended on height of subjects (2.300 ml for 173~174cm, 2.225 ml for
           170~172cm, 2.15 0ml for 168~169cm, 2.075 ml for 165~167cm, 2.000 ml for 163~164cm, 1.925
           ml for 160~162cm, 1.850 ml for 158~159cm, 1.775 ml for 155~157cm, 1.700 ml for
           153~154cm, 1.625 ml for 150~152cm, 1.55 0ml for 148~149cm, 1.475 ml for 145~147cm). In
           Control group, 2ml bupivacaine (0.75% bupivacaine (2 ml) + cerebrospinal fluid (1 ml))
           was injection for all subjects. Immediately after intrathecal injection, in control
           group, phenylephrine was introduced by continuous infusion pumps programmed for an
           infusion rate of 0.25 ug.kg-1.min-1 to maintain systolic blood pressure at ≥ 90 mmHg or
           70% -100 % of baseline value. In Bupivacaine and Ropivacaine group, no prophylactic
           phenylephrine was introduced For all subjects, when systolic blood pressure was less
           than 90 mmHg or 70% of baseline value. 100 ug phenylephrine was given and repeated every
           1 min until the systolic blood pressure returned to normal. When heart rate was less
           than 60 beat/min. 0.5-1mg atropine was given to maintain normal heart rate. Nausea and
           vomiting were treated with metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. Sensory block level after
           intrathecal injection was assessed with a 20G hypodermic needle (no sensation to
           pinprick). When the maximum sensory block height was lower than T8, epidural injection
           of 2% lidocaine (3ml/5min, total volume was less than 15 ml) was given or anesthetic
           technique was changed into general anesthesia.

        4. Data acquisition: After intrathecal injection, the blood pressure, heart rate,
           respiratory rate, SpO2 and fetal heart rate were recorded every 1 min until fetal
           delivery and then were recorded every 3 min until the end of surgery. The blood flow
           volume of uterine artery was monitored by ultrasound.

           The level of sensory block, defined as the loss of pin-prick sensation (20G hypodermic
           needle) at midclavicular level, was measured every 1 min until it reached the T8
           dermatome level and then every 10 min during surgery. The following variables were
           recorded: time to initial onset of analgesia, time for sensory block to reach the T8
           dermatome level, time for sensory block to reach maximum dermatome level, time to
           two-segment regression of analgesic level, and regression of analgesic level to the S2
           dermatome. Anesthesia was considered adequate for surgery if pain sensation was lost at
           the T8 level.

           Motor block was assessed every 1 min using the Bromage scale (0 = no motor block, 3 =
           complete motor block of lower limbs) until complete motor block and then every 30 min
           until the return of normal motor function. The times to complete motor block and
           complete recovery were recorded. The motor block score when the sensory block level
           reached T8 was also recorded.

           The time from anesthesia initiation to delivery, time from skin incision to delivery and
           time from uterus incision to delivery were recorded. The total dose of phenylephrine and
           total volume of fluid before delivery were recorded. After delivery, umbilical blood
           samples were taken for blood gas analysis. APGAR scores at 1 and 5 min were evaluated
           and recorded. In the intraoperative period, side-effects and requirement for sedation,
           epidural injection or general anesthesia were noted.

           Neurologic assessment (muscle force, muscle tone, sucking reflex, rooting reflex, moro
           reflex and grasp reflex) of the infant was carried out at 2h,4h,8h, 1d,2d,3d,4d and 7d
           after delivery. The quality of anaesthesia (judged by the anaesthetist), the quality of
           muscle relaxation (judged by the surgeon) and the degree of intraoperative comfort
           (judged by the patient) were recorded as excellent, good, fair or poor.

        5. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software
           package. All metering data were recorded as mean ± standard deviation and
           Independent-Samples T test or One-way ANOVA was used to compare the metering data.
           Chi-square test was used to compare the enumeration data. p&lt;0.05 indicates that the
           differences have statistical significance.
