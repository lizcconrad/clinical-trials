  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients are able to participate in a so
      called prehabilitation program (prior to the beginning of cancer treatment) which includes
      (1) a supervised and home-based exercise program plus one educational session or (2) just
      home-based exercise plus one educational session or (3) just one educational session.

      Breast cancer surgery may have potential for several side effects, including functional (e.g.
      flexibility in the affected arm, lymphedema [swelling that generally occurs in the arms or
      legs that occurs as a result of the removal of or damage to lymph nodes as a part of cancer
      treatment], shoulder pain) and psychosocial (e.g. reduced quality of life, increased fatigue)
      aspects.

      Evidence shows that exercise is considered to be an effective treatment approach in breast
      cancer patients during and after treatment with regard to the above mentioned side-effects.
      Also, prehabilitative exercise in colon and lung cancer patients was shown as feasible and
      effective. However, no experience exits with regard to prehabilitation exercise in breast
      cancer patients.
