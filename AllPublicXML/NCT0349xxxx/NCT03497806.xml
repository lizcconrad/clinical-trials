  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension of CDI-001 (subsequently referred to as PRISM 3), and is
      evaluating the safety and efficacy in reducing recurrence of CDI in adults who had a CDI
      recurrence within 8 weeks of receiving CP101 or placebo in PRISM 3. Subjects who are
      experiencing recurrent CDI will undergo screening procedures. Subjects who meet eligibility
      criteria will be eligible to be enrolled in the extension study and administered CP101.

      Approximately 70 subjects will receive CP101. The treatment duration will be 1 day. Subjects
      will be monitored for recurrence of CDI, safety, and tolerability for 24 weeks following
      receipt of CP101. The primary efficacy and safety endpoints will be evaluated at 8 weeks post
      treatment, and all subjects will continue to be followed for an additional 16 weeks for
      safety and recurrence of CDI.
