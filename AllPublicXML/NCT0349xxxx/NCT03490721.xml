  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This crossover design experimental study aims to compare the physiological stability of
      premature newborns during and after a cluster of care compared to a period when they receive
      standard non clustered care at the neonatal unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cluster care will take place at the time of feeding of the premature infants. The
      intervention will start with a calm period of 20 minutes before the start of care (no
      manipulations will be allowed), the baby will then received the cluster care for 20 minutes
      and a quiet period of 30 minutes will follow after the cluster care.

    <time_frame>The physiological stability will be measured for 70 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The physiological stability will be measured with the SCRIP score. The Stability of the cardiorespiratory system in premature infants is a scale, in which a score of 0 means major physiological instability and a score of 6 means a physiological stability. For every single parameter there's three grades from severe instability (0 points) to minor instability (1 point) to perfect stability (2 points).</description>
