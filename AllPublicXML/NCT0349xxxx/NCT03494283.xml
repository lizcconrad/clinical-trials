  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CrossFit is a recent sport that has been democratized since the beginning of the 2000's in
      France. The 3 major studies of CrossFit injuries were conducted in the United States in 2014,
      Brazil in 2016 and the United States in 2017. They show a discrepancy in terms of injuries
      average, from 19.4% to 31% in relation to an upsurge in the number of CrossFit practitioners,
      the specific training or not of the coaches framing this activity, the practice or not in
      competition. The main locations of these wounds are highlighted at the shoulders, lumbar
      region and knees. In France, to date, no epidemiological studies have been conducted on this
      subject.

      Hypothesis: High incidence of injuries related to a lack of framing, or bad practice and
      ignorance of CrossFit practitioners.

      Objectives : Estimate the injuries incident due to the CrossFit practice over a 8-month
      period in an adult population who practice in clubs .

      Research, among the anthropometric, sociodemographic, environmental, and the nature and
      frequency of practice and training sessions, those which are associated with the occurrence
      of injury in this cohort.
