  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a commonly reported comorbidity for adolescents with psychiatric conditions. It
      is well-known that insomnia can exacerbate the concurrent psychiatric symptom load. Results
      from a pilot study shows that outpatients of Children and Youth Psychiatry can improve their
      sleep and depressive symptoms by receiving internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for
      insomnia (iCBT). This study is designed to evaluate implementation of the treatment in
      routine care.The study will evaluate aspects of the implementation process such as
      organizational attitudes towards iCBT before implementation, level of knowledge about the
      condition and intervention among health-care providers before and after the implementation,
      and clinical outcomes in routine care.

    <description>Change in severity of insomnia is assessed by measuring ISI at several measurement points before, during and after treatment. The score ranges from 0-28, higher values indicate worse symptoms of insomnia.</description>

    <description>Change in depressive symptoms is assessed by measuring MADRS-S at several measurement points before, during and after treatment. The score ranges from 0-35, higher values indicate worse symptoms of depression.</description>

    <description>Change in clinician-rated level of functioning is assessed by measuring C-GAS at several measurement points before, during and after treatment. The score ranges from 0-100, higher values indicate better functioning.</description>
