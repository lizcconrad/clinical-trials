  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this longitudinal cohort study including young to middle aged people with longstanding hip
      and groin pain (LHGP) referred to tertiary care, we will collect data of patient reported
      symptoms, function and quality of life three and five years after the initial contact with
      orthopedic surgeon.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      87 physically active patients (18-55 years) with (LHGP) who were enrolled in a
      cross-sectional study (Diagnosis and functional limitations in the young to middle-aged
      physically active population with long-standing hip/groin pain: A cross-sectional study)
      during the period October 2014 to January 2017 will be recruited to this longitudinal cohort
      study.

      A research coordinator will contact the patients and provide them with written and oral
      information about the study. Patients who accept to participate will electronically complete
      the following questionnaires. The same questionnaires were included at baseline, i.e., in the
      cross-sectional study.

        -  Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS)

        -  HSAS - Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS)

        -  Patient Specific Functional Scale

        -  Medical Outcomes Study short form 36 (SF-36)

        -  K-10 questionnaire

        -  Self-Presentation in Exercise Questionnaire (SPEQ)

        -  Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) Additional questions about
           treatment, medication, patient satisfaction and perceived change in hip function will be
           included.

      For descriptive purposes, the mean difference (95% CI), or median (quartiles), between
      baseline and follow-up assessments will be used as appropriate. Separate linear regression
      models will be used to evaluate the change in each variable compared to baseline values.

    <time_frame>3 and 5 years after baseline (cross-sectional study)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome regarding hip dysfunction, which includes six subscales; pain, symptoms, physical function in daily living, physical function in sport and recreation, participation in physical activity, and quality of life. The score for each subscale ranges from 0-100, where 0 indicates extreme problems and 100 no problems.</description>

    <time_frame>3 and 5 years after baseline (cross-sectional study)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome regarding activity level. The scale ranges från 0-8 where 0 indicates the lowest activity and 8 the highest.</description>

    <measure>K-10 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 5 years after baseline (cross-sectional study)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome regarding mental health. This instrument consists of 10 questions, where each question is scored from 1 to 5. The total score is summerized and ranges from 10 to 50, where 10 indicates no problem and 50 severe problems.</description>

    <measure>Self-Presentation in Exercise Questionnaire (SPEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 and 5 years after baseline (cross-sectional study)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome regarding self image during exercise and consists of 14 questions. Each question is assessed on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Higher scores represent a greater desire to present oneself as an exerciser and a greater use of strategies to portray oneself as an exerciser.</description>

    <description>The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) is designed to measure perceptions of support from 3 sources: Family, Friends, and a Significant Other. The scale is comprised of a total of 12 items, with 4 items for each subscale. The items are scored on 7 point likert scale anging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree). The mean value tor each subscale are calculated. High score indicates a percetion of good social support.</description>
