  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type II diabetes is a known risk factor for heart failure, particularly through the
      progressive development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Cardiac metabolic parameters, including
      myocardial steatosis and epicardial fat, are altered in diabetic patients. The development of
      new anti-diabetics (incretins) has demonstrated protective cardiovascular effects independent
      of effects on glycemic control for the first time in the history of these therapies. Thus
      Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists improve the recovery of cardiac function after a
      heart attack and decrease atheromatous processes. It has also been demonstrated in a diabetic
      rat model that the administration of Liraglutide, a GLP-1 agonist, leads to normalization of
      myocardial steatosis associated with beneficial cardiac molecular remodeling involving
      pro-apoptotic, oxidative and metabolic processes. These beneficial cardiovascular effects
      were observed in the absence of any changes in blood glucose, insulin levels or body weight.
