  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety of changing pain medications (opioids) adult sickle cell
      patients take to another type of medication therapy (buprenorphine). Patients will be asked
      questions about their quality of life. Other tools for assessment will also be administered.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a descriptive, pilot study to assess the safety of converting a subset of adult
      sickle cell patients who are on effective disease modifying therapy (on high dose oral
      opioids who are unable to wean off opioids) and who continue to have frequent acute visits
      where parenteral opioids are administered to convert all opioid treatments to buprenorphine.
      Quality of life will be assessed using the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of life Measurement tool
      (ASCQ-Me), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), two Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information System (PROMIS) surveys (short-form Pain Interference and Physical Function), and
      frequency of acute pain visits.

      Buprenorphine is a partial mu-agonist and kappa antagonist and has a high affinity for the mu
      receptors with an elimination half-life of 28-37 hours for the sublingual administration. The
      lower risk for misuse, diminished withdrawal symptoms and cravings for opioids as well as the
      reduced risk of overdose make it an appealing alternative. Recent data on successful
      conversion for patients with chronic pain show a decrease in pain scores and increase in
      quality of life measurements after the beginning buprenorphine therapy for more than two
      months.

      The first dose will be determined for each patient by a physician to ensure that the dosage
      of buprenorphine will be appropriate given the patient's current opioid dosage. There is the
      risk of withdrawal induced vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC).

      Within 30 days prior to conversion to buprenorphine, a patient will take the ASCQ-Me, BPI,
      and two PROMIS surveys. Twenty-four hours prior to conversion, the patient will stop all
      opioid intake. The day of conversion, the patient will take a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal
      Scale (COWS) survey to determine whether they are in withdrawal. If so, the patient will
      begin buprenorphine conversion. They will also retake the aforementioned quality of life
      surveys. The patient will return on days 1, 14, 30, 90, and 180 to be evaluated.

    <measure>Number of subjects who require hospitalization within 72 hours post conversion from full agonist opioids to buprenorphine-based pain treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after buprenorphine initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be collected on need for hospitalization within 72 hours of conversion due to withdrawal induced vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Reported variables will be whether the patient was hospitalized within this window and for what reason the hospitalization occurred. If 2 out of the first 5 patients require hospitalization within 72 hours of conversion the study will be stopped and we will assess what changes need to be made in the protocol to decrease the risk of hospitalization triggered by the conversion.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (Brief Pain Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The BPI measures how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities, including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep. BPI pain interference is typically scored as the mean of the seven interference items. This mean can be used if more than 50%, or four of seven, of the total items have been completed on a given administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (PROMIS Pain Interference)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of quality of life measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Pain Interference has 9 questions where responses vary from Not at all, A little bit, Somewhat, Quite a bit, and Very much. The lowest score is 9 and the the highest score is 45 with a higher score representing more pain interference.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (PROMIS Physical Function)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) - Physical Function has 9 questions where responses vary from Not at all, A little bit, Somewhat, Quite a bit, and Very much. The lowest score is 9 and the the highest score is 45 with a higher score representing less physical function.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (ASCQ-Me)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of quality of life measured by Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ-Me). There are a fixed set of 5 items or questions for one domain. A unique aspect of ASCQ-Me measures is their use of standardized scores that are centered on a clinical population of people with sickle cell disease. Such scores are called &quot;normative&quot; because their value represents how close or far away they are from a normative population. The meaning of the score is defined by how it compares to the scores of others in a referent population. A score of 40 is one Standard Deviation lower than the mean of the reference population. A score of 60 is one Standard Deviation higher than the mean of the reference population</description>

    <measure>Number of acute care visits required by subjects in the 6 months prior to initiation compared to the 6 months post conversion.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months prior to conversion, 6 months post-conversion</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing number of acute care visits (either to Emergency Department or to Sickle Cell Infusion Center) in the six months prior to conversion to buprenorphine to 6 months post conversion.</description>

    <measure>Severity of opiate withdrawal, based on COWS score.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after initiation</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be in opiate withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine initiation. The level of withdrawal will be measured by the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), an 11-item scale designed to be administered by a clinician. The score ranges from 0-4 (no withdrawal), 5-12 (mild withdrawal), 13-24 (moderate withdrawal), 25-36 (severe withdrawal), and 36-48 (most severe withdrawal). Each patient's COWS score at time of initiation and at 24 hours post initiation will be measured and reported.</description>
