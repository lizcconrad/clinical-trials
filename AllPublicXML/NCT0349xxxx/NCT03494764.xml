  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease associated with recurrent
      mucosal inflammation. Clinically, the disease is characterized by bloody diarrhea, abdominal
      pain, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss. Treatment strategies vary
      based on disease activity and target various aspects of the inflammatory cascade. Options
      include: anti-inflammatory drugs (mesalamine), immunosuppressive or modulatory medications
      (corticosteroids, thiopurines, cyclosporine) and biologic agents (Anti-TNF). Disease severity
      can be wide ranging, and nearly 25% of UC patients are hospitalized for acute severe disease.
      Of these patients, 30% will undergo colectomy after the acute episode, a quarter of which
      will experience post-operative complications (1, 2). Although there has been great progress
      in treatment of UC over the past decade, even with the anti-TNF agent infliximab, the
      one-year remission rate for patients not responding to conservative management is barely 20%
      (3). Furthermore, corticosteroids have significant long-term consequences and immune
      suppressive drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine and infliximab have been associated
      with serious adverse events including life-threatening infections and lymphomas (4, 5). With
      growing evidence that the pathogenesis of UC is multi-factorial and involves a complex
      interaction of genetic and environmental factors, newer treatment modalities are being
      evaluated to target the mucosal immune response and mucosal inflammatory regulatory system
      (6, 7).

      Hyperbaric oxygen offers a promising new treatment option since it targets both tissue
      hypoxia and inflammation. Recent small scales studies evaluating the impact of hyperbaric
      oxygen treatment in acute ulcerative colitis flares demonstrated improved outcomes (8, 9).
      The mechanisms underlying the improvement are not known. In this study, we will treat
      ulcerative colitis flares with hyperbaric oxygen and measure changes in both markers of
      tissue hypoxia and inflammation. We hypothesize that hyperbaric oxygen will (a) improve
      outcomes, and (b) show reductions in markers of both tissue hypoxia and inflammation.

    <description>Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) provides 100% oxygen at a pressure above atmospheric pressure (typically twice to three times standard sea level pressure (2.0-3.0 ATA)). This dramatically increases the amount of oxygen dissolved in blood plasma, which in turn increases oxygen delivery to tissues. This effect of hyperbaric oxygen is used clinically to treat acute hypoxia in crush injuries, severed limbs, and failing skin grafts</description>
