    <textblock>
      The interventional study will evaluate effectiveness and potential of a regularly consumption
      of wheat germ oil (UV treated) vs. wheat germ oil (UV untreated) to increase plasma vitamin D
      levels ín humans.

      The interventional study in parallel design will evaluate the effectiveness and potential of
      a daily consumption of wheat germ oil (UV treated vs. untreated) to increase plasma vitamin D
      levels in humans.

      Wheat germ oil is naturally rich in vitamin D precursors (ergosterol and
      7-dehydrocholesterol), which are converted into vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 by a defined UV
      light irradiation for the present study.

      Half of the participants will consume UV-treated wheat germ oil (intervention) and the other
      part will consume traditional wheat germ oil (untreated, control). The subjects will consume
      10 ml of wheat germ oil per day over an entire period of 6 weeks (no follow-up).

      On the basis of the planned human intervention study (randomized, single-blind, parallel
      design) it will be investigated to what extent a regular consumption of wheat germ oil
      (UV-treated) can contribute to the increase of plasma 25 (OH) D levels.

      The comparison is made against the intake of traditional (untreated) wheat germ oil
      (control).

      The study fits with the strategy of the Competence Cluster for Nutrition and Cardiovascular
      Health (nutriCARD), Halle-Jena-Leipzig, Germany (www.nutriCARD.de) and the study
      collaborators are active members of the nutriCARD cluster.
