  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at a breast cancer screening technique, restriction spectrum imaging
      (RSI), as a possible alternative to the breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) used by most
      healthcare professionals.

      The technique involved in this study is:

      -Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research study is to measure RSI's ability to diagnose breast
      cancer in comparison to standard breast MRIs.

      RSI is a technique that has been shown to address the limitations of certain types of MRI
      exams used to make images of the prostate and brain. RSI is not a FDA-approved technique for
      screening, but is a type of advanced diffusion technique and diffusion weighted imaging is
      used as a part of the standard breast MRI. RSI has been shown to improve tumor detection in
      prostate and brain. For example, a recent pilot study in prostate showed that adding RSI
      improved the ability to find a certain stage of prostate cancer in comparison to an MRI
      without the use of the RSI technique. By comparing RSI's ability to diagnose breast cancer,
      future clinical testing can determine whether RSI is a more efficient way to screen for
      breast cancer.

    <description>RSI is a DWI sequence with a built in distortion-correction technique that can be applied to any diffusion technique using echo planar imaging acquisition.
RSI will be performed using pulsed-field gradient, spin-echo, echo planar imaging with &quot;multi-shell&quot; diffusion data .
The b0 images will be collected in both the forward and reverse phase encoding directions to allow for post-processing correction of spatial distortion from magnetic field.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Group 1 will consist of women who present for screening breast MRI:

               -  Age &gt;= 18

               -  Female

               -  Asymptomatic for breast disease

               -  Presenting for routine breast cancer screening with MRI

          -  Group 2 will consist of women who presented for a screening mammogram (2D or 3D
             tomosynthesis) AND who have had a biopsy recommended after diagnostic workup:

               -  Age &gt;= 18

               -  Female

               -  Asymptomatic for breast disease

               -  Presenting for routine breast cancer screening with mammogram (2D or 3D
                  tomosynthesis) and/or ultrasound

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Must have clinical experience in interpreting breast MRI.

          -  Must have interpreted at least 10 breast MRI exams with RSI interpretation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  cochlear implants. Other devices or metallic objects may be deemed unsafe for MRI
                  at the radiologist's discretion.

               -  Unable to tolerate exam (i.e., secondary to untreatable claustrophobia,
                  positioning constraints/unable to lie prone).

               -  Body weight exceeds that allowable by the MRI table.

               -  Breast biopsy or surgical intervention planned before the test RSI-MRI in this
                  study.

                  8. Nursing or thinks she may be or is pregnant, as gadolinium contrast-enhanced
                  MRI is unsafe. We will perform a pregnancy test as needed per institutional
                  policy for routine breast MRI. Per institutional clinical protocol, all females
                  of childbearing potential who are uncertain if they are pregnant or think they
                  are pregnant must have a blood test or urine study within 2 weeks prior to the
                  MRI exam to rule out pregnancy. A female of childbearing potential is any woman,
                  regardless of sexual orientation or prior tubal ligation, who:
