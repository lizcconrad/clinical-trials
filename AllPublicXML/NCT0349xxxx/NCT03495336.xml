    <textblock>
      Purpose/Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of boiled unfiltered
      (Turkish) coffee consumption on the plasma cardiovascular risk parameters of healthy
      subjects. The study also explores whether two unfiltered boiled (Turkish) coffee beverages
      that differ in content due to different roasting degrees will differentially affect
      cardiovascular biomarkers.

      Methods: In this crossover intervention study, healthy, nonsmoking, habitual Turkish coffee
      drinkers (n=28) were randomized to consume at least 3 cups of Light (LR) or Dark (DR) roast
      Turkish coffee brews per day for 4 weeks after a washout period (WO) of 2 weeks. Subsequent
      to each coffee abstinence period, both groups received the alternative intervention. After
      the first WO and the coffee intervention periods, anthropometric measures, blood pressure,
      heart rate and 13 biochemical parameters were collected and dietary records were completed.

      Background: Considerable controversy exists regarding the link between coffee consumption and
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. It has been shown that different coffee preparation and
      brewing methods influence the concentration of compounds present in the final coffee brew.
      Unlike coffee traditionally consumed in the western world, Turkish coffee is not drip
      filtered, but rather its method of preparation involves slowly boiling water that is mixed
      with thinly ground coffee beans. This style of preparation results in a greater amount of
      biologically active components (caffeine and diterpenes) remaining in the liquid. In addition
      to preparation styles, roasting process greatly affects the chemical composition of the
      coffee. Coffee types differing in content of major constituents differ with regard to
      cardiovascular health effects.

      Purpose/Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of boiled unfiltered
      (Turkish) coffee consumption on the plasma cardiovascular risk parameters of healthy
      subjects. The study also explores whether two unfiltered boiled (Turkish) coffee beverages
      that differ in content due to different roasting degrees will differentially affect

    <measure>Comparing the serum lipid levels of all interventions</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in concentration of serum lipid levels of participants in coffee-free period (washout) and after LR or DR coffee ingestion were measured.
Blood samples were obtained at the end of two weeks washout period and after each four weeks coffee intervention period, and sera were stored at −30∘ C, until analytical measurements were performed. The levels of serum lipids: Triglycerides (mg/dL), Total cholesterol (mg/dL), and HDL cholesterol (mg/dL) were determined using a Dimension Xpand Plus integrated clinical chemistry autoanalyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL, USA). The serum levels of LDL cholesterol (mg/dL) were calculated using Friedewald's equation. Differences in blood lipid variables were analyzed by repeated-measures ANOVA for comparisons of LR coffee intake with DR and of each roast with the washout.analyses were performed using SPSS 24.0 (IBM-SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The validated Turkish version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)-short form (7 item) was administered. The IPAQ questionnaires list activities and request estimates of durations and frequencies for each activity engaged in over the past week. Durations are multiplied by known METs per activity and the results for all items are summed for the overall physical activity score. Scores for walking and for moderate and vigorous activities are sums of corresponding item scores. A sitting question is not included in physical activity score. Physical activity level (PAL): Extremely inactive &lt;1.40 , Sedentary 1.40-1.69, Moderately active 1.70-1.99, Vigorously active 2.00-2.40,Extremely active&gt;2.40</description>
