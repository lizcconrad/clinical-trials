      Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) remains the surgical gold standard treatment for patients
      suffering from end stage osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. However, due to the high demand and
      scarce medical resources, the waiting time for surgery is astoundingly lengthy. Controversies
      are shown on numerous studies on whether physical functionality and mental status decline or
      remain stable over the waiting period. This study aims to evaluate the progression on
      patients suffering from end stage OA whilst being on the waiting list for TKR.

        This study aims to evaluate the progression on patients suffering from end stage OA whilst
        being on the waiting list for TKR. This was a prospective longitudinal study, involving
        patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis at Prince of Wales Hospital Hong Kong. This study
        was conducted from March 2013 to December 2016. By universal sampling, patients who had
        experienced symptomatic OA visiting the Li Ka Shing Orthopaedic Specialist out-patient
        clinic were screened by a research nurse or a research assistant based on the inclusion
        criteria.
