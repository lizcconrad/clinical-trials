  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SMART is an interactive web-based program that will allow youth with mild traumatic brain
      injuries (mTBI) to monitor their symptoms and receive education on problem-solving and coping
      strategies. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of SMART as a means of improving
      symptom-management, coping skills, and general well-being during recovery from mTBI. Half of
      participants will receive the SMART intervention, while half will receive usual care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psychological Distress, as measured by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 weeks post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>The SDQ is a 25-item behavioral screening questionnaire that has adolescents rate their psychological symptoms and positive attributes. The measure has been used with other pediatric-TBI populations89 and provides a measure of functioning across five domains (e.g., prosocial behavior and emotional symptoms). Both youth and their parents will complete, capturing adolescent strengths and challenges on a weekly basis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in coping strategies, as measured by the Coping Strategies Inventory (CSI-S: Short Form)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 weeks post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>The CSI-S is a coping styles measure and has been used with other pediatric TBI samples. Adolescents rate how much they agree with 32-statements regarding different ways of coping with difficult situations on a 5-point Likert scale. Responses are then grouped into primary subscales reflecting eight different coping strategies (e.g., problem-solving, problem avoidance, social withdrawal, etc.).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-efficacy for symptom management, as measured by the Self-Efficacy Scale (S-eS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 weeks post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>This 2-item measure will be developed by the research team based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory. Adolescents will rate their level of confidence that they are able to maintain a plan to manage their symptoms each week</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life, as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 weeks post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL includes 23 items measuring physical, emotional, social, and school functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in general functioning, as measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 weeks post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS collects data from the adolescent participant and the parent about the impact a condition has on the adolescent's functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health and behavioral symptoms, as measured by the Health and Behavior Inventory (HBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 weeks post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>The HBI is a 20-item questionnaire which includes a variety of cognitive, somatic, emotional, and behavioral symptoms requiring parents and adolescents to rate the frequency of occurrence of each symptom over the past week on a 4-point scale, ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;often.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in concussion knowledge, as measured by the Concussion Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 4 weeks post-injury</time_frame>
    <description>The concussion knowledge questionnaire will be based upon the 11-item questionnaire currently being used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Head's Up Concussion Course geared at coaches.</description>
