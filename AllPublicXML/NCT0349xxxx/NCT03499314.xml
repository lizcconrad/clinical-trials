  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind pilot clinical trial to test a novel treatment approach to
      rehabilitate fine motor function in individuals living with progressive multiple sclerosis
      (MS) using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to augment manual dexterity
      training. Treatment will be delivered to individuals at home using a state-of-the-art
      remotely supervised tele-rehabilitation protocol, a major advantage for patients with respect
      to ease of access, feasibility, reinforcement learning and minimal burden of in clinic study
      visit participation. Improvements in fine motor skill will be assessed at each remote session
      using a novel portable grip device that measures execution and adaptation or learning of
      fingertip forces during grasp, which is more sensitive than standard measures of hand
      function.
