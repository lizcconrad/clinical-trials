    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate long-term effects of early and prolonged individualized
      and optimized nutritional support using ONS for four weeks, in combination with a defined
      physiotherapy regimen, on sarcopenia and other outcome parameters in elderly fracture
      patients.
