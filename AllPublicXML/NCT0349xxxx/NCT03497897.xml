      The main purpose of this study is to assess preliminary efficacy and safety of LYS006 in
      patients with moderate to severe inflammatory acne and to determine if LYS006 has an adequate
      clinical profile for further clinical development.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects aged 18 to 45 years of age inclusive, and otherwise in good
             health as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECGs and
             laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Body weight between 50 and 120 kg, both inclusive, at screening.

          -  Patients with papulo-pustular acne vulgaris (inflammatory acne) presenting with 20 to
             100 facial inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules and nodules) at baseline, no more
             than 2 facial inflammatory nodules or cysts at screening and baseline, and
             non-inflammatory facial lesions (open and closed comedones).

          -  Patients who are candidates for systemic treatment and for whom in the opinion of the
             investigator, an appropriate previous treatment with topical anti-acne medication
             failed, or was not well tolerated, or is not indicated (e.g., due to large body
             surface area affected, e.g., on the back)

          -  Patients with Grade 3 (moderate) or Grade 4 (severe) IGA score.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Appropriate wash out periods are required for investigational drugs, any oral/systemic
             treatment for acne, systemic or lesional injected (for acne) corticosteroids or
             systemic immunomodulators, any systemic hormonal treatments, previous treatment with
             biologics, oral retinoids (in particular isotretinoin) and any topical anti-acne
             treatment.

          -  Previous surgical, physical (such as ThermaClearâ„¢), light (including blue or UV light,
             photodynamic therapy or laser therapy within 4 weeks prior to baseline

             prior to baseline.

          -  Any other forms of acne

          -  Any severe, progressive or uncontrolled medical or psychiatric condition or other
             factors at randomization that in the judgment of the investigator prevents the patient
             from participating in the study.

          -  Active systemic infections (other than common cold) during the 2 weeks prior to
             baseline.

          -  History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western
             blot) test result at screening.

          -  Chronic infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C virus.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
