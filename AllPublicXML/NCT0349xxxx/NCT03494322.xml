  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head &amp; neck (H&amp;N) cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the UK. Advanced H&amp;N cancer
      which has come back after treatment or has spread to other parts of the body is incurable and
      the average life expectancy of these patients is less than a year. New drugs called immune
      checkpoint inhibitors work with the patient's own immune system to fight cancer. They are
      used in the clinic to treat a number of cancers, including H&amp;N cancer. It may be possible to
      make immune checkpoint inhibitors more effective by combining drugs that work in different
      ways. In effect, attacking the cancer from different angles. Cetuximab is a well-established
      drug that works by blocking signals that tell cancer cells to grow and divide into more
      cells. It also engages with the immune system within the tumour. The trial aims to see if
      giving cetuximab along with an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug called avelumab is better at
      treating advanced H&amp;N cancer than giving avelumab on its own.

      These two drugs have not been given together before, so to start with, the investigator plans
      to enrol a small number of patients and give the patients avelumab + cetuximab to make sure
      the combination is safe at the doses chosen. After this, the investigator plans to enrol 114
      patients with advanced H&amp;N cancer. Half the patients will be treated with avelumab alone and
      the other half with avelumab + cetuximab. Both drugs are given intravenously in the hospital
      once every 2 weeks.

      Treatment lasts for up to a year and patients will be followed up for up to 2 years from the
      time they enter the study. Patients will be recruited from around 15 hospitals in the UK.
      Recruitment would be expected to start in the second quarter of 2018 and it will take about
      29 months (Safety run-in: 5 months; Phase II: 24 months) to recruit all the patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised phase II study comparing the efficacy of avelumab alone with avelumab +
      cetuximab combination in patients with platinum-resistant advanced or metastatic head &amp; neck
      cancer. The randomised phase II part of the trial will be preceded by a safety run-in.The
      objective of the safety run in is to make sure the combination of cetuximab and avelumab at
      the doses selected for the study are safe and tolerable.

      In phase II, the main question the investigator wants to answer is whether or not giving
      avelumab and cetuximab together is better than giving avelumab alone to treat patients with
      head and neck cancer that have had previous treatment with cisplatin and whose cancer has
      come back or spread to other parts of the body. The investigator will compare the number of
      patients in each group whose cancer has not gotten any worse 6 months after joining the
      study.

      The phase II part of the trial will recruit patients with head &amp; neck squamous cell carcinoma
      only. However, during the safety run-in, patients with other types of squamous cell
      carcinomas will also be eligible.

      Target accrual:

      Safety run-in: up to 16 patients with squamous cell carcinomas; Phase II: 114 patients with
      head &amp; neck squamous cell cancer

      The safety run-in will recruit patients in cohorts of 3 at a time and all patients will be
      treated with the combination. The safety run in is a dose de-escalation design. That is,
      patients will be given the dose that is planed for use in phase II and if this proves not
      tolerable, the dose of cetuximab will be de-escalated and another cohort of patients will be
      recruited. The investigator will conclude the combination is safe and tolerable if less than
      33% of patients who are treated experience side effects that lead to a dose reduction. The
      purpose is to ensure the safety of the combination prior to starting phase II, as these drugs
      have not been given together before. However, there is evidence from previous studies that
      these types of drugs can be combined safely. The trial aims to complete the safety run-in
      within 5 months and the phase II study within 24 months. The entire duration of recruitment
      is expected to be 29 months.
