    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Niraparib. Niraparib is being tested to treat
      Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will look at the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of Niraparib administered once daily orally.

      The study will enroll approximately 12 patients as a maximum. Participants will be assigned
      to Cohort 1 (21-day treatment cycle). After that, participants will be assigned to Cohort 2
      when safety and tolerability of the 200 mg dose will be demonstrated.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 16 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic with
      final visit approximately 28 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

             (NOTE: patients with Grade 2 alopecia may qualify for this study). If bevacizumab had
             been used in the past, all bevacizumab-related toxicities must have resolved. Patients
             with prostate cancer may have been treated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
             (LH-RH) analogs.

          2. Participants who received a known or putative poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
             inhibitor or other drugs that may inhibit the PARP, either as part of a clinical trial
             or as standard of care.

          3. Participants who initiated bisphosphonate therapy or are adjusting bisphosphonate
             dose/regimen within 30 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Participants on a stable
             bisphosphonate regimen are eligible and may continue the treatment.

          4. Treatment with any investigational products within 28 days or 5 half-lives (whichever
             was longer) before Cycle 1 Day 1.

          5. Participants who have symptomatic ascites or a symptomatic pleural effusion. A
             participant who is treated and clinically stable for these conditions is eligible.

          6. Patients with a known primary central nervous system (CNS) tumor.

          7. Patients with known CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded.
             However, patients with CNS metastases who have completed a course of therapy would be
             eligible for the study provided they are clinically stable for 30 days prior to Cycle
             1 Day 1 defined as: (1) no evidence of new or enlarging CNS metastases, (2) off
             steroids, or (3) on a stable dose and administration of steroids.

             infection. Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular
             arrhythmia, recent (within 90 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) myocardial infarction,
             uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal cord compression, superior vena
             cava syndrome, uncontrolled hypertension, or any psychiatric disorder that prohibits
             obtaining informed consent.

         10. Participants who have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or lab
             abnormality that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient's
             participation throughout the study period, or study participation is not in the best
             interest of the participant.

         11. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI surgery that could interfere with the GI
             absorption of study drug, such as difficulty swallowing capsules and total
             gastrectomy.

         12. Participants who have a psychiatric disorder that may interfere with the conduct of
             the trial.

         13. Participant is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including
             &quot;recreational use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the past
             year) of drug or alcohol abuse.

         14. Participants who are pregnant or breast-feeding, or expecting to conceive or be a
             father of children within the planned duration of the study.

             NOTE: If a breast-feeding woman discontinue breast-feeding, she may be enrolled in the
             study.

         15. Known human immunodeficiency virus positive.

         16. Known hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, or known or suspected active
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

        NOTE: Participants who are positive for hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) or hepatitis B
        surface antibody (HBsAb) can be enrolled but must have an undetectable hepatitis B virus
        (HBV) viral load. Participants who have positive hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb) must
        have an undetectable HCV viral load.
