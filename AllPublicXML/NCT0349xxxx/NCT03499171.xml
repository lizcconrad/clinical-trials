  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Citalopram is a drug used in the treatment of depressive episodes and belongs to the group of
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter
      predominantly found in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. Serotonin is associated with
      psychological disorders, including anxiety and depression, and emotion regulation and it has
      been shown that anxiety and depression are associated with increased severity of GERD-related
      symptoms. Citalopram and other SSRI's elevate the concentration of serotonin by blocking the
      reabsorption into the presynaptic neuron and thereby increasing the level of serotonin
      available to bind the postsynaptic receptor. A recent study showed beneficial effects of
      citalopram in patients with reflux hypersensitivity. However, there was no objective
      measurement for reflux nor esophageal sensitivity during the treatment period. Moreover, the
      effect of citalopram in patients with functional heartburn has not been studied so far.
      Therefore, we will conduct a randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the
      efficacy of citalopram on the improvement in symptom severity, reflux parameters and
      esophageal sensitivity. 50 patients with reflux hypersensitivity and 50 patients with
      functional heartburn will receive either placebo or citalopram (Cipramil®) 20 mg as an add-on
      for a period of 8 weeks. Symptom severity will be assessed by a validated reflux
      questionnaire (ReQuest questionnaire and diaries), reflux parameters by performing a 24 hour
      impedance-pH monitoring and esophageal sensitivity using our multimodal esophageal
      stimulation paradigm

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 to 65 years old.

          2. History of typical GERD symptoms during PPI treatment, at least 3 times per week for
             12 weeks.

          3. Daily intake of PPI treatment 12 weeks prior to inclusion, with at least 8 weeks of
             b.i.d. therapy (at least 2*20mg of omeprazole or equivalent).

          4. Sexually active women of child bearing potential participating in the study must use a
             medically acceptable form of contraception. Medically acceptable forms of
             contraception include oral contraceptives, injectable or implantable methods,
             intrauterine devices, or properly used barrier contraception.

          5. Subjects must be capable of understanding and be willing to provide signed and dated
             written voluntary informed consent before any protocol-specific screening procedures
             are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Endoscopic signs of severe erosive esophagitis (≥ grade B, Los Angeles classification)
             on endoscopy performed during PPI treatment in the 6 months prior to screening.

          2. Systemic diseases, known to affect esophageal motility.

             metabolic or gastrointestinal cerebrovascular disease as judged by the investigator.

          8. Major psychiatric disorder.

          9. Absence of PPI intake for at least 2 consecutive days in the 2 weeks prior to the
