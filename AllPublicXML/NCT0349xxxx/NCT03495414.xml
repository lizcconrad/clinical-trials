  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypersexual Disorder (HD), sometimes called &quot;sexual addiction&quot;, is a disorder with intense
      sexual desires and psychological preoccupations that lead to out-of-control sexual activities
      with severe consequences. HD is related to higher risks of HIV infection and an important
      risk factor for committing sexual crimes. The prevalence of HD is 3-6% of the general
      population, thus, a significant burden for society. The neurobiological mechanisms behind HD
      are still unknown, and there is still a great need for causal treatments.

      This study is aimed at identifying neurobiological and psychological mechanisms underlying HD
      as a basis for treatment development. The overall goal is to improve mental health, quality
      of life, diagnosis and treatment options for affected individuals, and to reduce the impact
      HD can have on society. Patients with HD will be recruited at Karolinska University Hospital
      in close collaboration between endocrinologists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and brain
      researchers at Karolinska Institutet. Cases and healthy controls will undergo brain scans
      (MRI), psychological and blood tests to quantify neurobiological, cognitive, and behavioral
      aspects of HD.

      This study is directly integrated into clinical practice, can identify important targets for
      interventions and factors predicting treatment outcomes. This study is essential for a better
      understanding of HD, the improvement of treatments, and can have significant impact on the
      prevention of HIV infections and sexual crimes.

        Patients will be recruited through an ongoing CBT study (KAFKA_IT) at Karolinska University
        Hospital (ANOVA). Initial contact between patients and study coordinators will primarily be
        made through the phone helpline PrevenTell, designed to prevent sexual offences by
        targeting persons at risk. At the clinical visit patients will be evaluated in a face to
        face interview by trained psychologists/psychiatrists to establish psychiatric diagnoses,
        including the diagnosis of HD. If criteria for HD are met, patients will be informed about
        the present imaging study. Healthy controls from the Stockholm catchment area will be
        recruited through Karolinska Trial Alliance, and/or public advertisement in form of
        posters, online job postings and/or social media.

          -  At least 18 years of age,

          -  Fluent in the Swedish language

          -  Patients will meet diagnostic criteria for hypersexual disorder and will not have
             started with any psychotherapy or psychological treatment.

          -  Controls will be physically and psychologically healthy, and show no indication of
             clinical hypersexuality

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For both patients and controls any reported medical or clinical condition known to affect
        brain structure and function, test performance, or associated with risks for the MRI
        environment will be exclusionary. The investigators will exclude for the following:

          -  Severe neurological/psychiatric diseases or conditions (e.g., major depression,
             bipolar disorder, ADHD, autism, anxiety/panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder,
             personality disorder, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, PTSD/chronic stress/burnout
             syndrom, Alzheimer's disease)

          -  Gender identity disorder/gender dysphoria

          -  Chronic pain conditions

          -  Impared vision, or other vision problems that cannot be corrected with MR-safe
             equipment.

          -  Hearing impairments, or problems with other senses

          -  History of severe brain damage/injuries

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  Having metal implants, a pacemaker, metallic braces or other MRI contra-indications

          -  Alcohol/drug dependence/abuse, eating disorder, pathological gambling, during the past
             6 months.

          -  HIV and Hepatitis C/B, if the condition is untreated or virus levels detectable.

          -  Untreated endocrinologic diseases

          -  Medication: bensodiazepine, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, centrally acting
             sympathicomimetics, SSRI (if use started less than 3 months ago). Any medication or
             pharmaceutical drug that interferes with sex hormone production or metabolism, i.e.
             ketoconazol, cyproteronacetate, spironolactone and similar drugs.

        Note: There is a potentially higher prevalence of comorbidities and medication use in
        patients. To facilitate recruitment and study completion, the investigators may include
        subjects that report specific conditions at the discretion of the principle investigator.
        In those cases, corresponding information will be recorded in order to control for
        potential confounders.
