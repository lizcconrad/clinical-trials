  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common human malignant tumors. The incidence and
      mortality of colorectal cancer in our country are on the rise. Surgery-based, combined with
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy comprehensive treatment, is the main treatment of colorectal
      cancer. Surgical resection has been recognized as the primary treatment of colorectal cancer.
      However, due to the majority of patients already advanced at the time of diagnosis, some
      difficulties are brought to radical surgery. Therefore, the importance of chemotherapy for
      colorectal cancer gradually been clinically recognized, But rarely survive more than 18
      months.&quot; In addition to chemotherapy, there is now a more ideal model of cancer treatment-
      molecular targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibody drugs such as cetuximab, as well
      as small molecule tyrosine kinases Inhibitors gefitinib and so on. Molecular targeted drugs
      make use of the difference in molecular biology between tumor cells and normal cells.
      Targeting drugs to tumor cells and inhibiting the growth and proliferation of the cells can
      achieve the therapeutic effect, which has the advantages of high specificity and low adverse
      reaction. The bio-targeted drug cetuximab is the first drug approved to marketed as an
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting immunoglobulin 1（IgG1）monoclonal antibody.
      Cetuximab, either monotherapy or combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy, can exert excellent
      anti-tumor activity in EGFR-positive malignant tumors and can significantly enhance the
      efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

      Reference to cetuximab injection, guilin sanjin Co., Ltd. and dragonboat Co., Ltd. jointly
      developed a recombinant anti-EGFR human mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (R &amp; D code:
      CDP1).The primary structure of CDP1 is exactly the same with cetuximab, the higher structure
      and Physical and chemical properties and cetuximab are highly similar. Pharmacodynamic
      activity in vivo and in vitro, pharmacokinetic characteristics and toxicological reactions
      are also similar to cetuximab. CDP1 selected with cetuximab consistent formulations,
      prescriptions, specifications.

      CDP1 was approved by China Food and Drug Administration (No. 2016L06884) in August 2016 for
      clinical studies. According to the contents of the document and guidelines for biological
      analogs, the clinical pharmacokinetic and clinical effectiveness comparison tests of CDP1 and
      the safety and immunogenicity assessment are planned.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

      To compare the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a single dose between CDP1 and the original
      drug Erbitux In patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary :

        1. To compare the safety and immunogenic characteristics of the single dose between CDP1
           and the original drug Erbitux in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer.

        2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of CDP1 multiple administrations.&quot;

      OUTLINE

      The study can be divided into 3 parts:

      Part 1: Single-dose Phase:

      single center, parallel, randomized, single-blind trial. The original drug Erbitux as a
      control, CDP1 and Erbitux single-dose pharmacokinetics of the initial comparison, and at the
      same time safety and immunogen preliminary comparison. CDP1 group received a single
      administration of CDP1 250mg/m2, Erbitux group received Erbitux 250mg/m2 single
      administration. Two groups of subjects after a single administration into the 4-week
      observation period, safety observations, pharmacokinetic blood samples and immunogenic blood
      samples were collected. The tumor was evaluated at the end of the 4 week observation
      period.If the subjects did not develop the disease, or did not appear the intolerant toxicity
      during the observation period, they entered the period of multiple drug delivery.

      Part 2: Multi-dose Phase:

      Single center, single arm, open trial, evaluation of pharmacokinetics and safety with
      multiple doses of CDP1. Multiple administrations of two groups of subjects were followed by
      continuous administration of CDP1. Dosing regimen is the first administration of 400mg/m2,
      followed by 250mg/m2, once a week for 6 weeks.

      Part 3: Follow-up Phase:

      CDP1, IV, once a week, 250mg/m2, until the patient's death or the withdrawal decision of the
      patient and/or investigator.
