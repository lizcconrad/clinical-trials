  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness of nervous system mobilization and exercise with
      exercise only on institutionalized older adults' postural control.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that 26 institutionalized older adults will be randomly allocated to
      receive either exercise and neural mobilization (n=13) or exercise only (n=13).

      Data on pain intensity (a vertical numeric rating scale) and location (body chart),
      depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), balance, hand grip strength, timed up and go and
      gait velocity will be collected at baseline, end of treatment and at 3 months follow up.

      Statistical analysis will be performed using a mixed-methods ANOVA.
