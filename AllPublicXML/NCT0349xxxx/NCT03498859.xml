  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the efficacy of physiotherapist-supervised training once per week
      during 10 weeks compared to home-based training during 10 weeks, after proksimal humerus
      fracture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Proximal humerus fracture is the third most common fracture in elderly people after hip and
      colles fracture, and are often caused by fall and osteoporosis. These fractures are highly
      related to morbidity and mortality among elderly people and consumes considerably health care
      resources. More than 70% of the proximal humerus fracture patients are over 60 years of age
      and 75% are female.

      Only sparse evidence reveals to what extend the patients need rehabilitation and how it
      should be implemented in the treatment strategy.

      In Denmark as well as in Finland the rehabilitation after proximal humerus fractures takes
      place in local centers in the municipalities, and the rehabilitation offered to the patients
      varies significantly. Currently in Denmark there are no national clinical guidelines to
      support the rehabilitation strategy.

    <description>Patient reported outcome measure of health related quality of life. A set of utility or preference weights is used to generate the 15D score (single index number) on a 0-1 scale, where a higher score indicates a poor health related quality of life.
The scores will be compared between the 2 groups</description>

    <measure>Pain catastrophizing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline, after 3 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcome measure. Measures on a 0-53 scale, where a higher score indicates a higher levels of pain catastrophizing thinking.
The scores will be compared between the 2 groups. Also the correlation with DASH scores will be investigated</description>

The scores will be compared between the 2 groups. Also the correlation with DASH scores will be investigated</description>

    <measure>Accelerometer based activity in the upper extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at 3 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is wearing a censor above the elbow on both arms, that measures the level of upper extremity activity for three consecutive days. It measures the number of movements under and above shoulder hight and classify them into either high or low intensity movements.
The asymmetry between the fractured and the healthy arm will be estimated and compared between the groups.</description>
