  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effect of two types of suturing techniques in the postoperative
      swelling and mouth opening after surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molar. total
      wound closure will be performed in one group of participants while partial closure will be
      performed in the other group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Third molar surgeries are mostly associated with pain, swelling and limited mouth opening,
      referred to as post-operative morbidity. Wound closure technique is an operative factor which
      is associated with reduced post-operative morbidity. In the total wound closure, the
      mucoperiosteum is hermetically sealed whereas in the partial wound closure, a window or
      opening is left to allow for secondary healing. This study therefore compares the effect of
      partial and total wound closure techniques after surgical extraction of impacted mandibular
      third molar teeth in reducing the swelling and limited mouth opening.
