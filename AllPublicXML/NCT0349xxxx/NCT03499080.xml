  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2015 the Norwegian government, after initiative from user organizations, decided to
      implement medication free inpatient treatment units. The goal is to secure real options to
      medication for psychiatric illness, and to gather experiences with medication free options.
      Freedom of choice is a main concern.

      The projects main aim is to study the outcome of medication free treatments of mental illness
      compared to treatment as usual, as well as characteristics of the treatment and the treatment
      population and why patients choose this treatment. Hereunder we aim to document who asks for
      these kinds of services and why, what kind of treatment they get, how they experience it, and
      how they respond to this kind of treatment. An important part will be to document whether the
      goal of increased freedom of choice between real treatment options is fulfilled.

      Research questions

        1. Does medication free treatment differ from treatment as usual? Are there any unique
           characteristics of the patient group who asks for this kind of treatment? What kind of
           treatment do they receive during their stay? How do they experience this treatment in
           comparison to treatment as usual? How is this in relation to the goals about increased
           freedom of choice? Does use of medication change during and/or after medication free
           treatment?

        2. Why do patients choose medication free treatment? What are their reasons? What
           experiences lead to this wish?

        3. What is the outcome of medication free treatment compared to treatment as usual?

      Background In 2015 the Norwegian government, after initiative from user organizations,
      decided to implement medication free inpatient treatment units. The goal is to secure real
      options to medication for psychiatric illness, and to gather experiences with medication free
      options. Freedom of choice is a main concern. (Aksjon for medisinfrie tilbud) The local unit
      under study DPS døgn Moenga at Akershus University Hospital has been given the assignment of
      developing a medication free treatment unit. This is an inpatient treatment unit for
      voluntary, planned treatment. High suicidal risk, severe acting out, active drug abuse etc.
      is excluded. The treatment program is 8 weeks long.

      Status of knowledge The project has been controversial, especially with reference to the
      status of knowledge. Critiques have stated that the knowledge base for treating serious
      psychiatric disorders without medication is lacking (Gundersen, 2016; Røssberg, 2016).
      Concerns are raised about whether it can be harmful (Røssberg, 2016), whether it is necessary
      (Røssberg, Andreassen, &amp; Malt, 2016) and whether it creates unfortunate dividing lines within
      health care (Røssberg et al., 2016). National guidelines recommend considering/offering
      medication for bipolar disorders, deep depression and psychosis (Helsedirektoratet, 2009,
      2012, 2013). On the other hand, the knowledge base for use of psychotropic drugs is also
      being questioned, especially regarding long term effects (Bentall, 2009; Forand &amp; DeRubeis,
      2013; Moncrieff, 2009; Sohler et al., 2016; Whitaker, 2010/2014 (no), 2016). Studies on
      medication are amongst others criticized for not taking withdrawal effect sufficiently into
      account (Bentall, 2009; Forand &amp; DeRubeis, 2013; Moncrieff, 2009; Whitaker, 2010/2014 (no),
      2016). A randomized controlled study by Wunderink, Nieboer, Wiersma, Sytema, and Nienhuis
      (2013) indicates a follow up period of at least 3 years is necessary to see the benefits of
      drug reduction regarding antipsychotics.

      Summing up, one can argue that generally, a considerable research base point to psychosocial
      treatment methods having an important place in the treatment of most psychiatric problems
      (Lambert, 2013; Wampold, 2001; Wampold &amp; Imel, 2015). The more specific questions regarding
      pure psychosocial treatment for serious disorders and long term effects of psychotropic drugs
      are at least disputable, and probably under-researched.

      Research questions

        1. Does medication free treatment differ from treatment as usual? Patient characteristics,
           treatment received, experience, medication use.

        2. Why do patients choose medication free treatment? What are their reasons? What
           experiences lead to this wish?

        3. What is the outcome of medication free treatment compared to treatment as usual?
           Hypotheses The treatment outcome of medication free treatment is not inferior to
           treatment as usual.

      Patients in medication free treatment will use less medication. Medication withdrawal may
      affect outcome in the short run.

      Project methodology The design of the study is a mixed methods, observational design within a
      naturalistic treatment setting using qualitative and quantitative methods to address the
      research questions.

      Moenga consist of two units, the medication free unit and a regular unit, which will be
      included for comparison. In addition we include a treatment unit on a different location for
      comparison; DPS Myrvegen. We aim for at least 200 n.

      One complication is that this autumn it was decided that the units at Moenga shall move and
      reorganize sometime during 2018. This entail change of location, possible reorganizing of
      personnel and that the comparison unit at Moenga is joined with another inpatient unit at the
      new location. This may cause disruptions that can affect our results. We will study possible
      effects of this in our data, and may exclude parts of the gathered data and prolong the
      inclusion period.

      We will collect survey data at start of treatment, weekly during treatment, at end of
      treatment (Work package 1), and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years follow up (work
      package 3). Register data will be collected 3 years back and 3 years follow up (work package
      3). Patient interviews (work package 2) and personnel interviews (work package 4) are
      performed during spring 2018, the patient interviews near the end of the treatment stay. See
      measures for details.

      Plan for data analyses Quantitative and qualitative analyses will be done according to the
      research questions. We will seek to compare the medication free unit and treatment as usual.
      Calculating propensity scores in the observational part of the study will be considered, to
      balance comparison groups (Austin, 2011).

      Statistical power Exact power calculations are only possible in concrete, delimited
      statistical designs, and must necessarily be based on assumptions not always known before
      starting the study. In a design with 200 persons the total effect of one-way analysis of
      variance yield a statistical power of .80 for small to medium effect sizes. That is, the
      probability of detecting differences between groups will be .80 for effect sizes in the range
      .40 -.50. For pairwise comparisons between groups (with N=50), the probability of detecting
      effects in the range of Cohen's d &gt;=. 40 will be about .80. In Cohen's pragmatic system,
      effect sizes with such magnitudes represent a &quot;small to medium effect size&quot;. These
      estimations will also apply to change-scores between two points in time, given that the
      correlation between the two repeated measurements are r &gt;= .5.

      Study plan

      Data collection:

      Work package 1: Inclusion of patients for quantitative measurements starts April 2018 with a
      12 months inclusion period. This may be prolonged if necessary.

      Work package 2: Patient interviews will be performed during spring 2018. Work package 3:
      Follow up measures and register data will be collected until spring 2022.

      Work package 4: Personnel interviews will be performed during spring 2018. Analysis
      Qualitative analyses will be performed within end of 2018. Quantitative analyses will start
      January 2019 Publishing Publishing of the results in scientific papers will take place mainly
      in 2019-2023.

    <time_frame>Filled out by patients at start of treatment, 1 time every week during the treatment program (typically 2 to 8 weeks), 1 time at end of treatment (typically at week 2-8) and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire was developed for tracking outpatients on a weekly basis. It measures symptom distress, interpersonal functioning and contentment with social role functioning, areas widely recognized as the essential ingredients of interest when assessing patient improvement. It is regarded suitable for patients with a wide range of diagnoses, sensitive to change over a short period of time, and brief and easy to administer (Lambert, Hansen, &amp; Finch, 2001).</description>

    <measure>The Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-SP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Filled out by patients at start of treatment, 1 time every week during the treatment program (typically 2 to 8 weeks), 1 time at end of treatment (typically at week 2-8) and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The WAI is one of the most widely used measures in research on working alliance and measures three aspects of the collaborative, purposive work in therapy: Bond, Task, and Goal. Research indicates that Bond, Task, and Goal represent the multidimensional construct working alliance is assumed to be (Horvath, 1994; ref. in Hersoug et al., 2009). WAI items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never) to 7 (always), assessing the extent to which patient and therapist explicitly agree on the tasks and goals of therapy and the quality of the affective bond between them.</description>

    <measure>Beliefs about medicines questionnaire (BMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Filled out by patients at start of treatment, end of treatment (typically at week 2-8) and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The BMQ comprises two sections: the BMQ-Specific which assesses representations of medication prescribed for personal use and the BMQ-General which assesses beliefs about mcdicines in general. The pool of test items was derived from themes identified in published studies and from interviews with chronically ill patients. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the test items resulted in a logically coherent. 18 item, 4-factor structure which was stable across various illness groups. In this study we use the BMQ-Specific. The BMQ-Specific comprises two 5-item factors assessing beliefs about the necessity of prescribed medication (Specific-Necessity) and concerns about prescribed medication bascd on beliefs about the danger of dependence and long-term toxicity and the disruptive effects of medication (Specific-Concern).</description>

    <time_frame>Filled out by patients at start of treatment, end of treatment (typically at week 2-8) and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>INSPIRE measure of staff support for personal recovery version 3 is included because the Recovery-tradition is a central part of the treatment program. Inspire has two subscales; Support and Relationship. The scale has demonstrated adequate psychometric properties (Williams et al., 2015).</description>

    <time_frame>Filled out by patients at start of treatment, end of treatment (typically at week 2-8) and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Collaborate is a 3-item measure of shared decision making. CollaboRATE assesses three core SDM tasks: (1) explanation about health issues, (2) elicitation of patient preferences and (3) integration of patient preferences into decisions (Paul J. Barr et al., 2017). It has been found to have adequate psychometric properties in both simulated (Paul James Barr et al., 2014) and clinical (Paul J. Barr et al., 2017) settings.</description>

    <time_frame>Filled out by patients at start of treatment, end of treatment (typically at week 2-8) and at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8) is an eight item questionnaire for measuring patient's global satisfaction with services. It has been shown to correlate well with the longer version, CSQ-18, and has shown good psychometric qualities regarding internal consistency, attendance, remainer-terminator status and greater client-reported symptomreduction (Attkisson &amp; Zwick, 1982)</description>

    <description>Affect Integration Inventory 42 (AII-42) is a short version of AII, a medium-length (112 items) self-rated assessment instrument that endeavors to measure capacities for experience and expression of nine affect states. These are important parts of the construct affect integration, the capacity to utilize affects for personal adjustment. A recent study has found satisfactory reliability, sound internal structure, and associations with external criteria, indicating good convergent and discriminant validity (Solbakken, Rauk, Solem, Lødrup, &amp; Monsen, 2017).</description>

    <measure>The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Filled out by clinician at start of treatment and end of treatment (typically week 2-8)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI) was developed for use in NIMH-sponsored clinical trials to provide a brief, stand-alone assessment of the clinician's view of the patient's global functioning prior to and after initiating a study medication (Guy, 1976; ref. in Busner &amp; Targum, 2007) The CGI provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure that takes into account all available information, including a knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function. The CGI can track clinical progress across time and has been shown to correlate with longer, more tedious and time consuming rating instruments across a wide range of psychiatric diagnoses (Busner &amp; Targum, 2007).</description>

    <description>Health of the Nation Outcomes Scales (HoNOS) was developed to routinely measure outcomes for adults with mental illness.

    <description>Global assessment of functioning (GAF) is one of the axes in the DSM diagnostic system from version III-R (Ullevål personlighetsprosjekt) until version 5. The multiaxial system was discarded in version 5 (Kress, Minton, Adamson, Paylo, &amp; Pope, undated). From 1998 Statens helsetilsyn recommended all health institutions to use a minimum set of basic data (&quot;minste basis datasett&quot;) which included a split version of GAF called S-GAF (Ullevål personlighetsprosjekt). The patient is ranged on two scales from 0-100 regarding symptoms and functioning. The psychometric properties of GAF are disputed (Kress et al., undated), but the measure is short, widely applied and mandatory in hospitals and therefore we include it.</description>
