  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel 4-group trial with the
      primary analysis after 4 weeks of treatment with continuous subcutaneous glucagon infusion
      (CSGI) or placebo. After a 1-week qualification on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM),
      subjects will have their baseline hypoglycemia counter-regulatory response hormones
      quantified using a step-wise hypoglycemia induction procedure. Subjects meeting eligibility
      requirements will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups, 2 glucagon, 2 placebo. Subjects
      will receive blinded study drug for 4 weeks, and they will be followed for an additional 26
      weeks post-treatment. Subjects' counter-regulatory hormone response will be measured at
      baseline, the end of treatment (4 weeks), and 13 and 26 weeks after treatment ends.

             at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects positive for other drugs of abuse via
             rapid urine test who report use of a prescription or over-the-counter medication that

             investigator.

         22. Administration of glucagon within 14 days of Screening.

         23. Pregnant and/or Lactating. For subjects of childbearing potential, there is a

             and to refrain from breast feeding during the study and for at least 1 month after
             participating in the study. Acceptable contraception includes birth control pill /
             patch / vaginal ring, Depo-Provera, Norplant, an intra-uterine device, the double
             barrier method (the female uses a diaphragm and spermicide and the male uses a
             condom), or abstinence.
