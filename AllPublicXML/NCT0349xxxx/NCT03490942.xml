  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind, parallel 4-group trial with the
      primary analysis after 4 weeks of treatment with continuous subcutaneous glucagon infusion
      (CSGI) or placebo. After a 1-week qualification on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM),
      subjects will have their baseline hypoglycemia counter-regulatory response hormones
      quantified using a step-wise hypoglycemia induction procedure. Subjects meeting eligibility
      requirements will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups, 2 glucagon, 2 placebo. Subjects
      will receive blinded study drug for 4 weeks, and they will be followed for an additional 26
      weeks post-treatment. Subjects' counter-regulatory hormone response will be measured at
      baseline, the end of treatment (4 weeks), and 13 and 26 weeks after treatment ends.

             rapid urine test who report use of a prescription or over-the-counter medication that
             would explain such a finding will be allowed to participate at the discretion of the
             investigator.

         22. Administration of glucagon within 14 days of Screening.

         23. Pregnant and/or Lactating. For subjects of childbearing potential, there is a

             and to refrain from breast feeding during the study and for at least 1 month after
             participating in the study. Acceptable contraception includes birth control pill /
             patch / vaginal ring, Depo-Provera, Norplant, an intra-uterine device, the double
             barrier method (the female uses a diaphragm and spermicide and the male uses a
             condom), or abstinence.
