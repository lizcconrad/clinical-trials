  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centered, prospective study, involving pregnant women presenting to the labor and
      delivery unit of collaborating clinical study sites with preterm labor and intact amniotic
      membranes with and without suspected Intra-Amniotic Infection (IAI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A study on patients in preterm labor for whom the managing physician plans to perform
      amniocentesis to evaluate for possible infection using conventional, currently available
      methods. Vaginal fluid will be collected and analyzed and amniotic fluid will also. These
      tests will be run remotely and not reported to the clinician.
