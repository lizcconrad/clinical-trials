  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipedema and Dercum's disease are known as Rare Adipose Disorders; they are painful,
      progressive disorders that result in abnormal accumulations of fat in the form of lipomas,
      excess lymphatic fluid, and many other symptoms. This trial aims to study RZL-012, a novel
      compound, in treating lipedema and Dercum's disease by triggering lipolysis at selected sites
      and reducing fat bringing pain relief and improvement in quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A vast amount of published information proves that for some people, obesity is not the result
      of excessive food consumption, poor food choices, and failure to exercise . Problems with
      mitochondria, leaky lymphatics and other mutations can drive and maintain fat growth that
      cannot be lost through traditional diet and exercise. Lipedema and Dercum's disease are known
      as Rare Adipose Disorders. These are painful and progressive disorders that result in
      abnormal accumulations of fat in the form of lipomas, excess lymphatic fluid, and many other
      symptoms.

      RZL-012 is a novel molecule that enables de-novo generation of thermogenic tissue at
      favorable anatomical sites. As a result, the extra accumulated fat will be turned into heat
      and induce lipolysis. This is an open label , Phase 2a clinical trial for the evaluation of
      safety, efficacy and lipolysis-induction of RZL-012 in women with lipedema involving
      substantial fat above the knee or women and men with nodular Dercum's disease.
