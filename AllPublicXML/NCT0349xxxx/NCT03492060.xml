    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze patterns in individuals with HNRNPH2 genetic
      variants, including their neurological comorbidities, other medical problems and any
      treatment. We will maintain an ongoing database of medical data that is otherwise being
      collected for routine medical care. We will also collect data prospectively in the form of
      questionnaires, neuropsychological, and motor assessments to examine the landscape of
      deleterious variants in this gene.

      Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of disorders in which the development of the central
      nervous system is disturbed. The genetic basis for many neurodevelopmental disorders has
      continued to expand and a recent gene called HNRNPH2 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein
      H2 (HNRNPH2)) is one such gene that is associate with a common neurodevelopmental disorder,
      characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism and autistic features,
      and tone abnormalities. The investigators would like to examine patterns of initial
      presentation, patterns in neurological evaluations, neurological testing including brain MRI
      and electroencephalography and outcomes individuals with a variant in the HNRNPH2 gene. This
      is non-interventional study that examines both data previously used in clinical practice and
      prospective data collection in the form of questionnaires and assessments. By analyzing such
      data, the investigators hope to gain insight into outcomes and patterns of neurological
      development.
