  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate a preventive intervention program designed to support
      families (parents and typically developing adolescent siblings) that include a child with an
      intellectual and/or developmental disability. Participant families will be randomly assigned
      to either the treatment condition, in which they will receive psychoeducation and
      communication coaching over a four-week period, or the control condition, in which they will
      receive self-study materials. All subjects will participate in a pre-test assessment and
      three post-test assessments over the course of the year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A critical need exists for an evidence-based program to ameliorate the impact of family
      stress and conflict on the overall well-being of parents and TD siblings, as well as
      individuals with IDD. Our objective in this study is to test the efficacy for parents, TD
      siblings, and children with IDD of an adaptation of the psycho-educational and communication
      training approach used in a previously validated prevention/intervention program for
      community families, and to examine the mechanisms associated with change processes that occur
      as a result of the 4-week program. Our long-term goal is to increase the availability and
      affordability of empirically-supported family-systems approaches to reduce family stress and
      conflict in families of individuals with IDD. Our central hypothesis is that participation in
      the program will support the identified needs of families with a child with IDD, improve the
      well-being and adjustment of parents, increase emotional security and adjustment for TD
      siblings, and be associated with improvements in adaptive functioning for individuals with
      IDD. This central hypothesis is supported by promising qualitative evidence and preliminary
      analyses from an ongoing pilot study using the adapted curriculum included in the present
      proposal. Our rationale is that providing a family-systems approach to improving the family
      environment will support the well-being of each family member, including the child with IDD.
      The specific aims are: (1) determining the efficacy of the program for parents, (2a)
      determining the efficacy of the program for typically developing siblings, (2b) testing
      process models, guided by the Emotional Security Theory (EST; Davies &amp; Cummings, 1994), to
      explain how and why and for whom and when changes occur as a result of the program, and (3)
      examining the impact of the program on individuals with IDD. Families (n=150) that include a
      child with IDD and a TD sibling between 11 and 17 years of age, will be randomly assigned to
      one of two groups: (1) parent and typically developing sibling intervention, or (2) resource
      only control. Multi-method assessments of all family members will be obtained at pre- and
      post-intervention visits, and 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. The approach is innovative
      because it addresses multiple family members' needs, tests theory about explanatory models
      for program impact, and utilizes a brief, psycho-educational format and a RCT design to
      evaluate its efficacy. This research is significant because it will create an inexpensive
      model program for family-system-level interventions for families of children with IDD,
      benefiting parents, siblings and the child with IDD, including evaluations of program
      effectiveness in standing community centers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants in all conditions will include mothers, fathers, TD siblings between 11
             and 17 years old, and individuals with IDD of any age.

          -  Participants must be able to understand and respond to survey questions in English

          -  Parents must be cohabitating, with both participating children living in their home.

          -  Individual with IDD falls into one or more of the following categories: 1) meets
             criteria for an intellectual disability, which would mean a measured IQ of 70-75 or
             lower and a measured Adaptive Functioning score of 70-75 or lower, 2) meets criteria
             for an Autism Spectrum Disorder based on an evaluation using the ADOS-2, SCQ, and
             expert clinical judgment based on DSM-5 ASD criteria, or 3) has a medically verified
             genetic condition (e.g., Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome,
             Angelman syndrome, others) that is generally considered to be a developmental
             disability, and shows cognitive or adaptive functioning deficits (70-75 or below)
             although not necessarily deficits in both categories as would be needed for an
             Intellectual Disability diagnosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Siblings identified as typically developing will be excluded 1) with a score of 10 or
             higher on the SCQ-L, if a subsequent ADOS suggests that they have an ASD diagnosis, or
             2) with a WASI-II score of 75 or lower.
