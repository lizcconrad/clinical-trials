  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cognitive function of
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in chronic schizophrenia patients with tardive
      dyskinesia (TD).

    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial. 60 patients with TD
      were randomly allocated to active (n=30) or sham tDCS groups (n=30). All patients received
      2-mA anodal left/cathodal right prefrontal tDCS treatment (fifteen 30-minutes sessions:
      Monday to Friday once daily, every other week to do a group of treatment). Abnormal
      Involuntary Movements Scale (AIMS), Tardive Dyskinesia Rating Scale (TDRS), Assessment of
      Negative Symptoms(SANS), the Positive and Negative symptom scale(PANSS), and the Cambridge
      Neuropsychological Test Automatic Battery (CANTAB) were assessed in patients. All evaluations
      were scored at baseline, the end of 3rd weeks, 5th weeks, and 7th weeks. Side effects of tDCS
      were assessed with an experimenter-administered open-ended questionnaire during the whole
      experiment.

    <masking_description>This study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled clinical trial.All patients received 2-mA anodal left/cathodal right prefrontal tDCS treatment (fifteen 30-minutes sessions: Monday to Friday once daily, every other week to do a group of treatment). All evaluations were performed at baseline, the end of 3rd weeks, 5th weeks, and 7th weeks by 2 psychiatrists blinded to the treatment assigned.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline AIMS(items1-7) total scores at 3 weeks and 5 weeks and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure was the severity of TD symptoms, which was measured by the AIMS total score(the sum of items 1-7).The range for subscale scores(items1-7) is between 0-28 scores and the higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tardive Dyskinesia Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline TDRS total scores at 3 weeks and 5 weeks and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of TD symptoms were also measured by the total TDRS score and the orofacial dyskinesia subscale scores, trunk and limb dyskinesia subscale scores. The range for TDRS total score is between 44-264 scores and the orofacial dyskinesia subscale scores are between16-96 scores , the trunk and limb dyskinesia subscale scores are between 24-144 scores.The higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Safety and Tolerabilit</measure>
    <time_frame>We assessed the side affects during and after tDCS.</time_frame>
    <description>Side effects of tDCS were assessed with an experimenter-administered open-ended questionnaire during the whole experiment. The questionnaire contained rating scales regarding the presence and severity of headache, difficulties in concentrating, acute mood changes, visual perceptual changes and any discomforting sensation like pain, tingling, itching or burning under the electrodes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline SANS total scores at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Negative symptoms were assessed with SANS. The range for SANS total scores is between 0-120 scores and the higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative symptom scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline PANSS total scores at 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Psychopathology was measured by the total PANSS score and the positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscale scores. The range for PANSS total score is between 30-210 scores and the positive subscale scores are between 7-49 scores and the negative subscale scores are between 7-49 scores and the general psychopathology total scores are between 16-112 scores.</description>

    <measure>Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automatic Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline cognitive function at 3 weeks and 5 weeks and 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient was given a series of computerized tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The language-independent tests and touch screen technology deliver rapid and non-invasive cognitive assessment. Executive and memory function were assessed with the following three tasks:The Pattern Recognition Memory (PRM), Intra/Extradimensional Set Shift (IED), and Spatial Working Memory.</description>
