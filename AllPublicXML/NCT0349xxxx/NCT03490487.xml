    <textblock>
      Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes is the most common type of focal epilepsy in
      children. It is known to be age-dependent and presumably genetic. Age of onset ranges from
      one to fourteen years and it represents fifteen percent to twenty five percent of epilepsy in
      children under 15 years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generally, Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes is characterized by infrequent focal
      sensorimotor seizures in the face during sleep, which may secondarily generalize, along with
      spike-wave discharges, reflecting nonlesional cortical excitability from rolandic regions.

      The prognosis is usually considered to be excellent. Over the past years, however, some
      investigators have questioned whether Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes is indeed
      benign, considering the variety of different presentations associated with the disorder.It is
      not uncommon for Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes to be associated with
      neuropsychological deficits, such as linguistic, cognitive, and behavioral impairment. In
      particular, reading difficulties and speech/language disorders are more common in children
      with Benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes than in healthy controls.Various
      neuropsychological deficits seem to be very dependent on the spike index, as well as the
      predominant localization of epileptiform discharges.Furthermore, the frequency of
      epileptiform discharges is closely related not only to the degree of neuropsychological
      deficits, but also to an atypical evolution of benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes.

      The high comorbid prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy
      suggests that there is a bidirectional relationship between these disorders .Cognitive
      impairment and attention problems are particularly crucial issues in children with epilepsy
      who are in a vigorous phase of neurodevelopment.

      Resolution of continuous spike-and-wave during sleep had been achieved with conventional
      antiepileptic drugs including ethosuximide, valproic acid, levetiracetam, and sulthiame. When
      these agents fail to normalize the EEG, a trial with second-line agents such as steroids or
      high-dose diazepam is attempted.

    <description>follow up Electroencephalography and calculation of spike-wave index before and after three months of treatment with diazepam and steroid.Any reduction in spike wave index on electroencephalograph after receiving diazepam or steroid will be considered improvement.The EEG technicians will be requested to perform a prolonged daytime nap EEG. The researcher first will look at the full sleep recording and visually pick the epoch with the highest spike density. The counting start with a page of a high spike density and continued for 10 consecutive minutes. Each page will be scored separately. Each second which contained spikes, either focal or generalized, will be considered positive, and the total number of positive seconds per page will be calculated as percents of the whole page. At the end of the counting, an average of 60 pages (10 min) will be performed and then displayed in terms of the nearest ten percentile number.</description>
