    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending dose of
      Y-2 sublingual tablets in healthy male and female adult subjects. The secondary objective is
      to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics of Y-2 sublingual tablets in healthy male
      and female adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, single ascending dose study in healthy male and female
      subjects. A total of 24 subjects, 4 cohorts of 6 subjects each, will be enrolled in this
      study. All of the 6 subjects in each cohort will receive a single dose of Y-2 sublingual
      tablet on a single occasion. Prior to taking the drug and after taking the drug at 5 min to
      24 h, venous blood from all subjects will be collected at different time points for PK
      analysis. After dosing, safety and tolerability data for each cohort will be evaluated.

             longer or participated in the early cohorts of the current study. Factors other than
             the half-life of the compound, such as accumulation of tissue, muscle or organ, should

             signs and symptoms of coagulation and clotting disorders, cardiac conditions),
             psychiatric, psychological, familial or geographical condition that, in the judgment
             of the investigator, may interfere with the planned staging, treatment and follow-up,
             affect subject compliance or place the subject at high risk from treatment-related
             complications.
