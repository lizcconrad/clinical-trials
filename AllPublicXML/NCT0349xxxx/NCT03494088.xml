    <textblock>
      This study's primary aim is to explore the potential differences in the gut mycobiome of
      children with autism spectrum disorder compared to otherwise healthy children. The secondary
      objective of this study is to evaluate whether the presence of specific species of fungi
      (e.g. Candida tropicalis, C. albicans, or Saccharomyces cerevisiae), in stool: 1) correlates
      with increased gastrointestinal symptoms; 2) correlates with evidence of increased behavioral
      problems (as assessed by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist or Social Responsiveness Scale-2);
      or 3) plays the same role as a constituent of commensal gut microflora as in normal controls.
      The scale indicates severity of social deficits in the autism spectrum as mild, moderate or
      severe. Additionally, the study aims to compare the fecal and oral fungi in these children
      because many fecal mycobiota are felt to originate in the oropharynx.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  for autistic children with GI symptoms: confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum
             disorder (ASD) and its severity (DSM-5: 299.00) by Autism Diagnostic Interview
             (ADI-R), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and Autism Diagnostic Observation
             SChedule-2 (ADOS-2); substantial gastrointestinal symptoms (as indicated by score of
             greater than 7 on the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Severity Index)

          -  for autistic children without GI symptoms: confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum
             disorder (ASD) and its severity (DSM-5: 299.00) by Autism Diagnostic Interview
             (ADI-R), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and Autism Diagnostic Observation
             SChedule-2 (ADOS-2)

          -  for controls: healthy children

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  severe sensory impairment

          -  brain injury

          -  major psychiatric illness (e.g., psychotic disorders that might interfere with
             assessment). (however, children with common psychological problems such as depression
             and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder will not be excluded, given that doing so
             would result in a sample of children with ASD that would be unrepresentative of the
             pediatric ASD population as a whole.)- children who appear genetically syndromic
             (based on exam in the pediatric GI clinic)

          -  taking immunosuppressive medications

          -  abnormal screening labs

          -  GI diseases

          -  allergy to antibiotics

          -  fever or a pre-existing adverse event monitored in the study

          -  known history of hepatitis B/C or HIV

          -  known pregnancy

          -  use of probiotics in the last 60 d

          -  use of oral antibiotics/anti-fungal during the previous 2 weeks

          -  indwelling catheters/prosthetic devices
