  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is the identification and quantification of the main bacterial
      communities present in the endometrial microbiota in obese infertile patients, to assess if
      there is an alteration of their composition dependent on the body mass index, and if such
      alteration it could influence the reduction of endometrial receptivity, demonstrated in obese
      women. If obese patients have an altered digestive microbiota and, at the same time, a lower
      endometrial receptivity, the investigator want to assess whether such reduction in
      receptivity may depend on an alteration in the endometrial microbiota, which in non-obese
      infertile patients has been shown to negatively influence the reproductive results

      The main objective of our study is to compare the composition of the endometrial microbiota
      between patients with normal weight and patients with obesity.

      A. Secondary Objectives/research questions

        -  To analyze the composition of the digestive microbiota through samples of saliva and
           feces in infertile patients with normal weight and obesity.

        -  To assess whether there is a relationship between the body mass index (normal weight,
           obesity Class I, Class II, Class III) and the main bacterial species detected in
           endometrial fluid samples from infertile patients.

        -  To evaluate the influence of the digestive microbiota on the composition of the
           endometrial microbiota according to the body mass index in infertile patients.

        -  To evaluate if there is an influence of the endometrial microbiota on the results of
           endometrial receptivity analyzed with the non-invasive Endometrial Receptivity Array
           test (niERA)

             or intramural myomas&gt; 4 cm that deform cavity, endometrial polyps or Müllerian
             anomalies, or adnexal as communicating hydrosalpinx).
