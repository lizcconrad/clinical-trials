    <textblock>
      A phase 1 study examining the combination of Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and Trabectedin in various
      solid tumor types. The study seeks to determine a safe dose of the combination of study drugs
      and then examine this dose in larger groups of patients of specific tumor types to evaluate
      its anti-tumor efficacy. Treatment will continue in patients who respond for up to 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include dose escalation and dose expansion phases.

      In the dose escalation portion, patients with advanced cancer will be enrolled and treated
      with Durvalumab and Trabectedin. Durvalumab will be administered at the same dose in each
      dose escalation cohort, while the dose of Trabectedin will be progressively increased in
      different cohorts until the safest dose of the combination is determined.

      In the dose expansion portion patients will be treated with the safest dose of the study
      drugs determined during the dose escalation phase. There will be two separate groups of
      patients treated at this dose to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy of the combination. One group
      will consist of non-small-cell lung cancer patients previously treated with PD-1 or PD-L1
      inhibitors and another group will consist of an immunotherapy naive group of patients. This
      immunotherapy naive group of patients will include sarcoma and another tumor type, this other
      tumor type will be determined based on anti-tumor efficacy seen during the dose escalation.

      The study drugs will be given intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue for up to
      one year or until disease progression.

             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, substantially increase
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written
             informed consent.

         15. Cirrhosis of any Child Pugh class

         16. Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%

             after treatment to the brain metastases. These imaging scans should both be obtained
             at least four weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial progression). In
             addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result of the brain
             metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be stable either, without the use
             of steroids, or are stable on a steroid dose of ≤10mg/day of prednisone or its

             local practice), hepatitis B (HBsAg positive), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency
             virus (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection
             (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HbsAg)

             polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV RNA.

         22. Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study
             drugs. Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving

             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control (as
