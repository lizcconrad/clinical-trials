  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is a common diagnosed and treated condition in private practices of
      primary health care. There is growing evidence that atherosclerotic plaques as predictors for
      stroke and heart attack are more prevalent than expected based on the clinical score in
      people with low risk for stroke and heart attack .

      Diagnosing atherosclerotic plaques can help to decide if a lipid lowering therapy should be
      prescribed even if the clinical risk score is low or on the other hand if they can be
      observed even in high lipid levels.

      Both common and proximal internal carotid arteries and both common femoral arteries
      (including bifurcations) were screened by ultrasound in patients who came for a check-up to a
      primary care practice with no known cardiovascular disease and low risk for stroke and heart
      attack according to the AGLA/GSLA risk score which is mostly used in Switzerland.

      All patients agreed and gave written informed consent to be included in this study. Presence
      of plaques was defined as a focal carotid intima-media thickness &gt;0.5 cm on ultrasound.
      Screening was performed by a medical doctor (DP) certified for the procedure using the
      following ultrasound system: Toshiba Nemio XG, probe 7.5 MhZ.

        The carotid and femoral arteries of 22 asymptomatic patients (9 females,13 males) aged
        between 41-72 having a low cardiovascular risk score based on blood pressure, nicotine
        abuse history, cardiac family history, blood analysis in fasting state for diabetes, lipid
        status including total cholesterol HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and calculated
        LDL-cholesterol were screened by ultrasound.
