      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single and multiple dosing, dose escalation
      phase I clinical trial to investigate the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics of HY209
      gel after transdermal administration in healthy male volunteers as a possible treatment
      option for atopic dermatitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A composition containing G Protein Coupled Receptor 19(GPCR19) agonist HY209 and a derivative
      thereof is found to have a considerable effect in the treatment of atopic dermatitis and is
      proposed as a pharmaceutical ingredient for prevention, treatment and improvement of atopic
      dermatitis. The GPCR19 agonist, HY209, is superior to conventional steroid ointment and
      immunosuppressant ointment in the treatment and improvement of allergic dermatitis. It
      directly reduces the amount of serum immunoglobulin E, which is a major factor of allergic
      dermatitis, It increases the T helper type 1(TH1) cytokines that alleviate allergic
      dermatitis pathologies, reduces the T helper type 2(TH2) cytokines that aggravate allergic
      dermatitis pathologies, and reduces the infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils and
      neutrophils into the dermal cells. Thus it can be utilized as a therapeutic drug composition
      for atopic dermatitis.
