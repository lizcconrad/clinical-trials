  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the verification of Cloud-DX Vitaliti™ Continuous Automated
      Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitor for Clinical Use and Self Measurement according to
      standards laid out by IEEE Std 1708 and AAMI-ISO 81060-2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several automated vital sign measurement systems have been developed recently; however,
      non-invasive continuous blood pressure monitoring continues to be a major limitation. To
      circumvent the limitations of current systems of interval hemodynamic measurement and
      increasing demands on health care providers, a non-invasive automated continuous vital sign
      monitor that can integrate into hospital early warning systems and warn health care providers
      of deteriorating vital sign parameters would be of significant value and a major advance for
      current hospital monitoring systems.

      Cloud-DX Vitaliti™ is a new low profile automated vital sign monitor, which includes a
      continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurement system. Additional parameters are also
      measured. Paired with companion software from cloud based computing, Vitaliti™ features a
      user friendly interface, onboard radios for communication with smartphones/tablets/personal
      computers, and several sensors.

      Cloud-DX Vitaliti™ has undergone preliminary testing and is now ready for verification to
      achieve compliance with AAMI/ISO and IEEE standards of medical grade device. At the Hamilton
      General Hospital (HGH), Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and Vascular Surgical
      Step Down Units, arterial catheters are standard of care and performed on most patients for
      variable periods of post-operative recovery. Within this setting, the IEEE Std 1708 and
      AAMI-ISO 81060-2 would be fully met. Furthermore, the cardiovascular surgical caseloads at
      HGH would provide sufficient test subjects to validate VitalitiTM in a timely fashion.
