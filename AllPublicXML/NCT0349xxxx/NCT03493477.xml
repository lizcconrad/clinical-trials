  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate gingival biotypes and width of keratinized gingiva in
      the anterior region of adults with abnormal skeletal jaw relations.

      This study will include consecutive adult patients seeking orthodontic treatment with
      skeletal Class II and Class III jaw relations based on clinical and cephalometric values.
      Each group will be further divided according to their vertical skeletal pattern. Gingival
      biotype will be determined -using the probe transparency method- into either thick or thin
      biotype for all anterior teeth in both jaws. Width of keratinized gingiva will be measured
      from the muco-gingival junction to the free gingival margin in the middle of the crown of the
      maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth using a digital caliper with a sensitivity of 0.01
      mm. Statistical analysis will be applied to see the correlation between gingival biotypes ,
      width of keratinized gingiva , and abnormal skeletal jaw relations.

    <description>Gingival biotype will be determined using the probe transparency method, in which probing is done in the sulcus at the mid facial aspect of maxillary and mandibular incisors and canines by a periodontal probe. Gingival thickness will be classified as thin when the underlying periodontal probe outline can be seen through the gingiva; otherwise, it will be considered thick. Results of the twelve anterior teeth will be recorded for each patient in a tabulated form. Statistical Analysis will be done to detect the correlation between gingival biotypes (Thick or thin ) and abnormal sagittal skeletal jaw relation ( skeletal class II or skeletal class III 9</description>
