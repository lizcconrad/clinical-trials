  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well fludeoxyglucose F-18 - positron emission tomography (PET) works
      in planning radiation therapy in participants with early non-small cell lung cancer, early
      stage lung cancer, or cancer that has spread to lungs from other parts of the body. Using PET
      in addition to the standard computed tomography to plan radiation therapy for cancer may help
      doctors to maximize the dose to the cancer and minimize the dose to normal tissues.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To determine the maximum inter-fraction variability of fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18-F FDG)-PET
      activity of thoracic tumor treatment volumes through a 5-fraction stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) course as it relates to the planning feasibility of emission-guided radiation
      therapy, or biologically-guided radiation therapy (BgRT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare similar inter-fraction variability of FDG-PET activity for non-thoracic SBRT
      target volumes for the purpose of determining the feasibility of BgRT.

      II. To compare dosimetric endpoints for primary tumor coverage and dose to organs at risk
      between conventional SBRT planning and simulated BgRT, or emission-guided radiation therapy
      planning for thoracic and non-thoracic targets.

      III. To compare dosimetry for primary tumor coverage and dose to organs at risk between
      adaptive cone beam computed tomography (CT) planning, and simulated adaptive emission-guided
      radiation therapy (BgRT) planning for thoracic and non-thoracic targets.

      IV. To compare variability of 18-F FDG-PET in patients undergoing immunotherapy
      simultaneously during SBRT, or within 4 weeks of SBRT treatment with patients undergoing SBRT
      but not receiving immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive fludeoxyglucose F-18 intravenously (IV) and after 60 minutes undergo PET
      within 4 weeks of the first planned SBRT fraction, prior to the second planned fraction, and
      prior to the fifth planned fraction.
