  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kingston General Hospital is committed to upgrading the surgical treatment platform for
      benign prostate surgery. Vaporization Surgery, either laser-vaporization or
      electo-vaporization is becoming a &quot;standard&quot; of therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia
      rather than the traditional transurethral resection of the prostate. However many Canadian
      hospitals have been slow to adopt an updated program because of evolving competing technology
      systems as well as unknown cost, efficacy, complication and patient/surgeon satisfaction
      considerations. KGH has been recognized as a centre of excellence in evaluating medical
      therapy for BPH and studies from the institution have impacted BPH care nationally and
      abroad. Laser and other state of the art BPH surgical technologies are being purchased by
      Ontario hospitals, including the local area, with no prospective assessment process. Kingston
      is uniquely advantaged to undertake a randomized comparative study of two of the most
      promising technology platforms because the investigators have the experience and expertise to
      perform the study in a hospital and surgeon naive institution.

      The investigators propose to directly compare two vaporization techniques, laser and plasma
      vaporization systems. The investigators will be able to answer the most important questions
      in technology introduction and technique into our hospital system - cost, efficacy, safety
      and satisfaction. The results will inform KGH (and other similar Ontario centres) on the
      advantage or not (financial and patient care related) of investing in a BPH state of the art
      vaporization technology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To comparatively evaluate two state of the art vaporization techniques for transurethral
      prostatectomy, the Clarion Evolve Laser Vaporization System and the Olympus TURis Plasma
      Vaporization (&quot;button&quot; electrode) system. Both systems are approved for use by Health Canada
      for vaporization surgery of the prostate. Both techniques involve a vaporization ablation
      (laser and plasma mechanism respectively) of the prostate, rather than sequential excision
      (or cutting) of the prostate performed with our traditional TURP technique. Compared to a
      TURP, both of the two study techniques involve similar endoscopic access to the prostate,
      similar anesthetic requirements, similar post-operative catheterization but appear to differ
      in blood loss (less with vaporization techniques), hospital stay (inpatient stay for TURP
      compared to outpatient discharge for study techniques) and patient recovery (improved with
      proposed techniques).

      The laser vaporization uses a dual wavelength (980 and 1470 nm) diode laser with a fibre that
      allows for contact vaporization ablation of the prostate. The hospital already uses a Clarion
      laser system for urinary stone lithotripsy. Clarion will provide the necessary equipment for
      this platform for the duration of the trial. The plasma vaporization uses a bipolar high
      frequency generator for vaporization and coagulation. The procedure is performed using a
      near-contact hovering technique and the tissue removal process is performed in a similar
      fashion as TURP. The hospital has recently purchased the Olympus platform and the extra
      equipment required for this study will be provided by Olympus for the study. These technology
      systems will be compared in a randomized single blinded controlled study in a &quot;technology
      naive&quot; hospital with &quot;technology naive&quot; surgeons. The primary outcome will be cost with
      satisfaction, efficacy, learning curve and safety as key outcomes.
