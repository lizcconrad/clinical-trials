  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating participants with B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoproliferative diseases that have not been treated. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To gain a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of pembrolizumab as monotherapy for
      patients with untreated indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoproliferative diseases (iBCL) based
      on overall response rate (ORR) measured at the end of a 6-cycle treatment period.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab in patients with untreated
      iBCL.

      II. To measure the efficacy of pembrolizumab used as monotherapy for patients with untreated
      iBCL by assessing clinical outcomes including complete response rate (CR), time to next
      therapy (TNT), progression-free survival (PFS), and the duration of response (DOR).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days and then up to
      5 years.
