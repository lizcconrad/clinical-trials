      Objectives: The aim of the study was to compare histological and histomorphometric results of
      six bone substitute materials used as graft in two-stage maxillary sinus augmentation model,
      after 6-month-healing.

      Materials and Methods:

      A two-stage sinus augmentation was carried out in six patients using mineralized
      solvent-dehydrated bone allograft (MCBA), freeze-dried mineralized bone allograft (FDBA),
      anor-ganic bovine bone (ABB), equine-derived bone (EB); synthetic micromacroporous biphasic
      calcium-phosphate block consisting of 70% beta-tricalcium phosphate and 30% hydroxyap-atite
      (HA-β-TCP 30/70), or bioapatite-collagen (BC).

    <time_frame>6 month-healing after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>After 6 months clinical and radiographic examinations were undertaken and each patient was reappointed for biopsy at the time of implant placement in the same location. Under local anesthesia, a full thickness flap was raised, a biopsy was performed using a 3.5 mm tre-phine bur under sterile saline solution irrigation, guided by the radiographic/surgical template in the selected implant site. A total of six bone samples was retrieved from the occlusal aspect to the alveolar crest, one from each augmented site to compare histologically and histomorphometrically the different materials.</description>
