  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and related metabolic diseases have become a chronic disease that is a threat to
      human health. Bariatric surgery can effectively and long-term reduce excess body weight and
      relieve related metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Laparoscopic gastric bypass
      surgery and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy are commonly used in bariatric surgery.
      Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy due to simple operation, good weight loss, and metabolic
      disease control effect, which is more widely used. However, there are several studies that
      show an increased chance of gastroesophageal reflux disease after laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy. Long-term gastroesophageal reflux may lead to Barrett's esophagus or esophageal
      cancer. Nowadays, the cause of gastroesophageal reflux disease after sleeve gastrectomy is
      not clear and precautionary measures are not precise.

      In this study, prospective randomized controlled trials were conducted to explore the
      possible causes of gastroesophageal reflux after sleeve gastrectomy and to explore ways to
      prevent gastroesophageal reflux disease after sleeve gastrectomy.

      With the social development and changes in the lifestyle, the incidence of obesity and type
      2diabetes is rapidly increasing. In 2010, the global incidence of type 2 diabetes was 8.3% in
      adults, 11.6% in China and 50.1% in China. In overweight and obese people, the prevalence of
      type 2 diabetes also increased significantly, and the prevalence of type 2diabetes in those
      people with BMI&gt; 30 reached 18.5-23%. Diabetes-induced cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      diseases, renal insufficiency and other complications, seriously affecting the quality of
      life of the patients, endangering the safety of life, the treatment of type 2 diabetes and
      related complications to public health expenditure has brought tremendous pressure.

      Traditional medical methods are difficult to achieve long-term and effective control of type
      2 diabetes. Surgery has been shown to achieve 75-95% long-term relief of obesity in patients.
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, RYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy
      are most commonly used. Among them, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is relatively simple, low
      incidence of complications, lower operating costs, and gradually become the most important
      surgical methods of weight loss and metabolic disease surgery. Numerous clinical studies are
      shown that sleeve gastrectomy in patients with type 2 diabetes has the same therapeutic
      effect as gastric bypass with a complete remission rate of 70-90% for T2DM.

      For the choice of surgical approach, numerous studies have shown that BMI ≧ 45, the general
      choice of gastric bypass surgery, BMI &lt;45, participants can choose sleeve gastrectomy. The
      remission rate for T2DM, sleeve gastrectomy has a good result for young patients with shorter
      duration. In China, the BMI less than 45 is majorities.

      According to the previous survey in 2012, the newly diagnosed diabetes patients in China
      constituted more than half of all diabetic patients. Since laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is
      relatively simple, so sleeve gastrectomy is easier to popularize in China and has wide
      application prospect.

      As an invasive treatment, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy also presents opportunities of
      surgery-related complications, including gastric leak (0.5-1%), stenosis (0.1-0.5%), bleeding
      (about 0.5%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Gastroesophageal reflux disease is
      a most common upper gastrointestinal disease, numerous clinical studies shown that the
      incidence of GERD in western populations are 10-20%, while obese people are around 37-72%, if
      abdominal fat accumulation more obvious, the incidence of GERD will become higher. In China,
      there is still no relevant data. Gastric bypass surgery has a clear effect on the treatment
      of GERD, and the relationship between sleeve gastrectomy and GERD is still controversial.
      Some studies have shown that sleeve gastrectomy did not increase the incidence of
      postoperative GERD, while another study showed that the incidence of GERD after sleeve
      gastrectomy increased significantly. In addition, no studies have revealed the reasons for
      the occurrence of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy and no study showed how to prevent the
      occurrence of GERD after sleeve gastrectomy.
