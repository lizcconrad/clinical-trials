  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 4-week
      mindfulness training program for adults with chronic pain (noncancer related). The
      intervention is based on the MIndfulness-based Stress Reduction Program, an 8-week
      mindfulness training program developed to help people manage stress-related and chronic
      conditions. The adapted mindfulness intervention will consist of four, weekly 1 hour and 30
      minute group sessions that are modified from the original program to fit the shorter length
      and to directly address chronic pain management. Participants will complete pre- and
      post-intervention surveys and daily mindfulness practice diaries, all online. The surveys
      will help us determine if participants experience decreased pain interference, increased
      quality-of-life, and increased psychological well-being over the course of the intervention.
      Participants will also complete a post-intervention telephone interview to help determine
      satisfaction with the intervention and areas where the intervention can be improved.
