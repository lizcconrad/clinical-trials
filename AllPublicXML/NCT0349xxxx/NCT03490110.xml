  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some of the most common, persistent, and disabling consequences of traumatic brain injury
      affect an individual's ability to achieve personal goals. Interventions that strengthen
      abilities such as being able to concentrate, remember, stay calm and overcome challenges,
      could have far reaching benefits for Veterans. One challenge in rehabilitation is that
      response to training can be highly variable, and a better understanding of the neural bases
      for this variability could inform care. This project will test whether changes in markers of
      the brain's electrical activity (using the non-invasive technique of electroencephalograms,
      EEG) can explain differences in responses to skill training.

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) can impair cognitive functioning long after the initial
      trauma. Some of the most common, persistent, and disabling consequences of traumatic brain
      injury are deficits in higher order cognitive functions that direct more basic processes
      based on an individual's goals. Symptoms such as distractibility and difficulty holding
      goal-relevant information in memory can affect achievement of personal and professional
      goals. These cognitive problems can be exacerbated by post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms,
      commonly observed in the Veteran population. Interventions that strengthen goal-directed
      control functions, such as the selection of relevant information along with inhibition of
      distracting information, could have far reaching benefits for Veterans.

      One challenge in rehabilitation is that response to training can be highly variable, and a
      better understanding of the neural bases for this variability could inform patient care.
      Investigators have developed a system for training neurocognitive skills that can be used in
      rehabilitation neuroscience studies to elucidate the neural bases of improvements in
      cognitive functioning. The training system is designed to help patients improve goal-directed
      brain state regulation, and preliminary work has investigated brain network parameters that
      may predict response to training. Electroencephalography (EEG) potentially provides easily
      accessible markers for the neural bases of improvements with training.

      Objectives in this pilot study are to investigate the potential of EEG markers to: (1)
      explain differential responses to attention regulation training; and (2) predict subsequent
      responses to training.

    <description>A composite score will be computed from standardized neurocognitive measurements of performance on attention and executive functioning. The investigators create a composite measure of complex attention and executive functions using the neurocognitive measures listed below. Performance on each measure is scored using populations norms; these scores are then standardized (Z-scored) and averaged to create a composite (aggregate) outcome (the unit measure being Z-score).

    <measure>Network modularity from EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8, after the intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>EEG will be collected during a focused rest condition. Network modularity will be estimated from a matrix of connections between electrodes based on phase coherence, a unit-less measure of correlation between phase angles of EEG signals in the theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range. The modularity metric reflects the strength of modular network organization by summing the difference between the fraction of within-module connections to the total fraction of connections across modules, thus ranging from 0 (random) to 1 (completely modular). Change in network modularity will be analyzed for this data as change from before to after the intervention period.</description>

    <description>This arm utilizes a training system designed to strengthen cognitive-emotional state regulation skills. Trainees practice skills across a range of challenge contexts, and coaches guide learning for success in applying skills to challenges in personal life. Digital scenarios provide experiential learning opportunities, allowing Veterans to apply skills to tackle challenges that are calibrated to maximize learning. Coaches focus efforts on generalizing the skills to help trainees apply the skills in other life settings.</description>
