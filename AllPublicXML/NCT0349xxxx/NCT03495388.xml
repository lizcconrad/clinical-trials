  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, in the U.S. alone, &gt;6 million children undergo painful surgery; up to 50% of them
      experience significant and serious side effects with opioids and inadequate pain relief.
      Though 60% of this inter-individual variability in responses results from genetic variations,
      there is an almost complete lack of understanding of how specific genetic variability affects
      pain and of the adverse effects of opioids, especially in children. In this project the
      investigators will focus on oxycodone, a standard and preferred post-surgical oral analgesic
      in children

      The purpose of this research is to study serious immediate and long-term clinical problems
      from both surgical pain and oxycodone use in children and adolescents to improve the safety
      and effectiveness of surgical pain relief.

      The long-term goals are to improve the safety and effectiveness of surgical pain relief with
      opioids (a class of drugs/pain relievers) and to minimize the societal burden of disabling
      Chronic Persistent Surgical Pain (CPSP, which is pain that persists even after the expected
      healing time from surgery) and Opioid Dependence (OD) by preoperative risk predictions and
      personalized care with the right dose of the right pain medication for each child.

      The overall objective is to determine the impact of risk factors on oxycodone's immediate and
      long-term negative postoperative outcomes and to personalize dosing in children undergoing
      outpatient and major inpatient surgery.

      Research procedures will include:

        1. Pre-operative blood draw for genotyping candidate genes and exploratory genes and for
           future similar studies will be collected.

        2. Standardized pre-, intra-, and post-operative care will be received by all participants.
           The study team will record medical history, demographic information, concomitant
           medications, vitals, pain scores, post-operative nausea and vomiting, and all
           medications given post-surgery for pain management throughout the participants
           in-patient stay.

        3. Psychological questionnaires to assess pain, risk of developing OD and chronic pain,
           anxiety and depression will be administered pre-operatively, and 48-72 hours, 7-14 days,
           2 months, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively.

        4. Quantitative Sensory Testing will be performed on up to 100 participants
           pre-operatively, and 48-72 hours,3 months and 12 months post-operatively.

        5. Serial blood draws for oxycodone and methadone pharmacokinetic modeling will be
           collected from up to 200 participants. QTc measurements will also be recorded from pre-
           and post-operative EKGs for those participants in which methadone pharmacokinetic blood
           samples are collected.
