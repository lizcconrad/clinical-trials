      Individuals on dialysis due to kidney failure have very prescriptive diets. These diets help
      increase dialysis effectiveness and help patients control blood levels of electrolytes
      including potassium and phosphate, acid-base balance, blood pressure, and fluid between
      dialysis treatments. However, patient compliance with these diets often can be very low, and
      one reason for this low compliance is disguesia (abnormal taste sensations) which can make
      the diets unpalatable. This experiment tests the hypothesis that disguesia, and subsequent
      lack of adherence to a dialysis friendly diet, is a result of either vascular taste (tasting
      your own blood through the basolateral side of taste cells) or altered chemical composition
      of saliva in between dialysis appointments. However, to study these hypotheses, data are
      needed on the types of substances that may contribute to the disguesia. Substances for which
      the concentration is influenced by kidney function (in healthy people) or dialysis (in
      patients) are the prime candidates for the disguesia under our hypotheses. Thus, this
      experiment tests whether taste or flavours experienced from sodium, calcium, potassium,
      creatinine, urea, phosphates, glutamate, and iron may be related to altered taste experienced
      by patients on dialysis.

      A. Background:

      Individuals on dialysis due to kidney failure have very prescriptive diets. These diets help
      increase dialysis effectiveness and help patients control blood levels of electrolytes
      including potassium and phosphate, acid-base balance, blood pressure, and fluid between
      dialysis treatments. However, patient compliance with these diets is often very low, and one
      reason for this low compliance is disguesia (abnormal taste sensations) which can make the
      diets unpalatable. The investigators hypothesize this disguesia, and subsequent lack of
      adherence to a dialysis friendly diet, is a result of either vascular taste (tasting one's
      own blood through the basolateral side of taste cells) or altered chemical composition of
      saliva in between dialysis appointments. However, to study these hypotheses, data are needed
      on the types of substances that may contribute to the disguesia. Substances for which the
      concentration is influenced by kidney function (in healthy people) or dialysis (in patients)
      are the prime candidates for the disguesia under our hypotheses.

      B. Objectives:

      The investigators will study how dialysis patients perceive sodium, calcium, potassium,
      creatinine, urea, phosphate, glutamate (umami taste), and iron solutions, and whether
      alterations in saliva may contribute to altered sensations from these compounds. These
      solutions will be used to:

        1. Determine whether dialysis patients recognize the flavour of specific stimuli as similar
           to the disguesias experienced between dialysis treatments.

        2. Determine if the intensity of the flavour from these solutions is more or less intense
           at the beginning of dialysis compared to the end.

        3. Determine if patients' ratings for the solutions differ from healthy, control
           individuals.

        4. Determine if saliva of patients contains different concentrations of analytes such as
           sodium, potassium, creatinine, urea, phosphates, iron, or glutamates from healthy
           controls.

        5. Determine if concentrations of these analytes in saliva decrease over the course of
           dialysis treatment.

    <description>Assess effect of dialysis on taste perceptions of solutions via sensory questionnaire. The scale used will be a generalized visual analog scale, which will ask participants about the intensity and hedonic quality of the sensations experienced. The scale ranges from 0 to 100 and are rated by the individuals when tasting the samples.</description>

    <description>Inclusion Criteria:
Patient's undergoing hemodialysis.
Male and female of any race
18 years/ older.
Those with dysphagia were excluded.
In both participant groups, before each tasting protocol commences, sterile cotton dental rolls will be placed in the participant's mouth. This will be used to collect a saliva sample and determine salivary flow.
Tasting Protocol: The hemodialysis patients will taste each solutions twice, both before and after their dialysis session. An sensory questionnaire and an open ended comment box will be given for participants to type in other words to describe the sensations.
In dialysis patients only, blood will be drawn pre and post dialysis for serum ion concentrations.</description>

    <description>Inclusion Criteria
No tongue, lip, or cheek piercings
Over 18 years of age
Normal taste and smell function
No known issues with salivation or dry mouth
Willing to comply with study protocol (taste samples and provide saliva)
The above protocol will be mimicked in the healthy control group. The only difference is that instead of a pre/post dialysis tastings, the control population will have a 2-4 hour gap in between tastings in order to follow the approximate time-frame of the dialysis patients. Finally they will not be required to provide blood samples.</description>
