  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether statin therapy can help prevent recurrence of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in transplant recipients who had liver transplantation for
      HCC. Multiple logistic regression analysis will be performed to evaluate the association
      between statin therapy and the risk of HCC recurrence after LT.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>A new lesion with radiographic features compatible with HCC was defined as recurrence of HCC.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to December, 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Usually, liver CT is performed at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and every year until 5 years after surgery. Afterwards, liver CT is performed at 2-year intervals. Measurement of blood tumor markers [AFP and prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence-II] is performed every month for 6 months after discharge from the hospital and every 3 months thereafter. Additional liver CT, liver magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography-CT is performed when elevated tumor markers or suspicious lesions were noted. A new lesion with radiographic features compatible with HCC is defined as recurrence of HCC based on the reports of specialist in radiology.</description>
