  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants are those who are members of the general surgery residency pediatric
      gastroenterology fellowship, and adult gastroenterology fellowship. Through a
      randomized-controlled trial, participants will fill out a baseline set of demographic
      information including year of training, approximate number of colonoscopies to date,
      specialty, age, sex and handedness. Participation in this activity is completely voluntary.
      Trainees will be randomized to one of two groups. Either first participating in an unassisted
      colonoscopy module twice and then taking a questionnaire and then transitioning to a
      supervised/coached colonoscopy module session twice and taking a questionnaire, versus the
      reverse, in which the participant first partakes in a supervised/coached colonoscopy module
      session twice and then transitions to performing a colonoscopy module twice, unassisted.
      Objective measures will be assessed by the module software and supervising faculty.
      Specifically, using individuals' survey responses to see if early supervision improves survey
      scores. Survey questions focus on student learning, completing module objectives and faculty
      performance in simulation. The survey will also ask subjects to self-rate their scores and
      comfort level with endoscopy skills. Survey responses will not be linked to an individuals'
      performance in their program training and endoscopy coaches will not be made aware of the
      survey responses.

      This will be a randomized controlled trial in which eligible participants will be members of
      the general surgery residency and adult gastroenterology fellowship. Investigators will ask
      all consenting participants to fill out a baseline set of demographic information including
      their year of training, the approximate number of colonoscopies to date, specialty, age, sex
      and dominant-handedness. Additional questions to be asked will inquire about the
      participant's experience in regard to the unassisted and supervision/coached colonoscopy
      module experience. Participation in this activity is completely voluntary, and the
      participating trainee is under no obligation to complete or finish the simulation or
      subsequent surveys The participant will be randomized to one of two groups. A computer
      program will make this random assignment. Neither the participant nor their physician coach
      will be able to choose which group they will be in. Participants will either first partake in
      an unassisted colonoscopy module twice (case one and case two) and then transition to a
      supervised/coached colonoscopy module session twice (case three and case four). The
      alternative is in which the participant first partakes in a supervised/coached colonoscopy
      module session twice (case one and case two) and then transitions to performing an unassisted
      colonoscopy module twice (case three and case four). A questionnaire examining training
      experience will be administered after case # 4 in both groups. This survey will take
      approximately 5 minutes to complete. Other objective measures will be assessed by supervising
      faculty and other metrics acquired through the simulator software. Individuals' survey
      responses will be used to see if early supervision improves trainee satisfaction and
      perceptions on survey scores. Participants will attend one individual training session date
      that will satisfy the designed simulation experience. The trainee can stop participating in
      this study at any time and participation in the study is voluntary and trainees may choose
      not to participate. It is important to note that refusal to participate will not affect a
      learner's access to the training center and will not affect their standing in their
      respective training program. The results will not be included in their official training
      record. Note no prior procedural or technical knowledge is required. Enrollment will continue
      for the 2018-2019 academic year and possibly academic years thereafter.
