  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative transient stress urine leakage following Holmium laser enucleation of the
      prostate is one of the problems that frustrate both surgeon and patients

      Standard HoLEP might be associated with some stretch of the sphincter and de-epithelization
      of the sphincter area anteriorly.

      In Veil preserving HoLEP, early separation of the adenoma from the sphincter ring minimizes
      sphincter stretch. Furthermore, more proximal incision of the 12 O`clock mucosal strip
      sparring a veil of mucosa covering the sphincter ring.

      Our hypothesis is that by this technique the early postoperative transient urine leak would
      be minimized and duration of leakage if anny would be shortened.

      Postoperative transient stress urine leakage following Holmium laser enucleation of the
      prostate is one of the problems that frustrate both surgeon and patients.

      Many reports addressed different variables for the cause of post HoLEP urine leakage. Looking
      for a procedure done by a single surgeon who had tremendous experience of this procedure may
      enable investigators to identify precisely technical points of interest that may affect post
      HoLEP stress urine incontinence.

      Standard HoLEP might be associated with some stretch of the sphincter and de-epithelization
      of the sphincter area anteriorly.

      In Veil preserving HoLEP, early separation of the adenoma from the sphincter ring minimizes
      sphincter stretch. Furthermore, more proximal incision of the 12 O`clock mucosal strip
      sparring a veil of mucosa covering the sphincter ring.

      Investigators` hypothesis is that by this technique the early postoperative transient urine
      leak would be minimized and duration of leakage if any would be shortened.
