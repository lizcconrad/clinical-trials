      This is an exploratory study designed to generate preliminary data in evaluating the efficacy
      of Nucala in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm exploratory study of mepolizumab in the treatment of CSU.
      The primary endpoint will be the mean reduction in the seven day urticaria activity score
      (UAS7) before and after 10 weeks of treatment with mepolizumab. Secondary endpoints will be
      the mean reduction of the urticaria control test (UCT) score and the weekly itch severity
      score (ISS) before and after treatment. Enrollment examination will include a standardized
      history and examination, baseline UCT score, CBC with differential, serum IgE level, chronic
      urticaria index, IgE Fc receptor antibody functional assay, and a 4 mm punch biopsy of
      lesional skin to confirm the urticarial tissue reaction includes eosinophils and is not
      neutrophilic predominant. Patients will discontinue all anti-histamines and start cetirizine
      10 mg PO BID which may be continued throughout the study duration. Patients will be provided
      with a log book to track daily urticaria signs and symptoms in a standardized manner for UAS
      scoring. At week 0 (enrollment visit +7 days), baseline UAS7 and ISS score will be assessed
      and skin biopsy results reviewed. Patients with a confirmatory skin biopsy will receive 200
      mg SC of mepolizumab at week 0,2,4,6,and 8. UAS-7 and weekly ISS score will be calculated at
      week 0, 4, 8, and 10. UCT scoring will be calculated at week 0 and at week 10. Repeat CBC
      with differential, serum IgE level, and measures of basophil serum activation (chronic
      urticaria index, IgE FC Receptor antibody functional assay) will be assessed at week 10.
      Attached to this document is a protocol summary.

    <description>Study participants will document their CSU symptoms using a diary,daily scoring for a) the number of wheals [none (=0 points), &lt;10 (=1 point), 10-50 (=2 points), or &gt;50 per day (=3 points)], and b) the intensity of pruritus [none (=0 points), mild (=1 point), moderate (=2 points), severe (=3 points)]. The daily UAS score is summed over a week to calculate the UAS7 score (range: 0-42).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean reduction in ISS and UCT</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks of treatment with mepolizumab</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly itch severity score is calculated using the pruritus score of the daily UAS score summed over a week (range: 0-21). The urticaria control test (UCT) is a more recently developed and validated outcome instrument to retrospectively assess urticaria control. Each UCT item has 5 answer options scored 0-4 with low points indicating high disease activity and low disease control. The minimum and maximum UCT scores are 0-16 with 16 points indicating complete disease control.</description>
