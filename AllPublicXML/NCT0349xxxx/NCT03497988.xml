    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of intranasal OXT caloric intake and
      eating behaviors in otherwise healthy obese adolescents.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of intranasal administration
      of oxytocin on food intake in obese, pubertal or post-pubertal adolescents (13 to &lt;18 years
      in girls, and 15 to &lt;20 years in boys).

      Participants will undergo a telephone screening and then, within 4 weeks, complete an
      in-person screening visit to determine eligibility. Then, within 4 weeks they will be
      randomized to either OXT or placebo. After a minimum 1-week (7-28 days) &quot;washout,&quot;
      participants will cross-over to treatment with the other condition (i.e., placebo or OXT).

    <measure>Effect of OXT on Eating Behaviors at Mealtime (appetite)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will assess appetite, a visual analog scale (VAS) to quantify participants' self-reported appetite on a linear scale will be used. The range of the VAS is 0% to 100% of the scale, with 0% corresponding to no self-reported appetite, and 100% corresponding to maximal self-reported appetite.</description>

    <measure>Effect of OXT on Eating Behaviors at Mealtime (impulsivity)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure impulsivity, which may affect the decision to eat, performance on a computerized stop-signal task will be assessed. Outcome measures include: direction errors (#, more = more errors), proportion of successful stops (%, higher = more successful), reaction time on &quot;Go&quot; trials (longer = slower), stop signal reaction time (longer= slower).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Proficient in English.

          2. Pubertal or Post-Pubertal Females: 13 to &lt;18 years.

          3. Pubertal or Post-Pubertal Males: 15 to &lt;20 years.

          4. Girls must have a negative urine pregnancy test and post-menarchal girls must use an
             acceptable method of contraception, including abstinence, a barrier method (diaphragm
             or condom), Depo-Provera, or an oral contraceptive, for the duration of the study.

          5. Currently obese (BMI &gt;95%ile for age/sex if age &lt; 18 years, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 age 18 - 20
             years). In children, obesity is defined with respect to age- and sex based as greater
             than or equal to the 95th%ile1, whereas in adults, an absolute threshold is used.

          6. Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and if appropriate, child assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetes mellitus requiring insulin or insulin secretagogue. (Laboratory values:
             HgbA1c â‰¥8.5%)

          2. Cardiovascular condition, as defined as any of the following: i) abnormal blood
             pressure, defined as &lt;3%ile or &gt;97%ile for age, sex and height 3, for adult
             participants abnormal blood pressure is defined as Stage 2 hypertension (systolic BP &gt;
             160 mm Hg or diastolic BP &gt; 100 mm Hg); ii) history of cardiac arrhythmia or
             arrhythmia detected on screening ECG; iii) history of heart failure and/or
             cardiomyopathy; iv) prolonged QTc interval (QTc &gt; 460 msec), and/or long QT syndrome
             phenotype and/or positive genotype for long QT syndrome pathogenic mutations.

          3. Concurrent use of medications known to prolong QTc interval and pose high risk for
             Torsades de Pointes (TdP) according to the current information available
             (www.crediblemeds.org). Concomitant medications will be assessed by the
             Investigational Drug Service (IDS) pharmacist, in collaboration with the study
             cardiologist, if additional clarification is needed. In addition, we require that
             potential participants be on a stable dose for at least 2 months of any medication
             with the potential to alter cardiac rhythm to ensure the screening ECG reflects
             steady-state physiology.

          4. Laboratory abnormalities that indicate abnormal sodium level, liver or renal disease,
             or anemia:

             intake.

         10. Any investigational drug use within 30 days prior to enrollment.

         11. Pregnant or lactating females.
