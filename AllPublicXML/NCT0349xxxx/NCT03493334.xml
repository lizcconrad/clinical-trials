  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of visual feedback of the posterior
      region of the cervical spine on pain intensity and range of motion.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 patients with chronic idiopathic neck pain will be randomly assigned into one of two
      groups: a group receiving visual feedback when performing 10 repetitions of each of neck
      movements (flexion, extension, side-flexion and rotation) and a group performing the same
      task without visual feedback. Participants will be assessed for pain intensity, pain
      location, disability, range of motion, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing and anxiety both at
      baseline and after visual the intervention (i.e., neck movements with and without visual
      feedback).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To have idiopathic neck pain defined as neck pain unrelated to any known pathology or
             lesion felt at least once a week in the last 3 months, located between the nuchal line
             and a horizontal line passing through T1 and pain intensity of at least 3 in the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cervical or facial trauma, radiculopathy, history of surgery in the
             vertebral segment in question, congenital anomalies involving the spine (cervical,
             thoracic and lumbar spine) or any neurological or rheumatic pathology, and, finally,
             evidence of significant visual changes, or of deficits not corrected by lenses or
             glasses.
