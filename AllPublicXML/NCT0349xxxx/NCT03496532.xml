  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is an effective treatment for Parkinson's
      disease. The analysis of cerebral signals of the subthalamic nucleus by local field
      potentials, provides one of the main electrophysiological markers of the success of the
      stimulation. This marker can be used to evaluate new paradigms of stimulation. So far, little
      studied, the temporal characteristics of the stimulation are very important in the
      effectiveness of the stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, in Parkinson's disease. The
      first objective (Study I) is to compare the effectiveness of the stimulation when it is
      applied with biphasic symmetrical pulses and when applied with the standard pulses applied so
      far.

      The second objective (Study II) is to see if, by applying pseudo-random time intervals
      between each stimulation pulse, if it would be possible to improve the efficiency and to
      limit the side effects of the stimulation.

      The third objective (Study III) is to evaluate the electrophysiological changes of the
      subthalamic nucleus caused by the general anesthesia, in the anticipation of the realization
      of the surgery of the stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus under general anesthesia.

      Study I and II: Patients who participate undergo pulse generator change under sedation. Four
      sets of stimulation parameters will be compared. The efficacy of every set will be measured
      on induced changes in LFP recorded from the STN electrodes. LFP will be compared between
      before, during and right after each stimulation conditions. The stimulation order will be
      randomized. All other stimulation parameters will be the same (macrocontact with most
      beta-oscillations, 1 minute, 1.5mA) .

      Study III: Patients who participate undergo their first pulse generator implantation,
      performed under general anesthesia because of wire tunnelisation. The depth of anesthesia
      will be documented, recording the BIS spectral analysis index. The difference in spectral
      amplitude density of LFP, in particular in beta band oscillations will be correlated with the
      depth of anesthesia as measured with the BIS index at the time of 2 minutes recordings.

The stimulation order will be randomized. All other stimulation parameters will be the same (macrocontact with most beta-oscillations, 1 minute, 1.5mA) .
Hence 4 sets of 1 minutes of STN stimulation will be performed, for:
Symmetrical biphasic pulses versus standard pseudo monophasic pulses (study I; 2 sets).
Pseudorandom uniform distribution stimulation paradigms versus pseudorandom Poisson distribution stimulation paradigms (study II: 2 sets).</description>
