    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of
      ticagrelor in pediatric patients from 0 to less than 24 months with sickle cell disease.

      Ticagrelor dose level adjustment will require a Protocol amendment and regulatory approval

      Study design This Phase I paediatric study (in patients aged 0 to &lt;24 months) with ticagrelor
      is planned to be a multi-centre, open-label, single dose study.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the PK properties of ticagrelor after a single oral dose

      Secondary Objectives:

      To determine the PK properties of the active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) after a single oral
      dose To assess the acceptability and the palatability of a single oral dose of ticagrelor

      Safety Objective:

      To assess safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of ticagrelor

      Duration of treatment At least 20 eligible patients will receive a single open label oral
      dose of ticagrelor on Day 1.

      Statistical methods A population PK analysis approach will be used to determine the PK
      parameters of ticagrelor and its metabolite AR-C124910XX in paediatric patients aged 0 to &lt;24
      months eg, CL/F (oral clearance) (only for ticagrelor) and AUC.

      The PK will also be described by presenting the observed plasma concentrations of Ticagrelor
      and its active metabolite for all individuals, as well as corresponding descriptive
      statistics.

      No statistical comparisons are planned for the primary or secondary objectives, which will be
      summarised descriptively.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Paediatric patients aged &lt;24 months, diagnosed with homozygous sickle cell (HbSS) or
             sickle beta-zero-thalassemia (HbS/β0), as confirmed by high performance liquid
             chromatography or haemoglobin electrophoresis.

          2. Body weight ≥5 kg at the time of screening.
