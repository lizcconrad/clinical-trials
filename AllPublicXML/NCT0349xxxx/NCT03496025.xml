    <textblock>
      Purpose of the trial is to study the activations of paralyzed facial muscles in a unilateral
      facial nerve palsy with a multi-channel electrical stimulator. The principle of the device is
      to measure muscle activity of the healthy side of the face by surface electromyography (EMG)
      and to use this information to stimulate the corresponding muscles of the paralyzed side. The
      ultimate goal is to develop a prosthetic device for persons with a facial nerve palsy.

      The trial consists of several different studies. The studies' aims are 1. To study
      activations of paralyzed facial muscles by the electrical stimulation. 2. To study different
      stimulation pulse waveforms, frequencies, and electrode placement and their effect on the
      muscle activations and the tolerability of the stimulation. 3. To study whether a symmetrical
      movement on the paralyzed side can be achieved with electrical stimulation when compared to
      the movements of the healthy side. 4. To study tolerability of stimulation-elicited eye blink
      when watching a film and the effect of the stimulation-induced blink on the eye symptoms, the
      visual acuity, and the effects of the stimulation on the lacrimal fluid. 5. To develop a
      method for facial pacing, i.e. measuring the muscle activations on the healthy side of the
      face and to use this information to stimulate and activate the healthy side of the face.

      Forty subjects with a chronic facial nerve palsy are recruited to the studies. Each subject
      can participate in one or several studies. Another forty subjects with an acute facial nerve
      palsy are recruited to the study on the tolerability and effect on the eye symptoms.
      Additionally, altogether ninety healthy volunteers are recruited to the studies in order to
      gather preliminary information on the tolerability and the effects of the stimulations.

    <description>The offline video analysis is done to determine the current threshold at which a movement of the target muscle is produced. Possible activations of the other muscles alongside the target muscle are also observed. The amplitude of the movement is analyzed offline from a video recording either visually by the investigators, or measured with a digital ruler. With visual evaluation, the outcome is measured on a rough level, i.e. whether the stimulated movement was larger in amplitude compared to the voluntary movement. With a digital ruler, the results a presented numerically (millimeters). The stimulated activation is compared to the voluntary activation of the muscle. Further, in some sub-studies, the facial activations are evaluated with the Facial Action Coding System.</description>
