  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the RELIEVE-HF study is to provide reasonable assurance of safety and
      effectiveness of the V-Wave Interatrial Shunt System by improving meaningful clinical
      outcomes in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or
      ambulatory class IV heart failure (HF), irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction,
      who at baseline are treated with guideline-directed drug and device therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, 1:1 randomized, patient and observer blinded clinical
      study, with a Shunt Treatment arm and a non-implant Control arm. A total of approximately 400
      patients will be randomized. The duration of follow-up will range from a minimum of 12 to a
      maximum of 24 months. Control patients will have the opportunity to receive therapy at the
      end of the blinded phase if they provide consent and continue to meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. All implanted patients will be followed for a total of 5 years from the time of the
      study device implantation.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Both heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and heart failure with
