  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity.

      The purpose of this study is to develop and test non-invasive biomarkers based on methylation
      changes in PBMC, T-cells and circulated tumor DNA in prostate cancer patients.

    <measure>DNA methylation of circulated tumor and PBMC DNA and its Correlation to Development and prediction of prostate cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>We will develop the linear model and a threshold value differentiating breast cancer from control based on the 100 patient training set. The model will be provided to the researchers:
Methylation score=CG1*b1+CG2*b2+ CG3*b3 + e
CG1 is the methylation value of the first CG b1 is the regression coefficient for the first CG and e equals the intercept.
We will develop the regression coefficient and intercept as well as the DNA methylation values for each patient for each CG. We will first compute the polygenic methylation score for each patient. Then based on the computer threshold based on the training cohort will call the samples as prostate cancer or not.</description>

        Patients will be assigned an ID that will be kept confidential according to hospital
        regulations. IDs will be randomized so that identity will not be revealed except to the
        approved hospital personnel. Methylation data will be returned to the hospital for follow
        up of progression of disease and for assessing early prediction of progression of Prostate
        cancer and will be entered into the data base. Other clinical follow up data will be
        entered into the electronic data base. All data will be captured in case report form
