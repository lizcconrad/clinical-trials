  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little data is currently available on the type of pathogen responsible for respiratory
      infections following drowning. Many environmental germs present in seawater are described as
      difficult to culture on standard media but are potentially pathogenic. Even using specific
      culture media nearly 90% of the bacteria present in the water remain non-cultivable. The use
      of 16S and 18S rDNA amplification followed by high throughput sequencing on respiratory
      samples could allow us to objectify these bacteria potentially involved in the
      physiopathological process secondary to drowning and thus improve their overall management.

      Carrying out a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) within 24 hours after admission to intensive care
      with analysis on standard and specific culture media of environmental germs, carrying out
      antibiograms, DNA extraction, amplification by universal 16 and 18S rDNA primers followed by
      high flow sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of pathogens found. Comparison of these
      results with the same analyses performed on seawater samples taken near the drowning site and
      during a new AML at 72h for patients still intubated and showing signs of pneumonia in order
      to determine if the pathogens detected at the entrance persist and are present in the
      environment.

      AML at the patient's entrance, on day 3 and environmental sampling in the drowning
      environment within 24 hours. Standard and specific bacteriological analyses with molecular
      biology techniques (amplification 16 and 18S rDNA) carried out at Pr RUIMY's laboratory (Nice
      University Hospital) sequencing on INRA's Toulouse genomics platform. Phylogenetic data
      capture and analysis at IRCAN (Bioinformatics, Croce Olivier). Patient follow-up until
      resuscitation discharge.
