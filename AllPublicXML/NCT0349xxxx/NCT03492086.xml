  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bioactive supplements might display relevant therapeutic properties according to validated
      molecular effects. Herein, the effect of a supplement based on diterpenes from Rosmarinus
      Officinalis L. and alkylglycerols with proven properties against signaling pathways involved
      in tumorigenesis is evaluated. The biological and molecular effects of this supplement,
      mainly based on expected effects on immune and genetic modulatory properties is investigated.
      For this purpose, 60 healthy volunteers were enrolled in a six week, double-blind, randomized
      and parallel pilot study with two study arms -rosemary and alkylglycerol containing capsules
      and control capsules. The study includes the analysis of (1) immunological parameters (ex
      vivo cytokine profile of LPS stimulated PBMC and PBMC phenotyping by cluster differentiation
      (CD) markers), (2) regulation of the expression of genes linked to immuno-modulation,
      inflammation, oxidative stress response and cancer, and (3) the analysis of correlation of
      selected genetic variants (SNPs) with the differential responses among individuals.

    <measure>Changes in ex vivo cytokine profile produced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Isolated PBMCs were first incubated for 12h, and then after LPS treated. Supernatants were recovered to determine concentrations of Interleukin (IL) -1B, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFNy and TNFa using a magnetic bead-based immunoassay (Human High Sensitivity T Cell Magnetic Bead Panel A MAGPIX-Luminex) kit from Millipore, following the manufacturer's instructions. A minimum of 50 beads per parameter was analyzed by the MAGPIX-Luminex system. Raw data (median ﬂuorescence intensity, MFI) were analyzed with the xPONENT software 4.1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in oxidative stress status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the changes in the oxidative stress the following biomarkers were measured in urine samples:
Oxidized-low density lipoproteins measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by using the monoclonal antibody mAb-4E6 (Mercodia AB, Sweden)
Isoprostanes and thromboxane B2 quantified by competitive ELISA (Enzo Biochem, Inc., NY, USA and Oxford Biomedical Research, MI, USA, respectively).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in lipid profile</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate lipid improvements the following measurements were considered: Triacylglycerol, Total Cholesterol, low Density Lipoprotein and High-Density Lipoprotein measured by routine laboratory (CQS, Madrid, Spain, which follows the UNE-ISO 15189:2007 directives) methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gene expression analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gene-expression assays were performed in a HT-7900 Fast Real time PCR. GAPDH was used as endogenous control. RT-StatMiner software (Integromics® Inc., Madison, USA) was used to detect and determine the quality control and differential expression analyses. The Expression Suite Software (Life Technologies) program was used to obtain the Ct data. The ΔCt (Ct gene-CtGAPDH) was calculated and then the relative expression (RQ) between visits was calculated (V3-V1) following the 2-ΔΔCt method (Livak and Schmittgen 2001)</description>

    <measure>DNA genotyping</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Genotyping was performed using the QuantStudio 12 K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies Inc., Carlsbad, CA) with a TaqMan OpenArray plates. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in different parts of the pathogenic processes of inflammation, immune system, obesity, lipid metabolism, redox homeostasis and cancer, were analyzed using TaqMan Genotyper software.</description>
