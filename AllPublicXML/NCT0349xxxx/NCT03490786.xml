  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation design trial. Twelve evaluable subjects (n=12) with BMIs of 30 to
      40 kg/m2 will receive a single dose of placebo followed by study drug applied directly to the
      surface of the tongue mucosa with a disposable pipette followed by a one-day washout. A total
      of seven (7) doses will escalate to a dose of 2.5 mg.
