  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunocompetent subjects with high load of Epstein-Barr virus DNA (EBV-DNA) in peripheral
      blood will be enrolled and prospectively followed up to track the natural histories of the
      chronic high load of EBV virus. The primary goal of this study is to explore the association
      of peripheral high load of EBV with the hematological malignancies, and second goal is to
      investigate the genetic mechanisms of immune escape and tumorigenesis of chronic EBV
      infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of
      human hematological malignancies such as lymphomas, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and
      chronic active EBV disease. While chronic latent EBV infection（especially carriers with
      persistent high load of EBV-DNA copy number）is the gray zone between the primary infection
      and the hematological malignancies, which is rarely concerned. Previous work has prompted the
      heterogeneities of EBV infection, such as racial heterogeneity, viral load heterogeneity and
      heterogeneity of infected target cells. It is of great significance to prospectively track
      the transforming process and elucidate the association of chronic EBV infection and
      hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Healthy subjects who was found to have high EBV-DNA load
      （&gt;1×103 copies/ml）in peripheral blood during the physical examination were enrolled and
      followed up by telephone or face-to-face interview periodically. The primary outcome is
      hematological malignancies including Burkitt lymphoma, EBV+ B-cell lymphoproliferative
      diseases, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of nasal type (ENKL), aggressive NK-cell leukemia
      (ANKL), classic Hodgkin lymphoma,EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and
      Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV). The Exploratory purpose of this study is
      to investigate of genetic mechanisms of immune escape and tumorigenesis of EBV infection.
      Subgroup analysis will performed in subjects with mild high load (&gt;1×103 copies/ml and &lt;1×104
      copies/ml) and severe high load (＞1×104 copies/ml) of EBV-DNA copies.
