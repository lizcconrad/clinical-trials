      In Phase I, participants will participate in pilot and usability tests of the curriculum
      prototype. For the pilot test, teachers and students will use the curriculum prototype and
      then be interviewed about it. For the usability test, students and teachers will use the
      revised curriculum and be interviewed/complete short survey. Teachers will provide consent
      and students will have parental consent and their own assent.

      In Phase II, a group randomized trial will be conducted during Spring semester 2020 among 9th
      grade student in 27 high schools in the Hillsborough County Public School system randomly
      assigned to treatment and control (14 treatment and 13 control). All students will complete a
      pretest survey. Students in two health classes in treatments schools will participate in the
      REAL media Plus curriculum and complete a short immediate posttest survey to rate their
      experience. All students will then complete two posttests. Students will have parental
      consent and provide their own assent.
