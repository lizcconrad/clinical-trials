  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over four million stroke survivors currently living in the United States are unable to walk
      independently in the community. To increase the effectiveness of gait rehabilitation, it is
      critical to develop therapies that are based on an understanding of brain adaptations that
      occur after stroke. This project will be the first step towards the development of a novel
      therapeutic approach using brain stimulation to increase walking capacity in stroke survivors
      and understand the neural mechanisms that are associated with impairment and functional
      recovery.

    <measure>Change in gait speed using 10 meter walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to immediately after training and baseline to 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>10-meter walk test: Gait speed will be measured as the average of 3 trials of the 10-m walk test. Participants will be asked to walk at their normal comfortable pace to cover a distance of 10 meters without an AFO (handheld assistive device is acceptable if needed).</description>

    <measure>Change in 6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to immediately after training and baseline to 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. Participants will be asked to walk at their normal pace for 6 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Change in Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to immediately after training and baseline to 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Balance will be measured using the Berg Balance Scale. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function. Tasks such as standing with eyes closed, one leg stance etc are included.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of life measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to immediately after training and baseline to 3 months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>QOL will be measured with the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The SIS is a stroke-specific self-reported health status measure.</description>
