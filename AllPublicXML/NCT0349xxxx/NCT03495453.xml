      This single center prospective, randomized study will be conducted to investigate plaque
      removal and luminal gain using CSI's DIAMONDBACK 360® Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System
      (OAS) (St.Paul, MN) versus Medtronic's Hawkone Directional Atherectomy system (DAS)
      (Minneapolis, MN) assessed by angiography and Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) in patients
      diagnosed with symptomatic obstructive femoro-popliteal disease will be analyzed. Both
      devices have received clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use by the
      label indication.Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive treatment with
      either OAS (using CSI device) followed by Inpact Admiral drug coated balloon (DCB) or DAS
      (using the Hawkone device) followed by DCB. Subjects in both arms will undergo IVUS before
      and after atherectomy, as well as at the conclusion of the procedure. Clinical data will be
      collected at baseline, immediately prior to the procedure, during and immediately after the
      procedures, and within 30 days, 6 and 12 months office visits after the procedure. Data may
      also be collected at office or hospital visits that are not scheduled but occur up to 12
      months after the procedure, if they pertain to treatment related to the obstructive SFA
      disease. Data to be collected for this study includes demographics, medical history,
      procedural parameters and follow-up. The study will be conducted at one study center, 90
      subjects will be enrolled in the trial with plan to accrue 60 subjects - 30 patients enrolled
      in the OAS arm and 30 patients enrolled in the DAS arm. The duration of the study is expected
      to be approximately 2 years from the date of first enrollment (1 year for enrollment of 60
      subjects and a year for follow-up).

    <description>Diamondback 360 Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) is a small catheter with a diamond crown. The doctor inserts it at the groin and advances into the leg.The OAS works by spinning around inside the artery to &quot;sand down&quot; the buildup of material along the artery walls while leaving the healthy vessel behind.</description>
