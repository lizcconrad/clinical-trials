  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare the overall survival adjusted to quality of life of 2 groups of
      patients with multiple myeloma, depending on the type of care: (1) day hospitalization
      exclusively or (2) day hospitalization combined with hospital-at-home.

      As secondary objectives, the study aims to compare the impacts of the two types of care
      organization on:

        -  the survival of patients and response to treatments according to criteria of the
           International Myeloma Working Group,

        -  psychological status of patients,

        -  specific toxicity related to treatment used (haematological and infectious toxicity,
           neurotoxicity, ...),

        -  health outcomes,

        -  the caregiver's burden,

      This study is combined with a qualitative study about the incentives and the barriers, and in
      order to set up the patient's typology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma, a malignant blood disease with about 5000 new cases diagnosed annually in
      France, essentially in the elderly population, is associated with alteration of quality of
      life resulting from pathology and therapies.

      Multiples cycles of chemotherapies are administered in a regular manner, as outpatient
      treatment or day hospitalization.

      In this study aiming to explore the impacts on health outcomes and resources utilization of
      hospital-at-home for elderly patients with multiple myeloma, all patients will be treated by
      4 standardized protocols of treatment including bortezomib by subcutaneous administration.

      9 centers will participate to the study. The study will not change the usual practices of
      care of these centers:

        -  6 centers organize patient care through day hospitalization combined with
           hospital-at-home,

        -  3 other centers rely exclusively on day hospitalization.

      The study will target overall the inclusion of 300 patients for the 9 centers and 70
      participants (35 for each arm: 10 patients, 10 caregivers, 15 from healthcare team) for the
      qualitative study.

      The individual follow up of each patient will last 12 months. The patient's vital status will
      be documented at the 24th month.
