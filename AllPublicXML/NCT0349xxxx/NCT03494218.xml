      The assessment and early diagnosis of pain is of great importance for pain management and
      treatment in patients with disorders of consciousness. The Nociception Coma Scale (- Revised)
      is only applicable to assess pain of DOC patients in international clinical setting. The aim
      of this study was to translate the NCS from English into Chinese and determine the validity
      of this Chinese version. To test internal reliability and inter-rater reliability, both rater
      A and rater B assess the perception of pain on day 1; and to obtain test-retest reliability,
      rater A assessed all patients repeatedly on day 2. 'Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry,
      Consolability' (FLACC) was used to analysis concurrent validity by rater A.

    <intervention_model_description>The order of the administration was randomly selected. All patients' total scores assessed by rater A were recorded to test the internal consistency of NCS-R (A1). Meanwhile, to assess the concurrent validity, the scores of the FLACC were recorded together with NCS-R by rater A on day 1. In order to analyze the test-retest reliability, rater A complete the second evaluation of NCS-R on day 2 (A2)</intervention_model_description>
