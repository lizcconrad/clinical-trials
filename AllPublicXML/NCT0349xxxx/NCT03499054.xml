  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving haemodialysis have poor physical function, psychological status and
      quality of life than the general population.Fatigue is a debilitating symptom in
      haemodialysis patients Exercise training may improve these parameters for haemodialysis
      patients.

      A 3-month randomized control trial with baseline、Week 4、Week 12 measurement periods was
      conducted. Exercise group was taught to Breathing exercise week and Usual care for three
      months. The control group received usual routine care.

      A total of 86 patients participated in this study, with 43 patients in the Exercise group and
      43 patients in the control group Methods: Hemodialysis Fatigue scale 、 WHOQOL-BREF 、 HADS_
      Anxiety

      、 HRV

    <description>During hemodialysis, the participants in the exercise group are asked to keep ttheir muscles relaxed, breathe normally through the nose at a rate of 3-8 times per minute with each breath held over 5 seconds in length. At the same time, the particpants are asked to also perform lower leg lifts for about 8 seconds per lift. The exercise is performed for 15-20 minutes, and after resting, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and HRV are measured.</description>
