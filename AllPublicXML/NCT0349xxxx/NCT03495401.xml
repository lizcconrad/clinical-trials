  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of double fortification (iron and
      zinc) in synbiotic milk (L.plantarum Dad13 and fructooligosaccharides) on under 5 years
      stunted children growth, gut microbiota composition, blood zinc and hemoglobin level, and
      cognitive level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel, quadruple-blind, randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of
      double fortification (iron and zinc) in synbiotic milk (containing 7 billion CFU L.plantarum
      Dad13 and 4 g fructooligosaccharides) on the gut microbiota composition, body height and
      weight, blood zinc and hemoglobin level, and cognitive level in under 5 years stunted
      children subjects. The duration of the study is 4 months, including a 2-week pre test and
      informed consent before randomization of subjects into treatment or control group, a 12-week
      intervention period, and a 2-week post test after the end of intervention. During the
      intervention period, subjects will be instructed to take 100 ml of fortified synbiotic milk
      or non-fortified synbiotic milk per day. They will also be asked to document consumed milk,
      any unusual symptoms or side effects of treatment. Diet will be monitored via 24-h dietary
      recalls and SQ-FFQ before and after treatment respectively. Changes in the gut microbiota
      composition will be determined by measuring bacterial population levels (Bifidobacteria,
      Lactobacillus, Enterobacteria, Prevotella, and Bacteroides) in stool sampled collected at
      baseline and 12 weeks by qPCR. Metabolic markers (calprotectin, hemoglobin, and zinc level)
      will be measured at baseline and 12-weeks in serum and plasma using biochemical and
      immuno-assay. Changes in the cognitive level, height for age Z-score collected at baseline
      and 12 weeks using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd Edition .

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive level will be collected and analyzed before and after the intervention and compared between groups using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd Edition (BSID). This part of BSID evaluation, which yields a score called the mental development index, evaluates several types of abilities: sensory/perceptual acuities, discriminations, and response; acquisition of object constancy; memory learning and problem solving; vocalization and beginning of verbal communication; basis of abstract thinking; habituation; mental mapping; complex language; and mathematical concept formation. Total score from test will determine mental development index of children : accelerated performance (score ≥85), within normal limit (score 70-84), mildly delayed performance (score 55-69), and significantly delayed performance (score &lt;55).</description>

    <description>Psychomotor data will be collected and analyzed before and after the intervention and compared between groups using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd Edition (BSID). This part of the BSID assesses the degree of body control, large muscle coordination, finer manipulatory skills of the hands and fingers, dynamic movement, postural imitation, and the ability to recognize objects by sense of touch (stereognosis). Total score from test will determine motor development index of children : accelerated performance (score ≥85), within normal limit (score 70-84), mildly delayed performance (score 55-69), and significantly delayed performance (score &lt;55).</description>
