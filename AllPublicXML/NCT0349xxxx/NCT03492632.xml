      Psoriasis is a common autoimmune disease. It affects women of all ages including reproductive
      years. Autoimmune diseases including psoriasis are linked to premature ovarian reserve. This
      study aims to measure serum hormones including FSH,LH,E2,PRL and AMH (indicators of ovarian
      reserve) in women with and without psoriasis.

      Psoriasis is a common autoimmune disease. It affects women of all ages including reproductive
      years. Almost 75% of patients are diagnosed before the age of 40. There is also increased
      evidence on autoimmune disease and their link to premature ovarian failure.Ovarian reserve is
      important for the reproductive period. The measurements of serum hormones including follicle
      stimulating hormone (FSH),luteinizing hormone (LH),prolactin (PRL), estradiol (E2) and
      anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) will give us an idea about the ovarian reserve. The
      investigators aim is to measure ovarian reserve parameters in patients newly diagnosed with
      psoriasis and to compare them to healthy controls. Serum FSH,LH,E2,PRL and AMH will be
      measured on the 3rd day of the cycle.The serum hormone levels will be compared between women
      with psoriasis and women without psoriasis
