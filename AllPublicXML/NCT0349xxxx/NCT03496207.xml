    <textblock>
      Study A011-09 is designed to assesses the efficacy and safety of sotatercept (ACE-011)
      relative to placebo in adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Eligible
      participants will receive study treatment for 6 months in the double-blind Treatment Period,
      and then will be eligible to enroll into an 18-month Extension Period during which all
      participants will receive sotatercept. All treated patients will be also undergo follow-up
      period after last treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of
      sotatercept plus SOC versus placebo plus SOC in participants with PAH of WHO Group 1,
      functional class II-III.

      Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive sotatercept 0.3 mg/kg
      subcutaneously (SC) every 21 days, sotatercept 0.7 mg/kg SC every 21 days, or placebo every
      21 days for a period of 24 weeks in the double-blind Treatment Period of the study while on
      standard of care therapy. Evaluations will include changes in pulmonary vascular resistance
      (PVR), six-minute-walk distance (6MWD), quality of life questionnaires, echocardiographic
      parameters, and safety. Participants who have not discontinued early from the Treatment
      Period and have had their post-Treatment Period PVR assessment will be eligible (per
      investigator assessment) to continue into the 18-month Extension Period in which
      sotatercept-treated participants will receive their latest dose level of sotatercept SC every
      21 days and placebo-treated participants will be re-randomized 1:1 to receive sotatercept 0.3
      mg/kg SC every 21 days or sotatercept 0.7 mg/kg SC every 21 days while on standard of care
      therapy.

    <time_frame>From initiation of treatment (Study Day 1) to end of double-blind treatment period (Study Day 168)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAMPHOR questionnaire contains 65 items in total, 25 relating to symptoms, 15 relating to activities, and 25 relating to Quality of Life (QoL). It is negatively weighted; a higher score indicates worse QoL and greater functional limitation. Symptom and QoL items are both scored out of 25: &quot;yes/true&quot; scores 1 and &quot;no/not true&quot; scores 0. Activity items have three possible responses (score 0-2), giving a score out of 30.</description>

    <time_frame>From initiation of treatment (Study Day 1) to end of double-blind treatment period (Study Day 168)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The questionnaire consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
