  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic type of eczema affecting approximately 10% of adults and
      12% of children in the US. The intense itching (pruritus) associated with AD can be
      significantly disruptive to sleep and quality of life for both the patients and their
      caregivers. AD is challenging to describe and measure. The purpose of this study is to see if
      we can reliably measure how much people with AD scratch and how scratching interferes with
      sleep and quality of life by using digital sensors, sleep studies and patient-reported
      information.

      Wrist worn accelerometers, sleep sensors, polysomnography (PSG), and associated data analysis
      platforms would provide quantitative and qualitative knowledge regarding the action of
      scratching and sleep quantity in a symptomatic atopic dermatitis (AD) population. Our overall
      aim is to validate the use of accelerometry technology and digital measures to quantitatively
      and qualitatively evaluate scratch and sleep in AD patients in a home environment.

      Accelerometry devices appear similar to a wristwatch. The subject will be asked to wear an
      accelerometry device on each wrist during the study. The accelerometry device provides
      continuous measures of wrist activity and will be used to quantify nocturnal scratching and
      sleep behaviors to be compared to videography (annotated for scratch), sleep sensor, PSG and
      traditional patient-reported outcome (PRO) and Quality of Life (QoL) measures [Peak Pruritus
      Numerical Scale, Severity of Pruritus Scale (SPS), Patient Global Impression of Severity
      (PGIS), Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale, Itch and Sleep Diary, Patient-Oriented
      Eczema Measure (POE), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-pain
      interference, PROMIS- anxiety, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Family Dermatology Life
      Quality Index (FDLQI), Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI), Device and Device
      Comfort Questionnaire] in patients with AD in a clinic and home setting in a well-controlled
      clinical study.
