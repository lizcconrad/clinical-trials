  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of patients with chronic pain (CP) is 40% in patients with acute pain in emergency
      department (ED). Patients with CP come more frequently to ED than patients without CP.
      Reasons for their visit to ED are often in relation with this CP. Few studies have been
      interested to management modalities of these patients in ED. We are going to realize a
      prospective observational study in one center. Our hypothesis is that patients with chronic
      pain are less satisfied of ED management that patients without CP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is defined by a daily pain since more than 3 months. CP is different of acute
      pain because of their mechanisms, treatments and therapeutic objectives. CP is associated
      with an alteration of quality of life with psychological, social and economic consequences.
      The prevalence of CP in France is 15%. In ED, the rate of CP in patients with acute pain was
      around 40%. Patients with CP come more frequently to ED than patients without CP. Their use
      of care structures, particularly ED, is all the more frequent that their disability is
      important. The satisfaction of these patients in ED is associated with age, nature of pain,
      wait duration, realisation of imaging, and administration of painkillers and relieving of
      pain. The reasons why these patients go to ED were pain exacerbation, inadequate strategy of
      coping, severity of disease and sometime despair associated with stress or anxiety. Currently
      we do not know if these managements in ED are adequate or not. And finally we do not know
      whether the satisfaction about their ED management is different from patients without CP. We
      are going to collect data about all patients admitted in ED with the objective to compare the
      satisfaction between patients with CP and patients without CP. The follow up will be
      restricted to the area of ED. The last data will be collected just before the exit from ED.
