  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with mandibular sub-condylar fractures underwent either either open reduction with
      internal fixation (ORIF) or closed reduction with external fixation (CREF) and were followed
      up for 6 months to assess treatment adequacy with the hypothesis that ORIF is superior to
      CREF.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mouth Opening</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mouth Opening shall be determined by measuring the maximal distance between the edges of upper and lower incisors with fully opened mouth; the measurement shall be made in millimeters (mm) using vernier caliper and mouth opening of 35 mm or more shall be classified as &quot;adequate&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Occlusion</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Occlusion shall be determined by maximum &quot;inter-cuspation&quot; as observed by the surgeon and patient self-reporting and will be classified as fine or deranged.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of complications with either mode of treatment shall be recorded</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-Effectiveness shall be determined as the ratio of the cost of treatment and achievement of both adequate mouth opening and fine occlusion.
The cost of treatment shall include the cost of surgical items (wires, elastics, arch bars, plates, screws etc), cost of anesthesia and surgery, cost of hospital stay and cost of follow up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants shall be requested to report their satisfaction after treatment with regards to ease of chewing, mouth opening &amp; closing and achievement of pre0traumatic facial symmetry/orientation.
This parameter shall be recorded on a 4-point Likert scale (not satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, somewhat satisfied, satisfied).</description>
