  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gambling craving is involved in the development, maintenance and relapse of gambling disorder
      (e.g., Young &amp; Wohl, 2009). Yet, it lacks research regarding evidence-based interventions
      available to mitigate craving in patients displaying gambling disorder. The elaborated
      intrusion theory of desire (EIT; Kavanagh, Andrade, &amp; May, 2005) is a cognitive model of
      craving which offers important avenues for the development of psychological interventions, as
      it clearly describes the processes at play in craving experiences (e.g., mental imageries,
      working memory). Recently, Cornil et al. (2018) evidenced that the elaborated intrusion
      theory is relevant to account for gambling craving experiences. According to this model,
      craving (and desire) is the result of an elaboration process where &quot;desires thoughts&quot; (mental
      images and thoughts), induced by internal (e.g., frustration) and/or external (e.g.,
      advertisement) triggers, require attentional and cognitive resources. The principle of
      interference-based techniques is to move the resources allocated to the elaboration of
      intrusive desire thoughts to a competing task (e.g., clay modelling, competitive mental
      imagery, Tetris) in order to monopolize the resources underlying craving, thus preventing its
      elaboration and reducing its vividness and overwhelming nature. Several studies (Andrade,
      Pears, May, &amp; Kavanagh, 2012; May, Andrade, Panabokke, &amp; Kavanagh, 2010; Skorka-Brown,
      Andrade, Whalley, &amp; May, 2015) have shown the efficacy of such techniques to reduce
      substance-related craving. Yet, data obtained on clinical samples remain scarce.

      Preliminary data have been obtained prior to this application. In order to investigate the
      relevance of interference-based techniques, an experimental study (Cornil &amp; Billieux, 2017)
      was conducted in community gamblers. In two conditions (19 gamblers per condition), gambling
      craving was first induced via a short mental imagery session and a computer-generated
      gambling simulation task. Then, the experimental group was asked to perform an interference
      task consisting of creating a vivid mental image of a bunch of keys. The control group
      completed a task in which they had to pop and count bubble wrap. The analyses revealed that
      induced craving decreases significantly in both groups. However, participants that are
      considered problem gamblers showed a greater decrease of their craving in the experimental
      condition. This previous &quot;proof of principle&quot; study supports that interference-based
      techniques are potentially promising interventions to reduce craving in problem gambling. It
      also warrants further research as no data is available in clinical population.

      The current project consists in a pilot study aiming to test the efficacy of
      interference-based techniques in a sample of gambling disorder patients. The investigators
      decided to adopt a multiple single case design, as this methodology is ideal in the sense
      that it helps to understand the whole process of an interference-based intervention among a
      small number (7) of outpatients with a gambling disorder, without control group. In addition
      to be easily implementable in a clinical design, this design will provide sufficient
      evidences before possible, in a second time, further validation of these techniques using a
      randomized-control trial.

Yet, data obtained on clinical samples remain scarce.
Due to the flexibility of the single case design towards each participant, the list of interference-based techniques that will be used in this study cannot be exhaustive. However, the following will be proposed to participants: Tetris (smartphone version), manipulation of a bunch of keys, manipulation of a fidget, mental imagery, reading and memorizing a text.</description>
