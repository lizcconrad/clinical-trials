    <textblock>
      The study has both quantitative and qualitative components.

      The objective of the quantitative study is:

        1. To culturally adapt and refine Montessori activities for people living with dementia in
           Pakistan.

        2. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of culturally-adapted group based
           Montessori intervention for people with dementia in Pakistan.

        3. To build capacity and capability in dementia research (researcher training)

      The objective of the qualitative study is:

      To explore views on perceived effectiveness and sustainability of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world. Mental health services are limited
      in Pakistan particularly older adults mental health services are almost nonexistent.
      According to a recent report in Pakistan currently 8 million people are of age 65 and above
      who have long term physical and psychological health conditions. This is a tough challenge
      for the country due to its poor economic condition.Hence, there is a need to develop programs
      that can help and improve the health-related quality of life of this population in low
      resource settings.We need to do a lot more work to address this issue.

      One possible low-cost, accessible, non-pharmacological intervention for BPSD (Behavioral
      Psychiatric symptoms of dementia) is the Montessori approach which is evidence based.The aim
      of the proposed project is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of using the
      Montessori intervention for people with dementia in Pakistan.

    <description>The Montessori method is a system of teaching developed by Maria Montessori based on principles to promote learning and independence in children. In the context of dementia care, this method has been tried in research settings in older people and was found to be effective in improving certain behavioral outcomes such as eating behaviors, agitation, and mood. The intervention is based on designing and offering activities that take into consideration the interests, needs, past experiences and preferences of participants. Importantly, participants demonstrating positive engagement with the intervention, suggesting that this may be a promising form of support to investigate and develop further for the care of people with dementia.</description>
