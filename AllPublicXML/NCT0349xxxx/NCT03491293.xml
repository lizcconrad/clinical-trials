      CHAT is an internet-based weight loss research program designed for women with overweight or
      obesity who want to lose weight through dietary change and increased physical activity.
      Participants will be randomized into a group-based online program who meet via a text chat or
      a video chat.

      The overall goal of this project is to determine whether weight losses can be improved if
      visual chat and electronic smart scales are added to an established 6-month online weight
      loss program. The primary aim is to assess weight change differences between subjects
      randomized to receive an Internet program alone (with text chat; INTERNET) vs. an Internet
      program with visual chat and electronic scales (VIDEO INTERNET). A secondary aim is to
      evaluate differences in social support experienced by subjects in both conditions. Overweight
      and obese adults (n=40) at two study sites (UVM and the University of South Carolina) will be
      randomly assigned to Internet (n=20) or Video Internet (n=20). All participants will receive
      the same 24 week web-based group weight control program which features synchronous
      facilitated chats and online behavioral tools. The only difference will be the delivery of
      the chat (text vs. visual) and the electronic smart scales given to the VIDEO INTERNET group.
      Assessments will be conducted at 0, 2 and 6 months and will include measures of body weight,
      treatment engagement (e.g., attendance, self-monitoring, website utilization), social support
      and treatment satisfaction.

    <description>The investigators will assess weight change differences between subjects randomized to receive an internet program alone with text chat vs. an internet program with visual chat and bodytrace smart scales. Weight will be assessed at baseline, 2 months after intervention begins, and at the end of intervention using a calibrated digital scale (Tanita, WB800S) with subjects in street clothes, without shoes.</description>

    <description>The group facilitator will record attendance at chats. Attendance at chat will be compared by treatment arm. Rate of attendance is calculated as number of meetings attended out of a total possible 24 meetings over the course of the study.</description>

    <description>Number of daily weights submitted over the course of 24 weeks divided by the possible total of weights will give the rate of weight self-monitoring (7/week x 24 weeks = 168 possible weights). The VIDEO arm will be provided with BodyTrace electronic scales that report weight to a secure database via cellular connectivity. Subjects in the TEXT arm will report their weights to their facilitator using their own digital scale at home.</description>
