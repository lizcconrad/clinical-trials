  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the dose of Orenitram® (treprostinil)
      Extended Release Tablets achieved at 16 weeks after a short-term course of Remodulin®
      (treprostinil) Injection in prostanoid-naive subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (PAH).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be initiated on subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) treprostinil and titrated
      to a target dose of 20 to 30 ng/kg/min. After achieving the target SC/IV treprostinil dose,
      subjects may begin a transition to oral treprostinil at the Transition Visit which can occur
      at Week 2, 4, or 8. After the Transition Visit, oral treprostinil titration will continue
      through Week 16 to reach the maximum tolerated dose.
