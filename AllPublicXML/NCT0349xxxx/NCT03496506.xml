    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of clopidogrel on the pharmacokinetics of
      selexipag and its active metabolite (ACT-333679) in healthy male adults (by determining the
      blood concentrations of selexipag and its metabolite). Also, the safety of selexipag when
      administered alone or with clopidogrel will be assessed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area under the plasma concentration-time profile of selexipag and ACT-333679 during a dose interval (AUC-tau)</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 hours post-dose on Day 3, Day 4 and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>AUC-tau for selexipag and ACT-333679 is calculated on the basis of the actual blood sampling time points drawn during the 12-hour interval after the morning administration of selexipag administered either alone (Day 3) or concomitantly with clopidogrel (Day 4 and Day 10)</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Maximal plasma concentration of selexipag and ACT-333679 (Cmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 hours post-dose on Day 3, Day 4 and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is directly derived from the individual plasma concentration-time curves for selexipag and ACT-333679, following administration of selexipag alone (Day 3) or concomitantly with clopidogrel (Day 4 and Day 10)</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Trough plasma concentration of selexipag and ACT-333679 (Ctrough)</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples from Day 1 to Day 9 before the morning and evening administrations of selexipag and on Day 10 before the morning administration of selexipag</time_frame>
    <description>Ctrough is the concentration of selexipag and ACT-333679 directly measured in the blood samples collected prior to the morning and evening administrations of selexipag</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to reach Cmax (tmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 hours post-dose on Day 3, Day 4 and Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>tmax is the time to reach the maximal plasma concentration of selexipag and ACT-333679 and it is directly derived from the individual plasma concentration-time curves for selexipag and ACT-333679, following administration of selexipag alone (Day 3) or concomitantly with clopidogrel (Day 4 and Day 10)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Number of participants with any treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including serious adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first selexipag administration on Day 1 up to Day 18 (about 1 week after the last administration of selexipag)</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-emergent adverse event is any adverse event temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment</description>

    <description>Subjects receive 1 tablet of selexipag twice daily from Day 1 to Day 9 and 1 tablet in the morning of Day 10. In the morning of Day 4 and 1 hour before the administration of selexipag, they receive 4 tablets of clopidogrel. Then from Day 5 to Day 10, 1 hour before the morning administration of selexipag, they receive 1 tablet of clopidogrel .</description>
