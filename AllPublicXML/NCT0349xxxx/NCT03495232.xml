      In this project the investigators wish to:

      Evaluate intra-operative and postop complications, longer term survivorship and patient
      reported outcome measures (PROMs) following primary total knee replacement using Persona
      Total Knee system.

      This project is carried out as prospective cohort study. Recruitment of participants to this
      project is expected to begin in October 2016 or as soon as permission from the Regional
      Ethics Committee and the local Data Protection Agency is obtained as required. A total of 700
      participants (including 155 participants from a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      investigating the Persona and the Nexgen total knee systems, which is separately submitted to
      the ethics committee) are to be included at several centers in the nordic region. Recruitment
      is expected complete after a period of 1,5 years per site. The patient follow-up visits are
      expected to be completed 2 years after recruitment of the last participant. Survivorship will
      be collected until 10 years after the recruitment of the last participant.

      Participants are seen on an outpatient basis at 3 months and 1 and 2 years postoperatively.
      After the 2 year follow-up visit the patients will be followed for survivorship through the
      National Knee Arthroplasty Registries at 5, 7 and 10 years postoperatively.

      The investigators will retain the subject data sources, case report forms (CRFs) and
      electronic-CRFs in accordance with local laws and regulations.

      The enrollment is competitive between the participating centers. Project information and
      consent according to local requirements before surgery is completed.

      Surgery is performed as described in the manufacturer's surgical technique. A senior surgeon
      dedicated to total knee arthroplasty surgery will perform all operations with an assistant.

      Participants will receive standard pain treatment and rehabilitation until discharge.
