  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of Real-World Strategy Training (RWST) compared to a
      psycho-education workshop for improving everyday life performance in older adults with
      subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of
      these approaches.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that 25-50% of community-dwelling older adults report SCD and that these
      individuals have an elevated risk for developing Mild Cognitive Impairment and/or dementia.
      Many of these individuals report difficulties with complex activities of daily living.

      RWST aims to reduce these difficulties in everyday life by providing a meta-cognitive
      training approach that compensates for age-related executive changes. The approach is
      provided within the context of individually identified everyday-life difficulties.

      The psycho-education approach is a Brain-Health Workshop supplemented by intellectually
      stimulating activities such as doing Sudoku and/or word searches. This approach provides
      information people may use to inform health behaviour changes.

    <time_frame>Changes from baseline to post-intervention at 10 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM is a standardized semi-structure interview in which participants identify everyday life difficulties (defined as things they need to or want to do). These issues are converted to goals with performance rated on a 10-point Likert-type scale. Goals considered improved to criterion are those that have a 2 or more points increase on ratings.</description>

    <description>The MET is an ecologically valid, performance measure being used to determine if strategies learned in RWST are transferred to novel contexts. Best performance is achieved through completing all tasks (n=12) without breaking any rules (n=9).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 weeks, 3 months post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in executive function are anticipated as meta-cognitive strategy training targets the executive control system. These will be measured using the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System.</description>

    <description>The key features of the protocol are: i. Participants are actively engaged in selecting their treatment goals. The research clinician will work with the participants to identify five specific, measurable real-world goals using a standardized semi-structured interview, the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Three of these will be training goals, two will not be trained but evaluated post-intervention for evidence of generalization and transfer to non-trained tasks; ii. A global problem solving approach is used (Goal- Plan- Do- Check). Participants are guided by the trainer to apply this strategy to their goals.</description>

    <description>The active comparator uses an information-based format and is designed to engage participants without providing any specific training techniques or strategies. During weekly sessions, participants will receive factual information on brain structure and function, age-related cognitive changes, and general brain health issues and will spend time doing non-specific cognitive exercises including crossword and Sodoku puzzles. Homework will consist of reading assignments related to the session topics.</description>
