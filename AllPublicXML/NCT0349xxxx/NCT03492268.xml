      This trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BCMA-CART in treating patients with
      relapsed or treatment refractory multiple myeloma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BCMA(B-Cell maturation antigen) is a tumor specific antigen of multiple myeloma (MM). Using a
      genetic engineering strategy to assemble an anti-BCMA CAR(chimeric antigen receptor) in
      autologous T cells will help these CART cells to recognize and kill BCMA-expressing MM tumor
      cells. This trial aims to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of autologous BCMA-CART
      with a human ScFv(single-chain variable fragment) in treating relapsed or treatment
      refractory multiple myeloma.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients undergo leukapheresis to separate their lymphocytes, from which CART cells are produced. Patients will receive a conditioning therapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine before CART therapy. BCMA-CART cells will be injected intravenously (IV) into patients on day 0.
After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 60, 90, 120, 180, and 365 days.</intervention_model_description>
