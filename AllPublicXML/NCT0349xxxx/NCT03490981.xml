  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the gap in treatment options for Veterans with chronic pain in primary care, the
      investigators have developed an abbreviated version of cognitive behavioral therapy, Brief
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Chronic Pain (Brief CBT-CP), specifically for use in
      integrated care settings. The first objective of the proposed study is to conduct a pilot
      randomized controlled trial of Brief CBT-CP compared to primary care treatment as usual to
      assess feasibility (i.e., recruitment and retention of participants, appropriateness of
      measures, and assessment of fidelity of service delivery). This trial will also preliminarily
      assess treatment effectiveness by examining changes in pain-related physical interference,
      psychological distress, pain intensity, and other related outcomes. Thirty eligible
      participants will be randomized into either Brief CBT-CP and primary care treatment as usual
      or primary care treatment as usual only. Eligible Veterans will include those with chronic
      musculoskeletal pain and pain-related functional impairment identified from primary care.
      Participants assigned to Brief CBT-CP will receive six weekly sessions of treatment in
      30-minute appointments. This intervention will include education and goal setting, activities
      and pacing, relaxation skills, cognitive coping, and relapse prevention. Assessments will
      include validated self-report measures that will take place at pre-treatment (baseline),
      post-treatment, and at 12-week follow-up. The second objective of this study will be to
      explore patient and provider perceptions of Brief CBT-CP to identify potential modifications
      that will improve its quality and overall feasibility of delivery in future work.
      Participants will include up to 12 staff members as well as up to 12 patients who were
      randomized to Brief CBT-CP. Participants will be interviewed by telephone about key
      components of the treatment. Participants will comment on the protocol and study procedures
      in terms of acceptability (the perception that a treatment is agreeable or that its specific
      components are satisfactory), appropriateness (the perceived fit or compatibility of the
      intervention for a given provider or consumer), and feasibility (the extent to which a new
      treatment can be successfully carried out or is suitable for everyday use). This intervention
      has been designed specifically for integrated care providers and therefore has clear
      implications for translation to clinical practice and for improving pain care quality by
      providing an evidence-based protocol. The potential direct benefit to Veterans includes
      offering a safe, accessible, non-pharmacological treatment for chronic pain early in the
      trajectory of VA care.

    <description>Brief CBT-CP is a manualized protocol that includes six, 30-minute sessions over the course of 6 weeks. Brief CBT-CP session outlines and patient handouts are included in the appendix. Session one focuses on foundational pain education and the development of treatment goals.

Sessions four and five focus on recognizing and modifying unhelpful thoughts that negatively impact pain. Session six focuses on relapse prevention and independent implementation of CBT-CP skills following treatment.</description>
