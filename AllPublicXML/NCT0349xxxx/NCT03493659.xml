  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problem-based learning (PBL) is an education model utilized by Maastricht University and many
      other universities worldwide. PBL occurs in small, collaborative tutorials, under the
      facilitation of a tutor. This study explores the effects of standing tutorials, compared
      against sitting tutorials, on PBL among undergraduate students. A quantitative approach will
      be taken to objectively measure students' learning, and a qualitative approach will be taken
      to obtain a deeper understanding of the processes of learning.

      It is hypothesized that students in the standing tutorials will be able to recall more
      academic concepts and link the concepts better than students in the sitting tutorials (H1).
      Audio-recording of the tutorials will be used to measure the discussions within the
      tutorials. The transcriptions obtained from the recording will be studied through text
      analysis. It is hypothesized that students in the standing tutorials will produce more
      discussions, and therefore a higher word count (H2). It is also hypothesized that the
      students in the standing tutorials will use more word categories that are conducive to the
      discussion and learning process (H3).

      Through the qualitative approach, the content of the transcriptions will be analysed through
      a thematic analysis. It is hypothesized that the students in the standing tutorials will
      produce more learning-oriented interactions (H4).

      Two additional factors that would be measured are subsequent physical activity and academic
      achievement. ActivPAL accelerometers will be used to measure the students' daily activity, to
      find out if the students' daily activities are affected by the standing tutorials, for
      example, students may sit more as a result of fatigue from the standing tutorials, or
      conversely transfer the active behaviour from the standing tutorials to other activities
      outside the tutorial group.It is hypothesized that standing tutorials do not affect the
      students' subsequent physical activity, and therefore there will be no significant
      differences of daily activity between students in the sitting and standing tutorials (H5).
      With regards to academic achievement, it is hypothesized that the students in the standing
      tutorials will have higher academic achievements after the course compared to the students in
      the sitting tutorials (H6).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Matriculated undergraduate students of Maastricht University

          -  Students who have given their consent to participate in this study.

          -  The course subject is well-established and mandatory for all students within the
             specific bachelor's programme. A well-established course will be chosen so that clear
             scoring is possible on the concept tests (explained in the Materials and Analysis
             sections) that will be administered to the students. The course should be mandatory
             for all students within the bachelor's programme so as to reduce the selection bias
             that may otherwise occur if we decide to select tutorial groups that only specific
             groups of students signed up for. An example of a well-established and mandatory
             course for students in the Biomedical Sciences bachelor's programme at Maastricht
             University would include 'Brain, behaviour and movement, 'Human genetics, reproduction
             and prenatal development' and so on.

          -  The course coordinators and tutors who are the gatekeepers of the students would have
             given their permission and cooperation in planning the study into the tutorials.

          -  The duration of the course would last at least 10 tutorial classes.

          -  The duration of each tutorial is 2 hours.

          -  The timing of the tutorial groups will have to be similar to minimize any effects
             arising due to tests being carried out at different times of the day.

          -  The course is taught in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For the standing tutorials, those who are suffering from musculoskeletal discomfort or
             pathologies that may prevent or influence movement

          -  Non-matriculated student of Maastricht University

          -  Non-matriculated student of the chosen course for the study
