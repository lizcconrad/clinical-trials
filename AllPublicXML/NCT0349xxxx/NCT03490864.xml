  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing body of evidence from both laboratory and field studies that disrupted
      circadian function, particularly decreased amplitude and stability of rhythmic behaviors
      represent significant risk factors for cardiometabolic disease (CMD) in humans. The exciting
      evidence of the ubiquity of circadian clocks in all tissues and their critical role in
      metabolism, not only opens up new avenues for understanding the mechanistic interactions
      between central and peripheral clocks in cardiometabolic disease pathogenesis, but also to
      develop therapeutic interventions to re-establish synchrony between central and peripheral
      clocks with each other and with the external physical and social environments. Feeding has
      been shown to synchronize clocks in peripheral tissues. Animal studies have demonstrated that
      restricting feeding to the active period decreases CMD risk, while in humans decreased
      caloric intake in the evening is associated with a lower body mass index (BMI). The amplitude
      of melatonin can be considered a marker of robustness of central circadian function, but
      melatonin also has physiological effects beyond circadian regulation throughout the body.
      Recent observations have demonstrated that having a low melatonin level is a risk factor for
      incident diabetes and hypertension independent of sleep duration. Together, the evidence
      suggests that strategies aimed at synchronizing feeding behavior and enhancing the nocturnal
      melatonin signal can positively impact cardiometabolic function.

      We propose to take an innovative approach that combines the recent data on the role of
      feed/fast patterns on clock regulated metabolic activity and the reemergence of scientific
      interest of the central and peripheral effects of melatonin on cardiometabolic function to
      elucidate the physiological and molecular mechanisms that underlie the relationship between
      circadian dysregulation and obesity associated CMD risk. This will be accomplished by
      strengthening the amplitude of circadian metabolic signals via meal timing and enhancement of
      nocturnal circadian signaling with exogenous melatonin in overweight and obese middle aged
      and older adults. In addition, this study will provide crucial information regarding the
      importance of circadian timing for the design of future clinical trials on CMD in overweight
      and obese adults. This is a critical time in the lifespan when circadian based strategies for
      prevention and treatment are most likely to have the greatest impact on CMD risk. This
      project will enroll 100 adults (40-54 years) to participate in a parallel (4 arm
      intervention) placebo controlled study to determine whether a six- week program of meal
      timing and/or low dose (3 mg) melatonin administration will enhance circadian amplitude and
      enhance cardiometabolic function, as well as to evaluate the potential beneficial effects of
      a regimen that combines both approaches. The results from this study will demonstrate novel
      mechanistically based approaches for maintaining and improving circadian-metabolic health
      during a critical time in the lifespan when there is a rapid increase in the prevalence of
      CMD.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial where each participant will receive one of four intervention types. Subjects will be randomized at baseline visit to one of four arms using a randomized block design to achieve balanced groups. Randomization will be stratified by sex. The allocation will be created using an online randomization tool. This study will include a 6 week four arm field intervention to evaluate the independent effect of meal of timing or melatonin as well as their combined effects.</intervention_model_description>
