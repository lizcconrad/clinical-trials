  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2006 there was a plateau in world wide mortality from asthma. Overreliance in Short
      Acting Beta2 Agonists (SABA) was associated with increased risk of death from asthma. Long
      acting beta agonists (LABA) alone was not permitted as treatment for asthma as it was
      determined by FDA by the &quot;black box&quot;. By contrast SABA does not have a &quot;black box&quot;, despite
      similar overuse alerts associated with increased risk of death from asthma. the investigators
      want to know if exist asthmatic subjects that do use another rescue medication; not SABA, and
      to compare their features, Asthma Control Test (ACT), and lung function in a outpatient
      facility.

      First consecutive visits at outpatient Pulmonary Section of asthmatic subjects were
      described. Asthma Control Test (ACT) that was routinely used to assess asthma and spirometry
      were performed.

      During the period from March 10, 2017 to January 16, 2018 the investigators decided to
      describe the rescue medication in all new asthmatic subjects that came for a first visit to
      the outpatient pulmonary department. Patients aged ≥16 years were entered in the study with a
      a diagnosis of asthma, based on a history of episodic dyspnea and wheezing, and/or documented
      bronchodilator reversibility in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 12% and 200 ml
      according to the National Institutes of Health criteria; to be non- or ex-smoker of less than
      10 pack-yr, to be neither pregnant nor breast-feeding and to be capable of completing Asthma
      control test and spirometry. Consecutive patients visiting the outpatient pulmonary
      department were included in the description.
