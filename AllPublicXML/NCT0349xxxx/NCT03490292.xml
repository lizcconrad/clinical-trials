      Background:

      Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is part of the standard of care for patients with stage II and III
      resectable esophageal cancer. This approach is based on the results of a large randomized
      clinical trial (CROSS) that demonstrated superior survival in patients receiving neoadjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection compared to patients treated with surgery
      alone. Pathological complete response at the time of resection is strongly linked to better
      survival. However, with current strategies pathological complete response is achieved only in
      a minority (29%) of patients. Remaining patients, especially those with positive lymph nodes
      at the time of the resection, are at significant risk for recurrences. Five-year survival
      rate for these patients is only 37%, and overall survival is as low as 9 months for those
      with persistent lymph node disease. Among patients who develop recurrent disease, most
      present with distant metastases outside of the radiation field. This is not surprising since
      the accepted treatment paradigm for this disease does not target possible disseminated
      microscopic systemic disease. Hence, novel strategies are needed to improve outcomes of these
      patients. We propose conducting a phase I/II clinical trial evaluating a role of immune
      checkpoint inhibitor in combination with chemoradiotherapy and post-operatively in the
      management of resectable esophageal cancer.

      Study Rationale:

        1. A number of preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated synergism between radiation
           and immunotherapy, suggesting that combining these approaches can enhance anti-tumor
           activity and increase treatment efficacy.

        2. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising activity in a subset of
           patients with metastatic esophageal and gastric cancers. Moving these agents into
           neoadjuvant setting may increase the cure rate of this disease compared to the standard
           approach.

        3. Current neoadjuvant therapy does not target any potential microscopic disease outside of
           the radiation field since chemotherapy serves primarily as a radiation sensitizer.
           Immunotherapy treatment will target both local and systemic disease.

      Hypothesis:

      We hypothesize that co-administration of avelumab with chemoradiation will be well tolerated
      and will increase pathological complete response rate in resected tumor specimens. We
      hypothesize that avelumab treatment will also decrease the rates of disease recurrence.

      Study Design:

      This is a 2 part Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy
      of avelumab in combination with chemoradiation in patients with resectable esophageal cancer.

      Part 1: This is the run-in phase of the trial. This portion will determine the safety and
      tolerability of avelumab in combination with chemoradiotherapy in 6 patients. The proposed
      combination will be considered as safe if dose limiting toxicities are observed in at most 1
      patient.

      Part 2: This is a Phase 2 portion of the trial, which will evaluate the efficacy of the
      proposed treatment regimen in patients with stage II/III resectable esophageal cancer.

      Objectives:

      Primary: Evaluate the safety of avelumab in combination with chemoradiation in patients with
      resectable esophageal cancer receiving perioperative therapy.

      Secondary: Obtain efficacy data and further safety data of the proposed drug combination in
      this patient population.

      Exploratory objectives: The translational focus of the study will evaluate changes in tumor
      microenvironment that occur in response to radiation and immunotherapy.

      Endpoints:

      Part 1 - Primary endpoint: Establish safety and tolerability of the proposed treatment.

      Part 2 - Primary Endpoint: Pathological complete response rate.

      Part 2 - Secondary Endpoints:

        1. Safety and tolerability.

        2. Disease free survival.

        3. Incidence of surgical complications.

        4. Rate of R0 resection.

      Number of centers &amp; patients: One center.

      Part 1: total of 6 eligible patients will be accrued to evaluate the safety and tolerability
      of the proposed combination.

      Part 2: 18 patients will be enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the trial.

      Population:

      Patients with histologically confirmed, potentially curable squamous-cell carcinoma,
      adenocarcinoma, or large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the esophagus who are candidates
      for neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection.

      Investigational drugs:

      Avelumab (Provided by EMD Serono). IND information to be added as needed.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a two-part phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted in one center.
Part 1. Run-in phase to assess the safety and tolerability of avelumab in combination with chemoradiation. Will enroll 6 patients, after which accrual will be stopped temporarily while safety data is being obtained.
Part 2. An open-label phase 2 study. Part 2 will obtain further safety data of the proposed drug combination and will evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy of perioperative avelumab and chemoradiation in this patient population. Will enroll 18 additional patients.
Each phase of the study will have a 21-day screening period, treatment procedures (neoadjuvant therapy, resection and adjuvant therapy), and active surveillance for a year after the completion of adjuvant therapy.
After active surveillance visit at 12 months post treatment completion, survival data and disease status will be collected via phone calls or medical record review every 6 months during the following 3 years.</intervention_model_description>
