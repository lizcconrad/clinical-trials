  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-angiogenesis Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been proved to show promising
      effects on prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) for advanced sarcoma after failure of
      standard multimodal Therapy. Methylsulfonic apatinib is one of those TKIs which specifically
      inhibits VEGFR-2. This study summarizes the experience of three Peking University affiliated
      hospitals in off-label use of apatinib in the treatment of extensively pre-treated sarcoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively analysed files of patients with advanced sarcoma not
      amenable to curative treatment, who were receiving an apatinib-containing regimen between
      June 1, 2015 and December 1, 2016. Fifty-six patients were included: 22 osteosarcoma, 10
      Ewing's sarcoma, 3 chondrosarcoma and 21 soft tissue sarcoma.
