    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if using a Quadratus Lumborum (QL) plane injection
      technique (also called a &quot;nerve block&quot;) that numbs the nerves going to the abdominal area
      improve pain control after surgery compared to administration of local anesthetic directly to
      the surgical incision. The QL block technique uses a numbing solution (local anesthetics)
      that is injected next to nerves located along muscles in the back to reduce pain. This block
      will not affect movement in the leg and/or make the legs weak. Some institutions, including
      Duke, use the QL block for patients having various abdominal surgeries, with the hope of
      providing good pain relief combined with improved mobility after surgery.
