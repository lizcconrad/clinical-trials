  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restrictive anorexia nervosa and TOCs are psychiatric diseases which shares a common
      pathophysiological substrate We hypothesize that anorexia patients and patients with OCD have
      structural and functional changes in the accumbofrontal tract. The main objective of this
      study will be to compare the structure and the connectivity of this tract in MRI with
      diffusion sequences (DTI tractography) and resting-state, in 3 distinct populations of
      anorexic patients, patients with OCD and healthy patients. The role of the accumbo-frontal
      tract in the cortico-striato-hypothalamo-cortical circuit seems to be established. DTI
      tractography will allow the measurement of functional anisotropy (FA), a parameter that
      evaluates the diffusion of water molecules along the white matter fibers, and therefore the
      potential alteration of the studied tract. Resting state sequences will allow to estimate the
      BOLD signal and the functionality of the tract.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients

          -  Age between 18 and 65 years

          -  Subjects free to give their written consent

        For anorexia nervosa :

          -  Patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa according to DSM5
             (American Psychiatric Association): low weight (&lt;85% of expected weight for age and
             height), fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, distortion of body image, and
             amenorrhea for more than 3 months

          -  Treatment with at least one antidepressant and one anxiolytic

          -  Patients meeting the diagnostic criteria of OCDs according to DSM5 (American
             Psychiatric Association) : presence of obsessions and / or compulsions, resulting in
             clinically significant suffering (loss of at least one hour per day) or impairment at
             the social, occupational level or in another important area of life. These symptoms
             are not due to the physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition
             and cannot be better explained by the symptoms of another psychiatric disorder.
