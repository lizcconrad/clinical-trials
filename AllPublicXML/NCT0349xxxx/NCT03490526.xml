  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caries disease is still the leading cause of severe tooth decay. Since this can lead to tooth
      loss, it is important that appropriate treatment is advised to help prevent damage and
      maintain tooth health. Faced with major coronary destruction, several times it becomes
      necessary to perform the endodontic treatment, aiming to maintain the element in the buccal
      cavity for longer. It is known that an excellent restorative treatment with poor endodontic
      treatment and vice versa has a direct impact on the (in) success of the treatment. In this
      context, the proper cleaning of the root canals is highlighted, aiming the removal of
      bacteria and toxins. There are several cleaning methods described in the literature, but it
      is not yet known which would be the most effective in the removal of these contaminants. In
      this double-blind randomized clinical trial, patients who need and meet the inclusion
      criteria will undergo endodontic treatment in two different root canal cleansing techniques
      (passive ultrasonic cleaning and cleaning with the XP Endo device). Patients will be
      monitored annually after finish your endodontic treatment to evaluate the periradicular
      repair and the quality of endodontic treatment.

    <description>The XP-Endo® finisher will be used next to the X-Smart Plus endodontic motor, with speed settings at 800rpm and torque at 1 N.cm. Irrigation with 17% EDTA and 2.5% NaOCl will be performed in three cycles of one minute each. In each cycle the XP-Endo will be used in the working length in continuous and slow movements of entrance and exit, with amplitude of 5mm, for a period of 1 minute, followed by new irrigation with 2.5ml of EDTA solution or hypochlorite of sodium 2,5%. Finally, the channel will be completely dry with absorbent paper tips</description>

    <description>For cleaning using passive ultrasonic irrigation, the E1 Irrisonic tip (Helse Ultrasonic, Ribeirão Preto, SP), will be used with Jetlaxis Sonic BP LED (Schuster, Santa Maria, RS). The insert has a diameter equivalent to a manual file 20, with reduced taper (0.01). The power used will be 10%. With root canals flooded with 17% EDTA, the irrigation tips will be coupled to the ultrasound and 1mm shorter than the working length. These tips will be kept in the center of the canal avoiding contact with the dentin walls. The irrigation will be performed in three cycles, and in each cycle the irrigation tips will be activated for 1 minute followed by new irrigation with 2.5ml EDTA. The same procedure will be repeated with 2.5% NaoCl. Finally, the channel will be completely dry with absorbent paper tips.</description>
