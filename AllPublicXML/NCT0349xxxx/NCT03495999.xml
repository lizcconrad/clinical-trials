  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia were both associated with inflammation, leading to
      diversities of cardiovascular disease such as left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, but the
      relationship among these entities remained unclear. The aim of the present study focuses on
      the association among hyperuricemia, diastolic dysfunction and inflammatory biomarkers in
      apparently healthy individuals with metabolic syndrome

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apparently healthy individuals with metabolic syndrome were prospectively and consecutively
      enrolled since August 2017. Blood samples were obtained after participants are fasting for at
      least 12 hours, including serum uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein,
      high-sensitivity interleukin-6, tumor necrotizing factor alpha, fasting glucose, glycosylated
      hemoglobin, insulin, lipid profile, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, sodium, potassium,
      and calcium. All echocardiographic parameters were measured in accordance with the American
      Society of Echocardiography guidelines.
