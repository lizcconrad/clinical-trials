  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diverticular disease is a chronic pathology, characterized by recurrent abdominal symptoms
      and a high social impact, with a high prevalence in developed countries, especially among the
      elderly. Diverticula are thought to develop from age-related degeneration of the mucosal wall
      and segmental increases in colon pressure resulting in bulging at points of weakness,
      typically at the insertion of the vasa recta. Classification of diverticular disease is
      largely based on symptoms: it begins with the development of diverticulosis, to asymptomatic
      disease, to symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD) and finally to complicated
      disease when patients develop abscesses, phlegmon, bleeding, fistula and sepsis.
      Approximately the 20% of the patients with diverticular disease has symptoms, such as
      abdominal pain, fever and altered bowel movement and, in the last decades, a significant
      increase of the incidence of complications related to the disease has been recorded, in
      particular of intestinal perforation.

      Lactoferrin (Lf) is a glycoprotein present in several secretory liquids - i.e. milk, saliva
      and tears - with antimicrobial properties that it exert to seizing iron, thus preventing the
      use by the pathogens, or altering their plasma membrane through its highly cationic charge.

      The investigators hypothesize that the antimicrobial and immunoregulatory characteristics of
      the Lf can be used to maintain an adequate homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa in patients
      with SUDD resulting in an improvement of both symptoms and quality of life.

      The investigators will verify whether a 4-week treatment with lactoferrin CRX is able to
      reduce SUDD-related symptoms, thus improving patient's quality of life. Symptoms will be
      assessed with the questionnaire by Tursi et al.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included in the trial the patient must:

          -  Age ≥18 and &lt;65 years

          -  Diagnosis of SUDD deﬁned as the presence of symptoms (mainly abdominal pain, but also
             constipation, diarrhoea and bloating) in patients with a previous diagnosis of
             diverticular disease at colonoscopy or imaging in the absence of any current
             complication (stenoses, abscesses, ﬁstulas)

          -  Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative pregnancy test at the
             Baseline Visit (V1) and to use adequate contraception for the duration of the trial

               -  Intrauterine Device

               -  Hormonal based contraception (pill, contraceptive injection or implant etc)
