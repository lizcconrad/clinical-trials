  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sham-controlled, multi-center and remote patient-centered randomized controlled clinical
      trial to investigate the efficacy of a novel non-invasive, unobtrusive study device in
      reducing symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Mild to severe CTS-diagnosed patients will
      wear the device daily and evaluation will be based on the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire.
      Subjects are randomized into a treatment group or sham group for 8 weeks, then followed for
      12 weeks post treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that daily wear of the study device results in significant improvements in
      patient-reported symptom severity. It is also hypothesized that the effects from active study
      device treatment are significantly greater than effects from sham treatment. In both cases,
      it is hypothesized that improvements are sustained or continue post-treatment.

      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, two-arm trial
      consisting of an eight week treatment phase (active study device or sham), followed by twelve
      weeks of follow-up. There are two study groups: the treatment group receiving the active
      study device and the sham group receiving a non-active sham device. Subjects will be informed
      that they have a 50:50 chance of receiving treatment or a sham. They will also be informed
      that if they receive sham treatment, they will be offered the active treatment at the
      conclusion of the sham post-treatment period. However, all subjects will not know what
      treatment they are on until the conclusion of the trial.
