      Treatment options for nipple fissures include drug therapy with antifungal and antibiotics,
      topical applications of lanolin, glycerin gel, creams and lotions, the milk itself, hot
      compresses and silicone nipple shields. Studies involving a light-emitting diode (LED)
      therapy have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, the enhancement of the wound repair
      process and the control of pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nipple fissures are the second major cause of the discontinuation of breastfeeding, following
      a sensation of insufficient milk, which leads to bottle feeding. Poor positioning of the
      child in relation to the breast, an inadequate frequency or duration of breastfeeding and
      improper suckling are the main causes of nipple fissure. Discontinuing breastfeeding deprives
      the infant of essential nutrients and also deprives the mother of certain health benefits.
      Treatment options for nipple fissures include drug therapy with antifungal and antibiotics,
      topical applications of lanolin, glycerin gel, creams and lotions, the milk itself, hot
      compresses and silicone nipple shields. Studies involving a light-emitting diode (LED)
      therapy have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, the enhancement of the wound repair
      process and the control of pain. As it does not cause discomfort, is relatively inexpensive
      and may impede the discontinuation of breastfeeding, phototherapy could be a viable option
      for the treatment of nipple fissures.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate LED therapy in treatment of nipple fissures
