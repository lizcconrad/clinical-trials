  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II single-arm, single-site, open label clinical trial with r/r HL patients,
      aimed to determine whether a RadVax approach using low-dose RT added to nivolumab can improve
      response among patients who do not achieve a CR to nivolumab alone. The long-term goal is to
      develop an effective regimen for r/r HL patients.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  Standard laboratory criteria for hematologic, and biochemical, and urinary indices

             of the subject on the trial.

          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method
             during participation in this trial.

             management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Subjects with contraindications to immune checkpoint therapy, as follows:

          -  Interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the detection and
             management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
