           history, and dental history will be collected from the parent or caregiver. The height
           and weight of each child will be measured in the same manner to standardize the result
           and their body mass index will be calculated before and after in follow up period.

        -  On the day of the GA, parent or caregiver will complete questionnaires about their
           child's oral state and well-being over the previous 3 months and oral hygiene
           instructions will be given to the parent.

           6-month post-operative follow-up visit. Dental examination will be assessed at baseline
           (pre-operatively) and at 1,3, 6, months post-operative visits.
