    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of CTLA4-Ig (abatacept) on phenotype, transcriptional profile, B
      cell receptor usage and functional parameters of circulating B cells expressing
      anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) in patients with early, methotrexate-na√Øve, ACPA
      positive rheumatoid arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      B cells expressing anti citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) display an activated, proliferative phenotype. Experimental data indicate that
      ACPA and ACPA-expressing B cells are actively involved in driving the disease process in RA.
      The present study is based on the hypothesis that targeted intervention with CTLA4-Ig
      (abatacept) as a means to interfere with T cell help for B cells in early, active,
      ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis can reverse the activated, proliferative phenotype of
      citrullinated antigen-specific B cells.
