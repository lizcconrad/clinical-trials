  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We sought to identify and verify independent correlates of Very Late Stent Thrombosis after
      the implantation of new generation drug eluting steng in China from an analysis of
      multicenter registries.

      This study represents a patient-level pooled analysis of patients undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention with stent implantation for acute coronary syndrome. Logistic
      regression methods were used to identify clinical, angiographic, and procedural
      characteristics associated with Academic Research Consortium- defined definite stent
      thrombosisï¼ž1 year.The patients will be divided into two groups:derivation group and
      validation group.We will develop a risk score from the derivation group and validate it in
      the validation group.
