  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine whether spatiotemporal characteristics of
      multisensory evoked potentials can be used as a marker of consciousness (awareness) under
      anesthesia.

      The secondary aim is to characterize changes in the characteristics of evoked potentials
      under anesthesia in both single sensory modality (visual, auditory) and across sensory
      modalities.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, dual parallel arm human subject study aimed at determining the
      relationship between level of sedation (consciousness) and features of multi and uni-sensory
      evoked potentials with the ultimate goal of developing novel means of detecting consciousness
      under anesthesia with potential for application to other clinical settings such as brain
      injury. For this purpose, the investigators have chosen two anesthetics with fundamentally
      distinct mechanisms of action: propofol and ketamine.

      The study will involve healthy compensated volunteers. On the day of the study, an EEG cap
      will be applied to the participant for monitoring brain activity and an intravenous line will
      be placed for drug administration. Blood pressure, ECG, pulse oxymetry, and end-tidal carbon
      dioxide (from nasal cannula) will be monitored. Supplemental oxygen will be administered
      using a nasal cannula. Subjects will then perform the behavioral tasks in the awake state for
      approximately 1 hour.

      After this phase is complete, participants will receive either propofol or ketamine (chosen
      permuted block randomization) using a clinician bolus/infusion strategy titrated to Richmond
      Agitation-Sedation Scale score of -1 (see above). Once the desired sedation level is
      achieved, subjects will once again complete the behavioral tasks. After the completion of
      this phase (approximately 1 hour) the anesthetic dose will be increased to attain Richmond
      Agitation-Sedation Scale -3 to -4. At this level of sedation subjects will not be able to do
      the behavioral task and only the evoked potentials will be recorded. Upon completion of this
      phase (approximately 1 hour), sedation level will be decreased to return the subject to a
      Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale of -1 and once again the tasks will be repeated.

      Finally, the anesthetic infusion will be stopped. Once the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale
      score of 0 is attained, participants will once again perform the behavioral task
      (approximately 1 hour). This will conclude the experimental phase of the trial. Subjects will
      be monitored until clinically established discharge criteria are met. This includes adequate
      respiration, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and activity level. No formal follow-up is
      required; however, subjects will be called 24 hours after study completion.

    <description>The primary study endpoint is multi-sensory evoked responses measured using EEG in units of millivolts squared per hertz at Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale scores of 0, -1, -2, -3 and -4. Multisensory evoked responses will be compared to those evoked by each uni-sensory modality (auditory and visual) individually. Evoked responses will be assessed in the frequency domain using spectral analysis techniques which quantify power of each neuronal oscillation (e.g. alpha, delta, theta and gamma) in terms of mV^2/Hz. Analysis will be performed separately during the period before drug administration and at different levels of sedation quantified with RASS scores. The investigators will test the hypothesis that with increasing doses of intravenous anesthetics, audiovisual (multisensory) responses will approximate algebraic sum of neuronal responses elicited by visual and auditory stimuli presented separately.</description>

    <description>The secondary endpoint is to use EEG recordings to demonstrate changes in the characteristics of evoked potentials under anesthesia using single sensory modality (visual, auditory) and across sensory modalities. Conventional evoked potentials will be computed as average waveforms aligned with respect to stimulus onset on a channel-by-channel basis.</description>
