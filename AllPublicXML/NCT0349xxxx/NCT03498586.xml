  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the use of half-normal saline as an irrigant for open-irrigated catheters
      during atrial fibrillation ablation. By increasing the efficacy of radiofrequency
      energy-mediated lesion formation, half-normal saline has the potential to reduce procedural
      times and improved acute and long-term outcomes.
