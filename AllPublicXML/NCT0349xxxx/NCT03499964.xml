    <textblock>
      ROBUST III is a prospective, multi-center, single blind randomized controlled clinical trial
      in a 2:1 allocation of treatment versus control device.

      This study is an adaptive design with an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation
      performed after 60 subjects have been enrolled. The interim analysis will be be undertaken
      following completion of the 6-month follow-up data from these subjects. Based on the results
      of the interim analysis, the final total sample size required for the study will be
      re-estimated. A minimum of 140 subjects, and a maximum of 200 subjects (pending the
      re-estimation) will be enrolled in the study. A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review
      the interim analysis results, including the sample size re-estimation and make
      recommendations related to trial continuation to the sponsor.
