  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to compare two methods of delivering short (~10 min) physical activity
      breaks that will occur during the regular school day for 3 years. Schools will be randomized
      to deliver physical activity breaks led by either the regular classroom teacher or by a
      remote instructor through a video in the classroom. Both delivery methods will promote a
      variety of whole body movements using large muscle groups. The schools will not be able to
      choose which group (regular teacher or remote instructor) they will be part of.

    <description>Activity breaks will be designed for delivery in the classroom without reconfiguration of the classroom space. Activities will emphasize whole body movements, using large muscle groups. Each break includes multiple activities. Each activity lasts about 2 minutes. There will be a total of about 20 minutes of physical activity done each school day.</description>
