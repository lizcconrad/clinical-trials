    <textblock>
      Background Patients undergoing resection for gastro-esophageal (GE)-cancer are subjected to
      high burden of disease and treatment-specific morbidities with potential detrimental impact
      on survival and quality of life. Exercise training is a promising strategy to improve
      physical functional before and after tumor resection, but it is not established if this
      translates into lower risk of peri- and post-operative complications, improved treatment
      tolerance.

      Objectives:

        -  To explore the effect a preoperative exercise-training intervention on the risk of
           treatment failure, defined as the risk of not reaching surgery, in patients diagnosed
           with operable GE cancer.

        -  To explore the effect of preoperative exercise training on median time to tumor
           progression (disease free survival), and overall survival

        -  To explore the effect of preoperative exercise training on the risk of treatment
           complications

        -  To explore the effect of preoperative exercise training on health related quality of
           life, anxiety and depression,cardiopulmonary fitness, muscle strength, and body
           composition

      Subjects and Methods In total, 310 GE-cancer patients will be included in the study and
      randomly allocated to pre-operative exercise training (n=155) or usual care control (n=155).
      All participants will undergo 2 study visits; assessed for cardiopulmonary fitness; muscle
      strength, body composition; blood sample (50 ml); quality of life by questionnaires; physical
      function; and blood volume profile.

      Quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires by self-report three times (at 12, 24, and
      36 months after diagnosis), and we will collect data from medical records regarding mortality
      and disease recurrence up to 36 months after diagnosis.

      Treatment arms:

      The intervention-group will be prescribed 2-3 weekly supervised exercise training for a total
      of 12 weeks before surgery during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. The control group will follow
      current usual care guidelines. After surgery during adjuvant chemotherapy, both groups will
      be referred to municipality-based rehabilitation.

    <description>Structured, supervised, high-intensity combined aerobic and resistance exercise. Based on patients' individual capacity (Wattmax and 1RM), a personalized exercise program will be prescribed. Following a 5 minutes warm up, the patients will perform 21 min of aerobic interval training on a stationary bicycle consisting of three 4 minute high intensity intervals (85-95% HRmax) with 3 minutes of active pause between each interval. The resistance training comprises 4 functional exercises by performed using bodyweight, elastic resistance bands or kettlebells followed by resistance exercises in machines for the major muscle groups: chest press, leg press, seated rows, and leg extension with 1 warm-up set followed by 3-4 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions.</description>
