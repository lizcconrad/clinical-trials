  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that one-third of the more than 7 million deaths from cancer worldwide are
      attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors, with 374,000 deaths preventable through
      diet modification alone. Diet supplementation for the prevention or treatment of cancer is
      attractive, as implementation is relatively easy, even in populations with reduced incomes
      and resources. Grape extracts or active components isolated from grapes have received
      attention as chemopreventive or therapeutic agents based upon their anti-proliferative,
      anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. Evidence from preclinical trials also
      suggests that muscadine grape products may decrease systemic inflammation. This study builds
      upon promising preclinical and clinical evidence to determine if the addition muscadine grape
      extract (MGE) to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improves symptoms in men with prostate
      cancer.

      Diet supplementation for the prevention or treatment of cancer is attractive, as
      implementation is relatively easy, even in populations with reduced incomes and resources.
      Grape extracts or active components isolated from grapes have received attention as
      chemopreventive or therapeutic agents based upon their anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory,
      and anti-oxidant properties. The muscadine grape contains a high concentration of anthocyanin
      3,5-diglucosides, ellagic acid, ellagic acid precursors, gallic acid, flavan-3-ols and
      flavonols. Several preclinical studies with muscadine grape products have revealed anti-tumor
      activity, including inhibition of tumor cell growth and induction of apoptosis. By reducing
      levels of circulating inflammatory markers such as CRP and IL-6, muscadine grape products may
      improve cancer outcomes by decreasing symptom burden, particularly fatigue. Despite reports
      indicating potential anti-tumor activity, there are limited clinical studies on the efficacy
      of muscadine grape products in the prevention or treatment of cancer or cancer-related side
      effects, representing an opportunity for novel investigation. The primary goal will be to
      determine whether treatment with MGE can improve measures of fatigue in men with
      biochemically recurrent prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Fatigue 7a Short-Form assesses the experience (3 items) and impact (4 items) of fatigue. Item responses are rated on a five-point scale ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;always&quot; and are summed for a total score and transformed to a T-score metric. Higher scores indicate more fatigue. Recommendations for classifying fatigue based on the T scores are as follows: &lt;50 normal; 50-59 mild; 60-69 moderate; ≥70 severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life: PROMIS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>General Quality of Life will be measured using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System© (PROMIS©) Global Health Short Form (SF), a 10-item instrument representing multiple domains. Items assess self-reported measures of general aspects of physical, mental and social health in adults. Raw scores are summed within each sub-domain, and converted to T-scores. Higher scores indicate better general health than the general population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in quality of life: HFRDIS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS). HFRDIS is a 10-item scale that assesses the degree to which hot flashes interfere with a variety of daily activities and quality of life. Interference is rated on an 11-point scale (0=not interfere; 10=completely interfere). Higher scores indicate more interference.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in sleep disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep disturbance will be measured using the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance (SD) SF 8a. The PROMIS-SD items assess self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. Each question has five response options ranging in value from one to five. The lowest possible raw score is 8; the highest possible raw score is 40. Raw scores are converted to a standardized T-score. Higher scores indicate more sleep disturbance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in cognitive abilities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive abilities will be measured using the PROMIS Cognitive Abilities SF 4a, which assesses patient-perceived functional abilities related to mental acuity, concentration, and memory. Raw scores are converted to a standardized T-score; final scores are represented by the T-score. Higher scored indicate more cognitive ability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in self-reported physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported physical function will be measured using the PROMIS Physical Function 10a SF, which is designed to assess self-reported capability rather than actual performance of physical activities. The form consists of 10 items. Raw scores are summed within each sub-domain, and converted to T-scores. Higher scores indicate better physical function general health than the general population.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in physical performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical performance will be objectively assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Each performance measure is scored ranging from 0-4 (0 = unable to complete; 4 = highest performance level), with total sum score range from 0-12. Lower score on the SPPB have been associated with increased risk of disability, hospitalization and worse survival among older adults with and without cancer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in sub-maximal exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 month</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Whole body lean mass, fat mass, and bone mass will be measured by duel energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). BMI will be calculated from height and weight.</description>
