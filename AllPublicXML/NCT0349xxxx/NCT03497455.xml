  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study aims to evaluate the use of the BARCO NV digital dermatoscope (non-CE
      marked device) in the skin cancer clinic. All eligible patients attending the Dermatology
      outpatient skin cancer clinic will be invited to participate. Patients who consent to the
      study will undergo standard care which will include medical photography of skin lesion(s) and
      appropriate management as determined by the Consultant Dermatologist in clinic. In addition
      to standard care, patients will undergo photography of the same lesion(s) using the BARCO NV
      digital dermatoscope. There will be no other intervention and no additional hospital visits
      in relation to the study. Use of the device will not influence the clinical management of the
      patient.

      A detailed experience questionnaire will be administered to all clinicians using the BARCO
      device to explore their opinion on its ease of use and features.

      All standard macroscopic &amp; dermoscopic images will be taken by OUH medical illustration
      department and stored on the 'Fotoweb' database (in keeping with current standard practice).
      Trained Dermatology Consultants, Dermatology Registrars, Research nurses or Medical
      Photographers, will take BARCO NV device images. A database of all BARCO images will be
      collected and stored on a dedicated NHS computer separate from the patient clinical record.
      Standard medical photography images will be stored on Fotoweb as per standard NHS clinical
      care.

      Data will be anonymised and collated and then sent securely to BARCO for further analyses to
      enable optimization of the BARCO device and for development of diagnostic algorithms in the
      future.

        All eligible &amp; consenting participants will be approached in a Skin Cancer clinic. Once the
        clinic consultation has been completed and a decision regarding their management has been
        made, patients will be invited to consent to the study.
