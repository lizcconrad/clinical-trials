  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      30 Veterans who are full-time wheelchair users will use personalized modular cushions for two
      weeks each. Personalized cushions will be created using a cushion fitting process the
      investigators have already developed and tested. Microenvironmental conditions will be
      monitored during use. A cost analysis will ensure the customized modular cushion applies
      value-driven principles. User satisfaction will be measured along with the effects on daily
      function, skin status and seated tissue health.

      A repeated measures clinical study design will be carried out with 30 Veterans.
      'Pre-baseline' seated interface pressures will be assessed with study participants sitting on
      their own cushions and pelvic region skin checks carried out by the study Research Nurse. All
      participants will then receive customized modular cushions. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to Group A or Group B using a modified randomization scheme. Group A participants
      will first use a gel ball fitted cushion for 2 weeks during all daily living activities while
      seated in their wheelchair followed by use of a SquishINS fitted cushion for 2 weeks. Group B
      will first use the SquishINS fitted cushion then a gel ball fitted cushion. Seated interface
      pressure distribution will be obtained at the beginning and end of each test period. A dual
      temperature and humidity sensor placed in the cushion will enable continuous monitoring of
      microenvironmental status during use. The study Research Nurse will repeat the pelvic region
      skin check and participants will complete a questionnaire based on the QUEST 2.0 user
      satisfaction instrument. All responses will be documented as part of the QS/DC program.
