  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a frequent and serious disease, with many complications. Diabetic foot ulcers are
      a frequent complication. Infection of diabetic foot ulcers is common, and requires heavy
      medical and/or surgical treatments. Antibiotherapy is one of the main options for the
      treatment of the diabetic foot ulcers, but it has many side effects.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness and safety of medical treatments, in this
      population of patients.

    <description>Effectiveness :
For soft tissue infections, remission is defined by the disappearance of any functional or physical sign of infection,
For osteomyelitis, remission is defined as the absence of clinical and /or radiological recurrence at the initial site one year after antibiotic therapy cessation.</description>
