  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of kinseio taping on functional
      capacity, pulmonary functions, respiratory muscle strength, severity of dyspnea, severity of
      fatigue in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Assessment of patients was done
      baseline and 6th week.

      Eligible patients for the study randomly allocated to Kinesio Taping Group (KTG), or Control
      Group (CG). Both groups received three different deep breathing exercises (diaphragmatic,
      thoracic, and lateral basal), each consisting of three sets of 10 repetitions, with 30
      seconds of rest between each set. KTG also received thoracic kinesio taping application.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a valid, reliable and useful test for assessing functional capacity of COPD patients. This test assesses distance walked over 6 minutes as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity/endurance.</description>

    <measure>Change in pulmonary functions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function test (PFT) is a generic term used to indicate a battery of studies or maneuvers that may be performed using standardized equipment to measure lung function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in respiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of respiratory muscle strength is useful in order to detect respiratory muscle weakness and to quantify its severity. Respiratory muscle strength is assessed by mouth pressures sustained for 1 s during maximaş static manoeuvre against a closed shutter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in severity of dyspnoea</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale is a valid and reliable test for measuring the severity of dyspnea of COPD patients. This scale ranges from 0 to 4. A higher value represents a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in severity of fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6th week</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Borg Scale (MBS) is a useful scale for severity of fatigue. This scale ranges from 0 to 10. A higher value represents a worse outcome (0=not at all, 10=maximal).</description>

    <description>The material used for thoracic kinesio taping application was Kinesio® Tex Gold™ (Kinesio Holding. Patients were instructed to sit upright on an armless chair with no back support, with knees flexed to 90 degrees, feet on the floor and arms relaxed. Kinesio tape was applied anteriorly and posteriorly to facilitate respiratory muscles (primarily diaphragm) along the subcostal area. Additionally, two more kinesio tapes were applied to upper trapezius and scalene muscles' area which lies between neck and acromion at both sides (left and right).</description>
