  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing number in patient's undergoing kidney transplantation in the United
      States. Furthermore, kidney recipients have high occurrence of 30-day readmissions that leads
      to high hospital costs and decreased quality of life for transplant recipients. A previous
      research finds that high levels of post-transplant anxiety is correlated with increased
      likelihood of 30-day readmissions. The goal of this study is to design and implementat a
      randomized control trial (RCT) using a standardized post-transplant mentoring program in
      order to reduce 30-day readmission and post-transplant anxiety among recipients.

      In this research, the investigators will seek to examine the efficacy of using former
      patients as mentors to newly transplanted patients and its relationship with patient anxiety
      following discharge as well as the prevention of 30-day readmissions for kidney transplant
      recipients. The primary hypothesis is that the treatment group of patients who undergo a
      targeted mentorship program will be better compliant with the discharge instructions and will
      perform better when compared to the control group who undergoes current routine
      post-transplantation care. Evidence from this experiment can help advance our understanding
      of patient-engagement in the continuity of care delivery, decrease patient readmission rates,
      and improve overall cost utilization.

      Methods:

      The investigators will conduct a single institution randomized control trial assigning
      patients getting discharged after a kidney transplant to a treatment group that involves a
      30-day mentoring initiative by former transplant patients, and comparing the efficacy with a
      similar control group. The overall study period will be divided into the following sections,
      summarized in Figure 1.

    <description>Patients assigned to treatment arm will receive standard post-transplantation discharge care that includes weekly follow-up visits and 24-hour access to transplant triage call center. In addition, they will be matched with a mentor who will conduct 5 meetings with the patients (which includes one video chat meeting, 4 30-minute phone calls) and discuss the following topics related to post-discharge: Medications, Lab Work, Fluid Intake and Adherence to doctor's appointment</description>
