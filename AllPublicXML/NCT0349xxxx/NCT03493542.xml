      This study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of Gardasil™
      (quadrivalent human papillomavirus [qHPV] vaccine, V501) in Chinese girls aged 9-19 years and
      young women aged 20-26 years. The primary hypothesis of the study states that a 3-dose
      regimen of V501 induces non-inferior geometric mean titers (GMTs) for serum anti-HPV 6,
      anti-HPV 11, anti-HPV 16, anti-HPV 18 in girls aged 9-19 years compared to young women aged
      20-26 years.
