  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will look at the cardiovascular risk factors as they arise, as well at the need for
      further revascularization after at least 10 years of coronary revascularization in Middle
      Eastern patients
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Middle Eastern patients aged 18 years or above presenting to cardiology service at one
      tertiary care center who had coronary revascularization (stent or coronary bypass surgery,
      i.e., index procedure) at least 10 years back, will interviewed to determine:

        1. Evolution of cardiovascular risk factors in the period from index procedure to time of
           interview. These risk factors include; hypertension, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia and
           obesity.

        2. Need for further arterial revascularization from the index procedure to time of
           interview.

           These arterial revascularization procedures include A. Coronary: stent and/or bypass
           surgery B. Carotid endarterectomy. C. peripheral arterial revascularization D. Renal
           artery stent.

        3. Medications used at the time if interview with special emphases on the
           guideline-recommended medications including antiplatelet agents, beta blockers, statins
           and renin angiotensin blockers.

        All comers who had undergone coronary stent or bypass surgery 10 years or more prior to
        interview. These patients will be asked about the appearance of new cardiovascular risk
        factors during this period and whether they had undergone further operations or procedures
        to the coronary arteries, carotid arteries, lower limb arteries ir renal arteries.
