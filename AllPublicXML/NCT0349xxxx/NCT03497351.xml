  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SVV is clinically affected by a variety of factors, such as abdominal pressure, body
      position, tidal volume, type and temperature of liquid treatment, etc. There are few reports
      on the effects of drugs on SVV.

      In clinical anesthesia, surgical stimulation and stress can affect patient hemodynamic
      stability, used in intraoperative vascular active drug is inevitable, they shrink or dilate
      blood vessels, speed up or slow down the heart rate, makes the ventricular preload and
      corresponding changes in the SV. Now, there is a study on SVV and PPV in patients with
      hypertension, but there are few reports on the effect of blood pressure drugs on the changes
      in patients' threshold.

    <description>The patients in Group N were infused the 130/0.4 hydroxyethyl starch and sodium chloride injection ( 7 ml/kg, 0.4 ml/kg/min) after anesthesi induction and before skin incision. Then the HR, SAP, DAP, MAP, CO, CI, SV, SVI, PPV and SVV were recorded. When the circulation was stability, Nicardipine was given, and the the 130/0.4 hydroxyethyl starch and sodium chloride injection was infused again.</description>
