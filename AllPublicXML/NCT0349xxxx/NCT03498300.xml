      This study evaluates the seroprevalence of Bordetella pertussis antibodies and anti-pertussis
      antibodies response after its single dose of reduced-antigen, combined diphtheria, tetanus,
      and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) in Thai pregnant women.

      All participants with no immunity against pertussis will receive Tdap vaccine, while immune
      participants will be equally randomized into 2 groups. Half of immune participants will
      receive Tdap vaccine and the other half will receive dT vaccine as standard protocol.
