  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are performing this research study to understand the role of sleep
      disturbance on the incidence/severity of delirium after surgery. The investigators will study
      the brain using a polysomnography device (PSG), which records the brain's electrical activity
      during sleep.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this study, PSG recordings will be collected and a sleep questionnaire will be
      administered to participants on the night before surgery in order to establish level of
      preexisting sleep disturbance. Delirium assessments will be conducted during the
      postoperative period. Further cognitive, quality of life and pain questionnaires will be
      administered perioperatively.
