      The primary objectives of this study are to:

        -  Evaluate recruitment procedures and adherence rates;

        -  Evaluate the ability to understand the concepts of pain neurophysiology;

        -  Evaluate the acceptability of an intervention program based on pain neuroscience
           education and exercise by institutionalized older adults and the institutions where they
           are.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be older adults with pain that are institutionalized and assess the
      feasibility of implementing an intervention consisting of pain neuroscience education in
      addition to exercise. It is antecipated that the intervention will consist of 1 to 2 sessions
      per week during 8 weeks and will be delivered in small groups. Participants will be assessed
      for pain intensity, duration, catastrophizing, fear of movement, knowledge of pain
      neuroscience, depression and performance.
