  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to determine the extent to which eating black pepper
      together with vegetables increase the absorption of carotenoids (a class of important
      nutrients) in the vegetables such as beta-carotene.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Black pepper has multiple health-promoting effects, many of which are associated with the
      relatively high levels of piperine it contains. Piperine can enhance the oral bioavailability
      of nutraceuticals in foods due to its inhibitory activity on drug metabolizing enzymes such
      as cytochrome P450 and p-glycoprotein in the gastrointestinal mucosa. This decreases the
      first-pass metabolism of nutraceuticals thus increasing their levels in the systemic
      circulation. Numerous studies in both animals and humans have validated the efficacy of
      piperine in boosting nutraceutical bioavailability. However, most of these studies utilized
      highly purified sources of both piperine and nutraceuticals, and therefore do not provide
      direct evidence on the ability of black pepper (used as a spice) to enhance the
      bioavailability of nutraceuticals in real foods.
