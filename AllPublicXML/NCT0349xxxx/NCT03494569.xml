      This phase I studies the side effects and best dose of total marrow and lymphoid irradiation
      when given together with fludarabine and melphalan before donor stem cell transplant in
      treating participants with high-risk acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Giving
      chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and melphalan, and total marrow and lymphoid irradiation
      before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow,
      including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy stem
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make
      stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose (MTD/RP2D) of total
      marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) with fixed doses of fludarabine and melphalan (FM100)
      as a preparative regimen in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (alloHCT) and who are not eligible for standard myeloablative regimens, with
      either a matched donor (Arm A) or a haploidentical donor (Arm B).

      II. To describe toxicities attributable to TMLI by dose level in patients treated under this
      regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of the regimen, at each dose level, by assessing the following:
      type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration of adverse events, including
      acute/chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), infection and delayed engraftment.

      II. To investigate the temporal effect of bone marrow residual damage in alloHCT patients
      after TMLI/FM100.

      III. To estimate overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), cumulative incidence (CI)
      of relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.

      IV. Assess minimal residual disease (MRD) from bone marrow aspirates on days 30, 100, and 180
      post-transplant and describe its relation to TMLI dose level and patient disease status.

      V. To evaluate effect of TMLI/FM100 conditioning on immune reconstitution after alloHCT in
      patients receiving stem cells from matched or haploidentical donors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TMLI.

      Participants undergo TMLI twice daily (BID) on days -8 to -5, and receive fludarabine
      intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 and melphalan on day -2. Participants then undergo
      alloHCT on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up twice weekly for 100 days,
      twice monthly for 6 months, and then monthly or yearly for up to 2 years.

             would impair his/her ability to be compliant with the medical regimen and to tolerate
             transplantation or would prolong hematologic recovery in which the opinion of the
             principal investigator would place the recipient at unacceptable risk

          -  Patients may not have had a prior autologous or allogeneic transplant

          -  DONOR: Evidence of active infection

          -  DONOR: Medical or physical reason which makes the donor unlikely to tolerate or
             cooperate with growth factor therapy or leukapheresis

          -  DONOR: Factors which place the donor at increased risk for complications from
             leukapheresis or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy could be
