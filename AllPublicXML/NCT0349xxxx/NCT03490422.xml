      This Trial evaluated the extent of pulp survival following pulpotomy in the permanent tooth
      pulp exposed by caries and identify potential risk factors for pulpal complications.

    <textblock>
      Healthy patients â‰¥ 21 years old were recruited with informed consent. Inclusion criteria were
      symptomatic and asymptomatic periodontally sound teeth, positive response to pulp sensibility
      tests, pulp exposure by caries with bleeding, haemostasis achieved within 10 minutes and
      normal apical tissues. Under local anaesthesia and rubber dam isolation, caries was removed
      before pulpotomy. Pain complaint, clinical and radiographic data were collected during
      recalls for up to 3 years.
