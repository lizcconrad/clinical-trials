  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound-guided SAPB is a facial plane block which maintained analgesia with blockade of
      lateral branches of intercostal nerves at above or below serratus plane muscle. There are few
      cases and studies in the literature reporting successful analgesia provided by SAPB in VATS
      operations. The serratus plane block is used in our clinic for postoperative analgesia in
      VATS operations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the postoperative pain scores and use
      of analgesia in patients performed with the serratus plane block in VATS operations in a

      1-year period.

      Approval for the study was granted by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee and all
      procedures were carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. A retrospective
      examination was made of the anesthesia forms of patients underwent VATS May 2016 and June
      2017. Due to incomplete data of 1 of these 35 patients, that case was excluded from the
      study. The patients were divided into two groups. 24 patients were performed SAPB and iv PCA
      (intravenous patient controlled analgesia) and 10 patient's pain management were provided
      with only PCA. No block was administered to 10 patients because of anticoagulant therapy and
      patient refused block application. The demographic data of the patients (age, gender,
      operation type, and duration) were obtained from the anesthesia forms. The postoperative pain
      scores of the patients, evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) at 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours
      postoperatively and the postoperative doses of analgesia used were taken from the block pain
      follow-up forms
