  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Busulfan (Bu) has been widely used for the treatment of neoplastic and non-neoplastic
      hematological disturbances, with satisfactory results in terms of successful hematopoietic
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Individual monitoring of the Bu dosage, which is done by
      means of various blood sample collections, is necessary for the purpose of attaining ideal
      therapeutic levels and minimizing systemic toxicity. This procedure sometimes becomes costly
      to and uncomfortable for the patient. Saliva has been analyzed as a possible alternative
      fluid for this monitoring.

      The first objective of this project is to verify the feasibility of using the analysis of
      salivary concentration of BU during individual adjustments of this drug in the period that
      precedes HSCT. Another question related to this project is with reference to the effects that
      the Bu concentration in saliva has on the mucosa of the digestive tract, particularly with
      regard to mucositis and salivary changes. Thus, the second objective of this project is to
      verify whether there is any association between salivary changes, cytological changes in the
      oral mucosa, degrees of mucositis and concentration of Bu in saliva. An analysis will be
      performed of the Bu concentration in saliva and in blood, as well as the salivary dosage of
      total proteins, albumin, amylase, antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and
      glutathione reductase) and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. In addition,
      morphological analysis will be made, and rate of apoptosis of cells of the oral mucosa will
      be analyzed. If the efficacy of saliva for the individual adjustment of the dose of Bu is
      confirmed, this method could facilitate the dissemination of pharmacokinetic monitoring of
      this drug in chemotherapy and HSCT centers. In addition, it is expected that the results of
      the present project will allow establishment of the toxicity indicators of BU detected by
      analysis of saliva and the cells of the oral mucosa, thereby allowing the early adoption of
      preventive actions for reducing the frequency and severity of mucositis, a fact that may have
      a positive impact on the success of HSCT.
