  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-week crossover study that will compare how the body absorbs and tolerates two
      different forms of lipoic acid: R form and racemic form.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This three-week double-blind crossover trial will compare two different forms of lipoic acid
      (LA). Every participant will take one week of daily oral 600mg R LA, have a one week washout
      period without LA, and take one week of daily oral 1200mg racemic LA. The order of LA type
      will be determined by randomization. Blood analyses will be performed to determine which form
      is better absorbed and a side effects questionnaire will be completed at each visit in order
      to determine which form is better tolerated.

    <measure>Comparison of oral tolerance between R-LA and racemic LA</measure>
    <time_frame>Obtained at first (Visits 1 and 3) and last doses (visits 2 and 4) of each form of LA. Each visit is approximately a week apart.</time_frame>
    <description>Oral tolerance will be determined by the completion of a modified Monitoring of Side Effects Scale at each study visit. This scale asks the participant to rate the following side effects: abdominal pain, appetite: decreased, appetite: increased, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea/vomiting, taste abnormality (metallic, etc.), thirst: increased, thirst: decreased, and weight: increased. Each side effect will be rated on severity. 0 - the lowest possible score represents &quot;not present&quot;. 4 - the highest possible score represents &quot;severe&quot;. The relative change in total tolerance score will be compared between R-LA and racemic LA.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of serum bioavailability as measured by Area Under the Curve (0-infinity) between R-LA and racemic LA</measure>
    <time_frame>Obtained at first (Visits 1 and 3) and last doses (visits 2 and 4) of each form of LA. Each visit is approximately a week apart.</time_frame>
    <description>Serum bioavailability, as measured by Area Under the Curve (0-infinity) will be compared between R-LA and racemic LA by obtaining concentration values at times 0, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes after ingestion of LA dose on the first (visits 1 and 3) and last doses (visits 2 and 4) of each LA form.</description>
