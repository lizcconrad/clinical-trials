  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomised controlled trial investigating a combination of unilateral
      strength training (cross-education) and mirror therapy for the rehabilitation of lower limb
      impairment following a stroke. This study has been conducted as part of a PhD qualification
      at the Institute of Technology Sligo in Ireland with all assessments being conducted at the
      institute and all therapy sessions taking place at the participant's home. The study was
      conducted in conjunction with Sligo University Hospital and it attained ethical approval
      through the relevant University Hospital Ethics Committee.

      The study necessitated patients with chronic stroke to perform a strength training programme
      with their less-affected lower limb. The mirror and strength training group observed the
      reflection of the training limb in a mirror, the strength training only group exercised
      without a mirror entirely. Patients were referred through Hospital Health Professionals.
      Prior to trial commencement all participants were given comprehensive trial information and
      provided signed written informed consent. A total of 35 participants were recruited. After a
      warm-up participants performed 4 sets of 5 maximal isometric ankle dorsiflexion contractions
      with their less-affected lower limb, three days per week, for four weeks. Patients received
      outcome assessment prior to the beginning of the intervention, directly after it and at
      three-month follow-up assessment. All assessments were carried out by a blinded Chartered
      Physiotherapist specialising in stroke rehabilitation. Patients were assessed using
      established outcome measures for lower limb isometric strength, motor function, muscle tone,
      and self-perceived participation.

    <description>Assessed with the Biodex System 3 Pro Isokinetic Dynamometer with the Biodex Advantage Software version 3.45 (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc., Shirley, New York, USA). Peak Torque, Rate of Torque Development and Average Torque over a single contraction was analysed. A higher torque measurement indicates a greater contraction strength.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG).</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health activity level. Used to measure basic mobility and balance manoeuvres; the ability to perform sequential motor tasks relative to walking and turning. Minimal Detectable Change = 2.9 seconds. A faster time indicates better functional ability.</description>

    <measure>10 Metre Walk Test (10MWT).</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health activity level. Used to assess walking velocity in metres per second (m/s) over a short duration. Lower times indicate an increased walking velocity. Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is reported as; Small meaningful change = 0.06 m/s and Substantial meaningful change = 0.14 m/s. A higher score indicates a faster walking velocity.</description>

    <description>Measurement of self-perceived impact of stroke over 6 domains of a patient's life (mobility, physical independence, occupation, social integration, orientation, and economic self - sufficiency). Scoring range of 0 to 1, where a score of 1 indicated 'No Disadvantage and a score of 0 indicates 'most severe disadvantage'.</description>

    <description>Patients performed 4 sets of 5 maximal isometric ankle dorsiflexions with their less-affected lower limb while observing the reflection of the exercising limb in the mirror which was placed in the patient's mid-sagittal plane.

    <description>Mirror Therapy involved the patient sitting on a chair with a standard mirror placed between both legs with the reflective side of the mirror facing the non-affected leg. The patient is instructed to observe the reflection of the non-affected limb during the sessions. The patient was not given any instruction on the use of the affected limb.</description>

    <description>Cross-education of strengthening involves training one side of the body with the intention of producing strengthening gains on both sides of the body. In this case the strengthening was done on the non-affected leg of each stroke patient.</description>
