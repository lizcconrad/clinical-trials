      Edoxaban (also referred to as Lixiana) is an anti-clotting drug, approved by Health Canada
      for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm).
      This study is being done to try to determine the best time to start apixaban treatment after
      an ischemic stroke has occurred.

      The purpose of the LASER study is to determine the safety of early edoxaban use after
      TIA/ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation using advanced MR imaging. This
      study will also gather information about participant general well being, mental status, and
      the effects of the TIA/stroke on daily living, as well as CT and MRI of the brain.

      The primary aim of the Lixiana Acute Stroke Evaluation Registry is to demonstrate the safety
      of edoxaban initiation within 5 days of cardioembolic stroke. Safety will be established by
      demonstrating low rates of hemorrhage in this setting. The secondary aim is to identify
      clinical, imaging and RNA transcript predictors of hemorrhagic transformation after
      cardioembolic stroke.

      The Investigators hypothesize that initiation of edoxaban within 5 days of stroke/TIA will
      not be associated with increased symptomatic HT rates, relative to patients in whom
      anticoagulation is delayed. The Investigators further hypothesize that early edoxaban
      initiation will be associated with a lower rate of recurrent ischemic stroke than those in
      whom it is delayed. The Investigators also hypothesize that RNA expressed in leukocytes at
      time of stroke can stratify risk of HT in patients treated with edoxaban.

      The Lixiana Acute Stroke Evaluation Registry (LASER) is a randomized controlled trial with an
      associated registry. Patients with previously known or newly diagnosed AF and acute ischemic
      stroke will be screened in the Emergency Departments or stroke units. A total of 150 male and
      female participants will be recruited. Informed consent will be obtained from the participant
      or substitute decision maker, in all cases prior to enrolment.

      Participants will be randomized (2:1) to early (≤5 days; n=100) or delayed (6-14 days; n=50)
      edoxaban initiation. In participants randomized to early treatment, edoxaban will be
      initiated as soon as possible after the baseline MRI (maximum 24 hours). Participants will be
      treated with edoxaban (60 mg once daily). If the eGFR is ≤50 ml/min kg or body weight ≤60 kg,
      the edoxaban dose will be reduced to 30 mg once daily.

      The primary endpoint is the rate of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (HT) defined as a
      parenchymal haemorrhage &gt;1/3 the volume of the ischemic infarct (ECASS PH2) associated with
      clinical deterioration (worsening of NIHSS score of 4 or more points) within 30 days of
      treatment initiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Diagnosis of minor ischemic stroke, or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA, defined as
             acute focal neurological deficits, with complete resolution of symptoms within 24 h of
             onset) confirmed ≤5 days from symptom onset. In cases where onset time cannot be
             established, it will be considered to be the time when patient was last known to be
             well.

          -  CT scan or MRI, with findings consistent with an ischemic etiology of symptoms.

          -  Atrial Fibrillation (AF, paroxysmal or persistent), confirmed with ECG/Holter monitor,
             or by history (clinical documentation of previous AF must be provided).

          -  Patients prescribed edoxaban by their treating physician following their stroke/TIA.

          -  Ability to obtain consent from patient or legally authorized representative.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute or chronic renal failure, defined as eGFR &lt;30 ml/min (Cockcroft Gault formula).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to edoxaban.

          -  Any significant ongoing systemic bleeding risk, i.e. active GI/GU bleeding or recent
             major surgery.

          -  Any condition that, in the judgment of the investigator could impose hazards to the
             patient if study therapy is initiated or affect the participation of the patient in
             the study.

          -  Recent past history or clinical presentation of ICH, subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH),
             arterio-venous (AV) malformation, aneurysm, or cerebral neoplasm. At the discretion of
             each Investigator.

          -  Hereditary or acquired haemorrhagic diathesis.

          -  Stroke mimics (such as seizures, migraine etc.)

          -  Patients with spontaneous HT with a grade of PH1 or PH2 on the baseline or screening
             imaging will not be eligible for randomization. They will be included in the registry
             portion of LASER and follow-up will be identical to that in the trial.
