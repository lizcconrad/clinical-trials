    <textblock>
      This study assessed the efficacy of three dry mouth products (including an experimental
      Oralbalance gel, oral rinse, and moisturizing spray) to relieve the feeling of dry mouth
      compared to water, in dry mouth population over a period of 28 days.

    <textblock>
      This was a multi-centered (two-sites), examiner-blinded, four treatment arms, stratified (by
      Modified Dry Mouth Inventory [DMI] score), randomized, parallel group study in participants
      with self-reported dry mouth symptoms as determined by participant responses to the DMI.
      Participants used their assigned dry mouth treatment at home for 28 days.
