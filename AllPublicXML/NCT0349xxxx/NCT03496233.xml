      Antiviral treatment of G1b Treatment-Naïve HCV-Infected Patients, with non- severe fibrosis,

      Study Type: Interventional Study Design: Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment Masking:
      Open Label Primary Purpose: Treatment

      Seventy-five (75) treatment-naïve subjects with chronic HCV GT1b infection (without
      cirrhosis) with or without glucose abnormalities such as insulin resistance and or diabetes
      will be consecutively enrolled.

      The investigators decided to include also patients with glucose abnormalities at baseline
      screening since data on these patients are scanty, and inclusion of this subgroup of patients
      better reflects the clinical practice. The study will consecutively enroll patients, without
      fixing a specific rule (e.g. sample allocation ratio) for recruitment of patients with and
      without glucose abnormalities. This will allow to evaluate the proportion of patients with
      and without glucose abnormalities at baseline (a useful approach to understand the impact of
      patients with glucose abnormalities in real life) and to perform explorative analyses to
      compare patients with or without glucose abnormalities according to SVR.

      There will be one treatment group with EBV/GZR (50/100 mg) once daily without regards to food
      for 8 weeks.

      EBV/GZR is manufactured as a 50/100 mg tablet for oral administration. Subjects will take 1
      tablet daily without regards to food.
