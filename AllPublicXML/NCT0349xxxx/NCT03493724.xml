      To study the diagnostic performance of the images on the smartphone compare the result of the
      clinical examination, all the dermatoses combined and by family of pathology (inflammatory,
      wound, oncology, infectious, allergology), during urgent request requests in dermatology

      The study is conducted in the dermatology department, for a maximum duration of 6 months. We
      include patients who require dermatological advice and for whom their doctor sends us
      photographs.

      Doctors contact us by telephone, describe the symptoms and send photographs according to the
      secure procedure.

      Patients are admitted for consultation and the diagnosis by photography is compared with the
      clinical diagnosis
