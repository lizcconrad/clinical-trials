  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to:

        -  Evaluate the effect of visual feedback on the intensity of low back pain, range of
           motion and function of pregnant and non-pregnant women with chronic low back pain.

        -  Determine the association between low back pain, catastrophizing, fear of movement and
           low back perception/image.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is antecipated that 15 pregnant women with low back pain and 15 non-pregnant women with
      low back pain will enter the study. Each group will receive two different interventions, one
      consisting of visual feedback when performing 10 repetitions of low back flexion, extension
      and right and left side-flexion and another intervention consisting of the same low back
      movements without visual feedback. Participants will be assessed for pain intensity, pain
      location, disability, kinesiophobia, catastrophizing, perception of the low back, flexion
      range of motion and time to perform the sit to stand test both at baseline and after the
      intervention.
