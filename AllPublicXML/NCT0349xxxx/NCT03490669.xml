  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of MSC-1. MSC-1 is a
      first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to the immunosuppressive
      human cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and is intended to treat adult patients with
      Advanced Solid Tumors.

      In part 1, multiple dose levels of MSC-1 in patients with Advanced Solid Tumors will be
      studied to determine the recommended dose for further evaluation of safety and efficacy in
      Part 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MSC-1 is a first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to the
      immunosuppressive human cytokine Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), and is intended to treat
      adult patients with advanced solid tumors. LIF is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in many
      physiological and pathological processes including the promotion of an immunosuppressive
      environment. In cancer, it is hypothesized that LIF expressing malignancies co-opt this
      activity, creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment as well as promoting the
      activity of cancer-initiating cell(s) (CICs). LIF is highly expressed in a subset of tumors
      across multiple solid tumor types.

      During dose escalation, patients with Advanced Solid Tumors will be treated with MSC-1 with
      the primary objective of determining the safety and tolerability of MSC-1 and defining an
      appropriate dose for further evaluation in dose expansion. MSC-1 will be administered
      intravenously (IV) until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or
      study termination.

      In dose expansion, up to 4 parallel cohorts of patients with LIF-High tumors (NSCLC, Ovarian
      Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer), and a cohort of mixed Solid Tumors (referred to as the &quot;basket
      cohort&quot;), may be treated at the recommended expansion dose to further characterize the
      safety, tolerability, PK, PD and anti-tumor activity of MSC-1.
