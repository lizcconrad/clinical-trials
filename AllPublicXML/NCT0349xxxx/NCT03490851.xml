    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine, in normal-weight and overweight subjects the
      effect of: Primary: oatmeal containing 4 g oat β-glucan on food intake at a subsequent meal
      compared to Cream of Rice cereal. Secondary: (i) oatmeal containing 2 g oat β-glucan on food
      intake at a subsequent meal compared to Cream of Rice cereal; and (ii) oatmeal containing 2g,
      4g and 4g low MW oat beta-glucan on subjective appetite ratings, gastric emptying,
      postprandial responses of glucose, insulin, ghrelin and PYY levels compared to those elicited
      by Cream of Rice cereal. In addition, the relationship between amount, MW and viscosity of
      OBG and the primary and secondary objectives will be determined.

             participated in a clinical trial involving long-term exposure (greater than 24 hours)
             to an investigational drug, nutritional supplement or lifestyle modification. Subject
             has not participated in another trial involving measurement of postprandial glucose
             response within 5 days of any of the 4 test visits in this study.

          -  Willing to maintain current dietary supplement use throughout the trial. On test days,
             subject agrees not to take any dietary supplements until dismissal from the GI labs.
             Failure to comply will result in a rescheduled test visit.

          -  Normal fasting serum glucose (&lt;7.0mmol/L capillary corresponding to whole blood
             glucose &lt;6.3mmol/L).

             participate in the study and authorization to release relevant protected health
             information to the study investigator.

             function or appetite, including, but not limited to adrenergic blockers, diuretics,
             thiazolidinediones, metformin and systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks of the
             screening visit, or with any condition which might, in the opinion of Dr. Wolever, the
             president of GI Testing, either: 1) make participation dangerous to the subject or to
