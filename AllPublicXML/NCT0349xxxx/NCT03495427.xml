      This study will enroll 60 patients previously enrolled to MCC#18523, &quot;A Validation Study on
      the Impact of Decipher® Testing on Treatment Recommendations in African-American and
      Non-African American Men with Prostate Cancer: (VANDAAM)&quot; that had high risk Decipher test
      results (Decipher score &gt;0.45). Patients with a high genomic classifier (GC) score at
      diagnosis will be approached for formal consenting for PSMA-PET imaging at 2 years post
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normally, some patients with prostate cancer undergo imaging tests to determine the extent
      (spread) of their disease. These imaging tests often give good information, but not in all
      patients and not every time. This study deals with a new imaging test known as
      F-DCFPyL-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography (PET), or
      F-DCFPyL-PSMA PET. The objective of this study is to evaluate safety and usefulness of using
      F-DCFPyL in detecting recurrent/metastatic prostate cancer. The F-DCFPyL PET imaging
      technique is used in some parts of the world but is not currently standard imaging care.
      Better understanding how this new imaging test performs in identifying recurrent/metastatic
      prostate cancer may lead to better management of prostate cancer patients in the future.
