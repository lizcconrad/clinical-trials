  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-interventional study (NIS) is to assess, under real-life conditions,
      woman's satisfaction with Levonogestrel IntraUterine System (LNG-IUS) in a young (18-30 years
      old (y.o.)) Spanish population taking into account their parity status.

      Furthermore, the study is aimed to evaluate the impact of: menstrual bleeding pattern and
      satisfaction with it at baseline, LNG-IUS chosen, previously used contraceptive method and
      reasons for change to/ choice of a LNG-IUS on overall satisfaction with LNG-IUS use.

        Participants will be women in childbearing age between â‰¥18 to 30 years, who have freely

        contraceptive options by their physician at a routine visit prior to the first study visit
        (enrolment) in a routine clinical practice setting. Then, women eligible for the enrolment
        will be visiting the physician in a IUS insertion visit in a gynaecological clinical
        setting.
