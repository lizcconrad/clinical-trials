  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of protein intake has an important role within the nutritional needs of people
      throughout their lives around the world, particularly in developing countries and in
      particular during pregnancy and early childhood. It is likely that adequate protein reduce by
      40% the prevalence of stunting (low height for age) in children under five years, according
      to World Health Organization data. Uncertainty about the quality of the diet, specifically
      with reference to quality proteins has potential impacts on health, economy, agriculture, and
      food security of a nation. The amino acid digestibility estimates based on stool analysis do
      not represent the amount of absorbed amino acid. Ideally, the bioavailable amino acid should
      be measured by methods that assess the difference between consumed and absorbed amino acids.
      However, the uptake of amino acids is not readily non-invasively measured in healthy humans.
      The use of vegetable protein intrinsically labeled by stable isotopes offers a solution to
      this problem. The deuterated water (2H2O), with relatively low cost, is suitable for labeling
      plant proteins such as those of beans. The labeled amino acids are present in the test meal
      ingested and incorporated into the blood, representing a single measure of bioavailability.
      This study aims to develop and apply a new methodology, using stable isotopes, to evaluate
      the bioavailability of bean protein, a very important food in the Brazilian diet, according
      to cooking procedures, through the use of deuterium. The project will be divided into two
      parts: a human nutrition and an agriculture part, the latter by planting/harvesting
      deuterium-labeled Phaseolus vulgaris L. After two weeks of blooming, deuterium water will be
      added to the bean crop, which will be subsequently dried. Chemical analysis and assessment of
      incorporation of deuterium in the beans will be done. Concurrent with the cultivation of
      beans, there will be a protein absorption test with 15 healthy volunteers for validation of
      the methods. For comparison purposes, milk protein labeled with deuterium and C13 will be
      used. The volunteers will consume the test meals. Blood, urine and saliva samples will be
      collected at baseline (before food ingestion), and in different times after the meal. In the
      next phase of this research, labeled beans produced by the agriculture experiment will be
      used to measure the protein absorption of volunteers of different groups (older persons, and
      stunting and non-stunting children). The samples will analyzed by isotope-ratio mass
      spectrometry. This methodology may promote a better understanding of the absorption of
      proteins and amino acids using less invasive methods in different age groups and clinical
      conditions. This work will have an important impact for the general population as well as for
      agriculture and health-related professionals.

      This study is divided in 4 phase. First Phase: Agriculture (Year 1) Site description: The
      experiment will carried out at the Experimental Farm of São Paulo's Agency for Agribusiness
      Technology (APTA) in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, at the geographic coordinates of 21°12'26&quot; S e
      47°51'48&quot; N and average altitude of 646 m. The annual rainfall is about 1427 mm, with average
      maximum and minimum temperature of 25°C and 19.3°C, respectively. The soil is classified as
      Oxitol with glay texture. The bean crop (Phaseolus vulgaris), will be grown at the 0,50m
      between rows with 12 seed per linear meters and at the 2 weeks after anthesis (flowering) the
      water supply will be amended with deuterium oxide to experimental development. The grain
      produced will be harvested to experimental analysis and consumption. The experimental area
      will have 5.000 m2 with common bean crop to produce enough quantity of grains to the
      experiment running. Seeds will be dried in a scale of 1 to 10 kg of dry and selected seeds.

      Nutrients Composition Analysis (Year 1) Six samples of 100g each will be separated for
      nutrients composition analyses, that will be performed at the Animal Nutrition Laboratory of
      the Animal Science Institute of the University of São Paulo, Brazil. Right after harvesting,
      the food samples will be weighted and dried in a stove with forced air circulation at 65
      degrees Celsius, during 72 hours. After this, samples will be ground in a mill with 2 mm hole
      sieve, and a subsample will be taken for the analysis of dry mass, protein, ether extract,
      mineral mass, energy, calcium and phosphorus, according to Official Methods of Analysis
      (AOAC) (1996). Fibre will be analysed in neutral and acid detergent according to reference
      Silva and Queiroz, 2005, and selenium will be analysed according to Olson et al., 1975.
      Energy analysis will be performed by a calorimetric bomb and fat by the extraction according
      to reference Bligh and Dyer, 1959, at the Nutrients Composition Laboratory of the Ribeirão
      Preto Medical School.

      Second phase (pilot study), Nutrition Institute (Year 2) Subjects Fifteen adult volunteers
      will be recruited for method validation. Inclusion criteria

        -  Healthy, non-pregnant adults 18-65 years of age

        -  Not taking any medication, including NSAIDs

        -  Not taking antibiotics within 4 weeks of study

        -  BMI within 18-35 range

        -  Stable weight Exclusion criteria

        -  Children and elderly (over 65)

        -  Pregnancy

        -  Diagnosed with non-communicable or communicable disease

        -  Being under restrictive diet

        -  Antibiotics within 4 weeks of study

        -  Medications within 4 weeks of study Study design After approval of project by local
           ethics committee and obtaining signed informed consent, volunteers will be offered a
           test meal with milk protein. The test protein in the first place will be whole milk
           protein, produced with a low level deuterium enrichment within the study. This will
           permit the Carbon-13 single cell protein to be characterised against a well-studied
           animal protein known to possess high digestibility. Tracer Amino Acid (AA) appearance in
           the circulation (blood; saliva, urine and breath will also be sampled) and the relative
           appearance of test and reference protein will be taken as a measure of relative
           bioavailability which can be converted into an absolute measure once the reference
           protein has been characterised. The basic measurement will be of stable isotope
           enrichment in individual amino acids.

      Phase 1 pilot study, Nutrition Institute. Fifteen adult volunteers will be recruited for
      method validation.

      Third Phase is in 15 children (1-3 years, with different nutritional status) and Fourth phase
      is in 15 elderly (more than 65 years, with sarcopenia or not sarcopenia).

      Test meal 1: Beans soaked for 3 h, water discarded and beans cooked for 20 min in pressure
      cook.

      The test meal will be separated by the use for two weeks of unlabelled beans. The same
      approach as used in the pilot study of milk protein will be adopted to study the
      bioavailability of grain legumes through simultaneous comparison with a modest quantity
      carbon-13 enriched single cell protein combined in the same test meal.

      All groups will be analysed food intake assessment, total urinary nitrogen and enrichment of
      deuterium in protein. Four 24h Recall Questionnaires will be applied to each volunteer during
      the periods of intake of the test meal, in order to verify the protein and calories
      consumption. Volunteers will be asked to keep their usual intake, to avoid changes in food
      consumption. Total urinary nitrogen of the samples will be analysed by the Kjeldahl method
      with ammonium micro diffusion. Compound specific isotope enrichment in amino acids will be
      analysed in saliva, urine, breath and blood samples. Carbon-13 in breath carbon dioxide (CO2)
      and Deuterium in urine enrichment will be analysed in Mass Spectrometry of Medicine School of
      Ribeirão Preto (FMRP-USP), Brazil, SP.
