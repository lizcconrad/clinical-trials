  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A quarter of a million women will develop breast cancer (BC) in this year alone. Many of
      these women will have side effects as a result of their breast cancer treatment. Radiation
      Fibrosis Syndrome (RFS) is a common complication from breast cancer treatment that
      progressively changes tissue and can cause decreased function, pain, and range of motion. The
      PhysioTouch is a hand held device that can be used to treat RFS and may improve the treatment
      of fibrotic tissue. This pilot randomized controlled trial aims to determine the efficacy of
      using the PhysioTouch in addition to current standard of care for treatment of BC-related
      RFS.
