  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CATH-VR study will investigate the effect of virtual reality (VR) on patient pain,
      anxiety, and radial artery vasospasm during coronary angiography. Our hypothesis is that the
      use of VR will decrease patient anxiety and pain via validated scoring systems, as well as
      show a low rate of vasospasm of the radial artery. In addition, we hypothesize that the
      amount of opioid and benzodiazepine medications utilized for procedural sedation will be
      lower in the intervention arm. VR has gained recent attraction as an alternative or
      adjunctive treatment option for pain, but its effect on reducing procedural sedation has not
      been studied. We propose a single center, randomized control pilot study to further
      investigate. The patient population will include adults older than 18 years who present for
      outpatient diagnostic coronary angiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to conduct a prospective, unblinded, randomized control pilot study to test our
      hypothesis that the use of VR will decrease patient anxiety and pain via validated scoring
      systems, as well as show a low rate of vasospasm of the radial artery.

      Patients will be eligible if they are greater than 18 years of age and undergoing an elective
      outpatient coronary angiogram with or without percutaneous intervention. Exclusion criteria
      will include patients with claustrophobia, seizure disorder, motion sickness, stroke within
      the past year, dementia, nausea, isolation status for infection control or those who do not
      wish to participate.

      Outpatients undergoing routine coronary angiography with or without possible percutaneous
      intervention will be screened for enrollment criteria. Those who agree to participate will be
      randomized to either the intervention or control arm. Those randomized to the intervention
      arm and agree to participate in the study will wear a VR Headset and headphones; those who
      are randomized to the control will receive the standard of care, which is moderate sedation
      for patient anxiolysis and pain control during the case. In both arms, the patient and
      operator will still be able to communicate verbally if needed to assess for pain, to ask
      questions, or to ask for anxiolytic or analgesic medications as needed. The procedure will be
      completed when vascular sheaths are just about to be removed.

    <description>Patients randomized to receive a Virtual Reality Intervention will be fitted with a VR headset and headphones and undergo a continuous immersive meditation experience. This will begin immediately prior to the start of the procedure, and continue until the procedure is completed.
Patient pain and anxiety levels will be frequently assessed by procedure operator and circulating nurse, and pain medication or anxiolytic medications will be administered in the absence of contraindications. Baseline amounts of sedation pre-procedurally will not be used in either arm. Pain and Anxiety Scores will be assessed pre, intra, and post-procedurally. If no contraindications, the operator will decide upon how much sedation medication to administer if indicated or requested. This is the usual manner in which pain and anxiety is treated in the cath lab.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to the comparison arm will not undergo the Virtual Reality Intervention. Baseline amounts of sedation pre-procedurally will not be used in either arm. Subjects will be assessed periodically by physicians and/or circulating nurses for their pain and anxiety levels. The patient may also prompt the staff that they are anxious or in pain, and if no contraindications, the operator will decide upon how much medication to administer. This is the usual manner in which pain and anxiety is treated in the cath lab.</description>
