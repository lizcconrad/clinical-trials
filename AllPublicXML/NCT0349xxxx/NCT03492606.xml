    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease associated with
      uncontrolled inflammation and autoimmunity and for which there is still an unmet need for new
      diagnostic and therapeutic options, especially for the progressive forms. Recent studies
      suggest that chronic inflammation can be a consequence of failure to resolve inflammation,
      the resolution of which is mediated by a newly discovered genus of highly potent
      anti-inflammatory lipids derived metabolically from omega-3 essential fatty acids and termed
      specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs).

      Herein, we propose to identify SPMs as leads for the control of MS pathology and progression
      and to propose them as novel disease-modifying treatments by assessing their ex vivo/in vitro
      and in vivo role in modulating the balance of effector and regulatory cells and/or the
      mechanisms leading to chronicity as wells as in promoting activation of anti-inflammatory and
      neuroprotective pathways.

    <textblock>
      Uncontrolled or unresolved inflammation is associated with several widely occurring diseases
      such as multiple sclerosis (MS), which is the most common chronic inflammatory demyelinating
      disease of the central nervous system and a major cause of disability, triggered by an
      autoimmune response to myelin that eventually leads to progressive neurodegeneration.Although
      knowledge on its underlying immunopathogenesis has considerably improved and is mostly
      believed to be mediated by autoreactive T cells that cause oligodendrocyte death and axonal
      damage, resulting in demyelination, synaptic alteration, and neuronal loss, there is still an
      unmet need for new diagnostic and therapeutic options, especially for the progressive forms
      of MS for which no drugs are still available. In recent years, previously unrecognized
      metabolites, termed specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), temporally and
      spatially synthesized from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, were identified and have
      emerged as biomarkers and potent mediators that control the magnitude and extent of
      inflammatory events by activating local resolution programs. Despite emerging data suggest
      that SPMs might control chronic inflammation, research on these mediators on MS is still
      absent. Thus, a detailed investigation is needed to identify SPMs as modulators of
      inflammation and disease progression in MS, which might lead to the development of new
      disease-modifying treatments.

      Hypothesis and Significance:

      Our hypothesis is that the underlying mechanism of chronic inflammation in MS could be the
      failure of activating pro-resolving mechanisms, involving the newly discovered omega-3
      essential fatty acids-derived mediators of resolution of inflammation: resolvins, maresins,
      and protectins. Endogenous mechanisms that curtail excessive inflammation and promptits
      timely resolution are of considerable interest; our findings that these SPMs (recently
      identified also in human lymphoidorgans, where most naïve-to-effector T cell differentiation
      occurs) exert a non-cytotoxic regulatory role on cells central inautoimmunity, acting on the
      balance between pathogenic Th1/Th17 and tolerogenic Treg cells - typically altered in MS
      -represents a promising beginning for a new avenue of research for MS. The elucidation of
      these mechanisms operating invivo to keep acute inflammation within physiologic boundaries as
      well as to stimulate resolution and prevent chronicinflammation is particularly significant
      and offers a novel opportunity to manage MS.

      Preliminary Data:

      Thanks to an ongoing collaboration with Prof. Serhan from Harvard Medical School (the father
      and inventor of SPMs) we have demonstrated for the first time that specific SPMs modulate
      adaptive immune responses in human peripheral blood T cells. These SPMs strongly reduce
      cytokine production from activated T cells, prevent naïve CD4 T-cell differentiation into Th1
      and Th17 and enhance the de novo generation and function of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Tregs)
      cells. These results are supported in vivo in a mouse model deficient elongase 2 (Elovl2-/-),
      the key enzyme for DHA synthesis (the precursor of resolvins and maresins). These findings
      suggest that SPMs might act on the balance between pathogenic Th1/Th17 and tolerogenic Treg
      cells and provide a new evidence for SPM-based therapeutic approaches to modulate T-cell
      mediated chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

      Specific Aims:

      Characterization of the resolution code of inflammation in MS patientsInvestigation of SPMs
      potential in modulating ex vivo/in vitro T cells in MS patientsExploitation of the
      therapeutic potential of SPMs in animal models of MS

        20 recurrent-remitting patients (RR-MS) and 10 primary-progressive patients (P-MS),
        according to the MacDonald or Poser method, without any type of treatment and 15 healthy
        donors of the same age and with no previous history of neurological diseases. Blood samples
        will be recruited at the IRCCS INM Neuromed, under the supervision of dr. Fabio Buttari who
        will make the diagnosis. The diagnosis of MS will be performed according to the criteria of
        MacDonald or Poser. On this occasion, the patient will be offered participation in the
        study, giving informed consent and explaining in non-technical language, what the research
        consists of, which parameters will be evaluated and for what purpose. Once consent is
        obtained from the patients, venous samples will be taken (15 mL).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion in the study is foreseen for sex subjects, ideally in a ratio of 1: 2.5 in favor
        of the female (according to the incidence of the disease), aged between 18 and 60 years,
        affected by the recurrent form - Multiple sclerosis emitter with EDSS between 1 and 3.
        Blood sampling will be performed at least one month after the last cortisone treatment.
        Taking into account that 20% of the enrolled patients could have a variability in the cell
        count of the monocytes to be purified, the number of the sample up to 24 is better than
        20%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who have at least one of the following characteristics will not be included in the
        study:

          1. subjects with CNS or autoimmune diseases

          2. subjects affected by RR-MS in immunomodulatory treatment

          3. subjects with RR-MS with monocytosis, infections or fever
