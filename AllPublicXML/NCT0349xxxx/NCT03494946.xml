    <textblock>
      The trial is a randomized control trial. Patients are randomized between Ltx and other
      treatment that may include further chemotherapy, TACE, SIRT or other available treatment
      options. The patients will be randomized 1:1 to Ltx and chemotherapy/other treatment options.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with non-resectable CRC liver metastases evaluated at the liver MDT at Oslo
      University Hospital, Rikshospitalet will be included in the study. Patients should have
      progressive disease on 1.line chemotherapy or the treatment should have been stopped due to
      toxicity. Patients randomized to Ltx will if applicable stop bevazicumab. All patients (both
      arms) will start further treatment that may include chemotherapy, TACE, SIRT or other
      available treatment options. Patients not receiving a donor liver graft within 3 months after
      listing for transplantation will be taken off the waiting list and transferred to the
      chemotherapy/other treatment option group. Patients randomized to Ltx and developing
      progressive disease beyond the inclusion/exclusion criteria during the time on the waiting
      list will be excluded from the study and receive best treatment option at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

          -  Liver metastases, not amenable to liver resection

          -  No signs of extra hepatic metastatic disease or local recurrence according to PET/CT

             6 weeks prior to the faculty meeting at the transplant unit, except resectable lung
             lesions all &lt; 15mm.

          -  No signs of extra hepatic metastatic disease on PET/CT within 6 weeks prior to the
             faculty meeting at the transplant unit, except patients may have resectable lung
