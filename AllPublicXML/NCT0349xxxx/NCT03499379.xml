      Determine what kind of side effects women experience in the first year after they start using
      an intrauterine device.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if there is a difference in levels of stress
      hormones in women who use copper or hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs). This study will
      provide more information on the potential effect of levonorgestrel intrauterine system
      (LNG-IUS) use on an individual's stress response. Ultimately, this study hopes to provide
      data to better counsel women on potential mood effects of the LNG-IUS. From a research and
      clinical management perspective, hair cortisol may provide a tool to evaluate women at risk
      for discontinuation of hormonal contraception due to concern of mood symptoms.
