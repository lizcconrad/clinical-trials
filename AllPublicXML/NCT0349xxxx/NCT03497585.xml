    <textblock>
      This study explores whether it is feasible to use a newly developed activity pacing framework
      to standardise how activity pacing is instructed by healthcare professionals in
      rehabilitation programmes for patients with chronic pain/fatigue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Activity pacing is frequently advised in the management of chronic pain/fatigue, including
      chronic low back pain, chronic widespread pain/fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue
      syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. However, there is no agreed definition of 'activity
      pacing' and it is instructed in various ways. For some, pacing involves adapting/limiting
      activities (for example, breaking down tasks/having rests); while for others, pacing involves
      having consistent activities/gradually increasing activities. Furthermore, pacing has been
      associated with both improved symptoms (decreased fatigue/anxiety/depression) and worsened
      symptoms (increased pain/disability).

      Due to the high prevalence and cost (personal and financial) of chronic pain/fatigue, it is
      imperative that coping strategies such as pacing are clearly defined and evidence-based. This
      study involves Stage III in the development of an activity pacing framework to standardise
      how pacing is instructed by healthcare professionals. Stage I: Online Survey of pacing
      involved 92 healthcare professionals (doctors/nurses/physiotherapists/occupational
      therapists/clinical psychologists). The survey findings, together with existing research were
      used to develop the pacing framework. The framework was further developed in Stage II:
      Nominal Group Technique (consensus meeting), involving four patients and six healthcare
      professionals.

      Stage III will test the feasibility of implementing the pacing framework clinically, by using
      it to underpin existing rehabilitation programmes for chronic pain/fatigue. Patients will
      attend rehabilitation programmes at the study sites as per usual practice. Patients'
      participation in this study involves their completion of a booklet of questionnaires. The aim
      of this feasibility study is to explore whether the activity pacing framework is usable in
      the clinical setting, to explore recruitment/retention rates, together with changes in
      symptoms between the start and end of treatment, and at 3-months follow-up. Stage III will
      also explore the acceptability of the framework by undertaking interviews with the patients
      and healthcare professionals involved in the rehabilitation programmes. Stage III is expected
      to last 22 months.

      Future study will test the framework in a clinical trial to assess the effects of pacing on
      patients' symptoms. The pacing framework has the potential to improve treatments by providing
      guidance on the components of pacing found to have benefits for patients.

      This study is funded by a HEE/NIHR ICA Clinical Lectureship.

    <description>The Activity Pacing Questionnaire (APQ) was developed to measure different themes of activity pacing. The APQ was initially validated among a sample of patients with chronic pain/fatigue and contained 26 items. Factor analysis identified five themes of pacing contained within the APQ-26: activity adjustment, activity consistency, activity planning, activity acceptance and activity progression.
The APQ-26 has been modified for the purpose of this study with the addition of two items to correspond to important aspects of pacing that were not included in the APQ-26. The APQ-28 reflects the content of the activity pacing framework.
The APQ-28 will be used to assess the changes in activity pacing from baseline (pre-treatment: up to one week before the programme) to end of the programme (6-week's programme).</description>

    <description>The activity pacing framework will be used to structure and standardise the instructions of pacing in existing rehabilitation programmes for adult patients with chronic pain/fatigue. The activity pacing framework has been developed in Stages I and II of this research. Stage I involved an online survey of activity pacing across healthcare professionals in England. The survey findings, together with existing research were used to develop the first draft of the framework. The framework was refined in Stage II: Nominal group technique (consensus method). The activity pacing framework describes the aims, facets and stages of pacing, together with how pacing relates to different behavioural typologies and other pain management strategies.</description>

        example, chronic low back pain, chronic widespread pain, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue
        syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). The study population includes those patients
        who are referred to the physiotherapy departments of The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust
        and who attend a rehabilitation programme. The activity pacing framework will be used to
        structure and standardise the pacing component of the programme.

          -  Patients aged ≥18 years

          -  Patients able to read/write in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of a serious underlying pathology, such as a current diagnosis
             of cancer

          -  Patients with severe mental health/cognitive functioning issues

        Acceptability Study (qualitative interviews) Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an initial GP/hospital consultant referral to The Pennine Acute
             Hospitals NHS Trust with diagnoses of chronic low back pain, chronic widespread pain,
             fibromyalgia or CFS/ME, with a minimum symptom duration of 3 months (as per the
             feasibility study).

          -  Patients who attended a minimum of one session of the rehabilitation programme, who
             consented to the study and completed the first questionnaire booklet. Patients do not
             need to have completed the programme, since the interviews will include patients who
             both completed and did not complete the programme.

          -  Qualified healthcare professionals delivering the rehabilitation programmes who
             received training in using the activity pacing framework: physiotherapists and
             psychological wellbeing practitioners employed by The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS
             Trust and Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust.
