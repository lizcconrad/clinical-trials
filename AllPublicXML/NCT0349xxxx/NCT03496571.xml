  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects
      of AK002, given monthly for 4 doses. It is hypothesized that AK002 is more effective than
      placebo control (alternative hypothesis) in reducing the number of eosinophils per high power
      field (HPF) in gastric and duodenal biopsies before and after receiving AK002 or placebo
      versus no difference between AK002 and placebo control (null hypothesis).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female aged ≥18 and ≤80 years at the time of signing Informed Consent Form
             (ICF).

          2. Symptoms of EG abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or nausea.

          3. Eosinophilia of the gastric mucosae without any other cause for the gastric
             eosinophilia (e.g., parasitic or other infection or malignancy).

          4. Subjects must have failed or not be adequately controlled on standard of care
             treatments for EG (which could include proton-pump-inhibitors (PPIs), systemic or
             topical corticosteroids, and/or diet, among others).

          5. If on other treatments for EG, EGE, or Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) at enrollment,
             stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to screening and willingness to continue on
             that dose for the duration of the study. [Only 4 weeks prior to screening for a
             proton-pump-inhibitor (PPI)].

          6. If on beta blockers at enrollment, ability and willingness to not take dose ≥24 hours
             prior to and on the day of each infusion of study drug.

          7. If patient is on pre-existing dietary restrictions, willingness to maintain dietary
             restrictions throughout the study, as much as possible.

          8. Able and willing to comply with all study procedures.

          9. Female subjects must be either post-menopausal for at least 1 year with
             follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt;40 mIU/mL at screening or surgically sterile
             (tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) for at least 3 months, or if
             of childbearing potential, have a negative pregnancy test and agree to use dual
             methods of contraception, or abstain from sexual activity from screening until the end
             of the study, or for 120 days following the last dose of study drug, whichever is
             longer. Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use
             a highly effective method of contraception from screening until the end of the study
             or for 120 days following the last dose of study drug, whichever is longer. All
             fertile men with female partners of childbearing potential should be instructed to
             contact the Investigator immediately if they suspect their partner might be pregnant
             at any time during study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the study drug.

          2. Diagnosis of celiac disease or H. pylori infection as determined by screening
             esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) or a history of celiac disease diagnosed by prior

          3. Presence of abnormal laboratory values considered by the Investigator to be clinically
             significant.

          5. Any disease, condition (medical or surgical), or cardiac abnormality, which, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would place the subject at increased risk.

          6. Treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the preceding 6 months.

          7. Treatment for a clinically significant helminthic parasitic infection within 6 months
             of screening and/or a positive helminthic test at screening.

          8. Use during the 30 days before Screening (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) or use
             during the Screening period of any medications that may interfere with the study such
             as immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs (including azathioprine, 6-
             mercaptopurine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, anti-TNF, anti-IL-5, anti-IL-5
             receptor, dupilumab, anti-IgE antibodies, omalizumab) or systemic corticosteroids with
             a daily dose &gt;10mg of prednisone or equivalent.

             treatment in the study, during the treatment period, or vaccination expected within 5
             half-lives (4 months) of the study drug administration.

         10. Known history of alcohol, drug, or other substance abuse or dependence.

         11. Participation in a concurrent interventional study with the last intervention
             occurring within 30 days prior to administration of study drug (or 90 days or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer, for biologic products.

         12. Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant while
             participating in the study.

         13. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor makes the
             patient unsuitable for enrollment.
