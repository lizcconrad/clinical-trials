  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although IV salbutamol is frequently used in children in a wide range, pharmacodynamic data
      are scarce. To date, there is an insufficient evidence base to guide initial and subsequent
      dosing recommendation for its IV use in children. Especially the need for a loading dose
      needs to be addressed. Therefore, pharmacodynamic and kinetic data are needed to guide
      initial dosing strategies of IV salbutamol in children. To assess the efficacy of a loading
      dose of intravenous salbutamol in children admitted to a PICU for severe acute wheeze or
      severe acute asthma. Efficacy is measured by the reduction in asthma score (Qureshi) at 1
      hour after administration of the loading dose, compared to placebo.

Based on expert opinion, we consider a reduction of 2 points to represent a clinically relevant improvement.</description>
