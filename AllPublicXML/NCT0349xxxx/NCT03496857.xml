      The aim of this study is to valuate the effects of LED photobiomodulation on analgesia during
      labor.ight-emitting diode (LED) photobiomodulation is an effective and noninvasive
      alternative to pharmacological methods.n total, 60 women in labor admitted to a public
      maternity hospital will be selected for a randomized controlled trial. The participants will
      be randomized into two groups: intervention group [analgesia with LED therapy (n = 30)] and
      control group [analgesia with bath therapy (n = 30)].

      Background: Labor pain is one of the most intense pains experienced by women, which leads to
      an increase in the number of women opting to undergo a cesarean delivery. Pharmacological and
      nonpharmacological analgesia methods are used to control labor pain. Epidural analgesia is
      the most commonly used pharmacological analgesia method. However, it may have side effects on
      the fetus and the mother. Light-emitting diode (LED) photobiomodulation is an effective and
      noninvasive alternative to pharmacological methods.

      Objectives: To evaluate the effects of LED photobiomodulation on analgesia during labor.

      Methods: In total, 60 women in labor admitted to a public maternity hospital will be selected
      for a randomized controlled trial. The participants will be randomized into two groups:
      intervention group [analgesia with LED therapy (n = 30)] and control group [analgesia with
      bath therapy (n = 30)]. The perception of pain will be assessed using the visual analogue
      scale (VAS), with a score from 0 to 10 at baseline, i.e., before the intervention. In both
      the groups, the procedures will last 10 min and will be performed at three time points during
      labor: during cervical dilation of (1) 4-5 cm, (2) 6-7 cm, and (3) 8-9 cm. At all three time
      points, pain perception will be evaluated using VAS shortly after the intervention. In
      addition, the evaluation of membrane characteristics (intact or damaged), heart rate, uterine
      dynamics, and cardiotocography will be performed at all time points.

      Expected outcomes: The use of LED photobiomodulation will have an analgesic effect superior
      to that of the bath therapy.

    <description>LED therapy sessions will be held in the pre-labor room. The patient who will undergo analgesia and the professional responsible for placing the LED plate on the patient's back, between T10 and L2, will be present at the time of the intervention. The LED plate will be covered with clear disposable plastic (PVC) to avoid cross-contamination and ensure hygiene. During the interventions, the patient will be allowed to choose the position that is the most comfortable for her.
Three 10-min LED applications will be performed when the patient has a cervical dilatation of 4-5, 6-7, and 8-9 cm. Data on the level of pain, characteristics of the membrane (intact or damaged), heart rate, cardiotocography, and uterine dynamics will be collected after each intervention.</description>

    <description>The method of analgesia with the bath therapy will be performed using a hot shower at 37°C for 10 min. After showering the entire body or the back for 5 min, the participants will be allowed to direct the water flow to any area of the body that feels the most comfortable and to adjust the temperature themselves for improved comfort. Bath therapy will be performed at three time points during labor: at cervical dilatation of 4-5 cm, 6-7 cm, and 8-9 cm. Data on the level of pain, membrane characteristics (intact or damaged), heart rate, cardiotocography, and uterine dynamics will be collected after the bath therapy by performing the same measurements used in the intervention group.</description>
