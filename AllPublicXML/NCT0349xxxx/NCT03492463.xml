  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to investigate whether using electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) or skin
      patches containing nicotine affects switching from smoking conventional combustible (burning)
      cigarettes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to assess the relative role of nicotine dose and route of delivery in
      affecting successful switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes, as well as
      concomitant reductions in ad libitum cigarette smoking and exposure to harmful and
      potentially harmful constituents of combustion. The strategy will be to assess adoption of
      e-cigarette use and concomitant reduction in ad libitum smoking of subjects' usual brands of
      cigarettes over an 8-week period, during which they will receive nicotine or non-nicotine
      e-cigarettes, and nicotine or non-nicotine skin patches. The nicotine patches will not be
      used as a therapeutic treatment in this study, but rather as a way to manipulate the nicotine
      dose, while varying the rate and route of nicotine delivery. Behavioral or &quot;habit&quot; aspects of
      e-cigarette use will be controlled for by the groups receiving non-nicotine e-cigarettes.
