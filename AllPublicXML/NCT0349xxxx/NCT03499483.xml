      Study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of once daily Biktarvy for 28 days for
      prevention of HIV infection in HIV-1-seronegative adults after high-risk sexual contact.
      (non-occupational post exposure prophylaxis - nPEP)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-randomized, open label single arm trial conducted at Fenway Health as a single site. 100
      subjects will be enrolled following a high risk sexual exposure in which HIV exposure is a
      concern. Each person will be provided with detailed informed consent and if they agree, will
      receive a 28 day regimen of BIC/F/TAF (Biktary) in a single fixed-dose tablet. Subjects will
      be seen for 3 visits over a period of four months in which assessments will be done to
      evaluate safety of product, tolerability of product and HIV status. All subjects will be
      compared to historical controls in the previous one daily TDF-based nPEP studies which were
      conducted at Fenway Health.
