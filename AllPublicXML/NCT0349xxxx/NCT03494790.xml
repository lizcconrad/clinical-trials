  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with suspected or confirmed infection and who will be sampled for blood
      culture will be recruited. Blood samples are collected for the analysis of matrix
      metalloproteinases (MMP) and their inhibitors. We also aim to analyse metabolic changes and
      use the samples for analysis of blood lactate, metabolomics, and fibroblast growth factor 21
      (FGF-21) as well. The primary aim of the study is to test the performance of MMP-8 in finding
      severely ill patients who will need treatment in high dependency unit or intensive care. The
      secondary aim is to study the metabolic changes in acutely ill patients with infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with suspected or confirmed infection and who will be sampled for blood
      culture (a surrogate for suspected severe infection) will be recruited from three large
      emergency departments in a University hospital. Two blood samples will be collected: one for
      the analysis of matrix metalloproteinases, their inhibitor tissue inhibitor of
      metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), FGF-21 and metabolomic analyses. Another blood sample is for
      the analysis of blood lactate. Clinical data will be collected to calculate quick SOFA
      (qSOFA), in order to test whether lactate and/or MMP-8 will improve the prognostic model if
      they are added to qSOFA. The primary outcome measure is the number of days alive without the
      need for ICU or high dependency unit treatment. The ability of MMP-8 to discriminate severe
      infection from uneventful course of the disease will be studied. The secondary aim is to
      study the metabolic changes in acutely ill patients with infection and compare these
      variables between survivors and non-survivors. The planned number of patients recruited is
      924. During this study the feasibility of a bedside rapid analysis of MMP-8 will be tested in
      30 patients and the results obtained using the rapid analyser compared with laboratory
      results obtained using ELISA.
