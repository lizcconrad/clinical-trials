  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, multicenter, 1:1 randomized Phase III study of intradermal autologous
      Vigil immunotherapy (1.0 x 10e6 cells/injection cells/injection; minimum of 4 to a maximum of
      12 administrations) in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide in subjects with
      metastatic Ewing's sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) refractory or intolerant to 1 prior line
      of chemotherapy. Participants undergoing a standard surgical procedure (e.g., tumor biopsy or
      palliative resection) may have tumor tissue harvested for manufacture of investigational
      product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be managed in an outpatient setting. Hematologic function, liver enzymes,
      renal function and electrolytes will be monitored. Blood for immune function analyses
      including IFNγ-ELISPOT analysis of cytotoxic T cell activation in response to autologous
      tumor antigens will be collected at tissue procurement, post-procurement screening and Day 15
      (prior to Vigil administration when applicable) at Cycles 2, 4, end of treatment, and every 6
      months thereafter. Blood for ctDNA analysis will be collected prior to chemotherapy
      administration at baseline, Cycle 2 - Week 1 Day 1, Cycle 4 - Week 1 Day 1, and EOT.
