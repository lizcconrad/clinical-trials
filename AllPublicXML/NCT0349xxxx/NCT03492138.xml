  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ONC201 is a novel dopamine receptor D2 antagonist that is able to activate the integrated
      stress response pathway. It is active against multiple myeloma cells in vitro, both as a
      single agent and in combination with corticosteroids and proteasome inhibitors. In order to
      document superiority over the combination compared to the individual agents of ixazomib and
      ONC201 in a single arm study, there will initially be a run-in period of weekly ONC201 625 mg
      with dexamethasone 40 mg such that if there is progression of disease (25% increase) after 4
      weeks or less than a minimal response (25% reduction) after 8 weeks then ixazomib will be
      added. Dexamethasone is dose-reduced to 20 mg at the same schedule for subjects ≥ 75 years
      old. If patients do achieve single-agent responses with ONC201 (minimal response or better),
      they will continue with weekly ONC201 and dexamethasone until progression, with response
      assessments after each 28-day cycle. Patients who have previously been treated on another
      clinical trial with weekly ONC201 625mg with dexamethasone with progression while receiving
      treatment do not need to complete the run-in phase of the study.

      At the time of progression, they will proceed to the 3 drug combination phase of the study.
      It is at the point of 3 drug initiation, that below phase I DLT principles or phase II
      disease control rate considerations apply.

      Phase I Study Design

      • Phase I will follow a 3+3 dose escalation design to determine the RPTD of ixazomib in
      combination with ONC201 and Dexamethasone.

      The dose escalation rules for the phase I portion of the study are as follows, escalating in
      cohorts of 3 patients per dose level including a de-escalation option in case of early
      toxicity. Three patients will be treated at the current dose level. If at least 2 patients
      are observed to have a DLT, the prior dose level is defined as the RPTD unless only 3
      patients have been treated at that level, in which case it is the tentative RPTD. If 0 of the
      3 patients are observed to have DLT, the dose level is escalated one dose level for the next
      cohort of 3 patients, and the process continues as above. If exactly 1 of the 3 patients
      treated show DLT, 3 additional patients are treated at the current dose level. If none of
      these additional 3 patients show DLT, the dose level is escalated for the next cohort of 3
      patients, and the process continues as above; otherwise, the prior dose level is defined as
      the RPTD (unless only 3 patients have been treated at that level, in which case it is the
      tentative RPTD). A tentative RPTD becomes final when a total of 6 patients are treated with
      less than 2 showing DLT.

      If, unexpectedly, at least 2 patients are observed to have DLT at the initial dose level 0,
      then the next dose level evaluated will be the lowest dose level, -2, and further dose
      escalations to dose level -1 will proceed as outlined above from that dose level. If there is
      no RPTD declared, there will be no expansion to the phase II portion of the study. The phase
      I portion of the study will include between 6 and18 patients depending upon the number of
      dose levels evaluated.

      Phase II Study Design Phase II will follow a Simon's Optimal two-stage design to indicate
      proof of concept regarding the PFS rate of ixazomib in combination with ONC201 and
      Dexamethasone at the RPTD established in phase I. Once the RPTD for combination therapy has
      been established, an additional 24 patients will be enrolled for a total of 30 evaluable
      patients (24 + 6 from phase I at RPTD).

      In considering a Simon's Optimal two-stage design, the plan is to look at each patient at 2
      months after initiating study treatment (3 drug combination) and classify each patient as
      responder or non-responder at the 2 month time point. A responder is a patient who has stable
      disease or better (not progressed) since initiating study treatment; a non-responder is
      someone whose disease has progressed according to IMWG criteria. The population of relapsed
      and refractory MM patients in this study will likely all have progressed on standard therapy;
      therefore the null hypothesis being tested is that the disease control rate at 2 months is
      5%. As per IMWG criteria, if patients show progression after 1 cycle of triplet therapy, they
      will continue on therapy and a repeat assessment will be performed after cycle 2 in order to
      confirm progression of disease.

      Stage 1:

        -  Enroll 9 patients including the 6 patients being evaluated from the phase I portion of
           the study

        -  Evaluate patients at 2 months post initiation of treatment

        -  If 0 have responded (progression-free), i.e. if all 9 have progressed, then stop trial
           for futility and conclude that the proportion who will be progression-free at 2 months
           is less than 5%.

        -  If 1 or more have responded (progression-free) at 2 months, then proceed to Stage 2.

      Stage 2:

        -  Enroll an additional 21 patients

        -  Evaluate patients at 2 months post initiation of treatment If 4 or more of the 30
           patients have responded (progression-free) at 2 months then the null hypothesis is
           rejected and further investigation of this treatment combination is warranted.

                  treatment. Ixazomib has significant drug-drug interactions with strong CYP3A
                  inducers. No drug-drug interactions with the CYP450 screen have been found with
                  ONC201, but the analysis of these studies is not complete, so during the study
                  use of inhibitors or inducers of CYP450 system is excluded.
