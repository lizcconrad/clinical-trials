    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to optimize response rates and rates of secondary resections of
      metastases in patients with initially non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer Liver
      Metastasis. The patients will be treated with systemic chemotherapy With irinotecan plus
      hepatic arterial infusion With floxuridine and oxaliplatin

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies and our experience have proved the efficacy and safety of systemic
      chemotherapy combined with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) with floxuridine and dexamethasone
      in patients with initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis. Hepatic arterial
      infusion oxaliplatin trials have been done with oxaliplatin alone and in combination with
      irinotecan, 5-FU/LV, and mitomycin-C and have showed that Hepatic arterial infusion
      oxaliplatin could increase response rate and resection rate for colorectal liver metastasis.
      Therefore, we designed this study to determine whether systemic chemotherapy With irinotecan
      plus hepatic arterial infusion With floxuridine and oxaliplatin can increase the complete
      resection rate (R0) and improve the overall survival in patients with initially unresectable
      colorectal liver metastasis.
