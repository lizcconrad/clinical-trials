      1. To assess the incidence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in adult AML patients, and to explore
           their associations with the patients' clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular
           characteristics as well as with treatment response and outcome.

        2. To delineate the similarities and distinctions among mutations at IDH1-R132, IDH2-R140
           and IDH2-R172 in AML, both clinically and molecularly (including cytogenetics,
           immunophenotyping, mutation co-occurrence patterns).

        3. The results can be references for future selection of targeted therapy (targeting IDH
           mutant proteins).

    <textblock>
      Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH) are enzymes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of
      isocitrate into alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG). IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML give the enzymes
      neomorphic enzymatic activity to transform α-KG to D-2HG, an oncometabolite which acts as a
      competitive inhibitor of dioxygenases, and causes dysregulation of TET2 and histone
      demethylases, consequently leading to epigenetic reprogramming of a cell, blocking
      differentiation and contributing to a transformed phenotype, and leukemogenesis.
      Investigators plan to recruit 300 adult AML patients (newly diagnosed or relapsed). 10mL of
      peripheral blood or marrow blood will be obtained from routine practice blood/marrow sampling
      specimens (no extra venipuncture or bone marrow aspiration would be required) and sent for
      routine tests such as cytogenetics, immunophenotyping, and gene mutation analyses. IDH1 R132,
      IDH2 R140, and IDH2 R172 mutations will be screened by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing, as
      previously described.

      Investigators will first assess the incidence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in adult AML
      patients, and then explore their associations with the patients' clinical course,
      cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics as well as with treatment response and outcome.
      Investigators also seek to delineate the similarities and distinctions among IDH mutation
      variants at IDH1-R132, IDH2-R140 and IDH2-R172, both clinically and molecularly (including
      cytogenetics, immunophenotyping, mutation co-occurrence patterns).
