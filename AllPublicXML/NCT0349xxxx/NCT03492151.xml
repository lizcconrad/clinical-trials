    <textblock>
      The study schema is shown in Figure 4. (A) All patients referred to one of the participating
      academic centers for EUS evaluation of the PCL will be enrolled in the protocol if they
      satisfy inclusion criteria. Patient consent will be obtained during the clinic visit or prior
      to their EUS. EUS-guided nCLE imaging is first performed (B) followed by EUS-guided FNA and
      aspiration of cyst fluid. The cyst fluid is analyzed for CEA and cytology. As per
      institutional standard of care, the cyst fluid is also sent for molecular analysis. The
      results of the cyst fluid molecular analysis (B) will be utilized for the most likely
      diagnosis. Based on institutional multidisciplinary tumor board meetings, surgery is
      performed as indicated (C). Surgical histopathology serves as &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis.
      It is anticipated that the majority of patients will undergo surgical resection after their
      EUS.

        Subjects for this study will be identified from patients referred for diagnostic EUS-FNA of
        PCLs for a non-study indication by a physician responsible for their care (i.e.,
        gastroenterologists, oncologists, general internists, and surgeons) either at the primary
        study center.
