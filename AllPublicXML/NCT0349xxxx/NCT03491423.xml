  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recommendations for cardiovascular rehabilitation (CVR) encourage exercise training,
      primarily involving the aerobic system, to allow patients to regain independence in daily
      activities. However, the lactic anaerobic process is also involved during these activities
      (stair climbing, carrying loads, etc.). Hence there is a major interest in accurately
      assessing patients' anaerobic capacities in order to tailor suitable exercise programs.
      However, there are no functional tests specifically dedicated to the evaluation of lactic
      anaerobic metabolism and adapted to people with coronary disease. The investigators offer a
      dedicated test, the short and fast test (SFST), which can be applied in current clinical
      practice and has already been evaluated in a population of healthy subjects. The purpose of
      this project is to evaluate the safety, feasibility and validity of SFST in a population of
      patients with coronary artery disease.
