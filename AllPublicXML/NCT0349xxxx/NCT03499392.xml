  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks headache among the top 20 causes of disability in
      the world.

      Primary headaches (with no known organic cause) account for 90% of these conditions. INSERM
      estimates that 15% of the general population is concerned. WHO estimates that 1.7-4% of the
      global adult population is affected by headache for at least 15 days a month. Headaches are
      disabling, for patients (pain, suffering, fatigue, unavailability ...) but also for society
      (socio-economic cost as frequent work stoppages and drug costs). They are a public health
      problem.

      In 2002, the High Authority of Health published its recommendations for the diagnosis and
      management of migraine patients. In addition, the French Society for Migraine and Headache
      Studies updated these recommendations in 2013. They are focused on the medical management
      offered by doctors and pharmacists. However, the professionals in daily contact with the
      subjects know that the dimension psychic plays an important role in the etiology of
      headaches.

      The review of the literature shows the keen interest and the need for this type of research
      to better understand the main psychological factors involved in primary headaches.

      The current vagueness, the lack of knowledge regarding the aspects associated psychological
      and the lack of studies on the French population can be filled with this study which takes
      place at the University Hospital of Besançon.
