  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label, dose-escalation, safety and pharmacokinetic study of rucaparib
      administered twice daily (BID) to Japanese patients with a solid tumor who have failed
      previous standard treatment for their cancer. A recommended dose of rucaparib for Japanese
      patients will be determined in a dose-escalation portion and then further evaluated in a
      dose-expansion portion of the study.
