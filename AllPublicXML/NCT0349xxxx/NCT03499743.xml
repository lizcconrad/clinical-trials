  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many oral analgesic drugs such as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) are used to
      relieve pain from gynaecological procedures and dysmenorrhea. Hyoscine-N-butyl bromide, an
      antispasmodic drug is commonly used for relief of smooth muscle spasms and can be used to
      alleviate genito-urinary spasm. Some studies reported hyoscine couldn't relieve pain in minor
      gynaecological procedures. So the efficacy of Hyoscine-N-butyl bromide use is still
      controversial, and no previous studies investigated its effectiveness for pain relief in IUD
      insertion procedure.

      The aim of this study is to determine if oral hyoscine butyl bromide 20 mg administered
      prophylactically before copper T380A intrauterine device placement will reduce pain with the
      insertion procedure among Egyptian nulliparous and parous women.

      A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted at the
      Kasr Al Ainy Medical School family planning clinic. Subjects will be randomized into two
      equal groups: the first group (group A) who will receive oral hyoscine butyl bromide 20 mg
      (BUSCOPAN two tablets, produced by Chemical Industries Development (CID), Giza - A.R.E. under
      licence of Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH - Germany) and The second group (group B)
      who will receive placebo(2 tablets)will be manufactured by Cairo University Faculty of
      Pharmacy and will be equal in shape, weight and colour to the buscopan tablet.These drugs
      will be taken 30 minutes before IUD insertion.

    <description>the visual analog scale (VAS ) pain score reported by participants during IUD insertion.Pain scores will be measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) consisting of a 10 cm horizontal straight line on which 0 cm corresponds to no pain and 10 cm to the worst pain. VAS is rated as 0 for no pain, 1-3 for mild pain, 4-6 for average pain, and 7-9 for severe pain and 10 for extremely severe pain an individual can experience.A research assistant standing beside the woman will hold the VAS sheet for the participant to select the point that corresponds to the level of pain she will experience.</description>
