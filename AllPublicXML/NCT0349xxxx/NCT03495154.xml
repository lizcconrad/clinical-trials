    <time_frame>pre-operatively, 1 month, 12 months, 24 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Carolina Comfort scale is a question survey used to assess a patient's quality of life pre and post hernia repair with mesh. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with 0 indicating no symptoms and 5 indicating disabling symptoms The Carolina comfort scale is a 15-item (pre-operative assessment) or a 23-item (post-operative assessment), Likert-type questionnaire that measures severity of pain, sensation of mesh (post-operative assessment only), and movement limitations in the following eight categories: lying down, bending over, sitting up, activities of daily living, coughing or deep breathing, walking, stairs, and exercise. The CCS score is derived by adding the scores from each of the 15 or 23 items. The best possible score is 0 and the worst possible score is 115.</description>
