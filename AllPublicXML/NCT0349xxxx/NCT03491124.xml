  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of Battlefield Acupuncture (BFA) on
      outcomes for pain, sleep, and physical activity level in an active duty military sample with
      subacute or chronic lower back pain (LBP). BFA is a form of auricular acupuncture (AA) that
      has been implemented in many Department of Defense (DoD)/Veterans Affairs (VA) medical
      settings to alleviate acute or chronic pain. BFA uses five predetermined locations in a
      defined sequence to place semi-permanent needles in the ear. Subacute lower back pain is pain
      that has persistently lasted from four to twelve weeks. Chronic lower back pain is pain that
      lasts more than 12 weeks.

      Hypothesis 1: Participants with subacute or chronic LBP will have reduced pain using BFA as
      compared to placebo.

      Hypothesis 2: Participants with subacute or chronic LBP will have improved physical activity
      using BFA as compared to placebo.

      Hypothesis 3: Participants with subacute or chronic LBP will have improved sleep quality as
      compared to placebo.

      The secondary study aims are:

        1. To explore the effects of BFA two weeks following the treatment for LBP.

             1. Do positive outcomes appreciated with BFA persist over two weeks?

             2. What is the pain medication usage during and after intervention treatments?

        2. To explore the effectiveness of BFA on trunk flexion mobility and balance.

             1. Does pain reduction improve trunk flexion and balance?

             2. Does improved truck flexion mobility and balance contribute to increased physical
                activity?

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain level change over time on the Defense/Veterans Pain Rating Scale(DVPRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>The DVPRS will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later.</time_frame>
    <description>Participant reported pain level using the DVPRS. DVPRS pain level ranks from 0 (no pain) to 10 (As bad as it can be. Nothing else matters).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain medication need.</measure>
    <time_frame>A medication form will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later.</time_frame>
    <description>A self reported increase, decrease, or no change in medication use.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in trunk flexion.</measure>
    <time_frame>Trunk flexion will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later. If the participant has a DVPRS &gt;=2 and mODI &gt;=20%, trunk flexion will also be measured after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk flexion will be assessed with Dual Digital Inclinometers. The Dual Digital Inclinometer is placed around the sacrum and measures the angle of flexion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in balance</measure>
    <time_frame>The FRT and TUG will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later. If the participant has a DVPRS &gt;=2 and mODI &gt;=20%, the FRT and TUG will also be measured after the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Balance is measured by Functional Reach Test(FRT) and Timed Up and Go Test(TUG). The FRT assesses a patient's stability by measuring the maximum distance an individual can reach forward while standing in a fixed position. The TUG is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It measures the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>The mODI will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later. The Actigraph watch is worn the entire 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Activity will be measured using an Actigraph watch and Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnairre(mODI)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>The ESS and ISI will be administered weekly for seven times. Followed by a one time washout 2 weeks later. The Actigraph watch is worn the entire 8 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep will be measured using an Actigraph watch, Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS), and Insomnia Severity Index(ISI)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Health and well being</measure>
    <time_frame>The SF-8 is administered the first, fourth, and eighth week.</time_frame>
    <description>Health and well being is measured using the SF-8 Health Survey (4 Week Recall).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Height, weight, and Body Mass Index(BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Height, weight, and BMI is measured the first and eighth week.</time_frame>
    <description>The participants height and weight is measured. A BMI is also calculated using the following formula: BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in meters squared.</description>
