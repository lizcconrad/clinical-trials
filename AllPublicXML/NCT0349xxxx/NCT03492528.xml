  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mediterranean Group of Cardio-Oncology (GMEDICO) brings together French cardiologists and
      oncologists who have developed a protocol for the monitoring and cardio-oncological
      management of patients treated for cancer.

      This unique organization makes it possible to envisage the creation of a large cohort from
      which the incidence and predictive factors of cardiovascular toxicity can be determined.

      Primary objective: to determine the cardiovascular prognosis of patients treated for cancer
      and followed up in cardio-oncology.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To determine the clinical, biological and imaging factors associated with cardiovascular
           events under cancer treatment, in order to define a risk score including clinical,
           biological (biomarker) and imaging data.

        -  To create a biological source for testing other biomarkers and conducting genome-wide
           association studies and genetic factors associated with cardiovascular events under
           cancer treatment.

      Each patient will be monitored for 5 years. Cardio-oncological follow-up and management
      within these centers will follow a common protocol established and validated in March 2016 on
      the basis of international recommendations and summaries of the characteristics produced for
      each drug. Additional blood samples will be taken for the biobanking. Depending on the case,
      a small skin biopsy will be carried out to analyze the cardiovascular response of in vitro
      immunotherapy using a reprogramming model of fibroblasts in hiPSC hiPSC (human induced
      Pluripotent Stem cells)-cardiomyocytes.
