  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carcinoid Heart Disease (CHD) is a rare form of heart disease, occurring in over 50% of the
      patients with carcinoid syndrome. Pathophysiology, prognostic factors of development of
      Carcinoid Heart Disease and progression of disease remain unclear.

      This observational multicenter cohort study is designed to study the occurrence of Carcinoid
      Heart Disease in patients with differentiated carcinoid tumors, to describe numerous factors
      influencing the occurrence, severity, progression and long-term survival of patients with
      Carcinoid Heart Disease. Basic informations and detailed diagnosis informations (oncological
      and cardiac parameters), are collected by professional doctors. Clinical outcomes (onset of
      Carcinoid Heart Disease, cardiac surgery, related death) will be followed up every year or
      every six/three months if clinically indicated.

    <description>Patient at high risk of Carcinoid Heart Disease (metastatic ileum or bronchial well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, patients with high level of urinary 5HIAA or with carcinoid syndrome) are followed with annual echocardiography to detect the occurrence of carcinoid heart disease.
In case of documented Carcinoid Heart Disease, a six or three months' cardiac follow-up is necessary to evaluate the progression and the severity of the disease.
Investigators collect the data of clinical parameters (flushes, diarrhea, …) biological parameters (urinary 5HIAA, NT-ProBNP …) and cardiac parameters that may influence the occurrence, severity and progression of Carcinoid Heart Disease.</description>
