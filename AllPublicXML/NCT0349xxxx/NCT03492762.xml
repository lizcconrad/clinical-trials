  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of the novel probe
      64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i for PET imaging of CCR2 expression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, pilot Phase 0/1 clinical trial to establish initial estimates of the
      human radiation dosimetry of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i. Healthy volunteers and participants who
      currently smoke cigarettes but do not have known pulmonary disease will be recruited. Twelve
      participants (N=6 healthy, N=6 current smokers) will undergo whole-body PET/CT and PET/MR
      imaging at multiple time points after 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i injection to determine the human
      dosimetry for this tracer.
