      Objective: This study investigated how patients' knowledge, attitude, and perceptions
      influence their oral hygiene practices as well as peri-implant health. Materials and Methods:
      Participants with single implant crowns placed in 2007-2011 completed a questionnaire that
      examined their knowledge, attitude, and perceptions on oral hygiene practices and
      peri-implant health before receiving a periodontal examination, prophylaxis, and oral hygiene
      education. Clinical parameters recorded were peri-implant probing depths and plaque index,
      width of keratinized mucosa, implant crown characteristics, reason for tooth loss, and
      diagnosis of peri-implant health.

      First, a trained clinical research dental assistant interviewed the participants and showed
      them pictures of oral hygiene aids so that the participants could answer the survey questions
      accurately. Subsequently, a periodontal examination, dental prophylaxis, and oral hygiene
      education were performed. Participants with active diseases e.g. caries, periodontitis, or
      peri-implantitis were referred for further management. The following clinical parameters were
      recorded during the examination:

        1. Probing depths at 6 sites around the implant (mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal,
           distolingual, midlingual and mesiolingual)

        2. Plaque index (Silness &amp; Loe 1964) at 4 sites around the implant (mesial, buccal, distal
           and lingual)

        3. Amount of keratinized mucosa at the implant site

        4. Characteristics of the implant crown:

             -  Type of implant crown (screw- or cement-retained) and

             -  Position of crown margins (supra-, equi- or sub-gingival)

        5. Reason(s) for tooth loss

        6. Diagnosis of peri-implant health

             -  Normal

             -  Mucositis, defined as 3 or more bleeding points per implant

             -  Peri-implantitis, defined as implant thread exposure that was either clinically
                visible or detectable with a periodontal probe.
