      Objective: To investigate the effects of robot-assisted hand rehabilitation with a Gloreha
      device on hand function and the participation of ADL for children with cerebral palsy(CP).

      Materials and Methods: Five children with CP aged 6 to 18 years were recruited and received
      12times of robot-assisted hand rehabilitation for 6 weeks of treatment (Sixty minutes a time,
      twice a week). The performance was assessed by a assessor for three times (pre-test,
      post-test, follow up at one month). The outcome measures Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb
      section(FMA-UE),Box and block test(BBT), Maximal voluntary contraction(MVC) of extensor
      digitorum communis(EDC), Flexor digitorum(FD), Grasp strength, &amp; ABILHAND-Kids for ADL
      ability. Collected data will be analyzed with ANOVA test by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha
      level was set at .05. Our hypothesis are robot-assisted hand rehabilitation with a Gloreha
      device has positive effects on hand function and the participation of ADL for children with
      CP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand function is the most important for ADL and learning ability. Many cerebral palsy(CP)
      suffered problems with the gross motor dysfunction and hand function disability. An inability
      to use the upper extremity in daily life can lead to loss of independence with ADLs and of
      important occupations (eg, school). Robotic therapy can deliver larger amounts of upper
      extremity movement practice for these individuals. Although the Robotic therapy appears to
      provide some benefit for upper extremity motor abilities and participation but is of
      uncertain utility for cerebral palsy(CP).

      Objective: To investigate the effects of robot-assisted hand rehabilitation with a Gloreha
      device on hand function and the participation of ADL for children with cerebral palsy(CP).

      Five children with CP aged 6 to 18 years were recruited and received 12times of
      robot-assisted hand rehabilitation for 6 weeks of treatment (Sixty minutes a time, twice a
      week). The performance was assessed by a assessor for three times (pre-test, post-test,
      follow up at one month). The outcome measures Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Limb
      section(FMA-UE),Box and block test(BBT), Maximal voluntary contraction(MVC) of extensor
      digitorum communis(EDC), Flexor digitorum(FD), grasp strength, &amp; ABILHAND-Kids for ADL
      ability. Collected data will be analyzed with ANOVA test by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha
      level was set at .05. Our hypothesis are robot-assisted hand rehabilitation with a Gloreha

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 weeks, follow up at one month</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer motor assessments for the upper limb section(scores from 0 to 66 points)that evaluates reflexes, volitional movements and rapid alternating movements. The higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Box and block test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 weeks, follow up at one month</time_frame>
    <description>The Box and Block Test (BBT) measures unilateral gross manual dexterity. Clients are scored based on the number of blocks transferred from one compartment to the other compartment in 60 seconds. Score each hand separately. Higher scores are indicative of better manual dexterity.</description>

    <measure>EMG: record maximal voluntary contraction(MVC) of brachioradialis, extensor carpi</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 weeks, follow up at one month</time_frame>
    <description>Surface electromyography root mean square from brachioradialis and extensor carpi was normalized to the maximal voluntary contraction recording. The higher muscle activation during the task indicate the more efficacy to grasp or release the block.</description>

    <measure>Jamar Handgrip Dynamometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 weeks, follow up at one month</time_frame>
    <description>The Jamar hydraulic handgrip dynamometer for measuring the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. The mean score among three trials of each instrument was recorded for data calculations. The higher scores presents the better hand grip strength.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ABILHAND-Kids questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6 weeks, follow up at one month</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of manual ability for children with upper limb impairments. The scale measures a person's ability to manage daily activities that require the use of the upper limbs, whatever the strategies involved. The parent is asked to rate his/her perception on the response scale as &quot;Impossible&quot;, &quot;Difficult&quot; or &quot;Easy&quot; (0 = &quot;Impossible&quot;, 1 = &quot;Difficult&quot; or 2 = &quot;Easy&quot;). The activities not attempted by the child within the last 3 months are not scored and are entered as not applicable. The total score based on 21 activities is then converted into a linear measure of manual ability (logits). This test was specifically developed for children with CP using the Rasch measurement model and showed a good reliability and reproducibility over time.</description>
