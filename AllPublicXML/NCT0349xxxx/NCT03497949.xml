  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of hypotension perioperatively during operation of an acute hip fracture is
      unknown. As a surrogate factor the usage of vasopressor support is more adequate as the
      registration of vasopressor drugs are many times not complete in records. The investigators
      retrospectively investigated the anesthetic journals of 1100 patients with an acute hip
      fracture (AHF) noting confounding factors and the usage of vasopressors either by injections
      or infusions and then correlated these results to mortality at 30-, 90- and 365- days
