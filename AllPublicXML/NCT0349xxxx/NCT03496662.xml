    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about a new combination of drugs being
      given to treat pancreatic cancer. The drugs being tested are BMS-813160, nivolumab,
      gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel. The investigators will be looking at both the side effects
      and the way the disease responds to treatment.

             14 days of study treatment except for adrenal replacement steroid doses &gt; 10 mg daily
             prednisone equivalent in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Note: treatment
             with a short course of steroids (&lt; 5 days) up to 7 days prior to initiating study

          -  Concurrent use of medications/food which may interfere with BMS-813160 including any
             strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 or P-gp is not allowed. These include but are
