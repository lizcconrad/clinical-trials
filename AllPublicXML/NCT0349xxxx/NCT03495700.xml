  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The L-PRF block is a combination of bone substitute with L-PRF. The use of a L-PRF block in
      bone augmentation therapies could enhance and improve bone regeneration.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if the use of autologous leukocytes and
      platelet rich fibrin accelerate and promotes bone regeneration in the sinus in comparison
      with the standard sinus lift procedure procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial. A total of 24 patients, needing sinus lift
      with lateral window technique (L), will be enrolled. All patients have to fulfil all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. The trial will comprise 8 visits. Written
      informed consent will be obtained prior to any examination carried out for study purposes.
      Randomization will be performed using sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes
      containing treatment allocation.

      Under local anaesthesia, the required L will be performed. Once the blood extraction is done
      the surgery can start following the normal procedure for the lateral approach of sinus floor
      elevation. Once the preparation of the sinus floor elevation is done the randomization
      envelopes will be open and the selected treatment will be applied. For the test group the
      sub-sinus cavity will be filled with L-PRF block and the window will be closed with L-PRF
      membranes. For the control group the sub-sinus cavity will be filled with only DBBM and the
      window will be closed with a collagen membrane. Afterwards suturing will be conducted and a
      CBCT will be taken for control and observation.

      After 6 months the subjects return for a check-up of the healing process. A CBCT will be
      taken to assess the bone regeneration. Implant surgery will be discussed.

      With a crestal incision the implant site will be exposed. A trephine bur of 3 mm in diameter
      will be use to obtain a biopsy of the test or control site. This will result in a biopsy
      sample of the healed site. At the exact same location of the biopsy the drilling will be
      performed according to implant protocol and the implant will be placed and ISQ values will be
      recorded. Follow-up will be till 1 year.

    <description>For the test group the sub-sinus cavity will be filled with L-PRF block and the window will be closed with L-PRF membranes.
Eight tubes (9 ml) of venous blood will be collected from the patients. For 6 tubes (red cap) a 12 min centrifugation at 2700 rpm/408g RCF will be followed. Two tubes (white cap) will be centrifuged (IntraSpin, Intra-Lock, Florida, USA) for 3 minutes only to form the Liquid Fibrinogen.
The L-PRF clots will be removed from the tubes using surgical tweezers. The clots will be thereafter gently compressed into membranes using a sterile metal box (Xpression, Intra-Lock, Florida, USA).
To prepare the L-PRF Block, L-PRF membranes will be cut into small pieces and mixed with DBBM (Bio-Oss Small particles, Geistlich AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland). The Liquid Fibrinogen will be added to the homogeneous mix, and stirred gently for Â± 10 seconds while shaping it to the L-PRF block</description>
