  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general scope of the study involves meditation and its effects on pain management,
      narcotic use, and emotional well-being. Half of the participants will receive access to a
      meditation app, which they will be asked to use for at least 10 minutes every day for 6
      weeks, while the other participants will be in the waitlist group and will receive a
      subscription to the meditation app after the 6 week study period ends. All participants will
      be asked to complete a set of questionnaires

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects an estimated 11.2% of the US population, costs the United States
      approximately $635 billion per year in medical expenses and lost productivity, and fuels the
      current epidemic of opioid addiction. Understanding alternate approaches to chronic pain
      management is an imperative given new guidelines for the treatment of pain, and preliminary
      studies indicate that meditation programs may reduce the suffering and distress that
      accompanies chronic pain. However, much of the research on meditation for pain has examined
      the effects of scheduled group interventions, delivered in-person by instructors over the
      course of several weeks. Far less research has looked at the delivery method that is most
      common and arguably most sustainable for busy adults, namely, smart phone delivered
      Contemplative Applications (Apps) for Well-being (CAWs). The proposed study will examine the
      use and impact of a meditation apps in the context of pain. Participants will be randomized
      to either app or a wait-list group, and will be assessed in terms of self-reported pain,
      distress, narcotic use. To assess efficacy, the researchers will examine the longitudinal
      changes in all measures in the mindfulness app group, compared to wait-list control groups.

    <measure>Change in Pain Catastrophizing Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Catastrophizing Scale is a 13-item inventory that measures 3 elements of the perception of the intensity of pain (rumination, magnification, feeling helpless). Participants indicate the degree to which they agree with statements related their pain by selecting 0 = not at all, 1 = to a slight degree, 2 = to a moderate degree, 3 = to a great degree, 4 = all the time. There are three subscale scores assessing rumination, magnification and helplessness. All subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating the participant is having more thoughts about the pain they feel.

    <measure>Change in Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale Short Form Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale Short Form is a 20-item inventory that measures fear and anxiety regarding to pain. Respondents rate their symptoms of anxiety on a scale of 0 (never) to 5 (always). Total scores range from 0 to 100 where higher scores mean the participant is experiencing more anxiety related to their pain.</description>

    <measure>Change in Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory is a 9-item inventory that measures both pain severity and pain interference in daily functioning with 2 scales. Questions are answered on an 11-point Likert scale from 0 to 10 and scales are scored by obtaining the mean for two separate scales: pain severity and pain interference.</description>

    <measure>Change in Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-24) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-24) is a 24-item inventory that measures 5 elements of mindfulness as it is currently conceptualized: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience. Respondents rate statements according to how true the statement is to them on a scale of 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). When scoring the questionnaire, some items are reversed so that low scores reflect low mindfulness. Total scores are between 39 and 195 and higher scores indicate greater mindfulness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) is a 21-item survey asking about feelings of depression and anxiety that the respondent has experienced in the past week (for example, &quot;I found myself getting upset at quite trivial things&quot;). Respondents indicate the degree to which they agree with each statement on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = does not apply to me at all and 3 = applied to me very much, or most of the time. The depression subscale includes 14 items. A score of 0-9 indicates no depression, 10-13 indicates moderate depression, 14-20 is moderate depression, 21-27 is severe depression and scores of 28 and above indicate extremely severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3, Week 6, Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The revised UCLA Loneliness scale (R-UCLA) is a 20-item questionnaire measuring general feelings of social isolation and dissatisfaction with one's social interactions. Participants rate each item on a scale from 1 (never) to 4 (often). When scoring the scale, certain items are reversed so that low scores correspond with low loneliness. Total scores range from 20 to 80, where high scores indicate high feelings of loneliness.</description>
