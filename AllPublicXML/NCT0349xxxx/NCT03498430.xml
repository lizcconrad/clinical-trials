  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted primarily to determine the pharmacokinetics of copanlisib in
      Chinese patients with relapsed iNHL.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of copanlisib
      administered on Day1, 8, and 15 of a 28-days cycle (3 weeks-on/1 week off dosing regimen) as
      a 1 hour intravenous infusion to Chinese patients with relapsed iNHL.

      The secondary objectives include the evaluation of safety, tolerability, and tumor response
      of Chinese patients treated with Copanlisib.

      Determine the pharmacokinetics of M-1 metabolite.

             anti-cancer chemotherapy or immunotherapy (with the exception of alopecia)

          -  Biological response modifiers, such as Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF)
             within 14 days of first study treatment. G-CSF and other hematopoietic growth factors

             clinically indicated or at the discretion of the principal investigator; however they
             may not be substituted for a required dose reduction
