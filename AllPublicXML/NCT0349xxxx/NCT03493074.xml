    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a novel noninvasive method to dynamically monitor the effect of
      abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and endovascular treatment of AAA (EVAR) on arterial pulse
      wave
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) develops slowly and degeneratively (increasing diameter, wall
      tension, thinning and decreased wall strength, altered compliance) which affects the aortic
      pressure and wave reflection. In 50% of cases, AAA rupture may lead to death and 50% of the
      remaining patients referred to hospital die. This results in high costs and preventable loss
      of lives. AAA can also be detected by pulse wave (PW) analysis. which could enable
      development of easy to use, affordable and accurate methodology for the detection of AAAs.
      The measurement system used in the present study is capable of wireless recording of PWs from
      several different locations utilizing two different sensor modalities (blood-volume related
      photoplethysmographic (PPG) PWs and dynamic blood pressure PWs). The objective is to study
      PWs in the detection of AAA and the effects of endovascular repair (EVAR) and whether adverse
      effects (i.e. endograft failure) can be detected. It is hypothesized that AAA and failure of
      the operation can be detected by PW features, especially by printed flexible sensors which
      will improve the usability, patient comfort and safety (hygiene). The technology could make
      it possible to screen AAAs at lower costs even in the municipal health centers or by the
      patients themselves, at similar accuracy, without skilled personnel operating the diagnostic
      devices and therefore improve the cost effectiveness of AAA screening resulting in
      significant savings, resource reallocation in the healthcare and also improved patient safety
      and prevention of deaths. It could also enable patient-centered, comfort follow-up for
      patients treated by EVAR.
