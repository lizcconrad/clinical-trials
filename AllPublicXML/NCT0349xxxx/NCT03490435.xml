  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed study is to assess the prevalence of intestinal parasitic diseases
      in adults and children. These invasions are included to &quot;dirty hand diseases&quot; (per os
      invasions), therefore it applies mainly preschool children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 75% of the world's population is infected with parasites and although
      parasitic diseases are mostly observed in the poor tropical and subtropical countries, there
      are also many diseases caused by parasites in Poland. In Poland, particular attention is paid
      to the following parasitic diseases closely related to the digestive system: giardiasis,
      taeniasis (including cysticercosis), ascariasis, cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis,
      trichinosis, echinococcosis.

      Symptoms of such invasions may include: allergic rhinitis of unknown origin, chronic fatigue
      or food intolerance. Moreover, many of them are asymptotic, therefore the study group will
      consist of both healthy people and individuals with undiagnosed diseases or/and chronic
      symptoms.

fresh fecal samples will be used to preparing direct (saline and iodine wet) mounts using supplementary techniques (flotation, sedimentation), as well as temporary mounts (hematoxylin and trichrome staining). Other technique of fresh fecal samples examination will be ParaSys™
A non-preserved stool samples will be stored below -20°C. Defrosted fecal specimen will be subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) - Giardia antigen test (coproantigens)</description>
