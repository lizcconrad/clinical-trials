  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is two-way crossover study to compare pharmacokinetic (PK) of daprodustat 2 milligram
      (mg) versus 4 mg tablets and food effect on the PK of daprodustat following single oral doses
      in healthy Japanese male subjects. This study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 is the
      bioequivalence part in which subjects will receive single dose of 2 tablets of 2 mg
      daprodustat and single dose of 1 tablet of 4 mg daprodustat in crossover manner. Part 2 is
      Food effect part. In this part, subjects will receive single dose of 4 mg daprodustat tablet
      in fasting and fed state in a crossover manner. There will 5-day wash-out period between each
      intervention period. There will be approximately 52 subjects in Part 1 and 12 subjects in
      Part 2. The study will last for 6 weeks.

             consent.

          -  Japanese subjects who are overtly healthy as determined by medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and cardiac
             monitoring.

          -  Body weight &gt; = 50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5 -
             24.9 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2).

          -  Male subjects.

          -  Subjects capable of giving signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of cardiovascular(CV), respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal (GI), endocrine, haematological, or neurological disorders capable of
             significantly altering the absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs;
             constituting a risk when taking the study intervention; or interfering with the
             interpretation of data.

          -  Abnormal blood pressure as determined by the investigator.

          -  ALT &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN).

             according to Fridericia's formula, machine-read or manually over-read. The specific
             formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
             individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other
             words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QT correction (QTc)
             for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue
             the subject from the trial.

          -  The values of Hgb at screening: &gt;=16.0 gram per deciliter (g/dL).

             condition.

          -  History of myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome, stroke or transient

             vitamins, diet foods and herbal medications within 14 days prior to first dosing.

          -  Exposure to more than 4 new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Current enrolment or past participation (that is administration of last dose of
             investigational study intervention) within the last 30 days (or 5 half-lives,
             whichever is longer) before signing of consent in this clinical study involving an
             investigational study intervention or any other type of medical research.

          -  The subject with positive serological test for syphilis (Rapid Plasma Reagin [RPR] and
             Treponema pallidum haemagglutination test [TPHA]), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             Antigen/Antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C virus (HCV)

          -  Smoking or history of regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (example
             nicotine patch, electronic cigarette) within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Sensitivity to any of the study interventions, or components thereof, or drug or other
             allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or medical monitor, contraindicates

          -  History of donation of blood or blood products &gt;= 400 mL within 3 months or &gt;= 200 mL
