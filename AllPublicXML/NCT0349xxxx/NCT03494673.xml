  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are prevalent in migraineurs, of which the
      mechanism is still unclear. The investigators aimed to test the spatial association between
      areas with reduced cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to hypercapnic stimuli and consequent
      development of WMHs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A whole-brain map of CVR will be created in patients with migraine and normal controls.
      Hypercapnic stimuli for CVR will be delivered by prospective end-tidal CO2 targeting device.
      Hemodynamic responses will be determined by BOLD signal changes using fMRI. WMHs will be
      determined by high-resolution 3D FLAIR imaging. Patients and controls will undergo serial
      MRIs with 1 year interval. Associations between areas of reduced CVR and consequent WMH
      development will be tested in both patients and controls.

    <description>The investigators will obtain a CVR map using BOLD MR signal in the first year of study and also obtain changes in WMH during 2 years of follow-up period in patients and controls, respectively. Then the investigators will test whether CVR-map predicts consequent WMH development in patients and controls, respectively.</description>
