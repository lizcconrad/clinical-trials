  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TEMPO is an interventional cohort study recruiting injecting drug users attending needle and
      syringe programs (NSP) in Australia. Three hundred participants will be invited to on-site
      HCV testing with NSP integrated care for HCV treatment.

      Participants will be screened for HCV using point-of-care testing and HCV positive
      participants will be offered treatment with Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir. Of those who initiate
      treatment, participants will receive weekly peer-based support on-treatment and return at End
      of Treatment (ETR) and 12 weeks following end of treatment (SVR12) for clinical follow-up.
