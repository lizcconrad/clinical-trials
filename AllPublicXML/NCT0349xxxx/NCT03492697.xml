  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open label study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) following single oral doses of
      different formulations of PF-06882961, including controlled release (CR) tablets at 2 release
      rates (long and short duration), an immediate release (IR) oral solution, and IR tablets, in
      healthy adult subjects.
