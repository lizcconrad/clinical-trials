      The purpose of this study is collect observational data regarding patterns of care and
      outcomes of focal therapies for prostate cancer, including but not limited to: high-intensity
      focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryotherapy, focal laser ablation, irreversible electroporation,
      photodynamic therapy, and brachytherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through the use of a prospective registry, the investigators will collect information on
      patient characteristics including age, co-morbidities, imaging and biopsy information, and
      prior treatments. Information on treatment details will also be captured, including treatment
      time, anesthesia delivered, and length of stay, when applicable. Oncologic outcomes including
      PSA, post-treatment biopsy and imaging data, need for re-treatment, and survival outcomes
      will also be captured. Safety outcomes will be captured using the Clavien-Dindo
      classification scale, and additional specific GU complications will be recorded, which
      include urinary retention, urethral stricture, recto-urethral fistula, osteomyelitis, and
      urinary tract infection. Finally, the investigators will capture functional outcomes using
      health related quality of life questionnaires including the EPIC questionnaire, IIEF-5,
      MSHQ-EjD, and IPSS.
