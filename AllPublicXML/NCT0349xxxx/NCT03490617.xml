  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of misoprostol at a dose of 400 µg administered vaginally four hours prior to IUD
      insertion increased the ease of insertion and reduced the incidence of pain during the
      procedure, although the frequency of cramps increased following misoprostol use.

      Nulligravidas women of reproductive age were submitted to IUD insertion between July 2009 and
      November 2011 at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira in Recife,
      Pernambuco, Brazil. A total of 179 women were randomly allocated to two groups: 86 to use 400
      µg of misoprostol vaginally four hours prior to IUD insertion and 93 to use placebo. Risk
      ratios (RR) were calculated as measures of relative risk, together with their 95% confidence
      intervals (95%CI). The number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) were
      also calculated.
