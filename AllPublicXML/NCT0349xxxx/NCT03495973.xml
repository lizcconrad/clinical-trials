  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess ustekinumab's ability to induce clinical response
      and remission (&quot;effectiveness&quot;) at Week 16 and remission at Week 52 and Week 104 in
      participants with Crohn's disease (CD). Response and remission will be assessed using
      clinical parameters. Retention rate at week 52 and 104 will also be studied.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Response at Week 16, Based on Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response for Crohn's disease (CD) is assessed by Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) and is defined as decrease of 3 points in baseline HBI score. HBI consists of clinical parameters: general well-being (0-4, where higher score means lower well-being), abdominal pain (0-3, higher score means more severe pain), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0-3, where higher score means presence of swelling in the abdomen), and complications (score 1 per item). Total score is the sum of individual parameters. The score ranges from a minimum score of 0 to no pre-specified maximum score as it depends on the number of liquid stools per day and number of complications, where higher scores indicates more severe disease and, score is presented as: less than (&lt;)5 (remission), 5-7 (mild disease), 8-16 (moderate disease), and greater than (&gt;)16 (severe disease).</description>

          -  The participant must have been initiated on treatment with ustekinumab within the last
             2 weeks (that is including those who already discontinued) or started on ustekinumab
             treatment less than (&lt;) 3 months ago if treatment start was documented in SWIBREG
             within 2 weeks of onset and has a record of Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) when starting
             ustekinumab

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant is enrolled in a clinical trial (randomized or non-randomized) in
             which the treatment of CD is dictated by a study protocol. If the participant is
             participating in another observational study (non-interventional), the participant may
             be included in this observational study

          -  Received an investigational drug (including investigational vaccines) or used an
             invasive investigational medical device within 60 days before the start of the study
             or the first data collection time point

          -  Participants who started ustekinumab despite contraindications for use

          -  Participants with planned stop of treatment with ustekinumab within 24 months from
