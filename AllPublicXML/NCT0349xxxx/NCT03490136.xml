  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Series of epidemiological studies have been carried out by the research team since 1988
      studying the changes in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, prediabetes and associated risk
      factors. These studies have shown that the determinants to rising prevalence of diabetes vary
      among populations and with time. Comparative studies from the same region can help to
      understand the secular changes occurring in a specific population. In this proposal we intend
      to conduct a cross-sectional survey with varied levels of urbanisation and compare the
      findings with our earlier reported data to assess the degree of changes in dysglycaemic
      prevalences. The primary aim of the proposal is to study the secular changes and the
      prevalence of diabetes, prediabetes and associated cardio-metabolic risk factors with varying
      levels of urbanization.

      A multi-stage random selection method will be used. Field workers will conduct an enumeration
      of the individuals above 20 years of age. In each location, streets will be randomly selected
      to have an equal representativeness from different socio-economic strata. All eligible family
      members of the selected households are invited for the survey. The study outcomes will be of
      relevance in public health research in modeling effective national healthcare policies.
