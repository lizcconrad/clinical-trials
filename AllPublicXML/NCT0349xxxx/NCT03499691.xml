  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today it is well established that middle molecules comprise several compounds that are not
      effectively removed by high-flux dialyzers, and effective clearance of large middle molecules
      in the process of dialysis depends on the dialyzer membrane having large enough pore sizes,
      larger than the conventional high-flux dialyzers. Studies have found associations between
      levels of large middle molecule uremic toxins and immune dysfunction and inflammation, as
      well as adverse outcomes. This indicates that dialysis membranes having larger pores,
      enabling an expanded HD (HDx) with more effective removal of large middle molecules, can have
      a positive impact on the inflammatory state. While data is starting to appear on the
      long-term use of the HDx therapy, little is still known on how large middle molecules and
      inflammation markers are affected over time.

    <description>The patients randomized in this group using the Theranova 500 medium cut-off dialyzer, and blood flow rate and treatment duration will be maintained stable during the observation period. However, other prescriptions will vary based on the Principal Investigator's (PI's) judgment. If other dialyzers need to be temporarily used during the study period it shall be recorded which alternative dialyzers are used and for how long the study patient is on a different dialyzer. However, prior to Week 12 laboratory assessment it is recommended that the patient undergoes three dialysis sessions on the designated treatment mode.</description>
