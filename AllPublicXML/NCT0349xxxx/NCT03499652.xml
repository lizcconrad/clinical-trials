  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal bacterial meningitis (BM) is a devastating infection that occurs more commonly in
      neonates than in any other age group, and is associated with significant morbidity and
      mortality, especially in developing countries. In this study, we aimed to develop a clinical
      risk score model, according to the available clinical syndromes and commonly laboratory
      tests, for screening BM among full-term neonates in a large-scale retrospective cohort, and
      prospectively validated the risk score in multicenter cohort.
