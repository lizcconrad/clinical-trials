    <textblock>
      Prospective association study to analyse patients' outcome after bariatric surgery.

      Outcome comprises postoperative pain, analgesia, postoperative side-effects, long-lasting
      pain, patients' impairment in daily living.

      Background

      Bariatric surgery is a common procedure. Data on patient related outcome beyond loss of body
      weight are scarce. The question arises which patient is at specific risk for an unfavorable
      outcome after bariatric surgery.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to investigate variables possibly associated with impaired outcome
      and increased patients' interference after bariatric surgery. Which patients are at risk for
      clinically meaningful impaired daily living?

      Methods

      Patients will be enrolled in a prospective observational study. Data will be collected in a
      registry with documentation of patient, surgery, anesthesia and analgesia related variables
      including preoperative status and postoperative patient reported outcome with a follow-up
      period up to 5 years after bariatric surgery.

      Patients fill in standardized validated outcome questionnaires at predefined time points. The
      registry provides the basis for large scale analyses and benchmarks for several parameters.

      Variables to be considered are pain scores after surgery, patient reported outcome, pain
      related interference after surgery (Brief Pain Inventory), quality of life (SF-12), long-term
      outcome, chronic (neuropathic) postsurgical pain, BMI, psychological questionnaires, surgery
      and patient related variables, including genetic variants.

    <description>Measured by the validated International Pain Outcomes Questionnaire: Patient reported outcome using the numeric rating scale 0-10 (0=no impairment, 10=worst experience possible).

    <description>Measurement of patient reported outcome by the BPI (Brief Pain Inventory). The BPI gives information on the physical and affective interference as well as pain scores using the numeric rating scale (NRS: 0-10). Cut-offs discussed for the three groups no/mild interference, moderate interference and severe interference are mean NRS-scores of 3 and 5.</description>
