  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand whether the couple therapy that is used in
      practice is effective in preventing situational couple violence. More specifically,
      investigators will focus on couples with mild to moderate forms of situational couple
      violence to investigate how couples therapy can be effective in preventing the escalation and
      recurrence of situational couple violence. For this purpose, the response of partners to
      therapy will be investigated by integrating self-report questionnaires and
      psycho-physiological markers of emotion.

    <description>Couples in the intervention group will receive couples therapy for 8 weekly sessions. Each therapy session will last approximately an hour. All therapies will be conducted by the PI, Dr. Gunnur Karakurt. Dr. Karakurt is a Licenced Marriage and Family Therapist and AAMFT (American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy) approved clinical supervisor. All therapies will be conducted as a couple. Training on stress management and safety planning will be performed as individuals. There will not be any group sessions. The goal of couple therapy is to help and improve couples' capacity to regulate emotions, solve problems, and communicate through therapy with the couple together.</description>

    <description>Couples in the control group will be taught safety planning, given information on local resources to help victims of violence, and will be instructed in stress and anger management strategies. Following this 8 week period, they will receive 8 weeks of couple therapy unless they choose not to.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  This study is open to married, dating, and cohabiting couples.

          -  Couples will have to be involved in an intimate relationship with their current
             partner for at least one year.

          -  Both partners have to be older than 18 years of age at the time they sign consent.

          -  Couples must have mild to moderate forms of situational couple violence.

          -  Both partners must want couples therapy and both partners must desire to maintain the
             relationship.

          -  Both individuals from the couple must participate concurrently, although they will
             sometimes be separated when asked questions of a sensitive nature.

          -  Only heterosexual couples will be included in the study.

          -  Both partners can be on psychotropic medication, if they are on medication and stable
             for past 12 month prior to enrollment, and no psychiatric hospitalization for past 2
             years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Couples will be excluded from the study if there are indicators of severe intimate
             partner violence and/or characterological violence as this study targets couples with
             mild to moderate levels of violence. In order to distinguish between these two
             different types of violence, we will use specific items in the Conflict Tactic Scale
             (CTS) completed by both parties (Johnson, &amp; Leone, 2005). Severe and/or
             characterological violence in this study is defined as follows:

               -  If participants answer yes to both of the following items: &quot;I punched or hit my
                  partner with something that could hurt&quot;, &quot;I kicked my partner&quot;.

               -  If participants answer yes to any of the following items: &quot;I choked my partner,&quot;
                  &quot;I slammed my partner against a wall,&quot; &quot;I beat up my partner&quot; &quot;I burned or
                  scalded my partner on purpose,&quot; and &quot;I used a knife or gun on my partner&quot;.

               -  One of the partners reports that a violent behavior was repeated at least six
                  times in a year by their partner or themselves.

          -  Participants will also be excluded from the study if they answer yes to the following
             questions: &quot;Do you have any firearms at home?&quot;, &quot;In your previous relationships, did
             your partners ever tell you that you were physically abusive?&quot;

          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if they are not stable on psychiatric
             medication for more than 12 months.

          -  Couples will be excluded from the study if there is a discrepancy between partners'
             reports of violence (received or perpetrated) in the CTS, defined as the difference
             between the partners' reports of the frequency of a particular act by the same
             partner. If the difference of the average score of the partners, or for any of the
             acts in the scale in the CTS is greater than 2, the couple will be excluded from the
             study. For example, if the female partner reports that the male partner pushed her
             three times but the male partner reports that he never pushed his partner, the couple
             will be excluded from the study since the couple will receive a difference score of
             three for the act of pushing.

          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if undiagnosed, untreated serious mental
             illness is suspected during pre-screening. In order to screen participants with severe
             mental health problems, Symptom Checklist (SCL90) will be used. We will use the cut
             off 0.885 with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with
             lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.

          -  Participants will be excluded from the study if there are indicators of substance
             misuse. We will use the 16 item Simple Screening Instrument for Substance Abuse
             (SSISA) to screen participants' substance use. We'll score only 14 items out of the 16
             items, which were selected by the Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIP) 11 consensus
             panelists from existing alcohol and drug abuse screening tools. A score of 4 or
             greater has become the established cutoff point.

          -  Participants will be excluded if they reported any history of violent legal offences
             in the past 2 years.

          -  Participants will be excluded if participants are currently suicidal and/or psychotic
             and/or patients who is moderately ill (e.g. equivalent of Clinical Global Impression
             (CGI) score 3 or greater) at the pre-screening.

          -  Participants who are not literate or cannot speak English will be excluded. The
             questionnaires require a 6th grade reading level.
