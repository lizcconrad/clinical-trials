  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the effects of beneficial compounds of plant foods, such as
      pomegranate on cardiovascular health, skin inflammation and aging. This will be tested by
      asking healthy males to eat a high fat ground beef patty with 8oz. pomegranate juice or 8oz
      placebo (a study product that looks like pomegranate juice, but contains no active
      ingredients) and then measuring blood vessel dilation (endothelial function) by blood flow.
      The investigators also will measure the amount of Nitric Oxide (NO) in blood and urine
      samples and sugar and insulin in blood. In addition, a Cutometer, a device that measures the
      elasticity of the skin, will be used to obtain measurements of skin inflammation and aging.

      Healthy men have been chosen for this study because eating high fat hamburger patties can
      easily mimic in them the condition that causes atherosclerosis. The results from this study
      may help to explain how high fat foods can be harmful to the body and how beneficial plant
      foods can have on cardiovascular function and the skin.

      The proposed investigation has two major objectives: 1. to determine the clinical efficacy of
      pomegranate juice to reduce skin aging by assessing UV-induced change and skin biological
      characteristics of elasticity, sebum, hydration/moisture and systemic inflammation and 2. To
      determine the impact of pomegranate polyphenols on the metabolic response to a high fat meal
      by postprandial flow-mediated dilation and plasma nitric oxide. The investigators propose to
      achieve the following specific aims in a randomized, two arm, parallel intervention of
      pomegranate juice or placebo for 12 weeks in obese men.
