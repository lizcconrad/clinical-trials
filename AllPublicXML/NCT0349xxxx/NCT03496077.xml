    <textblock>
      This study is about whether or not little cigars and cigarillos cause or maintain addiction,
      and if flavors, such as fruit, make them more addictive. The purpose of this study is to
      understand the addiction potential of little cigars and cigarillos compared to cigarettes in
      young adults who smoke both products. This study will also look at the differences between
      men and women. In the rest of this form, little cigars or cigarillos will be referred to as
      LCCs.
