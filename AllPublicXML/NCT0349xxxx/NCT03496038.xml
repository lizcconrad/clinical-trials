  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority study to evaluate whether L-PRF achieves similar or perhaps better
      results in bone gain, compared with &quot;the golden standard&quot; DBBM, after trans-crestal sinus
      floor elevation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial with parallel group design. A total of 40
      patients, needing transcrestal sinus lift (T), will be enrolled.

      Under local anesthesia, the required T and implant placement will be performed and ISQ values
      will be recorded. Afterwards a CBCT will be taken for control. Randomization will be
      performed by computer generated random codes, using random permuted blocks with a block size
      of 4 to avoid uneven splits and minimization for the key prognostic factors RBH. Allocation
      will be concealed to the surgeons at completion of the common part of treatment, by opening
      an opaque envelope. At the same time an oral implant(s) will be inserted in the augmented
      area.

      After 6 months a CBCT will be taken for control of the bone healing and the measurements of
      the newly formed bone. The abutment will be placed on top of the osseo-integrated implant(s)
      under local anesthesia. ISQ values will be recorded. Follow-up will be till 1 year.

Following a healing period of 6 and 12 months a CBCT will be taken to measure the height and width of the newly formed bone and compare it to the initial CBCT. A 3-D volumetric analysis of the amount of gained bone is conducted with MeVisLab software.</description>

    <description>For the test group the sub-sinus cavity will be filled with Leukocyte en Platelet Rich Fibrin (L-PRF).
Before starting the surgery, 8 tubes (9 ml) of venous blood will be collected from the patients. A centrifugation standard L-PRF protocol will be followed followed (12 minutes centrifugation, 2700 rpm/408g RCF).
After full centrifugation of the tubes, the L-PRF clots will be removed from the tubes using surgical tweezers. The clots will be thereafter gently compressed into membranes using a sterile metal box (Xpression, Intra-Lock, Florida, USA).</description>
