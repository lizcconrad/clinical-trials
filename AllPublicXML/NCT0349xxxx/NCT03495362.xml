  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lot of evidence to show that the yeast beta-glucan has immunomodulatory,
      anti-inflammatory, anti-infective effects.However,few work was done on the relationship
      between yeast bata-glucan and the immune function of diabetic patients. This is a randomized
      double-blind trial, aiming to study the effect of yeast beta-glucan on immune system of
      prediabetic patients. Firstly, the investigators will go into the efficacy of yeast
      beta-glucan on improving the clinical symptoms of prediabetics. Secondly, the investigators
      will study the mechanism of yeast beta-glucan on enhancing the immune function and improving
      the inflammatory response.

The color, shape, and external packaging of the yeast beta-glucan and placebo are consistent. Each bottle of capsules will be marked with the name (or identify number) of the participants by research designers. Thus, the grouping of participants is blind to the rest of the researchers (like outcomes assessors).</masking_description>
