    <textblock>
      Few reports have addressed mental health for women with pregnancy complication over a
      prolonged time period. Meanwhile, the caring model with intervention for women who have
      pregnancy complication needs to be developed. The aims of this study are to (1) describe and
      compare the differences in health indicators during pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and 1 year
      postpartum; (2) develop the theoretical framework of relationship among health indicators
      during perinatal period; (3) develop a telephone follow-up and consultation program and
      examine its effect on women's resilience, depression, anxiety and quality of life. In the
      first stage, a prospective longitudinal investigation will be performed in women at pregnancy
      and postpartum. Women with pregnancy-related complications will be recruited. All
      participants will complete questionnaires that assess demographic characteristics, obstetric
      and birth history, depression, anxiety, resilience and quality of life. Participants who are
      in early, middle, late pregnancy, 3-5 days, 1st, 3rd, and 6th month and 1 year postpartum
      will be contacted to complete the questionnaires by mail or at study site clinics. The sample
      size was estimated by drop rates and power calculation. Approximately 380 women in early
      pregnancy will be recruited at a medical center in northern Taiwan. The first stage of this
      study will be conducted over a 3-year period. In the second stage, randomized control trial
      with single blind will be used to recruit eligible subjects from women in the waiting room
      for prenatal examination at a medical center in Taipei. The eligible subjects will be
      randomized into a control or experimental group. The women in the control group will receive
      usual care and those in the experimental group will receive four instances of telephone
      follow-up or face-to-face consultation. Two groups will receive 3 times measurements of
      depressive symptom, anxiety, resilience and quality of life. Meanwhile, Investigators will
      assess the health indicators of women's newborn. Data will be analyzed by independent t-test
      and generalized estimating equations. Forty-eight subjects will be recruited in each group.
      Totally, 300 subjects will be approached in terms of including a 30% dropout rate. The second
      stage of this study will be conducted over a 2-year period.

    <description>The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale asked the subject how often depressive symptoms had occurred in the past week. There were four frequencies: no, very few (less than one day per week), sometimes (every Monday to two days), and frequent (three to seven days per week). Options To assess each symptom, score 0 to 3 for each question. After the forward question is scored backwards, the total score for the 20 questions is between 0 and 60. Radloff Radloff suggested that the results should be explained by the total score of the scale. The total score is suggested to be interpreted by the total score of the scale. The total score is recommended to be explained by the total score of the scale, and the total score is recommended to be explained by the total score of the scale. The higher the total score, the more severe the depressive symptoms.</description>
