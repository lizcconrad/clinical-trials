  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the project is to evaluate a novel upper body exoskeleton during simulated
      industrial work. In a first stage of the project, an extensive study involving the end-user
      companies will be carried out to clearly identify the operator target tasks and typical
      target task loads for which the exoskeleton will be designed. Based on standard ergonomic
      evaluation scales (RULA and NIOSH, the Need for Recovery Scale and the Ovako Working Posture
      Analysing System), high risk tasks will be identified in the field, based on the evaluated
      information about the workspace configuration, the performed operations and their physical
      constraints. These will include, but will not be limited to, non-ergonomic postures, for
      example performing operations above the head or reaching in front, to the side, or behind the
      body; flexing the arms for extended periods of time; and bending or twisting the torso to
      lift an object from low or distant locations. Important items to assess in this task are the
      frequency and duration of tasks and activities, lifting characteristics, perceived physical
      effort and work-induced fatigue.
