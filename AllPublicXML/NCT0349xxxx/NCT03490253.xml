  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first goal of the randomized trial will be to study the influence of personalized text
      messaging on both glycemic control and depressive symptoms. The primary outcomes for this aim
      will be improvements in physical activity. The secondary outcomes include diabetes and
      depressive symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, as well as mood and quality of life.

      The secondary goal of the trial is to evaluate the influence of nurse phone outreach on
      glycemic control and depressive symptoms for participants who are non-responsive to the text
      messaging approaches used in this study. In particular, a sequential multiple assignment
      randomized trial (SMART) design will use responsiveness data from participants during the
      course of the study to implement a second randomization step for nurse phone outreach.We will
      examine the same primary outcome and secondary health behavior outcomes among this sub-group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DIAMANTE intervention will develop motivational messages that will come from various
      attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy categories that might differentially motivate patients to
      act (e.g., informational: health, physical appearance, social: family, peers, and
      self-confidence). User center testing will also produce feedback from clinicians on the study
      platform and adoption of a new technology in busy primary care settings. The findings of this
      user centered testing with participants and clinicians will inform the development of
      combined diabetes and depression text messaging intervention that will be embedded into
      existing primary care practice.

      Following the completion of user centered design, we will recruit 350 adults from primary
      care clinics at the San Francisco Health Network. The design will be randomized clinical
      trial comparing the effectiveness of static messaging vs adaptive messaging intervention on
      depression and diabetes outcomes. At the1-month point of the intervention, the non-responsive
      individuals in both treatment arms will be randomized again, with half of non-respondents to
      receive the intensified nurse phone outreach component of the study.
