      The purpose of this study was to observe the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions of rhTPO
      in the treatment of pregnancy-induced thrombocytopenia.

    <textblock>
      The project is undertaken by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other 6 well-known
      hospitals in China. The investigators anticipate to undertaking a concurrent control,
      multicentre trial including 60 pregnancy associated ITP adult patients which are ineffective
      for first-line treatment or platelets infusion and 30 healthy pregnancy control. 30 of the
      ITP patients are selected to receive rhTPO(given different dose according to the platelet
      count, the risk of bleeding and delivery), the other ITP patients are selected not to receive
      rhTPO. Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms of ITP patients and their newborns are
      evaluated after treatment, adverse events are also recorded throughout the study in order to
      report the efficacy and safety of the rhTPO for the treatment of pregnancy with ITP.
