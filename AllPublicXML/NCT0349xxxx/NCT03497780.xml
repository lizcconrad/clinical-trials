      The proposed study will establish novel relationships between intra-articular mesenchymal
      stem cell (MSC) recruitment, synovial inflammation, biomarkers of cartilage degeneration and
      joint inflammation, clinical patient factors, and downstream alterations in cartilage
      composition and morphology to provide novel insights into the pathoetiology of post-traumatic
      osteoarthritis (PTOA) after ACL injury and reconstruction. The study aims to enroll N=38
      total patients with primary, isolated rupture to their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), who
      have agreed to participate in the study and who will undergo primary surgical reconstruction
      by an orthopaedic physician at our two sites. Patients will undergo baseline magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), baseline clinical evaluation, and undergo a baseline blood draw.
      Subsequent imaging and clinical evaluations will be longitudinally performed at several
      postoperative timepoints up to 12 months postoperatively.

      Overall Study Design: This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients undergoing
      primary ACL reconstruction following ACL rupture. Surgical treatment and treatment timelines
      do not deviate from the national and international standards of care. Enrolled patients for
      study participation will undergo assessments involving blood, urine, and synovial fluid
      collection, clinical evaluation involving questionnaires and joint laxity testing, and MRI
      analysis.

      Patient Selection and Enrollment: The participating physicians at each site will identify
      potential subjects from their clinics' patients according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      listed below. Based on surgical volumes at both sites, patients generally undergo ACL
      reconstruction 8-12 weeks after initial screening. In the preoperative timeframe, all
      patients will undergo standard physical therapy to address pain, swelling, and motion
      deficits, as is standard of care at both institutions. Arthroscopic ACL reconstruction will
      be performed by Dr. Bedi at the University of Michigan, by Professor Ao at Peking University,
      and by 5 additional surgeons at Peking University. All surgeons will utilize a standardized
      single-bundle technique with a hamstring or bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft.
