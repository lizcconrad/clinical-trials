  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      56 participants with Mucinoses will be selected to receive treatment of tranilast. After a
      period of time ,the investigators can determine the efficacy of the drug by detecting the the
      thickness and area of skin before and after treatment.

      56 participants with Mucinoses will be selected. After the signing of the informed consent
      ,participants will be collected the initial lesions photos,the thickness and area of skin
      lesions by ultrasound and magnetic resonance,and chemical examinations including blood
      routine examination, routine urine test, liver function, renal function. During tranilast
      (0.1g each time, three times a day,12 months) treatment, participants need regular follow-up
      (1 per month) including liver and kidney function, blood glucose level monitoring, and every
      three months to retest lesion thickness and area. With 3 month as a time point, participants
      were observed for four points. After the experiment, the experimental data will be arranged
      and the data of the thickness and area change of skin lesions will be statistically processed
      to determine whether it is meaningful.
