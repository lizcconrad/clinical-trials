    <textblock>
      Paracetamol overdose is one of the most common medical emergencies. Annually in the UK,
      100,000 people seek medical attention and 50,000 need hospital admission. Treatment is with
      the antidote acetylcysteine (NAC), which is effective but takes 21 hours to administer
      intravenously and frequently produces adverse reactions. .

      Current tools that are used to decide who needs treatment are inadequate. We have identified
      and validated new blood tests that accurately identify those patients at risk of liver injury
      by quantifying the fundamental in vivo toxicity mechanisms.

      This study aim to gain further samples in order to develop a new point-of-care test
      specifically for the detection of liver damage.

      Paracetamol overdose is one of the most common medical emergencies. Annually in the UK,
      100,000 people seek medical attention and 50,000 need hospital admission. Treatment is with
      the antidote acetylcysteine (NAC), which is effective but takes 21 hours to administer
      intravenously and frequently produces adverse reactions. Paracetamol is the commonest cause
      of acute liver failure and directly kills around 200 people/year in the UK. Management of
      paracetamol overdose is estimated to cost around Â£48 million/year to the NHS.

      Current tools that are used to decide who needs treatment are inadequate. We have identified
      and validated new blood tests that accurately identify those patients at risk of liver injury
      by quantifying the fundamental in vivo toxicity mechanisms. Over the last 4 years we have
      published our data in leading journals such as The Lancet, Lancet Gastroenterology (the MAPP
      Trial), Hepatology and Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics. The current gold standard
      marker, serum Alanine Aminotransferase Test (ALT) activity, lacks both sensitivity and
      specificity for early liver injury. We have qualified 3 new liver biomarkers in over 1,200
      patients (microRNA-122 (miR-122), High Mobility Group Box protein 1 (HMGB1) and keratin-18
      (K18)) and demonstrated they predict liver injury at first presentation to hospital with high
      accuracy at a time when ALT is still normal.

      This project develops a new point-of-care (POC) test for circulating microRNA specifically
      for the detection of liver damage after paracetamol overdose. We have developed the microRNA
      biomarker (miR-122) to the point where it has received formal regulatory support from the USA
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Our proposed
      assay has backing from worldwide clinical opinion leaders and pharma partners such as
      AstraZeneca, GSK and Novartis. Our engineering solution for POC microRNA detection is
      underpinned by robust pilot data and field-leading expertise. The current assay for miR-122
      is PCR following extensive sample preparation which is too slow for acute clinical decision
      making and for dose-escalation decisions. To address this key roadblock (as identified by the
      FDA) we will use electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We have over 10 years of
      experience in EIS-based POC test development. Our pilot data demonstrate that EIS can detect
      miR-122 spiked into buffer and distinguish patients with DILI (high miR-122) from healthy
      subjects (low miR-122).
