  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients suffer from
      severe and bothersome symptoms because treatments are intense. So, the investigators
      developed SPARK (Supportive care Prioritization, Assessment and Recommendations for Kids), a
      website devoted to helping children track symptoms and providing a way to let doctors and
      nurses know which symptoms are bothersome. This study will examine the likelihood that
      children will complete SPARK once daily, help the investigators figure out how to improve the
      website so that children will use it, and help the investigators plan the large scale trial
      to test its efficacy in improving quality of life (QoL).

      Participants will be children with cancer or HSCT recipients who are 8-18 years of age and
      who are expected to be in hospital or in clinic daily for 5 days.To determine the feasibility
      of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of symptom feedback to healthcare providers

      Methods: Participants will be children with cancer or HSCT recipients who are 8-18 years of
      age and who can understand English, and who are expected to be in hospital or in clinic daily
      for 5 days.

      SPARK RCT will be a pilot multi-center RCT in which we will randomize children to either
      undergo daily symptom screening for 5 days with symptom reports provided to the healthcare
      team or standard of care. Feasibility will be met if at least 30 participants are enrolled
      within one year and at least 75% complete at least 60% of evaluations.

      Quality of the Idea Children receiving cancer treatment have excellent survival outcomes, in
      part, related to the provision of intensive therapies. Unfortunately, most children suffer
      and experience severe and bothersome treatment-related symptoms. Symptoms not only impact on
      QoL and morbidity but, in addition, may negatively influence future psychosocial functioning.

      Symptoms remain unaddressed even during healthcare encounters because children do not
      complain and clinicians fail to ask about them. We recently developed SSPedi, a
      pediatric-specific symptom screening tool on an iPad. SSPedi, however, consists only of the
      questions which ask about symptoms. SPARK is the web-based application which will facilitate
      access to SSPedi, encourage symptom screening, generate reports and allow children to track
      their symptoms. Careful thought to design is required to ensure SPARK optimizes future use
      and has clinical utility. The proposed project output is a product that facilitates
      longitudinal symptom screening and provides the groundwork for a future RCT of symptom
      feedback.

    <description>Will be determined by both the number of patients who are recruited for this study, and the number of patients who complete at least 60% of evaluations.

    <description>Measures self-reported symptoms related to cancer treatment, capturing physical, psychological and cognitive health. 5-point likert scale ranging from 0(almost never) to 4 (almost always); there is no weighting of items. Scores are transformed on a scale from 0 to 100. Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Mean score is calculated= Sum of the items over the number of items answered.
Total Score is used and calculated by: Sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the Scales. Higher scores indicate lower problems.</description>

    <description>Self-reported symptom screening questionnaire asking pediatric patients (age 8-18) how bothered they are by 15 identified symptoms and side effects of cancer treatment. This 5-point Likert scale score from 0 (not bothered at all) to 4 (extremely bothered), and has a total score ranging from 0-60, with a higher number indicating more bother cancer-related symptoms. Likert scores will be summed for a total score that ranges from 0 (none) to 60 (worst possible).</description>

    <description>The Faces Pain Scale Revised is a self-report measure of pain intensity developed for children to score the sensation of pain on the 0-to-10 metric. The scale shows a close linear relationship with visual analog pain scale, counting left to right; 0&quot; = &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; = &quot;very much pain</description>
