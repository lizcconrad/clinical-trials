      Robot-assisted gait training can improve gait ability of patients with Parkinson's disease by
      repeating a normal gait pattern with high intensity. This study is a randomized controlled
      trial to investigate the effect of robot-assisted gait training on walking ability and
      functional connectivity of brain in patients with Parkinson's disease using an exo-skeletal
      robot.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a disease caused by dopamine deficiency in the striatum resulting from
      the loss of dopaminergic neuronal cells in the cerebral substantia. It is a progressive
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms including gait disturbance and
      balance instability. In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, dysfunction of the
      sensorimotor area of the basal ganglia typically occurs, leading to habitual control hurdles.
      Accordingly, cognitive efforts are required to perform habitual tasks such as walking, and
      the automaticity of walking is reduced. Walking performance in a dual-task condition has been
      used to assess gait automaticity in patients with Parkinson's disease.

      Patients with Parkinson's disease are known to exhibit changes in functional connectivity of
      the brain from an early stage. In addition, a number of studies have reported that patients
      with Parkinson's disease with gait freezing have a change in resting brain activity and
      functional connectivity of the brain. However, no studies have examined the functional
      connectivity of the brain in patients with Parkinson's disease before and after
      rehabilitation.

      Robot-assisted gait training is a method of rehabilitation that repeats normal gait patterns
      at high intensity. Recent meta-analysis has shown that robot-assisted gait training improved
      the recovery of independent gait after stroke compared with conventional rehabilitation
      therapy. On the other hand, robot-assisted gait training in Parkinson's disease has been
      reported to improve walking speed and walking endurance compared to conventional physical
      therapy, but is not superior to treadmill exercise of the same intensity. In addition, it has
      been reported that in patients with Parkinson's disease with balance impairment,
      robot-assisted gait training can improve balance disorder compared with physical therapy, and
      gait freezing has improved in some small-scale patients. However, studies on the
      effectiveness of robot-assisted gait training in Parkinson's disease are still lacking, and
      the mechanism of the effect has not been elucidated. In particular, the effect on gait
      automaticity, which is a characteristic of Parkinson 's disease, and functional connectivity
      of the brain has not been studied. Therefore, this study is aimed to investigate the effect
      of robot-assisted gait training on walking ability and functional connectivity of brain in
      patients with Parkinson's disease using an exo-skeletal robot.

    <description>The Berg balance scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function (Maximum score 56).</description>

    <description>The FES-I is a 16-item questionnaire of fall-related self-efficacy. The 16 items of the FES-I are rated according to &quot;how concerned you are about the possibility of falling&quot;, using the following responses (score in parentheses): not at all (1), somewhat (2), fairly (3), and very concerned (4). Thus, the total score ranges from 16 to 64 points.</description>

    <description>Parts II and III were designed for FRs only, providing a total summed score between 0 and 28. Part II (items 2-6, scoring range 0-19) rated the severity of FOG based on its duration and frequency in its most common manifestation, i.e. during turning and initiation of gait. Part III rated the impact of FOG on daily life (items 7-9, scoring range 0-9). No separate on and off rating of parts II and III was considered to avoid unreliable assessment.</description>

    <description>Correlation coefficient between BOLD signals in motor network
At least 6 minutes resting state fMRI imaging is desirable for acquiring stable resting state brain imaging data. The investigators divide the entire brain into voxels, and if the investigators assume TR=3sec, one voxel has 120 time series data. This data reflects the blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal, which is related to neural activity via a complex interplay of cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and metabolic rate of oxygen.</description>

    <description>Patients should use their belts (Harness) to support their weight when walking in equipment. In the first training session, the patient focuses on fitting and adapting the equipment and helps the patient learn. To minimize skin damage, the patient can wear a protector. The initial walking speed starts at 1.0 km/h and can be increased gradually to 3.0 km/h. The gait robot provides an auditory feedback according to gait cycle and a visual feedback on the patient's active participation. If the patient can tolerate, the gait robot may control the walking speed automatically according to the patient's participation. The treatment time per session is 45 minutes including don and doff time. Total 12 sessions are provided for 4 weeks.</description>
