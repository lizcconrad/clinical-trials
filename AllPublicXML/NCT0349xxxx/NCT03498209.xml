      One single operator, Master degree student in the department of Pediatric Dentistry and
      Dental public health, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University will assess incidence of molar
      incisor hypomineralization for all the patients who will be included in the study sample. The
      survey will involve a structured questionnaire which will be followed by clinical examination
      to assess the presence / absence of molar incisor hypomineralization and its severity based
      on EAPD criteria
