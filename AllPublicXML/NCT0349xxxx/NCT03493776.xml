  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to study the immunogenicity of the vaccine before and after lung
      transplantation. Patients (at least 50 years old) before and after lung transplantation will
      be enrolled. The investigators hypothesize that the recombinant varicella-zoster subunit
      vaccine is able to induce cellular immunogenicity after transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplant recipients receive lifelong immunosuppression and are at increased
      risk for reactivation of all herpesviruses including VZV. Epidemiologic studies show the
      cumulative incidence in lung transplant recipients of reactivation to be 15-20%. A non-live,
      recombinant subunit vaccine (Shingrix; GSK vaccines) was recently licensed for the prevention
      of shingles in people aged 50 years or older. The investigators plan to study the
      immunogenicity of the vaccine before and after lung transplantation. Patients (at least 50
      years old) before and after lung transplantation will be enrolled. The investigators
      hypothesize that the recombinant varicella-zoster subunit vaccine is able to induce cellular
      immunogenicity after transplantation.
