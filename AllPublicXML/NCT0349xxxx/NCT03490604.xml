  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the 5th leading cause of death from cancer in France. When chemotherapy
      can be proposed, the choice of treatment is currently based on the patient's profile and
      expected tolerance. The endpoints currently used in trials, such as time to therapeutic
      failure, do not take into account the patient's experience of the disease. The use of quality
      of life questionnaires is often proposed, but frequent missing data and filling time can be a
      problem. In oncology, some studies have demonstrated, through questionnaires, the link
      between physical activity and quality of life. In this situation, ambulatory measurement of
      physical activity by wrist actimetry could be an integrative reflection of the impact of the
      disease and treatment (efficacy, tolerance) on patients. This type of evaluation, if accepted
      by patients, could usefully complement the measurement of quality of life in this population.
      To our knowledge, no study has specifically looked at the use of devices of this type in the
      context of digestive cancer. We therefore propose to evaluate the acceptance of this type of
      device by pancreatic cancer patients receiving chemotherapy before evaluating its potential
      interest.
