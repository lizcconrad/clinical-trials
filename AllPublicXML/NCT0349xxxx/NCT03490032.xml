  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of the safety and tolerability of a single administration of 3 mega Becquerel
      (MBq)/kg, but not less than 150 MBq and not more than 250 MBq, of 68Ga-PSMA-R2, to assess the
      pharmacokinetics (PK), biodistribution, and dosimetry of 68Ga-PSMA-R2, and to establish the
      optimal imaging method for determining location and burden of positive lesions in adult male
      patients with biochemical relapse (BR) and metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa).

                  ng/mL after radical prostatectomy or PSA nadir plus 2 ng/mL after radiation
                  therapy with corresponding CT/MRI or bone scan revealing absence of local
                  recurrence or metastatic lesions.

                  OR

               2. Metastatic disease: defined as both, castration-sensitive or castration-resistant

             would jeopardize compliance with the protocol, or active infection including human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and untreated hepatitis B, hepatitis C. Screening for
