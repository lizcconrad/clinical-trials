      To determine the long-term nephroprotective potential of treatment with sparsentan as
      compared to an angiotensin receptor blocker in patients with primary focal segmental
      glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel, active-control study.
      Approximately 300 patients aged 8 to 75 years (inclusive) will be enrolled in the study. The
      study will be conducted in approximately 150 study centers, globally. The investigational
      drug (sparsentan) is a dual acting angiotensin receptor blocker and endothelin receptor
      agonist. The active control is irbesartan. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will
      require wash out from renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, if applicable
      prior to their first dose of study drug.

      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either sparsentan or active
      control (irbesartan).
