  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators have conducted K-BASKET trial (Korea-Biomarker-driven multi-arm drug-screening,
      knowledge and evidence-generating targeted trial), which was based on the specific genetic
      aberration, not the cancer type, which could accelerate matching the right drug to the right
      target so that every cancer patient could get the right specific drug based on the specific
      genetic biomarker, like NCI-MATCH trial. Next generation sequencing (NGS) focusing panel has
      the mutation and copy number variation of MET, PIK3CA and AKT. Investigators will open new
      treatment arms during the progress of K-BASKET trial. Patient with PD-L1 positive or EBV
      positive or MSI-H or POLE/POLD1 mutation tumor will be assigned to Avelumab monotherapy.
