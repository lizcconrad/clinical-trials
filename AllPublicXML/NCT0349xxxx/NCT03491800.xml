  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot study in 30 Heart Failure (HF) patients and
      visit companions (i.e., a family member who accompanies the patient to medical visits), to
      evaluate a pre- visit question/topic prompt list, designed to enhance patient and family
      member engagement during visits by providing a list of questions or topics that they may want
      to discuss with their health care provider.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will include 30 HF patients or dyads (i.e., a patient and family
      member who accompanies the patient into the examination room at a visit). While our study
      primarily will target HF dyads, if the investigators encounter recruitment difficulties,
      unaccompanied HF patients (i.e., HF patients who do not have a family member who can
      participate in the study with them) will also be enrolled.

      Procedures (methods): Single group pre-post study design.

      After providing informed consent, HF patients or dyads will receive the prompt list while in
      the waiting room prior to their visit. Completing the prompt list involves two steps. In step
      1, participants will independently select from a predetermined list of questions (within
      topic areas) that they would like to ask their health care provider. The questions/topics
      were developed by other HF patients and family members in another phase of the study. Also,
      patients will be asked to choose behaviors they would like their family member to engage in
      during the visit (e.g., write down the provider's instructions, ask questions), from a
      structured list developed based on prior research. Family members will identify which
      behaviors they are willing to perform. In step 2, patients or dyads will collectively
      prioritize which questions/topics to discuss during the visit. Each dyad member will receive
      a prompt list to complete in the clinic waiting room immediately before their appointment.

      All visits will be audio-taped to assess effects of the intervention on communication
      behaviors during the visit. All participants will complete a questionnaire at baseline, 2
      days after the audio-taped clinic visit, and at 3 months.

    <measure>Percent of screened candidates who enroll</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess enrollment rate into the study. The investigators aim to have at least 50% of screened individuals or dyads consent and enroll (enrollment rate)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants indicating that the checklist was helpful for facilitating communication with their health care provider.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess the perceived value of the checklist using a series 13 questions developed for this study. Each question is scored using a 6-point Likert response scale where 1=strongly disagree and 6=strongly agree. Higher scores mean higher perceived value of the checklist.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean score on the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) to measure self-care maintenance and self-care management. The 10-item self-care maintenance scale assesses behaviors used to maintain physiologic stability (e.g., adherence to medications, frequent weighing).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean score Self-care of heart failure Index self-care confidence subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the the 6-item subscale of the Self-Care of Heart Failure Index to assess self-confidence in performing behaviors and make decisions to control heart failure symptoms. The subscale score is standardized, with scores ranging from 0-100 (higher scores indicates greater self-care confidence). Scores â‰¥ 70 are reflective of &quot;adequate&quot; self-care confidence. A change in scale score of one-half of a standard deviation or more is considered clinically significant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean score on confidence in communicating with health care providers communication behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Perceived efficacy in patient-physician interactions (PEPPI) measure, a 6-item measure which assesses confidence (self-efficacy) in communicating with health care providers. Each question is scored using a 5-point likert scale (0= not at all confident to 5=very confident). Higher scores indicate greater confidence in communicating with health care providers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean score on patients' communication behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Communication with Physicians measure by Lorig, a 3-item measure which assesses the frequency of patients' engagement in communication behaviors during medical visits, including, preparing a list of questions, asking questions about treatment, and discussing personal problems with provider. Each question is answered using a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0=never to 5=always. Higher scores indicate more active engagement in communication during medical visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean score on Caregiver Contribution to Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (CC-SCHFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The CC-SCHFI is a 22-item measure (across 3 sub-scales) that assesses the contribution of caregivers to the self-care maintenance and self-care management of HF patients as well as their confidence in their ability to contribute to the patients' HF self-care. Each of the 3 subscales uses a 4-point Likert scale (never or rarely, sometimes, frequently, always or daily), with a standardized score from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate higher contribution to self-care.</description>
