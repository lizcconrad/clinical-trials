  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research study is to characterize the fermentation of chitin-glucan fiber by
      assessing the volatile compounds released in the breath. For this purpose, an interventional
      study with control will be performed. After a single administration of 4.5 g of chitin-glucan
      fiber, the kinetic of production of exhaled volatile compounds (such as H2, methane, SCFAs,…)
      will be measured during twelve hours. These results will be compared to the exhaled volatile
      compounds measured during twelve hours after supplementation with 4.5g of maltodextrin
      (placebo).
