  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test whether a combined OBINUTUZUMAB/bendamustine therapy
      is superior to single agent OBINUTUZUMAB in medically non-fit, 'compromised' patients in
      terms of anti-lymphoma activity (primary objective), side effects, and quality of life. For
      the assessment of the anti-lymphoma activity the &quot;event free survival (EFS)&quot; will be applied
      as primary endpoint. EFS is defined as the time from the day of randomization to the date of
      first documented disease progression, death by any cause, or institution of a new
      anti-lymphoma treatment.

      Study design:

      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter phase III trial with a parallel-group design of
      two groups.

      Randomization and Interventions:

      Randomization between Obinutuzumab single agent treatment versus Obinutuzumab plus
      Bendamustine followed by Obinutuzumab

      Treatment plans:

      Arm A: Obinutuzumab single agent Obinutuzumab flat dose of 1000 mg on Day 1 of each of four
      28 -day cycles and on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1

      If at least 'stable disease':

      Obinutuzumab flat dose of 1000 mg at weeks 21, 29, 37 and 45 Arm B: Obinutuzumab plus
      Bendamustine Obinutuzumab flat dose of 1000 mg on Day 1 of each of four 28 -day cycles and on
      Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1 plus Bendamustine 70 mg/m2 iv d1+2 of each of four 28 -day cycles

      If at least 'stable disease':

      Obinutuzumab flat dose of 1000 mg at weeks 21, 29, 37 and 45

      The project attempts to establish an evidence based treatment strategy for medically non-fit
      advanced stage FL-patients who are not eligible for standard therapeutic immunochemotherapy
      approaches to improve their long term perspectives.

      It will furthermore provide a prospectively generated data set which will link performance in
      the assessment scores IADL, G8 and CIRS-G to medical fitness as judged by the treating
      physician. The generated data will allow using geriatric and functional tests to define
      medical fitness and to provide a more solid basis for future studies.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 6.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>With the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (=IADL) the functional status) will be analysed (=instrument to assess independent living skills) The instrument is most useful for identifying how a person is functioning at the present time and for identifying improvement or deterioration over time. There are 8 domains of function measured with the Lawton IADL scale. Historically, women were scored on all 8 areas of function; men were not scored in the domains of food preparation, housekeeping, laundering. However, current recommendations are to assess all domains for both genders. Persons are scored according to their highest level of functioning in that category. A summary score ranges from 0 (low function, dependent) to 8 (high function, independent).</description>

    <measure>Comorbidity assessment will be performed by using the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 6.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This can be used to measure the burden of current and chronic illnesses in the older adult.This scoring system measures the chronic medical illness (&quot;morbidity&quot;) burden while taking into consideration the severity of chronic diseases in 14 items representing individual body systems.
The general rules for severity rating are:
0→No problem affecting that system.
Current mild problem or past significant problem.
Moderate disability or morbidity and/or requires first line therapy.
Severe problem and/or constant and significant disability and/or hard to control chronic problems.
Extremely severe problem and/or immediate treatment required and/or organ failure and/or severe functional impairment.</description>

    <measure>Comorbidity assessment will be performed by using the G 8 (=geriatric) 8 screening score</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to 6.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The G8 screening tool was developed to separate fit older cancer patients who were able to receive standard treatment from those that should undergo a geriatric assessment to guide tailoring of therapy. The assessment includes (instrumental) activities of daily living, cognition, mood, nutritional status, mobility, polypharmacy and social support. G8 is an independent predictor of mortality within the first year after inclusion (hazard ratio 3.93; 95 % confidence interval 1.67-9.22, p &lt; 0.001). The G-8 Score is a screening tool containing 8 questions. The total G-8 score lies between 0 and 17. A higher score indicates a better health status.</description>
