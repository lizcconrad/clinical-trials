  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is inflammatory, demyelinating and autoimmune disease of the central
      nervous system. It is usually seen with relapses and genetic and environmental factors play a
      role in the etiology. Neurological symptoms seen in MS restrict the patient's daily activity
      and social role participation. Mobility problems and fatigue are the most important reasons
      of role limitations and decreased quality of life. The importance of exercise training in
      disease management has been emphasized in recent years. However, few studies have
      investigated the effects of task-oriented trainings on symptoms of the disease. The aim of
      this sudy is to investigate the effects of task-oriented training additional to combined
      exercise training on functional capacity, mobility, balance, fatigue and quality of life in
      patients with MS.
