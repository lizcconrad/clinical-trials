  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often participate in equine-assisted
      interventions, where practitioners partner with horses to improve the health and well-being
      of the clients they serve. One of these interventions is equine-assisted occupational therapy
      (EAOT). The first aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of EAOT at improving the
      social, behavioral, and occupational functioning of children with ASD. Second, this study
      aims to conceptually develop the theory of change that guides how horses are integrated into
      occupational therapy for children with ASD. Eight children with ASD will participate in 10
      weeks of EAOT. The quantitative strand will involve caregivers filling out measures of social
      functioning, self-regulation, and occupational performance on a weekly basis. Investigators
      hypothesize children will demonstrate improved performance on these measures during the
      intervention in comparison to baseline. The qualitative strand will consist of interviews
      with the providing occupational therapists aimed at understanding the theory behind why the
      intervention is effective. The results of this study will have implications for children with
      ASD, their families, and occupational therapists providing services to individuals with ASD.

    <textblock>
      The proposed study will implement a mixed-methods investigation of equine-assisted
      occupational therapy (EAOT) for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The
      quantitative strand will consist of a multiple-baseline single-case design investigating the
      effects of EAOT on social functioning, self-regulation, and occupational performance of eight
      children with ASD. The qualitative strand will consist of interviews with the occupational
      therapists before, during, and after the 10-week intervention, focused on developing EAOT's
      theory of change.

      PARTICIPANTS Invesitgators will distribute fliers to local schools and ASD organizations to
      recruit eight participants for the study. Investigators will screen children for inclusion
      through a four-step process. First, they will call interested participants to ensure
      eligibility for the study, provide basic information, and answer any questions. Next,
      investigators will mail interested participants a packet that includes the SCQ, the ABC-C,
      and Hearts and Horses Enrollment Packet, along with a cover letter and instructions to mail
      back the completed forms, which will include a physician's signature stating the child is
      medically cleared to ride horses. Next, eligible participants will attend a screening at
      Hearts and Horses Therapeutic Riding Center to ensure they meet all PATH, Intl standards, and
      can ride a horse for 10 minutes while following safety rules. Finally, eligible participants
      will attend a final screening visit that will include administration of the ADOS-2, Leiter-3,
      and Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Third Edition (ABAS-3). This final screening visit
      will take place at Colorado State University for most participants, unless a participant can
      provide documentation of previous ADOS scores, in which case the screening visit can take
      place at Hearts and Horses if the family would prefer. Eight participants who meet
      established criteria will be enrolled in the study. If a child already had ADOS scores,
      investigators will ask the caregiver to bring the clinical report, or if they do not have it
      investigators will ask the caregiver to sign a HIPAA release form that would allow them to
      obtain the clinical report from the hospital or clinic that administered the ADOS.

      SCREENING MEASURES. Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). This parent-report measure is a
      quick, 10-minute screen for ASD. A score of 15 or above indicates the individual likely has
      ASD. The SCQ has strong discrimination between children with and without ASD and is widely
      used for entry into ASD research studies.

      Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2). The ADOS- 2 is a play-based
      assessment of communication, social interaction and behaviors, and is often used to confirm a
      clinical diagnosis of ASD. The ADOS has strong predictive validity for diagnosis of ASD.
      Participants who meet clinical-cutoffs for ASD will be included in the study. The ADOS-2
      requires extensive training to administer reliably; an investigator who has obtained
      research-level reliability will administer the ADOS-2 to potential participants.

      Leiter International Performance Scales, Third Edition (Leiter-3). The Leiter-3 is a
      completely nonverbal measure of intelligence and cognitive abilities that is widely used with
      the ASD population. The Brief IQ score can be used reliably in place of the Full IQ score
      when a minimal IQ estimate is needed; therefore, this study will use the Brief IQ version of
      the Leiter-3. Participants who have an IQ below 55 will be excluded from the study. A
      registered and licensed occupational therapist will administer the Leiter-3.

      Aberrant Behavior Checklist- Community (ABC-C). The ABC-C is a valid and reliable behavior
      rating scale that measures the extent of problem behaviors in children and adults with
      development disabilities. Any adult who knows the child well, in this case the caregiver, can
      complete the 58-item checklist. The irritability and hyperactivity subscales will be used as
      outcome measures in the study. Therefore, to avoid a ceiling effect as described above,
      children included in this study must have a combined score â‰¥ 11 on the irritability and
      hyperactivity subscales of the ABC-C, as established by Gabriels et al. (2015).

      PATH, Intl. Standards. PATH, Intl provides a list of contraindications for participants who
      should not participate in equine-assisted interventions. In order to ensure participants meet
      all PATH, Intl standards, they will complete Hearts and Horses enrollment packet and process.
      See attachments for the enrollment packet. Amongst other things, the packet includes a form
      that requires a physician signature that the child does not have any of the listed
      contraindications, and is medically cleared to participate in equine-assisted interventions.
      Furthermore, each participant will attend a screening visit at Hearts and Horses to ensure
      participants meet all other standards.

      Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS-3). The ABAS-3 is a norm-referenced rating scale
      that measures ten domains of adaptive behaviors and can be completed by a caregiver. The
      ABAS-3 was chosen because it measures adaptive behavior in a variety of domains, therefore
      providing a well-rounded picture of the child. The ABAS-3 will not be used to screen for
      inclusion, but rather will be completed by the caregiver prior to the occupational therapy
      evaluation in order to provide the therapist with information regarding areas of strengths
      and weaknesses in the child's everyday functioning, which will help to guide the evaluation
      and goal-setting.

      THE INTERVENTION The intervention will occur at Hearts and Horses Therapeutic Riding Center,
      which follows guidelines set forth by PATH, Intl to ensure safety of participants; for
      example, instructors are PATH-certified, trained side-walkers will be present during the
      intervention, and participants will wear helmets. The occupational therapists who will
      deliver the intervention currently provide EAOT to children with ASD at Hearts and Horses on
      a consistent basis. They are certified to provide equine-assisted interventions by PATH,
      Intl.

      Prior to the intervention, each participant and caregiver will participate in an evaluation
      with an occupational therapist to determine current level of functioning and family
      priorities. Before the evaluation, caregivers will be asked to fill out two forms and bring
      them to the evaluation: a questionnaire about their child's adaptive functioning and the
      sensory profile. During the evaluation, occupational therapists will conduct a
      semi-structured interview with the parent and child. Next, the occupational therapist will
      collaborate with the child and family to create occupation-focused goals, a process that will
      be facilitated by the administration of the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM).
      Occupational therapists will help to guide the family in setting occupation-focused goals
      that are realistically attainable with this 10-week intervention.

      Guided by the evaluation, the occupational therapist will individualize the intervention to
      address each participant's unique goals, accommodate for individual learning styles (e.g.
      minimize use of verbal cues), and incorporate each child's special interests or powerful
      motivators. Despite this individualization, common components will be present across all
      intervention sessions. Each session will be 45-60 minutes long, and the child will be mounted
      on the horse for at least 25 minutes. The session will begin with a visual schedule of the
      day's activities, which can then be referred to throughout the session to facilitate
      transitions from one activity to another. There will be a one-to-one ratio between the child
      and occupational therapist to ensure the intervention is individualized to each child's
      needs. Additionally, trained volunteers will serve as horse leaders and sidewalkers during
      mounted portions of the intervention; every effort will be made to pair each child with the
      same horse and volunteers for the duration of the 10-week intervention. Two EAOT sessions
      will occur simultaneously in the same arena, and the occupational therapists will facilitate
      social interaction between participants. As described below in the quantitative data
      collection section, participants will be paired into groups of two so that the session that
      is occurring simultaneously is with a child with autism with a similar level of adaptive
      functioning. Activities will be structured to provide positive reinforcement for
      communication, and the occupational therapist will manipulate equine movement to provide
      graded sensory stimulation and optimal arousal. Unmounted, or &quot;ground activities&quot; will be
      customized to address each child's goal. For example, if a child has a goal related to
      sequencing, the occupational therapist may design an activity focused on sequencing the steps
      of grooming the horse. A graduate research assistant will videotape 30% of intervention
      sessions, and an undergraduate research assistant blinded to the purpose of the study will
      use a checklist to assess intervention fidelity of the videotaped sessions.

      DATA COLLECTION: It is likely that improvements made during EAOT will be maintained after the
      intervention is withdrawn, therefore a multiple-baseline design is the optimal single-case
      experimental design. After the occupational therapy evaluation, participants will be paired
      into groups of two based on similar levels of adaptive functioning and/or similar or
      complementary treatment goals. Pairs of participants will then be randomized to a 5-week, or
      7-week baseline phase. The baseline condition will be a no-treatment waiting list, during
      which caregivers will fill out the ABC-C on a weekly basis, retrospectively reporting on
      their child's behavior for the previous week. Caregivers will also complete a brief
      questionnaire that asks about any changes in medication, therapy, or routines that week. In
      addition, caregivers will rate their child's target behaviors on a VAS everyday. All of these
      measures (ABC-C, parent questionnaire, and VAS) will be administered online using a Qualtrics
      survey that is emailed or texted to them, depending on parent preference.

      The 10-week intervention phase will consist of weekly, 45-minute EAOT intervention sessions,
      described above. Throughout the intervention phase, caregivers will continue completing the
      ABC-C and brief questionnaire weekly; caregivers will also continue providing VAS ratings
      daily. In addition, caregivers will complete the intervention credibility scale, the SRS-2,
      and the COPM on the first week and the 10th week of the intervention phase, in order to
      provide a pre and post assessment of caregivers' attitude toward treatment, and child social
      functioning and occupational performance. Three months after the intervention, caregivers
      will complete the SRS-2, COPM, and the ABC-C a final time to determine maintenance of effects
      DATA ANALYSIS: Visual inspection will be the primary method of data analysis. The Co-PI will
      plot the dependent variables (y-axis) against time (x-axis) for each participant. Next, she
      will inspect the data for changes in mean (average rate of performance), and trend (direction
      of change over time), of the dependent variables between baseline and intervention
      conditions. If the data demonstrate positive findings, the plotted graphs will be further
      inspected for evidence of non-effect, such as delayed latency to change, positive trends
      during the baseline phase, or variable data with overlap between phases. As a secondary
      method of analysis, investigators will calculate the non-overlap of all pairs (NAP) of the
      ABC-C, and VAS scores between baseline and intervention phases, which will yield an effect
      size and a measure of statistical significance . Additionally, investigators will perform a
      Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test to compare the scores on the SRS-2 and COPM before
      and after the intervention. For these calculations, the a priori Î± level will be set to .05,
      and Cohen's d will be calculated to generate an effect size. All calculations will be
      performed in the latest version of IBM SPSS statistics.

      QUALITATIVE STRAND: CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THEORY PARTICIPANTS: Two occupational
      therapists have been recruited to participate in this study. Both occupational therapists
      helped to screen the children with autism to determine if they met all PATH, Intl standards
      for participation in equine-assisted therapy. Second, they have both helped to conduct
      occupational therapy evaluations to determine the current level of functioning and therapy
      goals for the children with autism. Third, they will provide the equine-assisted occupational
      therapy to children with autism. Finally, they will participate in interviews about the
      theory guiding the intervention they are delivering.

      DATA COLLECTION: Qualitative data will consist of interviews with the occupational therapists
      during and after the 10-week intervention. During the course of the 10-week intervention, the
      Co-PI will interview both occupational therapists using a semi-structured interview guide.
      Questions during the first interview will focus on the occupational therapists' theoretical
      rationale for how the intervention is designed. During the intervention phase, the
      investigators will observe and take fieldnotes, and a research assistant will videotape 30%
      of the intervention sessions. Fieldnotes, videotapes, and transcriptions of previous
      interviews will guide the creation of a new semi-structured interview guide, once again aimed
      at elucidating the rationale guiding the choice of intervention components, and the theory of
      change underlying each component. Overall during the intervention phase, investigators will
      conduct 5 hours of interviews with each occupational therapist. After the 10-week
      intervention has concluded and quantitative data have been analyzed, the Co-PI will conduct
      one final hour-long interview with both occupational therapists aimed at explaining the
      quantitative results. The therapists may have insights concerning why certain outcomes were
      found and not others, why children responded differently to the intervention, or why trends
      in the data changed throughout the course of the 10-week intervention phase.

      DATA ANALYSIS: InvestigatorsI will transcribe audio-recorded interviews and perform
      theoretical thematic analysis with constant comparison using the qualitative data analysis
      software program, Nvivo. First, interviews will be coded according to these start codes,
      derived from work on theory-guided interventions: 1- &quot;problems&quot; experienced by participants
      2- intervention components designed to address problems, 3- theories of change and
      mediational processes, and 4- intended outcomes. Next, investigators will conduct open
      coding, whereby the text will be broken down, examined, conceptualized, and categorized. Data
      will be sub-categorized within existing start-codes as appropriate, and new categories may
      emerge from the data. After open coding, investigators will engage in axial coding, seeking
      to find links and relationships between and within categories and sub-categories.
      Investigators will bring emerging analyses to the practitioners for occassional member
      checks, in order to ensure that ongoing analyses are consistent with their intended meanings.
      Finally, selective coding will allow final themes to emerge, and will elucidate relationships
      between themes.

      OPTIONAL FOLLOW-UP QUALITATIVE STRAND: CAREGIVER PERCEPTION OF CHANGE PARTICIPANTS: On the
      last day of therapy, caregivers of children with autism will be asked if they would like to
      participate in an optional follow-up interview. These are the same eight caregivers who have
      already been participating in the study by filling out daily and weekly questionnaires about
      their child. If they choose to participant in the optional follow-up interview, caregivers
      will be given a new consent form explaining this additional portion of the study.

      DATA COLLECTION: Interviews will be scheduled sometime during the Spring semester, likely
      January or February as the participants' schedules allow. Participants can choose if they
      would like the interview to occur at Hearts and Horses Therapeutic Riding Center in Loveland,
      at Colorado State University, or at a different location of their choosing such as their
      home. While in-person interviews are preferred, phone interviews will be an option for
      caregivers who would prefer not to meet in person. Interview questions will center around the
      caregivers' perceived impact of the therapy on their child. For instance, &quot;How, if at all, do
      you believe participating in equine-assisted therapy affected your child?&quot;. Interviews will
      be audio-recorded.

      DATA ANALYSIS: Recorded interviews will be transcribed either by a professional transcription
      service. Transcriptions will be uploaded into NVivo, a qualitative analysis software.
      Investigators will conduct open coding, whereby the text will be broken down, examined,
      conceptualized, and categorized. Data will be sub-categorized within existing start-codes as
      appropriate, and new categories may emerge from the data. After open coding,investigators
      will engage in axial coding, seeking to find links and relationships between and within
      categories and sub-categories. Finally, selective coding will allow final themes to emerge,
      and will elucidate relationships between themes. After initial analysis is complete,
      participants will be asked to participate in a follow-up interview or phone call in a place
      of their choosing, in order to conduct a member check, and ensure that emerging analyses are
      in line with participants' intended meaning.
