  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project addresses critical gaps in the understanding of the strength,
      specificity and persistence of neurobehavioral adaptions that occur in the initial period of
      repeated consumption of a branded sugar sweetened beverage (SSB). Half of Americans consume
      SSBs on any given day.

      Regular SSB intake is considered a contributing factor to excess energy intake, weight gain,
      and obesity, which impacts 70% of Americans. A contributing factor to repeated SSB
      consumption is sugar intake causes the release of dopamine (DA) and opioids in the striatum,
      providing positive reinforcement. As such, multiple brain-based models of food reward-driven
      obesity have been proposed, largely focusing on the striatum and executive functioning. These
      brain-based models of obesity have elucidated risk factors for overconsumption of high-sugar
      foods; however, data supporting these competing models rely heavily on observational studies
      in small samples.

      Importantly, previous reports from the investigators lab and others directly implicate eating
      behavior patterns as a vital contributor to aberrant neurobehavioral responses to food
      stimuli. However, without experimental evidence, there are fundamental gaps in the
      investigators knowledge about the neurobehavioral adaptations that occur as an individual
      begins to regularly consume a SSB prior to weight change.

      As observational data suggest, it is also crucial to examine individual difference factors
      that may exacerbate or protect against adaptations associated with regular SSB intake, as
      well as whether these adaptions are specific.

    <measure>Percent Change in Voxel-wise Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) Including Outliers Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of Brain Activation Signals in Response to Beverage Taste and Logo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, approx. 5 weeks post</time_frame>
    <description>The fMRI paradigm will assess evoked blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to receipt of study beverages, (sweetened and unsweetened) and a tasteless solution, and logo-elicited anticipation of both beverages and tasteless solution.
The paradigm is controlled by in-house scripts written in PsychoPy software. The visual stimuli will be two beverage logos, a tasteless logo, and a fixation cross. Each logo (1 seconds) signals impending delivery of 3 mL of the associated juice/tasteless over 6 seconds, with the fixation cross otherwise presented. Participants are visually instructed on when to swallow. A jitter ranging from 5 to 13 (x̅ =8) seconds follow each trial. In total, the participants are presented 24 repeats of the events of interest over 4, 7 min runs.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, approx. 5 weeks post</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators use resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data to assess intrinsic functional connectivity and network analyses. Functional connectivity is commonly quantified by measuring the synchronization of low-frequency BOLD fluctuations across pairs of brain regions of interest (ROIs) via correlation coefficients (see statistical analyses). rsfMRI data is acquired in one run of 7 minutes; participants are asked to remain still with their eyes open, and to fixate on the fixation cross.</description>

    <measure>Modulation of Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of Brain Activation Signals in Response to Beverage Taste and Logo by TaqIA Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, approx. 5 weeks post</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva from participants is used to extract DNA using standard salting-out and solvent precipitation methods, to yield an average of 45 µg of DNA. The TaqIA (rs1800497) assays are done using a fluorogenic 5_nuclease (Taqman, ABI) method on an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System via the allelic discrimination mode. Reactions containing 20ng of DNA are performed in 10 µl reactions with TaqMan Universal Polymerase Chain Reaction Master Mix using standard cycling conditions. Independent investigators score allele sizes; inconsistencies are reviewed and rerun when necessary. For every assay, each 96-well plate includes non-template and DNA standards of known genotype. All genotyping is performed at the UNC-CH Advanced Analytics Core</description>

    <measure>Change in Stop Signal Reaction Time to Logo as Measured in Behavioral Response Inhibition Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, approx. 5 weeks post</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the behavioral response inhibition task is to examine motor disinhibition in response to the beverage logos and control logos. This allows for behavioral assessment of bias toward the logos and is sensitive to detect change to the intervention. Participants respond as quickly and accurately as possible with a keyboard press when shown the target logo, but withhold their responses during presentation of other logos. The task is performed twice, each time depicting one of the beverage logos as the 'target' logo. Each task consists of 48 trials. For each trial, a picture of the target logo (75% occurrence) or similar logos (25% occurrence) is presented for 500 ms. Stimuli is presented and reaction times, commission and omission errors are recorded using Presentation (Neurobehavioral Systems, Davis, CA).</description>

    <measure>Change score in Visual Analog Scale Ratings of Beverage Perceptual Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Assessment; Intervention Visits 1-9, 3 weeks; Post-Intervention Assessment, approx. 5 weeks post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All visual analog scales are presented on an iPad screen and completed one at a time. The scale is assessing response to taste after the participant consumes a small amount of the beverage. Perceived pleasantness of, and desire to consume the two juices is measured using adapted labeled hedonic scales at pre-/post-intervention. Pleasantness is phrased 'How pleasant is this taste' and anchored by (-100) 'most unpleasant imaginable' to (100) 'most pleasant imaginable', and 'neutral' (0) in the middle. Desire follows a similar pattern using 'desire to consume' as the phrasing. Pleasantness and desire of the assigned juice is also evaluated at the 9 intervention assessments. Perceived hunger is assessed via cross-modal visual analog scales, anchored by (-100) 'I am not hungry at all' to (100) 'I have never been more hungry'. The change score is calculated from the slope of ratings plotted by time.</description>

    <measure>Change in Food Pattern From Baseline to Post-Intervention Assessment by Food Frequency Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Assessment; Post-Intervention Assessment, approx. 5 weeks post</time_frame>
    <description>The Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) is a self-reported checklist of 76 foods and beverages with a frequency response section. Subjects report generally how often each item is consumed over a two-week period of time. The six possible responses are 1= never in the last two weeks, 2= 1-3 times in the last 2 weeks, 3= 4-6 times in the last 2 weeks, 4= 7-9 times in the last two weeks, 5= 10-13 times in the last 2 weeks, 6= daily or more in the last two weeks. Response information is used to estimate daily caloric intake (number of kcal) and macronutrient content (percent calories from carbohydrate/fat/protein). Food pattern is assessed as an aggregate of these measures. Changes in food pattern will be assessed as a difference from baseline to post-intervention assessment.</description>
