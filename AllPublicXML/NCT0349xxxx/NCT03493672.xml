      Rationale:

      Optimal selection of patients with cancer eligible for a clinical trial, is of utmost
      importance, but can be very difficult. Patients must be sufficiently fit and have a
      reasonable life expectancy, to be eligible for participation in clinical trials. In current
      clinical practice, the ECOG/WHO performance status, is used to select patients for clinical
      trials, and it has proven to be an independent predictor of survival in patients with cancer.
      This score is based on a subjective assessment of the treating physician, which can, together
      with the strong motivation of some patients to participate, lead to overestimation of a
      patient's actual physical condition and may thereby contribute to early trial
      discontinuation. Participation of these patients may not only harm them, but will also hamper
      trial conduct and outcomes.

      Both, physical activity and fitness are positively associated with survival in patients with
      cancer. This gives rise to the investigators hypothesis that objective measurements can be of
      added value in the selection process. Additionally, preliminary results in 50 patients with
      cancer that participated in part 1 of the &quot;Counting Steps!&quot; project revealed that the
      smartphone can produce valid and reliable assessments of physical activity and fitness, and
      the user friendliness was rated &quot;good&quot; by patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that measurements of physical activity and fitness with
      smartphones will provide more objective and accurate information about the actual physical
      condition of a patient with cancer.

      With a better prediction of trial feasibility (without early trial discontinuation) and
      overall survival in patients participating in phase I-II clinical trials, the selection of
      eligible trial participants could be improved. In this way, it is possible to more adequately
      identify patients who are most likely to successfully participate in a clinical trial and
      thereby have the highest chance to benefit from trial participation. Successful trial
      participation will provide optimal palliative care to patients and improve their quality of
      life. In addition, it may prohibit participation of patients who are currently incorrectly
      included in clinical trials and suffer from toxic therapies without having a chance to
      benefit from treatment. A better selection of patients will be beneficial for the trial
      outcomes and subsequently for the development of new anticancer drugs or treatment regimens.

      Objective:

      The investigators aim to:

        1. Identify whether objective smartphone measurements of physical activity and fitness is
           predictive for trial feasibility (without early trial discontinuation) in patients with
           cancer participating in phase I-II clinical trials.

        2. Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the use of the smartphone's objective
           assessments of physical activity and fitness in clinical practice.

      Study design: Observational study

      Study population:

      â€¢ 135 patients with hematologic or solid cancer referred to the VU medical center for
      participation in phase I-II clinical trials.

      Intervention:

      In this observational study, patients will not receive an additional intervention.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Prior to the start of medical treatment, physicians will rate the performance status, and
      participants will wear a smartphone for one week to measure the daily number of steps, to
      complete the 6 minute walk test using the smartphone application, and to fill out the 5-item
      physical function subscale of the EORTC QLQ-C30. These assessments will be repeated after 4
      and 8 weeks.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      No extra visits to the hospital will be necessary. Participation in this study will not cause
      any additional risks or expected benefits for participants. It will only deliver knowledge,
      which may be used in the future to better select patients eligible for participation in phase
      I-II clinical trials or even for regular treatment. Participation in the study will only cost
      time for patients. The patients will be asked to wear a smartphone for a week, have to
      perform a six-minute walk test (6MWT) once in this week and have to complete a questionnaire
      about their own physical function once. Subsequently, patients will repeat those measurements
      4 and 8 weeks after inclusion in the phase I-II clinical trial.
