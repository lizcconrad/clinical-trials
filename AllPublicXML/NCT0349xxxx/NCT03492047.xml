  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of N-acetyl cysteine in combination with
      paclitaxel on the clinical outcomes of patients with peripheral neuropathy,
      paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy affect quality of life in cancer patients.

      new therapeutic approches such as the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, showed to has
      neuroprotective effect, the aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of N-
      acetylcysteine(NAC) administration in the prevention of paclitaxel-Induced peripheral
      neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel is a first-line chemotherapeutic treatment of solid tumors. Neuronal damage also
      seems to have a major role in paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain, paclitaxel contributes to
      ROS formation (superoxide, hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide) in neuronal
      mitochondria that are involved in nerve injury-induced.

      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a cysteine pro-drug and glutathione (GSH) precursor which is a
      protective agent and detoxifies and scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS), which seems to
      help normalize the oxidative status.

      It has been reported that high dose of N-acetylcysteine shown to Prevent retrograde motor
      neuron death after neonatal peripheral nerve injury and significantly increases motor neuron
      survival, which may improve functional outcomes after obstetrical brachial plexus injury in
      rats.

      Also, it has been reported that NAC significantly inhibited CCI-induced microglia activation
      but elicited no notable effects on astrocytes. These results demonstrate an effective and
      safe approach that has been used clinically to alleviate neuropathic pain via the powerful
      inhibition of the activation of MMPs in rats.

      N-acetylcysteine has been shown to have neuroprotective effects against oxaliplatin-based
      adjuvant chemotherapy in colon cancer patients with Oral administration of
      N-acetylcysteine1,200 mg) was given one and a half hours before each oxaliplatin
      administration.
