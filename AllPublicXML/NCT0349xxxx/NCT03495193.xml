      The goal of this research is to identify an intervention that will improve cognition and
      sleep in persons with PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) often experience non-motor symptoms such as cognitive
      dysfunction and sleep problems. These symptoms can be more disabling than the motor symptoms
      of PD. Medications are often not effective for treating these non-motor symptoms or can have
      unwanted side effects. Non- medication treatments such as exercise are known to improve the
      motor symptoms of PD, but the effect of exercise on cognition and sleep has not been fully
      explored. This study investigates the impact of 16 weeks of supervised exercise, 3 times per
      week, compared to no-exercise over the same duration, on cognition and sleep dysfunction.
      Participants will be evaluated with cognitive tests and sleep studies before and after
      16-weeks to determine the impact of this exercise intervention. The goal of this research is
      to identify an intervention that will improve cognition and sleep in persons with PD.

    <intervention_model_description>The proposed study is a randomized, controlled, interventional study to investigate the impact of a novel exercise intervention on executive dysfunction (Aim 1) and objective sleep outcomes (Aim 2) in patients with PD. Thirty participants with idiopathic PD will be recruited from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Movement Disorders Center and randomized (1:1) to one of two groups (15 per group): exercise intervention (Ex) group or no-exercise (no-Ex) control group.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Exercise training will be performed 3x/week. After 2 sessions, training volume and intensity will progress over the first 4 sessions ramping up the number of sets to increase the volume. The full volume prescription will consist of: 1) 5 movements to improve strength and muscle mass (leg press, knee extension, chest press, overhead press, pull down), 3 sets each of 8-12 repetitions (~30 total repetitions); 2) trunk exercises to improve postural stability (trunk extension and flexion); 3) 3-4 bodyweight exercises (selected from a menu) to improve power and balance (e.g. step up, squat, jump squat, lunge, side lunge, push-up, assisted pull-up, assisted dip). Bodyweight movements will be modified as necessary to match abilities.</description>
