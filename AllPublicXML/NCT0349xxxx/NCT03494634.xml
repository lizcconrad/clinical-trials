  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chidamide，a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in China. The aim of this study was to
      observe the efficacy and safety of Chidamide as a single-agent treatment in patients with
      recurrent and metastatic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated solid tumors.
