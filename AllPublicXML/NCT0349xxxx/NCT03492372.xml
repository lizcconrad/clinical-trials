  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are trying to identify molecular mechanisms that control spine deformity and
      degenerative changes that can be used for therapeutic strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Discarded surgical material from spinal procedures is collected. RNA analysis and other tests
      on the tissue is performed to determine markers of pathologic disease and to develop
      pharmacologic treatment strategies for pediatric spinal disorders.
