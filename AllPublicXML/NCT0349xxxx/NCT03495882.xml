    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-arm study, of AGEN1884 in combination with AGEN2034 in
      subjects with advanced solid tumors including cervical cancer. AGEN2034 is a novel, fully
      human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody, designed to block program cell death-1
      (PD-1). AGEN1884 is a novel, fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody,
      designed to block cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4).

      The study consists of two phases:

        -  Phase 1: Dose escalation

        -  Phase 2: Expansion in Select Tumors

      Phase 1: Part A - Dose Escalation:

      The study will consist initially of a 3+3 dose escalation that will evaluate different
      combination dose levels of AGEN1884 and AGEN2034 in subjects with advanced / refractory solid
      tumors.

      Phase 2: Expansion in Select Tumors

      To further characterize safety and efficacy, the following expansion cohort will be enrolled:

      Part B - recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic cervical cancer In Phase 2, the selected CDL
      of AGEN2034 and AGEN1884, established in Part A, will be administered for a maximum of 2
      years or until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for stopping
      the study drugs or withdrawal from the trial occurs.

      For the Phase 2 portion of the study, an Independent Data Management Committee (IDMC) will be
      established to evaluate safety and efficacy and an Independent Endpoint Review Committee
      (IERC) will be established to adjudicate tumor response.

             that disease recurrence for 5 years since initiation of that therapy.

             Note: In Phase 2, the history and time requirement for no evidence of disease for 5
             years does not apply to the cancer for which the subject is enrolled in the study.

             hours of first dose of study medication) if of childbearing potential or be of
             non-child bearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined as (by other than
             medical reasons):

             barrier methods throughout the study, starting with the screening visit through 120
             days after the last dose of study treatment.

         11. Male subjects with a female partner(s) of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             two adequate barrier methods throughout the trial starting with the screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of study treatment is received. Males with

             T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibodies.

          4. Has persisting toxicity related to prior therapy of National Cancer Institute Common

             and/or surgical resection).

          6. Has known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (NCI-CTCAE Grade
             ≥3), any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma (i.e., ≥3 features of partly

             within 2 years of the start of trial treatment (i.e. with use of disease modifying
             agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (i.e.,
             thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or
             pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

         10. Has had an allogeneic tissue/solid organ transplant.

         11. Has or had interstitial lung disease (ILD) OR has had a history of pneumonitis that

             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.
