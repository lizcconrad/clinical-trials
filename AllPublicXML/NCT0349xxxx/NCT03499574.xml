  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the feasibility of delivering swallowing therapy using surface
      electromyography as a means of biofeedback to patients with dysphagia in the acute stroke
      setting. It will investigate trends in efficacy by comparing biofeedback therapy to usual
      care. The results will inform future dosing and efficacy studies.
