  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no published data on the role of melatonin supplementation or the
      appropriate dose for patients with multiple sclerosis. Because of the potential benefits of
      melatonin, this pilot study will be an exploratory investigation to evaluate the effect of
      supplementing melatonin in subjects with multiple sclerosis who are taking an oral disease
      modifying therapy (DMT) for 6 months or longer. It is our intent that the results of this
      study will support the rationale and be a prelude to a larger trial which can focus on
      clinical efficacy of melatonin therapy outcomes.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change in 24 hour urinary
      6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6SMT) collected for 24 hours in two twelve hour sessions. The secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the change in serum morning melatonin level. In addition, quality
      of life (QOL) measures will be assessed including the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS),
      Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).
      Clinical objectives include the number of relapses during the trial and a change in the
      Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) &amp; Performance Scales (PS).

      The pilot study is a one-year randomized, rater- and dose-blinded trial evaluating the
      potential role of melatonin in subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis who have been
      taking a stable dose of an oral disease modifying therapy (DMT) for at least 6 months. The
      oral DMTs include dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, and teriflunomide. Thirty subjects with
      relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled at Providence Neurological Specialties in Portland, Oregon.

    <description>Changes in the MFIS: Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is a PRO, consisting of 21 statements that describe the effect of fatigue. Subject will choose an answer (0= never to 4=always) that best describes how fatigue has affected them in the past 4 weeks. Item scores are summed to a total score. The total MFIS score ranges from 0 to 84. Higher scores indicate higher level of fatigue.</description>

    <description>Changes in the MSIS-29: Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) is a patient reported outcome (PRO) measure, consisting of two subscales- physical impact of MS (20 items) and psychological impact (9 items). It asks subject to rate the impact MS has their daily life in the past 2 weeks (1=low impact to 4=large impact). Scores from individual items are summed to a total score. Physical impact score ranges from 20-80 and psychological impact scores ranges from 9-36. Higher scores indicate greater impact of MS on QoL.</description>

    <description>Changes in PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) asks 10 sets of questions about sleep quality and pattern in the past month. The scale derive 7 component scores based on a 0 to 3 scale (0= no difficulty, 3=severe difficulty) which are summed to a global score (range 0 to 21). Higher scores indicates worse sleep quality.</description>
