  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study determine the difference in hemodynamic effects of synthetic and
      natural caffeine consumption in healthy individuals through blood pressure (central and
      peripheral) assessment. Participants will randomly be assigned to consume either one 8oz cup
      of coffee containing 400mg of caffeine (increased caffeine using concentrated coffee) or one
      8oz cup of coffee-flavored drink with approximately 400mg synthetic caffeine from capsules
      dissolved in it.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the difference in effects of consuming synthetic
      versus natural caffeine on hemodynamic parameters in healthy subjects. This study will
      determine the difference in hemodynamic effects of synthetic and natural caffeine consumption
      in healthy individuals through blood pressure (central and peripheral) assessment. The
      participants in this study are healthy adults who will be introduced to a risk that may be
      more than they would encounter through their normal daily activities. This study seeks to add
      to the literature by evaluating the difference in impact of synthetic compared to natural
      caffeine on central blood pressure.

      This protocol has the following aims:

        1. Investigators hypothesize there will be a (baseline adjusted [ΔBP]) difference in BP
           (peripheral and central) between the natural and synthetic caffeine arms in healthy
           volunteers post consumption.

        2. Investigators hypothesize there will be (baseline adjusted [ΔCO]) no difference in CO
           between the natural and synthetic caffeine arms in healthy volunteers post consumption.

        3. Investigators hypothesize there will be (baseline adjusted [ΔSVR]) no difference in SVR
           between the natural and synthetic caffeine arms in healthy volunteers hours post
           consumption.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy males and females

          -  Active duty military service members

          -  DoD beneficiaries

          -  Participants must be willing to refrain from caffeine use 72 hours prior to study days
             one and five

             or ventricular arrhythmia, family history of premature sudden cardiac death before the
             age of 60, left ventricular hypertrophy, acute myocardial ischemia, atherosclerosis,
             hypertension, and palpitations. This will be determined through the questionnaire

          -  Blood pressure at initial screening appointment or at baseline on study Day One
             greater than 130/80 and if 130-139/80-89, FRS risk greater than 10%.

          -  Presence of any known medical condition, confirmed through participant interview up to
             the discretion of the research team. Examples of these are:
