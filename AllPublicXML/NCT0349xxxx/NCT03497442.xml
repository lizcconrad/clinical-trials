  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asian Flushing Syndrome (AFS) is a genetic disease affecting approximately 70% of patients of
      East Asian descent characterized by severe flushing with minimal ethanol consumption. This
      reaction is cosmetically unattractive and socially limiting. Many Asian patients avoid
      drinking alcohol on dates, at weddings, and during business events because of this reaction
      and the perception of being drunk or alcoholic.

      Ethanol is normally metabolized to acetic acid by two enzymes. The first enzyme, alcohol
      dehydrogenase (ADH) converts ethanol to acetaldehyde. The second enzyme, aldehyde
      dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) converts the toxic acetaldehyde to harmless acetic acid. When ADH
      function is increased or ALDH2 function is decreased, the toxic intermediate acetaldehyde
      accumulates resulting in cutaneous flushing. Over 70% of East Asians have genetic
      polymorphisms in either ADH or ALDH2 leading to intense flushing with ethanol consumption.

      There are no effective topical treatments for the Asian Flushing Syndrome. Oral
      antihistamines have been used with some success in treating symptoms of Asian Flushing
      Syndrome; however these can have sedating effects and may be dangerous in combination with
      alcohol.

      Brimonidine is a selective Î±2-adrenoceptor agonist that acts through vasoconstriction and is
      commercially available in a topical gel. This topical treatment is FDA approved for the
      indication of facial flushing and has a long history of safety in human subjects.

    <description>This is a randomized vehicle controlled, double blinded, interventional study. Patients of East Asian descent with a history of Asian Flushing Syndrome will be asked to apply a thin layer of brimonidine 0.33% gel to one half of their face thirty minutes before consuming alcohol (1.5 oz vodka for women, 3.0 oz vodka for men). The Photos will be taken 30 minutes, one hour, and 1.5 hours after consumption of alcohol. Erythema will be assessed at each time point by both the patient and study investigator using a 5- point erythema assesment score. Patient blood alcohol content (BAC) will be measured noninvasively at each time point.</description>
