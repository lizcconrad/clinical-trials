      A randomized controlled trial comparing Urtica comp. gel (Swissmedic listed medication in the
      category of &quot;Anthroposophic Medication without Indication&quot;) against standard skin care,
      examining its effect in prevention and treatment of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer
      patients under Radiation therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation dermatitis is one of the most common side effects of radiotherapy for cancer and
      affects around 95 % of patients receiving radiotherapy. Patients with breast cancer as well
      as patients with head and neck cancer are most frequently affected, due to the higher
      radiation dose to the skin, as compared to other cancer types.

      Radiation dermatitis has a profound impact on the quality of a patient's life, due to pain
      and discomfort. Skin lesions bear a marked risk of infection. In addition, all these issues
      may be the cause of interruption of radiation therapy, resulting in inadequate disease
      treatment.

      Despite a plentitude of studies researching local and systemic therapeutic approaches,
      currently no treatment (aside from local steroids which bear substantial side-effects) can be
      explicitly recommended.

      Thus, further research, especially in therapeutic options with a positive side-effect
      spectrum would be highly beneficial.

      Urtica comp. gel is a Swissmedic registered medication. It is e.g. applied in first and
      second-degree burn and scalding as well as sunburn and has been used in over 80 years with an
      excellent safety profile. Positive clinical experience in treating radiation dermatitis with
      Urtica comp. gel suggest studying this therapeutic option in a pilot trial.

    <description>Comparison between both arms. The FACIT-TS-G (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy treatment satisfaction - General) assesses the patients treatment satisfaction at the end of therapy (EOT after 6 weeks of Radiation therapy).
The questionnaire consists of 8 questions, 3 of which are answered on a scale ranging from 0 (much worse) to 4 (much better), 3 questions ranging from 0 (not al all) to 3 (totally) and two questions which can be answered with 0 (no), 1(maybe) and 2 (yes). Thus on all scales a higher value represents a better outcome. The total score range is 0 (not satisfied at all) to 25 (highly satisfied).</description>

    <description>with the Skin Condition VAS the patient self-assesses the skin condition in the radiation area.
The questionnaire consists of 5 subscales: pain, itching, burning, irritation, visual appearance. Each scale ranges from 0 (not apparent) to 100 (worst possible expression). For the total score all values are summed up and divided by 5 (number of scales) resulting in a total score ranging from 0 (best possible outcome = no skin affection due to radiation) to 100 (worst possible outcome).</description>

    <description>For the patients of the test-group Urtica comp gel is applied three times per day locally on the skin as soon as the patient senses &quot;itching, tingling&quot; and/or reddening. Otherwise the skincare is exactly as the control group in line with the departments general guidelines.
In case of marked worsening, e.g. epitheliolysis, the patient may receive &quot;Flammazine and Ialugen plus&quot; as rescue-care.
Rescue care: according to the departments therapeutic guidelines patients will receive &quot;Flammazine and/or Ialugen plus&quot; as clinically indicated at the discretion of the treating physician (usually in cases of marked worsening of the skin condition like e.g. epitheliolysis).</description>
