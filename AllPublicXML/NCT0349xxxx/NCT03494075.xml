      Modeled after the Storycorps project and healthtalk.org, MyPaTH Story Booth will use an
      (audio) &quot;document&quot; approach to elicit in depth experiential knowledge or perspectives from
      patients and caregivers by recording their personal stories. Narratives provide a powerful
      framework for understanding patient problems and the larger process of illness, coping, and
      seeking health care. Narratives can provide meaning, context, and perspective for patients'
      situations and insight into failures in health care delivery, particularly for marginalized
      patients. MyPaTH Story Booth will provide simple instructions for how participants can work
      with an interview partner (e.g., a family member or friend) to record their story. MyPath
      Story Booth will be launched sequentially at each PaTH site to establish an initial archive
      of patient and caregiver narratives. Individuals who record narratives will be asked to
      provide limited &quot;tags&quot; to populate a searchable database (e.g., their age, sex, interview
      topic). The audio booth and procedures will also be made available to PaTH affiliated
      researchers who wish to augment the narrative database with narratives of patient partners
      from specific study populations.
