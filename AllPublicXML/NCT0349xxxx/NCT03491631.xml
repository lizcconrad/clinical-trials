  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is designed to efficiently identify the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination therapy regimen of the IDO1 inhibitor
      SHR9146 when administered in combination with immune checkpoint PD-1 inhibitor SHR-1210 plus
      VEGFR inhibitor Apatinib or not in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. All
      subjects will receive the same standard SHR-1210 plus Apatinib (only three drugs
      group)regimen, while SHR9146 in doses increasing from 100 mg twice daily to, potentially, 600
      mg twice daily. Once the recommended regimen has been identified, subjects with the selected
      tumor type will be enrolled into expansion cohorts based upon prior safety and tolerability
      data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic solid
             tumors that have failed prior standard therapy (including subject refusal or
             intolerance).

          2. At least one measurable parameter according to RECIST 1.1.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.

          4. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          5. Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL

               2. Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL

               3. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); for subjects with
