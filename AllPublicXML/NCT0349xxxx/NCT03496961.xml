      This study is to disclose the mechanism of characteristic Tao yin exercises regulate Chronic
      Fatigue Syndromes based on Brain-Gut Axis.Explore the clinical manifestation of Chronic
      Fatigue Syndromes, changes of neurotransmitter and central brain function. Then provide some
      new methods of treating Chronic Fatigue Syndromes.

    <textblock>
      This research will be conducted in Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.Then
      the clinical efficacy of Yan Nian Jiu Zhuan Fa on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be observed
      by examining gastrointestinal function, affecting the content of substances in plasma and
      analysing the central nerve response mechanism.

    <intervention_model_description>Clinically evaluated, medically unexplained fatigue of at least 6 months duration:
Of new onset. Not a result of ongoing exertion. Not substantially alleviated rest and associated with a substantial reduction in previous levels of activity</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This will use simple randomization ways. Sofware20.0 will used to generate a random unique number for each integral number from 1 to 90 and divide the 90 numbers (1 to 90) into three groups with a ratio of 1:1:1 based on the random numbers group. The number grouping is unknown. This will be a double blind trial.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report instrument consisting of 20-item devised to measure fatigue, covering the dimensions of General Fatigue, Physical Fatigue, Mental Fatigue, Reduced Motivation and Reduced Activity. This instrument takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete. The instrument's psychometric properties were tested and determined to have good internal consistency and construct validity in samples with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is an internationally well-validated measure of Health-related quality of life that has a broad scope of questions validated across different chronic diseases and comorbidities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain functional connectivity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional connectivity density (FCD) is a newly developed data-driven method to measure the number of functional connections of each voxel, possibly providing new insight into the neural correlates of fluid reasoning.Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a novel method for studying the changes of brain functional connectivity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bristol Stool Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Bristol stool scale is a diagnostic medical tool designed to classify the form of human feces into seven categories. It is used in both clinical and experimental fields. The seven types of stool are:
Scale 1: Separate hard lumps, like nuts (hard to pass), also known as goat feces or sausage-shaped, but lumpy.
Scale 2: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface or like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft.
Scale 3: Soft blobs with clear cut edges (passed easily). Scale 4: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool even watery, no solid pieces, entirely liquid.
Scale 1 indicate constipation, Scale 2 being the ideal stools as they are easy to defecate while not containing excess liquid, Scale 3 tending towards diarrhea, and Scale 4 indicate diarrhea.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. Developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, the PSQI is intended to be a standardized sleep questionnaire for clinicians and researchers to use with ease and is used for multiple populations. The questionnaire has been used in many settings, including research and clinical activities, and has been used in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Clinical studies have found the PSQI to be reliable and valid in the assessment of sleep problems to some degree, but more so with self-reported sleep problems and depression-related symptoms than actigraphic measures.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropeptide Y</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36 amino-acid neuropeptide that is involved in various physiological and homeostatic processes in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. NPY has been identified as the most abundant peptide present in the mammalian central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord. It is secreted alongside other neurotransmitters such as glutamate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Substance P</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Substance P is a bioactive 11-amino acid peptide (Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-amide) first isolated in 1931 from brain and intestine. The peptide is involved in many physiological processes including pain modulation, smooth muscle contraction, blood pressure control, kidney function and water homeostasis.Substance P is widely distributed in numerous tissues and body fluids including the central and peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, visual system and circulatory system.</description>
