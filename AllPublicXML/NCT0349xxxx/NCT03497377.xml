  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate a radiolabeled urea-based small molecule inhibitor
      of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), [18F]DCFPyL (DCFPyL) PET/CT (or PET/MRI imaging
      if available) for detection of metastatic prostate cancer. PSMA is a well characterized
      histological marker of prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential.
      Preliminary first-in-human studies demonstrate high specific uptake of a first generation
      less avid compound, DCFBC, in metastatic prostate cancer and demonstrated feasibility for
      prostate cancer metastatic detection. Investigators propose to assess the ability of DCFPyL
      PET to detect metastatic prostate cancer by visual qualitative and quantitative SUV analysis.
      Correlation will be made to sites of suspected metastatic disease detected by ultra sensitive
      but less specific [18F]Sodium Fluoride (NaF)-PET/CT imaging for prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological confirmation of prostate cancer

          2. Radiologic evidence of new or progressive metastatic disease demonstrated on
             anatomical imaging (CT, MRI, or ultrasound), bone scintigraphy, [18F]Sodium Fluoride
             PET, and/or [18F]FDG PET

          3. Rising PSA on two observations taken at least 1 week apart

          4. Adequate peripheral venous access or available central venous catheter access for
             radiopharmaceutical administration

          5. Patient can remain on androgen deprivation therapy if on the same regimen prior to
             documentation of progressive metastatic disease

          6. Patient cannot start a new therapy for prostate cancer prior to study
             radiopharmaceutical imaging

          7. Patient is judged by the Investigator to have the initiative and means to be compliant
             with the protocol and be within geographical proximity to make the required study
             visits

          8. Patients or their legal representatives must have the ability to read, understand and
             provide written informed consent for the initiation of any study related procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has been treated with an investigational drug, investigational biologic, or
             investigational therapeutic device within 14 days prior to study radiotracer
             administration

          2. Prior radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or androgen-deprivation therapy within 2 weeks
             prior to study radiotracer administration (Washout is one half-life of the drug or 2
             weeks, whichever is longest)

          3. Initiation of new therapy for progressive metastatic disease since radiographic
             documentation of progression.

          4. Serum creatinine &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal

          5. Total bilirubin &gt; 3 times the upper limit of normal

          6. Liver Transaminases &gt; 5times the upper limit of normal

          7. Unable to lie flat during or tolerate PET/CT (or PET/MRI imaging if available)

          8. Prior history of any other malignancy within last 2 years, other than skin basal cell
             carcinoma or superficial bladder cancer.
