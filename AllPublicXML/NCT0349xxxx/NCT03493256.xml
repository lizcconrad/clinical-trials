  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single center prospective cohort study a total of 100 patients scheduled for elective
      off-pump CABG will be recruited. They will be allocated to one study and one control group
      according to the presence or absence of postoperative type 2 neurological complications. The
      two groups will be compared in terms of serum concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic
      protein (GFAP), neuroserpin (NSP), phosphorylated axonal neurofilament subunit H (pNfH) and
      visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) at the time of skin incision and closure as well as 24 hours
      and 7 days following surgery. Diagnostic performance of these markers for predicting type 2
      neurological complications of off-pump CABG will be assessed.
