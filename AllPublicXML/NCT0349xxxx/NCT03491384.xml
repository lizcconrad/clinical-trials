    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether the anxiolytic effects and anti-inflammatory properties of
      cannabis vary as a function of the ratio of CBD to THC, with the goal that these effects may
      shed light on the mixed data linking cannabis use and anxiety. Individuals with mild to
      moderate anxiety who elect to use cannabis (smoked flower or edible) will complete four weeks
      of observation. Participants complete cognitive tasks, a substance use history, health
      questionnaires concerning sleep and physical activity, and a blood draw at four different
      time points (Baseline, after 2 weeks of cannabis use, and immediately before and after
      self-administration after 4 weeks of use) with the use of a mobile pharmacology laboratory,
      which goes to a convenient location for each participant to self-administer their cannabis.
      Participants are then followed for five months to self-report on cannabis use, anxiety,
      subjective cognitive functioning, sleep quality, and other mental health symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Marijuana use is on the rise with the number of adults reporting medical and recreational use
      doubling in the past decade. Among adult medical marijuana users, 39% report using marijuana
      for the purposes of self-treating or coping with anxiety. Marijuana is approved for medical
      use in over half the states and is gaining traction for use as an &quot;off-label&quot; add-on therapy
      for treatment-resistant anxiety and stress-related disorders. Paradoxically, however, while
      data suggest that marijuana, in particular âˆ†9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), increases anxiety
      acutely, cross sectional and longitudinal data suggest associations between marijuana use and
      lower risk for anxiety disorders.

      There is some evidence demonstrating that marijuana use is associated with increases in acute
      anxiety and anxiety disorders. However, other data suggests that marijuana use may be
      protective for adolescents at-risk for anxiety and decrease the chances of developing an
      anxiety disorder during college. This finding is consistent with a growing body of evidence
      from animal models suggesting that marijuana has anxiolytic and anti-inflammatory properties.
      Clarifying the anxiolytic effects of specific strains that differ in their cannabinoid
      composition may explain these discrepant findings. Thus, regardless of whether results
      support or refute the anxiolytic properties of marijuana, findings from this study fill a
      critical void and can inform public perception.

      The study goal is to understand the anxiolytic effects of cannabinoids, in particular the
      effects of THC-based strains vs. CBD-based strains vs strains containing both THC and CBD in
      different ratios (1:0, 1:1, or 0:1) on inflammation, cognitive functioning, and
      anxiety/negative affect. This design will capitalize on the novel opportunity to examine the
      effects of real world marijuana strains on key outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety/Negative Affect: Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over three time points over 4 weeks: Baseline (before 4 weeks of cannabis use), Pre-Administration (after 4 weeks of use, but before acute self-administration), and Post-Administration (after 4 weeks of use and after acute self-administration)</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS21 is a 21-item scale that measures self-reported change in anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. Subjects are asked to use 4-point severity/frequency scales (higher values indicate greater severity) to rate the extent to which they have experienced each state. Scores for Depression, Anxiety and Stress are calculated by summing the scores for the relevant items. Changes in DASS self-report will be tested in relation to THC and CBD blood levels.</description>

    <measure>Change in Inflammation: Circulating Levels of cytokines (panel of inflammatory markers).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over three time points over 4 weeks: Baseline (before 4 weeks of cannabis use), Pre-Administration (after 4 weeks of use, but before acute self-administration), and Post-Administration (after 4 weeks of use and after acute self-administration)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in inflammation from before to after cannabis use will be tested in relation to THC and CBD blood levels.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change: Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over three time points over 4 weeks: Baseline (before 4 weeks of cannabis use), Pre-Administration (after 4 weeks of use, but before acute self-administration), and Post-Administration (after 4 weeks of use and after acute self-administration)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC) measures self-reported change on a 1-7 scale (i.e. from 1 (very much worse) to 7 (very much improved)) in anxiety. Changes in this measure will be tested in relation to THC and CBD blood levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Impairment: NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery, Flanker Inhibitory Control Attention Task (FICA), International Shopping List Test (ISLT), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Cognitive Scale (FACT-Cog).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change over three time points over 4 weeks: Baseline (before 4 weeks of cannabis use), Pre-Administration (after 4 weeks of use, but before acute self-administration), and Post-Administration (after 4 weeks of use and after acute self-administration)</time_frame>
    <description>Co-outcomes testing multiple domains of thinking, memory, and perception (NIH Toolbox), cognitive impairment in the domains of immediate and delayed recall (ISLT), attention and inhibitory control (FICA), and a subjective report of cognitive complaint (FACT-Cog). Cognitive outcomes are measured in standard scores (e.g. Range of &gt;70 to &gt;140 (Mean of 100 and SD of 15) with higher scores indicating better performance) and can be averaged to reflect a Standard score of overall cognitive function.</description>

    <description>Self-report of depression and mood states will be assessed at baseline and the four-week appointment. Given the observational nature of the study, co-outcomes are appropriate to comprehensively assess change in depression/negative affect over the course of the study.</description>
