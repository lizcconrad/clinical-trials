  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot randomized, placebo-controlled trial of nulliparous postpartum women with a perineal
      laceration following a term vaginal delivery comparing vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms between
      women using vaginal estrogen in the postpartum period with those using placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine whether there are benefits to use of low-dose
      vaginal estrogen in the postpartum period. Dyspareunia and vaginal/perineal pain are
      well-known sequelae after vaginal delivery. However, the contribution of postpartum vaginal
      atrophy to these issues is largely unknown. Although the relationship between lactation,
      relative estrogen deprivation, and vulvovaginal atrophy has been established, there is a
      paucity of data regarding on the prevalence of vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms in the
      postpartum period. Additionally, although the benefits of vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal
      atrophy are well-established, the benefits in the postpartum period are unknown.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vulvar Assessment Scale (VUAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The VUAS is a four-item measurement administered by a clinical provider that quantifies and rates the patient's responses to questions of dryness, soreness, irritation and pain to external stimulation. Patients are asked whether they have experienced specific symptoms (&quot;yes/no&quot;) during the past 4 weeks and rate symptom severity (&quot;none,&quot; &quot;mild,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; &quot;severe&quot;). The first 3 items assess dryness, soreness, and irritation during routine activities excluding sexual intercourse and the fourth item assesses pain with external manual stimulation. An option for &quot;no attempt&quot; indicates a patient has not been sexually active within the past 4 weeks. Each item in the VuAS is scored from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) with composite scores calculated by taking the mean of the items when at least two of four items are not missing. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms. The VuAS includes a pelvic exam and vaginal pH.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perineal Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical rating scale: Visual Analog Scale These will be assessed using validated questionnaires consisting of a visual analog scale for pain (VAS). The scale ranges from 0 to 100 with 100 indicating maximum pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) The EPDS is a validated 10-question depression assessment for postpartum women, which includes anxiety symptoms and excludes constitutional symptoms associated with depression common in the postpartum period, such as changes in sleeping patterns. Each question is given a score of 0 to 3 and a total score of at least 10 indicates minor or major depression at the time of the patient's follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urinary symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6) The UDI-6 is a questionnaire that includes 6 items evaluating bother form urinary symptoms with higher scores indicating more bothersome symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fecal incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI) for bowel symptoms The FISI evaluates patient responses symptom severity to fecal incontinence with higher scores indicating more bothersome anal incontinence symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Function</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) The FSFI is a validated questionnaire to assess sexual function in six domains of sexual function, including desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain over the 4 weeks prior to administration of questionnaire with lower scores indicating more sexual dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction and ease of use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Likert scale Satisfaction will be assessed using the patient satisfaction questionnaire, with responses of &quot;completely,&quot; &quot;somewhat,&quot; and &quot;not at all,&quot; in response to the question, &quot;How satisfied were you with your progress with this treatment?&quot; In a similar fashion, ease of usability will be scored be assessed on a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, correlating to the following responses of &quot;strongly disagree,&quot; &quot;disagree,&quot; &quot;slightly disagree,&quot; neither agree nor disagree&quot;, &quot;slightly agree,&quot; &quot;agree,&quot; &quot;strongly agree&quot; to the statement, &quot;This product was easy to use.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Likelihood of continued use</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Likert scale This will be assessed at the end of the study intervention with a 7-point Likert scale at weeks 6 and 12. This will be assessed on a score of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, correlating to the following responses of &quot;strongly disagree,&quot; &quot;disagree,&quot; &quot;slightly disagree,&quot; neither agree nor disagree&quot;, &quot;slightly agree,&quot; &quot;agree,&quot; &quot;strongly agree&quot; to the statement, &quot;I plan to continue using this product.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>At each clinical/research visit the participant will be asked about any adverse events (AEs). AEs will be reported with study outcomes.</description>
