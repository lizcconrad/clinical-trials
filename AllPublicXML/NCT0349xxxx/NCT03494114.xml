      To test whether folate-based positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using 68Ga-EC2115 can
      differentiate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients from control subjects and
      determine whether the PET signal correlates with measurements of inflammation and disease
      severity.

      Investigators intend to enroll patients who are undergoing bronchoscopy for diagnosis of
      solitary pulmonary nodules from the Vanderbilt lung nodule evaluation clinic, including 30
      patients with COPD and 15 non-smokers without COPD. Folate imaging will be performed with
      68Ga-EC2115 prior to scheduled bronchoscopy, which will be performed for clinical purposes to
      evaluate a suspicious lung nodule. The unused portion of the bronchoalveolar lavage (not
      necessary for clinical purposes), will be interrogated to compare PET imaging with parameters
      of inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In addition, PET imaging data will be
      compared with disease severity based on pulmonary function testing.
