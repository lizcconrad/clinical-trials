  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label study designed to
      assess whether Pd/Pa is non-inferior to FFR when used to guide treatment of intermediate
      coronary artery stenosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary angiography is insensitive to assess the physiologic significance of a coronary
      stenosis. Therefore, clinical guidelines support the use of pressure-derived fractional flow
      reserve (FFR) to assess the hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis. Nevertheless, the
      penetration of FFR in clinical routine continues to be limited by its requirement for
      pharmacological vasodilation, prolonged procedure time and adverse systemic effects from
      adenosine.

      The instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) and resting distal coronary pressure to aortic
      pressure ratio (Pd/Pa) are indices of the hemodynamic significance of a coronary artery
      stenosis in the absence of pharmacological induced hyperemia. The iFR is measured during the
      wave-free period of mid to late diastole, when flow during the cardiac cycle is the highest
      and the microcirculatory resistance is the lowest. In contrast, Pd/Pa is measured during the
      whole-cycle resting distal coronary to aortic pressure.

      Multiple studies using off-line analysis assessed the utility of iFR and Pd/Pa against FFR as
      a reference standard. Overall these studies have shown that iFR and Pd/Pa can be used to
      identify ischemia generating stenosis, as defined with FFR.

      Two large randomized controlled clinical outcome trials (DEFINE-FLAIR and iFR-SWEDEHEART)
      have demonstrated that an iFR-guided revascularization strategy was non-inferior to an
      FFR-guided revascularization strategy in patients with stable angina or acute coronary
      syndrome.

      However, iFR requires proprietary software, thus limiting its use with other pressure systems
      and sensor wires. Pd/Pa is more broadly available because it can be measured with every
      pressure monitoring system.

      To date no randomized outcome-based clinical trial has compared Pd/Pa with FFR in terms of
      subsequent clinical outcomes.

      The investigators hypothesize that Pd/Pa is non-inferior to FFR in assessment of intermediate
      coronary stenosis in terms of the occurrence of MACE at 12 months after randomization.
      Therefore a randomized study to compare two approaches to assess the physiologic significance
      of intermediate coronary Stenosis is proposed: (1) Pd/Pa measurement - the experimental arm;
      and (2) FFR measurement - the current reference standard.
