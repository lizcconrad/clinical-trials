    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect large volumes of matched pairs of pre- and
      post-vaccination sera from healthy subjects who will be administered GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
      Biologicals' vaccine against meningitis- MenACWY vaccine (Menveo) or rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine
      (Bexsero), which will serve for the development, qualification, validation and maintenance of
      immunological assays and will support the preclinical research activities and clinical
      development of GSK Biologicals' vaccines. The safety of the subjects given one of the 2
      vaccines (Bexsero or Menveo), as per the recommended dosage and schedule will be assessed
      during their participation in the study.

             entering into the study. Healthy subjects with no medical conditions that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from participating in the study.

             Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current bilateral tubal
             ligation or occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

             blood draws.

          -  Abnormal function of the immune system resulting from:

               -  Clinical conditions.

          -  Subjects who lost &gt;200 mL during a single apheresis or who lost red blood cells on
             more than one occasion during apheresis within the previous 60 days.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a

          -  Ongoing anaemia as indicated by haemoglobin values below the lower limit of the
             laboratory-specified reference range. If the finger prick method demonstrates an
             anaemia, no further protocol procedures will be performed, and the subject will be
             referred for appropriate medical management. The subject may participate in this study
             following therapy and evidence that the anaemia has been resolved.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
