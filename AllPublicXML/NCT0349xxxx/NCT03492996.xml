      The primary objectives of the study are:

      â€¢ To assess the absorption, metabolism, excretion of LCB01-0371 after a single oral
      LCB01-0371 dose with a [14C]-LCB01-0371-tracer dose to healthy subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, one-sequence, one-period, single arm
      study in healthy male subjects. A total of 6 subjects will be enrolled in the study, and a
      minimum of 4 evaluable subjects are considered sufficient. An evaluable subject is defined as
      a subject who has provided whole blood, plasma, exhalation and excreta samples sufficient for
      evaluation of the primary objectives. Study subjects will be screened for eligibility to
      participate in the study within 28 days before dosing.
