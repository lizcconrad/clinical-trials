  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the leading cause of cancer related death in China.Different from
      patients in the US, Chinese patients with lung nodules tend to be less related to smoking,
      and seem to be more willing to get operation despite of the doctors' suggestion of imaging
      surveillance.

      This study is designed to figure out the risk factors for Chinese lung cancer patients and
      evaluate the psychosocial status of inpatients with lung nodules.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the only determinate risk factor proposed by the NCCN（National Comprehensive
      Cancer Network） Clinical Practice Guidelines for lung cancer screening. However, it has been
      estimated that over half of Chinese female lung cancer patients are non-smokers. Thus it
      might be reasonable to take unique Chinese cooking habit and environment pollution into
      consideration when it comes to the risk factors for lung cancer in Chinese people.

      Lung nodules are reported to exist in 25-70% patients who have undergone LDCT （Low-dose
      Computed Tomography）examination. However, the prevalence of malignant nodules is reported to
      be 1.1-3% by different researchers. Even in country with comprehensive medical consulting
      system and lung nodule management consensus, almost all patients assume their lung nodules to
      be malignant when detected by LDCT for the first time.The investigators noticed nearly 1/3 of
      the inpatients are determined to get operation despite the surgeons' suggestion of CT
      surveillance according to the NCCN guideline in Department of Thoracic surgery in Peking
      University People's Hospital. As there's no evidence suggesting lung nodules in Chinese
      people have more possibility of malignancy, the investigators would like to know whether
      those patients who choose to get operation &quot;ahead of the guideline&quot; has higher level of
      cancer distress, and figure out whether psychosocial factors should be taken into
      consideration of lung nodules management when living with an indeterminate tumor has added up
      to patients' negative emotion and reduced their quality of life.

      The investigators do the survey on the first day of admission during the inpatient education,
      help patients fill in the questionnaire including personal information, smoking history,
      medical history, their diet and lifestyle habits, family history of malignant neoplasm, any
      past or current environmental exposures and psychological status.

    <description>Patients with lung nodules are invited to fill in a questionnaire including personal information, smoking history, medical history, their diet and lifestyle habits, family history of malignant neoplasm, this procedure is finished during inpatient education before the operation. After the operation, we analyze the factors and patients' pathology results to figure out the risk factors for Chinese lung cancer patients.</description>

    <description>Patients with lung nodules are invited to fill in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during inpatient education. Patients are thus grouped depending on whether they have indication for biopsy or operation according to the NCCN guideline for lung nodules management. As a result, patients who accept surveillance long enough or have proper indication for operation are one group, patients who stop surveillance and choose to get operation &quot;ahead of time&quot; are the other group. The level of negative emotion would be analyzed and compared afterwards.</description>
