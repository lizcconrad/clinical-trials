    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to answer the following questions:

        1. Does the appearance of the reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) vary in
           appearance on PET/MRI depending on graft type and time after surgery?

        2. What is the appearance of the native ACL on Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic
           Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI)?

      This Phase I feasibility trial will evaluate knee injuries utilizing a standard of care
      non-contrast 3 Tesla (T) MRI. In addition, knee injuries will be assessed with a low dose
      (1/5 of the dose given for standard of care PET scans) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET research
      scan with CEST sequences. Patients enrolled in this study will include both those with and
      without a history of ACL repair; however, patients receiving the standard of care MRI will
      not be currently suspected of having an ACL injury based on physical examination and history.

      Patients with and without a history of ACL reconstruction will undergo a low dose FDG PET
      scan in the same setting as their MRI. The PET examination will be performed such that the
      early phase of imaging is performed prior to the MRI and the delayed phase is completed
      immediately following the MRI. This dual-phase scanning will allow for both assessment of the
      vascularity of the graft as well as its metabolic activity.

      Patients will be asked to provide study personnel with authorization to their medical records
      regarding the outcome of the knee graft. This authorization will be provided for 10 years
      from date of signed consent.

      Comparisons of the finding in normal and reconstructed ligaments as well as between graft
      types based on time from reconstruction will demonstrate the feasibility of this imaging
      technique and allow for generation of an imaging based hypothesis that will provide metabolic
      activity of the graft in a post-operative knee.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>feasibility of imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2-5 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine the feasibility of imaging ACL grafts using FDG PET/CT by performing imaging in a variety of patients, with different surgical techniques and times since surgery. Whether a sufficiently measurable signal is achieved will be evaluated alongside the signal in the healthy, control knee of each patient.</description>

    <measure>the ability of coregistration of PET and MR</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2-5 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate the ability to coregister separately acquired PET and MR images by creating a foam mold of the MRI knee coil to be used as a positioning device during the separate PET/CT imaging. We will assess the impact of motion artifacts on both image data sets as well.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>dynamic uptake rate of FDG in the ACL graft</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 2-5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PET images will be acquired in a dynamic mode, meaning they can be reconstructed into frames of different durations over the total 75 minute scan time. We will assess the uptake at the end of the 75 minute imaging period, as well as the dynamic uptake rate of FDG in the ACL graft, to learn whether the rate of uptake can provide additional insight into the healing process.</description>
