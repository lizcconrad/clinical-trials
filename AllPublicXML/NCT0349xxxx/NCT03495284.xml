  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2-period randomized cross-over trial will be conducted to determine the effect of
      incorporating 1 medium size potato, compared to an isocaloric portion of refined grains, on
      fasting glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, lipids and lipoproteins,
      arterial stiffness, body weight, gut microbiome, and dietary intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 2-period randomized cross-over study will be conducted. Free-living subjects will be
      provided with a potato based side dish (equivalent to one medium sized potato) or an
      isocaloric refined grain based side dish every day for 4 weeks, in random order. The
      treatment periods will be separated by a minimum two-week break. Endpoint testing will be
      conducted over two days at baseline and the end of each diet period.

    <description>Participants will be provided with one potato-based side dish, equivalent to one medium sized potato, every day for 4 weeks for incorporation into their self-selected diet. The potato-based side dish will be prepared at the Penn State Metabolic Kitchen. The potato side dish will consist of commonly consumed potato-based sides in the U.S. and there will be limited inclusion of ingredients high in saturated fat, refined sugars or sodium. French fries will not be provided. The variety of potatoes will represent consumption patterns in the U.S. including white, russet, yellow and red potatoes.</description>

    <description>Participants will be provided with a calorie-matched refined grain-based side dish every day for 4 weeks for incorporation into their self-selected diet. The refined grain-based side dishes will be prepared at the Penn State Metabolic Kitchen and ingredients high in saturated fat, refined sugar or sodium will not be used. These will be sides commonly eaten in the U.S. (e.g. pasta made with white flour and white rice, white bread rolls). During this treatment, participants will be told not to consume potatoes.</description>
