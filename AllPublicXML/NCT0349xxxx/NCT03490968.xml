  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Test the theory that abnormalities in the large blood vessels that deliver blood to your leg
      and the very small blood vessels in your leg's muscles (invisible to the eye) work together
      to worsen your leg function and walking.

    <description>Screen: Subjects will undergo a H&amp;P, ankle brachial index, ECG, CBC, CMP, lipid panel, HgA1C, and urinalysis. A urine pregnancy test will be performed on women of childbearing age.
Testing Visit 1: MRI, IV in common femoral vein with phlebotomy (60 cc total) before and after sphygmomanometric cuff occlusion of lower limb, 6-minute walk test, 4-meter walk speed test, walking impairment questionnaire, and muscle biopsy.
Supervised exercise and leg bypass surgery patients will return in 12 weeks and have the testing visit repeated.</description>
