  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20-40% of patients with NSCLC will develop brain metastases at some point during their course
      of disease. Osimertinib has demonstrated intracranial activity in EFGR mutated NSCLC with
      leptomeningeal disease in the phase 1 BLOOM study. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is one of
      the standard local treatment for patients with limited number of brain metastases. Currently,
      it is unclear whether adding SRS to Osimertinib will result in superior intracranial disease
      control in patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC with brain metastases diagnosed de novo or
      developed while on first line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Erlotinib and
      Gefinitib.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of Osimertinib alone versus SRS plus
      Osimertinib on intra-cranial disease control in EGFR mutated NSCLC with brain metastases
      diagnosed or developed while on first line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

                  second degree heart block.

                  history of long QT syndrome or unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in
                  first degree relatives or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QT
                  interval.

         11. Past medical history of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), drug-induced ILD, radiation
             pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of clinically active
             interstitial lung disease.

         12. Inadequate bone marrow reserve or organ function

         13. History of hypersensitivity of drugs with a similar chemical structure or class to
             Osimertinib or any excipients of these agents.

         14. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study

         15. Judgement by the investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
