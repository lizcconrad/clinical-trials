  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe/morbid obesity is an international public health issue that importantly increases the
      risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Likewise,
      severe/morbid obesity increases the risk of illness, reduces quality of life, and raises
      health-care costs. Bariatric surgery is the election method for the treatment of
      severe/morbid obesity, resulting in significant weight loss and remission of comorbidities.
      However, a relatively large proportion of bariatric patients regain weight and continue to be
      at high risk for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. A healthy lifestyle
      following bariatric surgery is essential for optimizing and maintaining weight loss.
      Observational studies suggest that physical activity following bariatric surgery might be
      associated with additional weight loss and more effective weigh loss maintenance over time.
      However, very little experimental evidence exists regarding the effects of supervised
      exercise on obesity-related outcomes in this specific population.

      The aim of the EFIBAR (Ejercicio FÍsico tras cirugía BARiátrica) randomized controlled trial
      is to determine the effects of a 16-week supervised concurrent (aerobic and strength)
      exercise intervention program on weight loss (primary outcome), body composition,
      cardiometabolic risk, physical fitness and quality of life (secondary outcomes) in patients
      with severe/morbid obesity following bariatric surgery.

      According to the study aims the investigators pursue the following hypothesis: Supervised
      exercise will result in larger weight loss than control.

    <description>Measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale short form (DASS-21). The DASS-21 comprises three sub-scales assessing specific psychiatric symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress). Each of these symptoms is assessed using seven items rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale (i.e., 0 = ''Did not apply to me at all''; 3 = ''Applied to me very much, or most of the time''). Summed score for each psychiatric symptom ranges from 0 to 21. Higher scores in each sub-scale indicate higher levels of depressive, anxiety or stress symptomatology. According to the specific nature of the three psychiatric symptoms assessed by the DASS-21, these are treated independently so that no total score is available.</description>
