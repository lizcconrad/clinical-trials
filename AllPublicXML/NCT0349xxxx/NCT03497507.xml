  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shivering during a cesarean section can be quite uncomfortable for the patient as well as
      make it difficult for the anesthesiologist to obtain vital signs. The researchers will
      investigate whether or not applying pressure to the P6 acupressure point during a cesarean
      section can treat shivering. The hypothesis is that shivering will be alleviated with
      acupressure.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether applying pressure to the left and right P6
      acupoints can treat shivering in a patient undergoing a cesarean section. The hypothesis is
      that bilateral stimulation of P6 with pressure can stop or alleviate shivering.

      The primary endpoint is resolution of shivering within 15 minutes of applying bilateral
      pressure to P6 acupoints during a cesarean section.

      The secondary endpoints include:

        1. Time to resolution of shivering

        2. Degree of patient-reported improvement in shivering

        3. Degree of practitioner-reported improvement in shivering

        4. Assessment of skin irritation and/or pain at the site of acupressure vs control

      Patient information will be stored in a locked cabinet on labor and delivery, and that
      cabinet will be located in a T3-locked office. The link between subject ID and patient ID
      will be stored in a different office on labor and delivery, also under a T3 lock.

      Patients who are laboring with an epidural catheter and subsequently require a cesarean
      section will be selected. This patient population has a MUCH higher rate of shivering during
      the cesarean section as compared to patients who undergo elective scheduled cesarean sections
      under spinal anesthesia. By selecting this group, the investigators are not only increasing
      chances of identifying shivering but also decreasing variability between patient
      characteristics by limiting it to one type (only epidural and not spinal) and limiting the
      number of screen failures.
