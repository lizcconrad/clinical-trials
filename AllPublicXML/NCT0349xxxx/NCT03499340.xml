  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pictorial cigarette warning labels (PWLs) are thought to increase risk knowledge, but
      experimental research has not examined PWLs' longer term effects on memory for health risks.
      In this study, adult smokers are repeatedly exposed to text-only vs. low arousal graphic vs.
      high arousal graphic warning labels paired with numeric risk information. This study will
      allow the investigators to assess the extent to which reactions to warnings remain consistent
      over time and influence smoking risk perceptions and quit intentions. The investigators will
      also assess the impact of graphic images on memory for smoking risk information presented in
      absolute (a smoker's lifetime risk of getting a smoking related disease) versus relative (a
      smoker's risk of getting a smoking related disease, compared to the risk of non-smokers)
      formats.
