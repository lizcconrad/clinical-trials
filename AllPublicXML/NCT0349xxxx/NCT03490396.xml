  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy/conditioning prior to stem cell transplantation
      (SCT) are at high risk for developing painful lesions in the oral cavity, known as oral
      mucositis (OM).

      In this high risk adult population, the study objectives are to investigate the efficacy and
      tolerability of Gelclair® (GEL; an FDA cleared medical device indicated for the management of
      painful oral lesions) and ideal timing of initiation of therapy (at the time of conditioning
      or after mild OM is diagnosed) for the management of oral mucositis (OM), relative to a
      commercially available compounded mouth wash (First® Mouthwash BLM &quot;Magic Mouth Wash&quot;; MMW)
      initiated after mild OM is diagnosed. The study may be adapted based on an interim analysis
      and recommendations of the interim data review committee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients at high risk for developing OM receiving one of the following myeloablative
      (MA) pre-transplant conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic transplant along with
      methotrexate (MTX) as part of graft vs. host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis meeting all other
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled:

        -  FluBu based regimens: either fludarabine: 30 mg/m^2 x 4 days and busulfan 0.8 mg/kg IV
           q6h x 4 days; both given daily starting at day -4 OR fludarabine: 40 mg/m^2 and
           busulfan: 3.2 mg/kg both given daily on days -6 through -3.

        -  Bu/Cy: busulfan, 0.8 mg/kg IV q6h x 4 days (-7 through -4); cyclophosphamide: 60 mg/kg
           IV once on days -3 and -2

        -  Cy/TBI: Cyclophosphamide, 60 mg/kg IV given twice between days -3 and -1 and TBI
           fractionated (generally over 3 days) for a total of 12Gy

      GVHD Prophylaxis:

      • Regimens including methotrexate (MTX; 15 mg/m^2 planned to be given on days 1, 3, 6 and
      11); addition of other agents given along with MTX (e.g., tacrolimus, sirolimus) is
      acceptable.

      Duration of treatment:

        -  Arm 1: GEL treatment a minimum of 4x/day initiated from 1st day of conditioning through
           OM resolution (G0), up to a maximum of 20d.

        -  Arms 2 (GEL) and 3 (MMW): Treatment a minimum of 4x/day initiated when G1 or G2 OM
           diagnosed during observation period (through Day +14 relative to stem cell infusion)
           through OM resolution (G0), up to a maximum of 20d.

        To be randomized to begin treatment, subjects randomized to Arms 2 or 3 must also meet the
        following criterion:

        -Be diagnosed with G1 or G2 OM via WHO OM scale during observation period from conditioning
        to Day +14.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             those defined, herein.

          -  Use of topical or systemic agents/treatments for OM within 2 weeks of treatment day 1.

          -  Evidence of uncontrolled infection (oral/oropharyngeal or systemic), including oral
             herpes or unexplained febrile illness (≥ 99.5F /37.5C) requiring systemic
             anti-infectives, within 7d of treatment Day 1.

          -  Subjects with active oral lesions or other mouth/throat soreness within 7d of study
             randomization.

          -  Any other criteria, in the opinion of the investigator that would make the subject
             unsuitable for study participation.

        For subjects randomized to Treatment Arms 2 or 3 during observation period:

        -OM ≥ G3 diagnosed prior to initiating randomized treatment during observation period
        (conditioning through Day +14; i.e., missed treatment window).
