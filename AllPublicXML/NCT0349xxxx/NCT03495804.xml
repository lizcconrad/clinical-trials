  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CT enterography has become an important tool in the evaluation of small bowel diseases,
      especially in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. There are several shortcomings of
      commonly used isotonic mannitol as an oral contrast agent, such as incident adverse reactions
      and gases in the gut. However, polyethylene glycol can avoid these drawbacks with a good
      performance in some pilot experiments.

    <description>The assessment system includes six parts.
Whether the contrast reached the caecum is evaluate and recorded as 'yes' or 'no'.
The overall presence of inhomogeneous contrast is evaluated and recorded as 'yes' or 'no'.
The maximum dimension of a single loop in each quadrant was recorded.
The scale of loops of small bowel distended â‰¥2 cm are evaluated and recorded as '0-25%', '26-50%', '51-75%' and '76-100%'.
The wall visibility and visualization of the small-bowel mucosal are scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 4, in which a higher score represents a better outcome.
Overall quality is assessed subjectively by the radiologist and scored on a scale ranging from 1 to 4, in which a higher score represents a better outcome.</description>
