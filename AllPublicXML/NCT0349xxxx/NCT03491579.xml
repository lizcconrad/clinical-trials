      This trial assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to characterize dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs) of epacadostat when added to the cladribine/cytarabine chemotherapy in
      relapsed / refractory AML patients fit for intensive treatment

      Background and Rationale:

      Epacadostat (INCB024360) is an Inhibitor of Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1).
      Indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a 403 amino acid cytosolic haem enzyme encoded by
      the INDO gene on human chromosome 8p22. IDO1 is responsible for the catabolism of the
      essential amino acid tryptophan (trp) to kynurenine (kyn) within immune cells and a subset of
      tumor cells resulting in inhibition of antitumor cell-mediated immune responses. Increased
      IDO activity correlates with lower CR rates and shorter OS in AML.

      Objective:

      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to characterize
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of epacadostat when added to the cladribine/cytarabine
      chemotherapy in relapsed / refractory AML patients fit for intensive treatment

      Study Duration:

      Phase I part will last from 3 to 18 months (permitting the enrolment of minimum of 3 and a
      maximum of 24 patients).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Relapsed/refractory AML (according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO)
             classification definition of ≥ 20% blasts; Arber et al, 2016) after at least one line
             of treatment and suitable for intensive treatment (including stem cell
             transplantation) without severe concurrent infections.

          -  Patients must be aged &gt; 18 years, and must have given voluntary written informed
             consent.

          -  Women of childbearing potential having a negative serum pregnancy test at screening or
             at least within 48 hours before start with epacadostat, and willing to use an
             effective contraceptive method (intrauterine devices, hormonal contraceptives,
             contraceptive pill, implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices, infusions
             with prolonged release) during the study and for at least 6 months after the last
             study drug administration

          -  Prior or concurrent malignancy, except for the following: adequately treated basal
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or any other cancer from which the subject has been
             disease-free for more than 6 months.

          -  APL (acute promyelocytic leukemia) or AML type M3, are excluded from the trial

          -  Treatment with any investigational product within 4 weeks before the first
             administration of epacadostat (INCB024360)

          -  Abnormal organ function if not caused by the underlying disease as considered by the
