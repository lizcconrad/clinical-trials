    <textblock>
      Acupuncture has been widely used for blood pressure management. Its effect on the
      cardiovascular-related targeted metabolome is still unknown. This pilot study aimed to assess
      the effect of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture on regulating the targeted metabolome of
      hypertensive patients.
