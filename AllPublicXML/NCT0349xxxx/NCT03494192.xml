  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal reduction of the AHD has been considered as one of the possible mechanisms in the
      aetiology of subacromial impingement syndrome. Maintenance of the AHD is crucial for
      prevention and rehabilitation of rotator cuff related disorders.

      The development of a rehabilitation treatment plan is based in part on the assessment of
      scapular motion and muscle deficits in patients with shoulder pain. Rehabilitation should be
      based on the identified impairments.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of scapula based and scapula&amp;rotator cuff
      based rehabilitation programs on symptoms, functional limitations and AHD in individuals with
      subacromial pain syndrome and compare with health population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coordinated motion between the humerus and scapula is required for pain-free arm movement.
      Rotator cuff and scapulothoracic muscles dynamically control the subacromial space or
      acromiohumeral distance (AHD).Scapulothoracic muscles need to provide stability and control
      in a synchronized fashion to facilitate normal scapulohumeral movement. Scapular upward
      rotation and posterior tilt is essential to maintain the AHD.Therefore, the force couple
      function of the rotator cuff muscles play an critical role in opposing the superior migration
      force that is generated by deltoid muscle and, to maintenance the subacromial space.

      Abnormal reduction of the AHD has been considered as one of the possible mechanisms in the
      aetiology of subacromial impingement syndrome. Maintenance of the AHD is crucial for
