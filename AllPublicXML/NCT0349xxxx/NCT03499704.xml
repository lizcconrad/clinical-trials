      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of pioglitazone plus alogliptin plus
      metformin with glimepiride plus alogliptin plus metformin on glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
      change from baseline to Week 26.

      The drug being tested in this study is SYR-322-4833/Alogliptin Benzoate and Pioglitazone
      Hydrochloride FDC. This study will assess the efficacy of pioglitazone or glimepiride in
      participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      The study will enroll approximately 176 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups.

        -  SYR-322-4833 (15 mg + 25 mg) + Metformin &gt;=500 mg

        -  Glimepiride 2 mg + Alogliptin 25 mg + Metformin &gt;=500 mg

      Based on investigators opinion at Week 12, if participant has HbA1c &gt;=7.5%, dose of
      pioglitazone and glimepiride can be titrated up to 30 mg and 4 mg respectively.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Republic of Korea. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 54 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic,
      and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after their last dose of drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>HOMA IR measures insulin resistance based on fasting glucose and insulin measurements: HOMA IR = fasting plasma insulin (micro unit per milliliter [mcU/mL]) * fasting plasma glucose (milligram per deciliter [mg/dL]) / 405. A higher number indicates a greater insulin resistance.</description>
