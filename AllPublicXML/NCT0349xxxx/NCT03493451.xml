  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, open-label, Phase 2 clinical study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of BGB-A317 in patients with relapsed or refractory mature
      T- and natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms. There will be two cohorts of patients:

        -  Cohort 1: Patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (nasal or
           non-nasal type)

        -  Cohort 2: Patients with other mature T-cell neoplasms, limited to the following
           histologies; peripheral T-cell lymphoma- not otherwise specified (NOS),
           angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

      Approximately 50 patients will be enrolled into Cohort 1 and 40 patients into Cohort 2 for a
      total sample size of 90 patients. Cohort 2 will include 20 patients with EBV-positive disease
      and 20 patients with EBV-negative disease. The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR determined by
      independent central review. Disease response for the primary endpoint will be assessed per
      the Lugano criteria with the LYRIC modification for immunomodulatory therapy BGB-A317 will be
      administered intravenously as a 200 mg infusion every 3 weeks (Each cycle consists of 21
      days). Study procedures will occur over a Screening phase (up to 35 days); Treatment phase
      (until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent,
      whichever occurs first); Safety Follow-up phase (up to 90 days following last study treatment
      for all AEs and SAEs); Survival follow-up phase (duration varying by patient).
