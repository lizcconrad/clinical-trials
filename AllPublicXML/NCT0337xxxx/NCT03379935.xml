  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractures of the radial head are among the most common fractures in the elbow and represent
      one-third of all elbow fractures.This retrospective cohort study was performed between 2004
      and 2014 at Sundsvall and Umeå University hospital, Sweden. All patients who were operated on
      between 2004 and 2014 with a radial head arthroplasty for an acute or sequelae due to a caput
      radii fracture.The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical or radiological differences
      between patients treated with a unipolar or bipolar radial head arthroplasty.
