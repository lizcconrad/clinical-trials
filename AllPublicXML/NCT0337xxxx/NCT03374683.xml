  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children's risky play is associated with a variety of positive developmental, physical and
      mental health outcomes, including greater physical activity, self-confidence and risk
      management skills. Children's opportunities for risky play have eroded over time, limited by
      parents' fears and beliefs about risk, particularly among mothers. We have developed a
      digital and in-person workshop version of a tool to reframe parents' perceptions of risk. We
      will examine whether the tool increases mothers' tolerance for risky play and influences
      parenting behaviour change, in the short and long term, and whether these changes are greater
      than those in the control group.

      We will conduct a single-blind (researchers and outcome assessors) randomized controlled
      trial and will recruit at total of 501 mothers of children aged 6-12 years. The risk
      reframing (RR) digital tool is designed for a one-time visit and includes three chapters of
      self-reflection and experiential learning tasks. The RR in-person tool is a 2-hour
      facilitated workshop in which participants are guided through discussion of the same tasks
      contained within the digital tool. The control condition consists of reading the Position
      Statement on Active Outdoor Play.

      Primary outcome is increased tolerance of risk in play, as measured by the Tolerance of Risk
      in Play Scale. Secondary outcome is self-reported attainment of a behaviour change goal that
      participants set for themselves. We will test the hypothesis that there will be differences
      between the experimental and control groups with respect to tolerance of risk in play and
      goal attainment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study uses 3-group parallel randomized controlled trial design.

      Participants will be recruited through advertising on social media, distributing notices
      through our networks, snowball sampling, and posting notices in community centres. The aim is
      to obtain complete data on 375 participants, thus the investigators will recruit at least 501
      mothers to account for attrition. Interested participants will complete a questionnaire in
      REDCap electronic data capture tool hosted at British Columbia Children's Hospital Research
      Institute to answer eligibility questions and provide informed consent. Enrolled participants
      will be sent a link to the baseline questionnaire package to be completed in REDcap.

      Once participants are deemed eligible for the study, they are allocated to one of the three
      conditions: 1) Control group; 2) RR digital tool; and 3) RR in-person workshop. Participants
      in Condition 1 will be provided with a link to the Position Statement on Active Outdoor Play,
      which includes information on research and recommendations for action. Participants in
      Condition 2 will be provided with a link to the RR digital tool to complete at their leisure.
      Participants in Condition 3, will be scheduled to attend the RR in-person workshop. The
      randomization schedule was generated beforehand in sealedenvelop.com using blocks of size 3,
      6, and 9. The list was then transferred to REDCap.

      Honoraria will be paid at each time point as compensation for participation. Participants
      attending in-person RR workshops are provided with an additional honorarium to compensate
      them for any expenses incurred in attending, such as travel or childcare.

      Participants have equal likelihood of assignment to each condition (33%). They will not be
      blinded to allocation, because the nature of the intervention does not allow it. They will be
      informed of their allocated treatment after completing the baseline questionnaires.
      Allocation will be concealed to the researchers at participant assignment and data analysis.
      Furthermore, the RR in-person workshop facilitator does not need to be blinded to allocation,
      as the other two arms do not have a facilitator.

      Participants will complete a questionnaire package at three time points: Baseline (T1),
      1-week post-intervention (T2), and 3-months post-intervention (T3). Survey data will be
      collected and managed using REDCap.

      The study hypotheses are:

        1. Mothers completing the RR digital tool will have a significantly greater increase of
           tolerance for risk in play than mothers in the control condition.

        2. Mothers completing the RR in-person workshop will have a significantly greater increase
           of tolerance for risk in play than mothers in the control condition.

        3. A greater proportion of mothers completing the RR digital tool will attain their
           behaviour change goal, than mothers in the control condition.

        4. A greater proportion of mothers completing the RR in-person workshop will attain their
           behaviour change goal than mothers in the control condition.

    <measure>Change in Tolerance of Risk in Play Scale (TRiPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before intervention, 1 week post-intervention, 3 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A 31-item measure examining adults' tolerance of risk during children's play (Hill &amp; Bundy, 2014). The scale is based on Sandseter's six-category model of risky play (Sandseter, 2009). Goodness of fit statistics for TRiPS have been found to be in the acceptable range (Hill &amp; Bundy, 2014). Item hierarchy examination indicated that items that were relatively difficult to endorse (e.g., &quot;Would you let the child play near the edge of steep cliffs?&quot;) were located higher on than those that were easier to endorse (e.g., &quot;Would you let the child play in the backyard supervised?&quot;). The person separation index was 2.63, indicating that the measure separated persons into more than two distinct groups, such as more and less risk-tolerant. The person reliability index was 0.87 indicating that the instrument was able to consistently differentiate between those scoring high versus low.</description>

    <description>Parents' self-reported progress on attaining the goal they set for themselves within the RR tool. Participants are asked: &quot;At the beginning of the study, you set a goal for yourself regarding something you wanted to change to give your child more opportunities for risky play. Have you made progress toward this goal?&quot; with response options &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;No,&quot; and &quot;I've attained the goal.&quot; For the purpose of our analyses the categories &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;I've attained the goal&quot; will be combined to indicate behaviour change.</description>

    <description>Participants proceed through three chapters in the tool: https://outsideplay.ca. Chapter 1: most important attributes they want for their child; their child's favourite play activities; their own childhood play activities; how their child's and their own play activities compare.
Chapter 2: imagining themselves in three video segments where they must decide whether they allow their child to climb a tree, walk home from school, and use box cutters to build a fort. They reflect on their barriers and things that helped them let go.
Chapter 3: revisiting the most important attributes they want for their child and whether there is anything they want to change, setting a realistic goal, outlining steps for attaining that goal, and setting start date.</description>

    <intervention_name>Position Statement Active Outdoor Play</intervention_name>
    <description>The position statement summarizes the issues and research regarding children's access to outdoor play and provides recommendations for various stakeholders. It states that &quot;access to active play in nature and outdoors - with its risks - is essential for healthy child development&quot; and recommends increasing children's opportunities for self-directed play in all settings. The Position Statement includes recommendations for parents, educators, health professionals, administrators and various level of governments to address the barriers to children's outdoor play. It addresses common misconceptions and encourages that danger be differentiated from risk and outdoor play and fun be valued as much as safety (ParticipACTION Canada, 2015; Tremblay et al., 2015).</description>
