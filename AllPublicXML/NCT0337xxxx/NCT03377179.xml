  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ABC-108 is a single-arm Phase IIA clinical study of ABC294640 (Yeliva ®) in the treatment of
      cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In this clinical study, all participants will be receiving
      ABC294640. The study drug, ABC294640 is an orally available inhibitor of the enzyme
      sphingosine kinase-2 (SK2). SK2 is an innovative target for anti-cancer therapy because of
      its critical role in sphingolipid metabolism, which is known to regulate tumor cell death and
      proliferation. ABC294640 also inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of
      cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, in a recent Phase I trial, ABC294640 demonstrated
      clinical activity in CCA patients. In this study, ABC294640 will be continuously
      administrated orally, twice a day, in 28 day cycles, until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or voluntary withdrawal initiated by the participants or physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label clinical study of ABC294640 in adult subjects who have been diagnosed
      with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma either intra- perhilar or extra-hepatic.

      A maximum of 39 participants will be enrolled in the study which will be conducted at up to 5
      sites in the USA. Eligible participants will receive ABC294640, 500 mg twice a day,
      continuously administered in 28 day cycles.

      In addition to physical and neurological exams, blood and urine samples will be routinely
      collected for safety and to determine response to the study drug. Participants will be
      radiographically assessed for disease status every 2 cycles of treatment.

      Tumor biopsies, when accessible, will be obtained within 21 days prior to the beginning of
      treatment and again on the beginning of the second treatment cycle.

      All participants will be followed every 2 months for progression and survival for a maximum
      of 24 months after the last patient has been entered to the study. Follow up procedures may
      include physical examination, laboratory work and radiographic tumor assessment.
