  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between intake of vitamin D and
      polymorphisms in GC and CYP2R1 in relation to risk of colorectal cancer in a Danish
      prospective cohort study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The association between vitamin D and incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been
      thoroughly investigated in both observational and experimental studies, but the results are
      conflicting. Genetic epidemiology is an advantageous alternative to randomized, clinical
      trials for ethical and economic reasons.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether polymorphisms in GC and CYP2R1 that predicts
      25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D) concentrations after both ultraviolet B radiation and
      consumption of vitamin D3-fortified bread and milk in Danes are associated with risk of CRC;
      and further, to examine whether intake of vitamin D through diet and supplementation alter
      the risk of CRC.

      Data are retrieved from the Danish prospective &quot;Diet, Cancer and Health&quot; study encompassing
      57,053 persons which were recruited between 1993 to 1997. Between 1994 and 31th December
      2009, 1038 CRC cases has been diagnosed. A sub-cohort of 1857 persons has been randomly
      selected within the full cohort at time of entry into the cohort. The study design is a
      nested case-cohort study.

        The Diet, Cancer and Health study is an ongoing Danish cohort study designed to investigate
        the relation between diet, lifestyle and cancer risk. The cohort consists of 57,053
        persons, recruited between December 1993 and May 1997. All the subjects were born in
        Denmark, and the individuals were 50 to 64 years of age and had no previous cancers at
        study entry. Blood samples, anthropometric measures and questionnaire data on diet and
        lifestyle were collected at study entry.

        The present study uses a nested case-cohort design. Follow-up is based on population-based
        cancer registries. Between 1994 and 31th December 2009, 1038 CRC cases were diagnosed. A
        sub-cohort of 1857 persons has randomly been selected within the full cohort at time of
        entry into the cohort.
