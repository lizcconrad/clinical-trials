    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of fecal transplantation in
      the treatment of antibiotic dependent chronic pouchitis. This is a double-blinded randomized
      placebo controlled study. 13 patients receive a fecal transplantation from the healthy tested
      donor and 13 patients in the control group receive their own feces.

    <textblock>
      Pouchitis is the most common long term complication among patients with ulcerative colitis
      who have undergone restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). The
      etiology of pouchitis remains unclear. There is significant clinical evidence implicating
      bacteria in the pathogenesis. It has been shown that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
      is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile -infection. Case reports have
      also shown promising results of FMT in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Currently
      there is no established effective treatment for chronic antibiotic dependent or refractory
      pouchitis. The aim of our study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of fecal
      transplantation in the treatment of chronic pouchitis instead of antibiotic therapy. Another
      aim is to evaluate phylogenetic analysis of the fecal microbiota trying to find
      microorganisms contributing to good results in fecal transplantation in IPAA patients.

      Patients receive FMTs on weeks 0 and 3. Antibiotic treatment has been stopped 36 hours before
      the first FMT.
