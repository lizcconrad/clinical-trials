      This study examines the effects of moderate alcohol intake on the brain, the immune system,
      and cognition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves a within-subjects, pre/post design to assess the effects of a moderate
      dose of alcohol on immune biomarkers, neurobiological measures, and cognitive functioning.
      The study recruits healthy adults (ages 21-45) from the community to complete the
      experimental protocol. Participants complete magnetic resonance imaging scans, blood sample
      collection, and cognitive testing in the context of alcohol consumption.
