  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The problem of cognitive decline among the aging population has become a significant health
      burden, especially in light of the increase in the prevalence of dementia with age For
      patients with MCI (Mild cognitive impairment) there are various recommendations to deal with
      the disorder, including behavioral recommendations for physical exercise. Some
      recommendations could also be found for cognitive practice. However, currently, there is no
      consensus regarding effective cognitive treatment or practice for MCI. Among the populations
      suffering from MCI, there is a significant segment of patients with amnestic disorder. For
      these patients, it seems that cognitive training of memory, including verbal memory, is very
      important. In recent years, we have developed an effective tool for managing rehabilitation
      practice by monitoring the patient's engagement with an easy-to-use EEG
      (electroencephalogram) tool. We have shown in a variety of rehabilitation settings, that when
      the patient is recruited, the clinical improvement is significantly better. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the ability to harness the EEG monitoring of brain engagement to achieve
      functional improvement in verbal memory training in patients with Amnestic MCI.
