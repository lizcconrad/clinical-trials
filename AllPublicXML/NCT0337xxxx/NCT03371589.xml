  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bell's palsy is defined as a facial nerve palsy without any other known cause. The common
      practice for this disease consists of the use of oral steroids. Such treatment can cause harm
      to people who have disabilities or prior conditions such as pregnancies, diabetes, obesity
      and/or high blood pressure. While the use of intratympanic injection for sudden sensory
      hearing loss is well rehearsed in many practices, similar management of facial nerve palsy
      due to Bell's phenomenon is rare and a few researches have been conducted regarding the
      subject. In this research we suggest intratympanic injections for these patients as a
      treatment for Bell's palsy.

      Bell's palsy is defined as a facial nerve paralysis without any other known diagnosis or
      cause .Its' estimated occurrence is in 20 to 30 people per 100,000 people per year. The
      occurence is greater in patients older than 65 years old and lower in children younger than
      13 years old. There are many estimated etiologies for Bell's palsy, such as failure of the
      vasa nervosa, viral infections, ischemic neuropathies and auto immune reactions. Of those,
      viral hypothesis is the most widely accepted.

      The prognosis for recovery for most patients is 80% to 90%. One series showed that only 17
      out of 1505 patients demonstrated moderate to severe sequela and none had complete facial
      nerve paralysis. The common practice for the management of Bell's palsy consists of oral
      steroids with or without the antiviral medications. A recent study made by the Department of
      Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck surgery in Korea indicated that Intratympanic
      injections could replace the use of oral steroids . Another recent study by Jong job lee et
      al. has shown that Intratympanic injections have prolonged uptake in rats, in comparison to
      Intraperitoneal injections.
