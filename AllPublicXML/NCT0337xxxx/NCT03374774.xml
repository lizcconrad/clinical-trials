  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information about the participant's ability and
      willingness to pay for NovoMix 30 using a modern device, which is prescribed to the
      participant by the study doctor for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus according to routine clinical
      practice. The study aims to obtain data that can guide prescribers' understanding of the
      ability and willingness to pay for NovoMix 30 FlexPen or Penfill among participants in the
      growing middle class in India and Egypt. The decision to prescribe NovoMix 30 FlexPen or
      Penfill has been made independent from this study.

    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 12 after first prescription of BIAsp 30 in treatment satisfaction, measured by Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (status)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DTSQs questionnaire will be used to assess subject's treatment satisfaction. This instrument contains 8 items and measures the treatment for your diabetes (including insulin, tablets and/or diet) in terms of convenience, flexibility and general feelings regarding treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 0, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TRIM-D Device is an eight item measure with two domains assessing Device Bother and Device Function. This captures information on the ease of use, convenience, and handling of the device(s) used to take diabetes medication. The measure has acceptable reliability, validity and ability to detect change.</description>
