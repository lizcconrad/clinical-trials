      There are 5 speciality medical units involved. Patients must respond to the define inclusion
      criteria. Each patient will be asked if they agree to participate and if so will be asked to
      consent to participate.

      Every day, nurses will give a questionnaire which will be completed by the patient to know if
      there were troubles sleeping patterns. If so, a second questionnaire will be completed by the
      patient.

      Other data will be recorded such as personal informations, diagnostic, medical history,
      consumption habits and treatments.
