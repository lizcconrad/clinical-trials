  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to extend the application of spreading depolarization monitoring to
      non-surgical TBI patients, using intraparenchymal electrode arrays and scalp
      electroencephalography to detect depolarizations and develop less invasive monitoring
      methods.

      This study aims to develop the new clinical science of spreading depolarizations for routine
      monitoring of all TBI patients requiring intensive care. This will be accomplished by
      investigating automated and non-invasive methods for bedside detection of spreading
      depolarizations and by determining the prognostic value of such monitoring across the
      spectrum of TBI severity. While current monitoring of depolarizations is invasive and limited
      to the subgroup of TBI patients requiring craniotomy, pilot studies have shown that spreading
      depolarizations are also manifested in non-invasive scalp electroencephalographic (EEG)
      recordings. Here, approximately 189 subjects will undergo neuromonitoring with EEG only
      (n=63), with combined EEG and intraparenchymal ECoG (n=63), or with combined EEG and subdural
      ECoG (n=63). Simultaneous ECoG and EEG monitoring will allow characterization of the EEG
      signatures of spreading depolarizations and enable identification of signal-processing steps
      and quantitative criteria for their detection with clinically meaningful sensitivity and
      specificity, as validated against the gold standard of invasive ECoG. In parallel, an
      observational electrophysiology study of all TBI patients admitted to intensive care,
      including non-surgical cases, will characterize the incidence of spreading depolarizations
      across the TBI severity spectrum. Successful completion of these objectives will 1) determine
      the extent to which findings obtained in surgical TBI patients also generalize to patients
      who are managed medically, and 2) establish the first non-invasive method for routine bedside
      monitoring of a neuronal pathomechanism with proven relevance to TBI outcome. In doing so,
      this study may enable an individualized approach to TBI management and clinical trials in
      which neuroprotective therapies can be administered selectively to patients based on
      real-time identification of a marker and mechanism of secondary neuronal injury.

    <description>Glasgow Outcome Scale- Extended (GOS-E) is an ordinal global scale for functional outcome that rates patient status into one of eight categories, with higher scores representing better recovery: Dead (1), Vegetative State (2), Lower Severe Disability (3), Upper Severe Disability (4), Lower Moderate Disability (5), Upper Moderate Disability (6), Lower Good Recovery (7), and Upper Good Recovery (8).</description>

    <description>For patients who require craniotomy to treat TBI, a subdural electrode strip will be placed intraoperatively following evacuation of a hematoma or contusion, as required. Electrode strips will be used for subsequent electrocorticography (ECoG) during intensive care. Patients will also undergo continuous scalp EEG monitoring.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Burr Hole ECoG (Group 2)</arm_group_label>
    <description>For patients who do not require surgery but do require invasive monitoring, an intraparenchymal ECoG electrode array will be placed through a cranial burr hole. Depending on other monitoring needs, the location of injuries, and other clinical considerations, the burr hole may be the same as used for placement of other probes or may be separate. In cases of focal injury, the burr hole will be placed to allow electrode targeting to a lobe with significant primary lesion(s). Patients will also undergo continuous scalp EEG monitoring.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>EEG (Groups 1-3)</arm_group_label>
    <description>Continuous EEG recordings will be made using Ag/AgCl electrodes placed on or beneath the scalp (subdermal wire) according to standard practice. The default montage will employ eight lead electrodes for each hemisphere following the 10/20 system (Right: Fp2, F4, C4, P4, O2, F8, T4, T6; left: Fp1, F3, C3, P3, O1, F7, T3, T5). Other montages with more dense placement of electrodes in the region of ECoG monitoring may also be used.</description>

        enrolled. The study will be conducted as an addition to TRACK-TBI (Transforming Research
        and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury), an observational study conducted at 11
        sites in the United States. The present study will be implemented at 7 of the 11 sites:
        University of Cincinnati, University of Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh, University
        of Miami, Massachusetts General Hospital, University of California San Francisco, and
