  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser-assisted cataract surgery is an innovative and growing procedure to improve the safety
      and results of modern cataract surgery. However, this technique faces to some obstacles:
      economics in the one hand due to the cost and time spent for the laser procedure before the
      conventional surgery, and technical in the other hand, especially due to some loss of pupil
      dilation during the surgery, which is highly important to ensure a perfect procedure. The
      present study aims at assessing a pharmacological protocol to maintain an accurate pupil
      dilation all along the surgery in order to improve the whole procedure.

    <textblock>
      Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) is a major surgical development that
      would allow systematization of surgery and even improved safety of the procedure. The
      development of this new surgical technique must now face certain obstacles, in particular (i)
      financial considering the extra cost generated by the use of the laser and (ii) technique due
      to the need to re-learn certain gestures and certain variations related to the laser
      procedure and more specifically the instability of the pupillary mydriasis (dilatation)
      during the actual surgery. The use of a systematic preoperative pharmacological mydriasis
      protocol should allow maximum intraoperative mydriasis to be maintained, allowing
      satisfactory surgery throughout the procedure. Several drugs or medical devices are now
      indicated in cataract surgery, but their effectiveness has not been specifically evaluated
      for the laser technique. This study could thus make it possible to validate or not a protocol
      of mydriasis that could make consensus in the future for the practice of FLACS.
