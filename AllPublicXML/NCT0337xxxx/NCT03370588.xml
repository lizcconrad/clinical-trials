  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been
      reported to be an effective treatment approach for peritoneal cancer, however, the stress
      response to HIPEC is major neuroendocrine and cytokine response, which has been considered as
      the homeostatic defense mechanism. Recently, dexmedetomidine has been suggested to exhibit
      anti-inflammatory properties. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of perioperative
      administration of dexmedetomidine on inflammation response and postoperative outcomes in
      patients undergoing hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) cytoreductive surgery.
