      Reducing intraoperative hypotension using FlotracIQ with HPI software.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension occurs often. Even short durations of hypotension are suggested to
      be associated with increased risk for renal insufficiency and myocardial ischemia. Currently
      treatment of these hypotensive episodes is not proactive. Edwards Lifesciences has developed
      an algorithm using continuous invasively-measured arterial waveforms to predict hypotension
      with high accuracy minutes before blood pressure actually decreases. Hypothesis: the use of
      this algorithm will alter treatment of hypotension and reduces the incidence of hypotension.
