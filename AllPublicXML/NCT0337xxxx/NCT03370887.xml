  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential design, multicentre study
      in patients with moderately impaired systolic function undergoing CABG surgery. Twenty four
      (24) patients scheduled for elective bypass surgery will be randomized (up to approximately
      33 patients if replacements are needed). The objective is to investigate safety and
      tolerability of AZD8601 following epicardial injection in patients undergoing Coronary Artery
      Bypass Grafting (CABG) surgery with moderately impaired systolic function. At Visit 3
      patients will receive either AZD8601 or placebo as epicardial injections and will then be
      followed up at 14 days (telephone visit) and 1, 3 and 6 months (on-site) post-surgery.

             drugs 13. Patients unable to give their consent or communicate reliably with the
             investigator or vulnerable patients e.g., kept in detention, protected adults under

             order 14. Positive hepatitis C antibody hepatitis B virus surface antigen or hepatitis
             B virus core antibody or human immunodeficiency virus, at Visit 1 15. Known history of
             drug or alcohol abuse 16. Any concomitant medications that are known to be associated
             with Torsades de Pointes 17. History of QT prolongation associated with other
             medications that required discontinuation of that medication 18. Congenital long QT
             syndrome 19. History of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular contractions,
             bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia), which is symptomatic or requires
             treatment (CTCAE Grade 3).

             20. Current atrial fibrillation as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
