    <description>In Part 1, single ascending intravenous (IV) doses of JNJ-63733657 or placebo will be administered to sequential cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 5) of healthy subjects on Day 1. The progression to the next (higher) dose level is dependent on acceptable safety and tolerability profile of JNJ-63733657 obtained after dose administration of the current dose level. Here, SAD indicates single ascending dose.</description>

    <description>In Part 2, multiple ascending IV doses of JNJ-63733657 or placebo will be evaluated at three dose levels in sequential cohorts in subjects with prodromal or mild AD; 3 doses will be administered over a period of 8 weeks (Day 1, Day 29, Day 57). The starting dose will be decided based on the data from Part 1. Escalations will be done based on safety and tolerability similar to Part 1. Doses will not exceed those tested in Part 1.
