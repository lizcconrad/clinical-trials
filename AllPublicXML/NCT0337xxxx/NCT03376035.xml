  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our investigators plan to measure the skin on the breast six months after breast
      reconstruction. The non-reconstructed breast will be used as the control for subject with
      unilateral reconstruction only. For those who have BILATERAL reconstruction, a core
      temperature will be obtained from the ear.

    <textblock>
      Many factors influence outcomes following mastectomy and breast reconstruction. Cutaneous
      sensation, degree of scar formation, nipple projection and overall appearance are well
      correlated with patient satisfaction. However, very little data exists on the importance of
      skin temperature after mastectomy and reconstruction. Our investigators have noted that a
      number of patients report their reconstructed breast is cold and relate this as a source of
      dis-satisfaction. In these patients, it is unclear if 1) the reconstructed breast skin is
      cold and if so 2) can something can be done to improve this. Our investigators hypothesize
      that cutaneous breast temperature may be altered after mastectomy and reconstruction. This
      may be dependent on the reconstruction technique and other patient factors. In this pilot
      study, our investigators aim to establish techniques for evaluating cutaneous breast
      temperature following mastectomy and reconstruction. Our investigators hope to establish
      baseline data to develop an understanding of breast skin temperature after mastectomy and
      reconstruction.

      Our long-term goals are to evaluate how cutaneous breast temperature may contribute to
      patient satisfaction. Our investigators also hope to determine which patients are at risk for
      developing a cold breast after surgery. Finally, our investigators will setup a prospective
      trial evaluating techniques to correct this problem and improve patient satisfaction.
