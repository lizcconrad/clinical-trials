      The purpose of this registry is to evaluate if sleeve gastrectomy surgery will help with
      symptoms of delayed gastric emptying for patients suffering from diabetic gastroparesis.

      This is a prospective registry enrolling patients with an established diagnosis of diabetic
      gastroparesis and interested in receiving a sleeve gastrectomy for weight loss. An often
      intentional outcome of sleeve gastrectomy is an increase in gastric emptying. The
      relationship between how beneficial this outcome could be for diabetic gastroparesis patients
      suffering from delayed gastric emptying is not very well established. The purpose of this
      study is to find out if sleeve gastrectomy surgery will also help with symptoms of delayed
      gastric emptying. This study involves completing the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index
      questionnaire before your weight loss surgery and after surgery at the following time points;
      30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.

    <description>Administer the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI). The GCSI consists of three subscales: (1) Nausea/vomiting, (2) Fullness/early satiety, and (3) Bloating/distention. The average score is calculated from these three subscales with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity. The symptoms are rated on a scale from 0-5 with zero reflecting no symptoms and 5 indicating very severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>Patients with an established diagnosis of Diabetic Gastroparesis that are interested in a sleeve gastrectomy for weight loss will be asked to participate in the registry. Once the consent process is complete the patient will be asked to complete the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Questionnaire prior to weight loss surgery and 30 days, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after surgery.</description>

        The study group will be patients with diabetic gastroparesis who qualify for bariatric
        weight loss surgery (BMI &gt;35, insurance/medicare bariatric coverage). These patients are
        referred by gastroenterologists and/or endocrinologists with established diagnosis of
        diabetic gastroparesis confirmed via delayed gastric emptying on scintigraphy. All
        available treatment options will be discussed with every qualifying patient. Patients
        opting for sleeve gastrectomy will be invited to participate in the registry.
