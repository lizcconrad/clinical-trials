  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal dysfunction associated with cardiac surgery (DRA-ACC) in our hospital population
      affects 39% of patients, being an important cause of morbidity and mortality, increasing the
      need for dialysis and assuming a prolongation of stay in the unit of intensive care, as well
      as an increase in the economic cost.

      In this sense, extracorporeal circulation (CPB) is a clear aggression for renal function due
      to multiple effects, not entirely known.

      Human albumin is sometimes used as part of the priming of the CEC circuit in variable
      concentration according to published centers and studies, demonstrating benefits on the
      maintenance of plasma oncotic pressure during the period of ECC, as well as other effects
      that can protect renal function during this period of renal injury.

      Despite the use of albumin in the ECC priming both in Spain and in other countries, there are
      currently no published studies demonstrating the effect of albumin on renal function
      administered during CPB in cardiac surgery during the postoperative period. with a high
      incidence of kidney injury, although there are current studies that confirm a decrease in the
      incidence of kidney injury in patients with hypoalbuminemia and who undergo heart surgery
      without extracorporeal circulation.

      The hypothesis of this study is based on the potential protective effect of albumin on renal
      function in patients undergoing heart surgery under CPB, in which there is a high incidence
      of postoperative hypoalbuminemia.

      This study aims to obtain information about the effect that albumin can have in this
      population of patients with a high incidence of acute renal dysfunction, and if this benefit
      exists, whether it is significant or not to justify its systematic use.

      This study is aimed to analyze the effect of the use of human albumin during ECC on the
      incidence of ARD-ACC in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB diagnosed according to
      the KDIGO scale during the first 7 days after the intervention.
