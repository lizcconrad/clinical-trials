  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase I study is to evaluate the safety and to establish the
      recommended dose of CD19-CART01 infused in pediatric patients affected by relapsed/refractory
      B-ALL or NHL with measurable Bone Marrow (BM) involvement. The phase II extension is aimed at
      testing the efficacy of the treatment at the optimal dose defined in the phase I.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 phases, a Phase I or dose escalation phase and a Phase II or
      expansion phase. Paediatric/young adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell ALL will
      be enrolled. Eligible patients will undergo leukapheresis in order to harvest T cells, which
      is the starting material for the manufacture. Autologous CAR T product directed against
      CD19-expressing tumor cells (CD19-CART01) will be produced and, after a lymphodepletion with
      conventional chemoterapic agents, the patient will receive CD19-CART01 intravenously. The
      construct contains also the suicide gene safety switch &quot;inducible Caspase 9&quot;; therefore, in
      case of relevant toxicities, the patient will receive the dimerizing agent in order to induce
      the apoptosis of the cells.

      After the treatment, the patients will then enter a 36-month follow-up period.

             to enrollment iii. MRD &gt; 0.1% after either reinduction therapy or any course of

          4. Voluntary informed consent is given. For subjects &lt; 18 year-old their legal guardian
             must give informed consent. Pediatric subjects will be included in age-appropriate
             discussion and verbal assent will be obtained for those greater than or equal to 12
             years of age, when appropriate.

          5. Clinical performance status: Patients &gt; 16 years of age: Karnofsky greater than or

          6. Patients of child-bearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to practice
             birth control from the time of enrollment on this study and for four months after
             receiving the preparative regimen.

          7. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects on the fetus.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating women

          2. Severe, uncontrolled active intercurrent infections

          7. Blood oxygen saturation &lt; 90%.

          8. Cardiac function: Left ventricular ejection fraction lower than 45% by ECHO.

          9. Congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness, or social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or in the opinion of
             the PI would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.

         10. BM blasts &gt; 50% pre-infusion.

         11. Hyperleukocytosis (greater than or equal to 20,000 blasts/microliter) or rapidly

             ability to complete study therapy

         12. Active CNS disease as documented by the presence of blasts in the CSF or by MRI. This
             criterion could be revised once that, after the phase I portion of the study, absence
             of life-threatening (i.e. grade IV) neurological toxicity will be documented.

         13. Presence of active, grade 2-4 acute or extensive chronic GvHD

         14. Recurrent or refractory ALL with testicular involvement

         15. Concurrent or recent prior therapies, before infusion:

             i. Systemic steroids (at a dose &gt; 2 mg/kg prednisone) in the 2 weeks before infusion.
             Recent or current use of inhaled/topical/non-absorbable steroids is not exclusionary.

             ii. Systemic chemotherapy in the 2 weeks preceding infusion. iii. Anti-thymocyte

               1. There is no time restriction with respect to prior intrathecal chemotherapy,
                  provided that there is complete recovery from any acute toxic effects of such;

               2. Patients who relapse while receiving standard ALL maintenance chemotherapy will
                  not be required to have a waiting period before entry onto this study provided
                  that they meet all other eligibility criteria;

               3. Subjects receiving steroid therapy at physiologic replacement doses only are
                  allowed provided that there has been no increase in dose for at least 2 weeks
                  prior to starting apheresis;
