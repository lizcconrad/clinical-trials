  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain contributes to declining health and function in older adults; effects that are
      intensified by obesity and sedentary (sitting) behavior. The purpose of this study is to
      develop and test a novel, patient-centered intervention to reduce pain and improve physical
      function in older, obese adults. The study will utilize a combination of telephone based
      coaching and smartphone tools to deliver this novel intervention to decrease both body weight
      and sitting behavior. The long-term goals of this project are to test the efficacy of the
      intervention and to develop it as a tool for clinicians to provide outside-of-clinic
      patient-centered support for overweight/obese older adults with chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain has emerged as an urgent age-related health issue that significantly effects
      physical functioning and quality of life, with the unfavorable effects worsened by both
      obesity and sedentary behavior. The annual cost of pain in the United States is nearly 30%
      higher than the combined costs of cancer and diabetes. In 2016, the NIH called for a National
      Pain Strategy to: 1) expand non-pharmacological treatment options in older adults, who are
      particularly susceptible to the side effects of opioid and other pain medications; 2) develop
      accessible treatments that are tailored to individuals; and 3) increase the development of
      self-management programs for chronic pain. The purpose of this R-21 is to develop and test
      the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, patient-centered intervention to reduce chronic
      pain and improve physical functioning in older adults, leveraging the combination of
      telecoaching and individually-adaptive mHealth tools to decrease both body mass and sedentary
      behavior. A pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted to provide initial evidence
      for effect sizes (pain and physical function) associated with the proposed intervention, and
      to estimate the sample size needed for a full scale randomized controlled trial design that
      compares the effects of the intervention versus usual care on pain ratings and physical
      function in overweight/obese older adults with chronic pain.

    <measure>Change in PROMIS Pain Intensity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Intensity Scale tasks participants with rating how much they hurt on a scale of 1 (had no pain) to 5 (very severe). Final scores are given as T-scores, with higher scores representing worse intensity</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PROMIS Pain Interference Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Interference Scale captures the impact of pain on valued areas of an individual's life (e.g., how much did pain interfere with your day to day activities) on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Final scores are given as T-scores, with higher scores representing worse interference.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test of lower-extremity function consists of 4-m walk at usual pace, a timed repeated chair stand, and 3 increasingly difficult standing balance tests. Each measure is assigned a categorical score ranging from 0 (inability to complete the test) to 4 (best performance) resulting in a final score of 0-12. Higher scores denotes better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sedentary and Light to Moderate Activity Minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Sedentary &amp; Light to Moderate Activity Minutes will be assessed using ActivPal activity monitors (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK) worn at the thigh for 7 consecutive days. We will assess (a) number of daily minutes spent in light-intensity physical activity as reported by the ActivPal (range: 0-1440, more minutes of light activity are favorable); (b) number of daily minutes spent in moderate-intensity physical activity as reported by the ActivPal (range: 0-1440, more minutes of moderate activity are favorable).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sedentary and Light to Moderate Activity Transitions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Sedentary &amp; Light to Moderate Activity Transitions will be assessed using ActivPal activity monitors (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK) worn at the thigh for 7 consecutive days. We will assess number of daily transitions from sitting to non-sitting behavior, captured via the ActivPal inclinometer (range: 0 - infinity; a higher number of transitions are favorable).</description>

    <measure>Participant Retention</measure>
