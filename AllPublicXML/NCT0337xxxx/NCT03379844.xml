  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma often die from intrahepatic disease since current
      treatment options are generally limited. Local treatment using holmium radioembolization
      could offer an effective treatment and a more personal approach than yttrium
      radioembolization (standard-of-care) as holmium has more imaging options.

      Primary objective:

      • To establish the safety and toxicity profile of holmium radioembolization in patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate efficacy of holmium radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma without
           curative treatment options in a non-comparative phase II study.

        -  To evaluate tumor marker response.

        -  To evaluate Quality of Life (QoL).

        -  To evaluate biodistribution / dosimetry.

        -  To evaluate hepatic function.

      Study design: Multi-center, interventional, treatment, non-randomized, open label,
      non-comparative, early phase II study. The study is a collaboration between UMC Utrecht and
      Erasmus MC Rotterdam. Recruitment and treatment of patients will take place in both centers.

      Intervention: Holmium radioembolization will be performed via a catheter during angiography.

    <description>An intra-arterial radioembolization procedure will be performed. The hepatic artery catheter is inserted via the femoral or radial artery under x-ray guidance by a trained interventional radiologist. The radiologist must repeatedly check the position of the catheter during the procedure to ensure it remains correctly sited and that reflux of the QuiremSpheres® into other organs does not occur. This is performed by injecting contrast medium. At the conclusion of the procedure, the catheter is removed.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of significant extrahepatic disease (MRI-scan liver and multiphase abdominal
             CT as well as a thoracic CT are routinely performed at screening).
