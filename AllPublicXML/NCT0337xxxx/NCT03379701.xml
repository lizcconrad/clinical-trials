    <textblock>
      Professor Hossam Haick from the Technion, developed an electronic nose for diagnosis of
      diseases via breath samples.

      Biomarkers from nose and sinuses and upper respiratory tract can be detected by &quot;electronic
      nose&quot;.

      Identification of biomarkers from nose and sinuses and upper respiratory tract can
      differentiate between the subtypes of CRS (Chronic rhinosinusitis) and may serve as markers
      for disease (vs controls), of disease activity (predicting aggressive disease course,
      predicting Malignant vs Benign nasal &quot;polyps&quot;, as inverted papillpma or carcinoma; predicting
      response to therapy (Steroid , Antibiotics, Nasal wash, Surgery).

      Biomarkers from nose and sinuses and upper respiratory tract can be detected by &quot;electronic

      Identification of biomarkers from nose and sinuses and upper respiratory tract can

      response to therapy (Steroid , Antibiotics, Nasal wash, Surgery).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate various CRS diseases with the Electronic Nose trying to
      better differentiate CRSwPolyps , CRS without Polyps, PCD, AFS, Vasculitis (as Wegener
      Granulomatosis) and Allergic Rhinitis with CRS.

      For that reason samples were taken from patients from different groups of &quot;CRS patients&quot;: 1.
      CRSwPolyps with no Eosonophilia , 2. CRSwPolyps with Eosonopholia, 3. CRS without Polyps, 4.
      PCD, 5. AFS, 6. allergic rhinitis and 7. Control subjects.
