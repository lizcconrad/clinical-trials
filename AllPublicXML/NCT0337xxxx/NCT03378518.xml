  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to retrospectively examine patients evaluated by the Code Blue team on a
      Code Blue call in our hospital between 2016-2017.

      Primary outcome: an examination of the survival rates and demographic data of the patients
      evaluated as an emergency by a Code Blue call in the period 2016-2017.

      Secondary outcome: to determine the rates of false Code Blue calls, the clinics giving Code
      Blue calls and the relationship between the times of Code Blue calls and mortality.

      relationship between the times of Code Blue calls and mortality.Inclusion criteria: patients
      throughout the whole hospital for whom a Code Blue form was completed and who were evaluated
      by the Code Blue team on a Code Blue call.
