  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a leading risk factor for chronic disease among African
      American/Black populations. Fostering habit development offers a promising new approach to
      improving the effectiveness of lifestyle programs for people with MetS, yet this approach
      remains understudied. The long-term goal of this line of research is to test and disseminate
      an affordable and effective intervention for reducing MetS. The objective of the proposed
      project is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel, occupational therapist-delivered
      habit-development intervention targeting dietary and physical activity habits in up to 80
      African American/Blacks with MetS ages 40+ recruited from an emergency department in Detroit,
      MI. The specific aims are to (a) evaluate intervention feasibility and acceptability and (b)
      estimate intervention effect sizes for primary outcome measures of habit development and
      weight loss and secondary outcomes of blood pressure, BMI, and waist circumference. Through
      the 8-week intervention, indicators of intervention feasibility (e.g., time, effort, costs,
      participant recruitment and retention, satisfaction) will be tracked. Measures of habit
      development will be taken biweekly over the 8-week active intervention period and
      anthropometry measures will be collected at baseline and week 20.

    <textblock>
      Together, diabetes and cardiovascular disease cost the U.S. economy a staggering $557.6
      billion annually and are the leading chronic diseases of African Americans. Maintaining a
      healthy body weight by being physically active and eating a healthy diet are the best means
      of reducing cardio-metabolic risk factors. Despite decades of behavioral research, however,
      lifestyle interventions targeting activity and diet have made little progress in effecting
      widespread and enduring health behavior changes in the populations most at risk for
      developing these conditions. Addressing the role of habits, defined as behavior patterns
      operating below conscious awareness that are acquired through context-dependent repetition,
      would significantly improve the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions. Most simply, habits
      develop when repetition of a behavior (e.g., walking for 10 minutes) occurs in connection
      with a stable situational cue that supports the behavior (e.g., while on a lunch break). Once
      established, habits are cued by the characteristics of a specified recurring situation rather
      than by intentions. Recent research suggests that habit development may prevent relapse and
      aid maintenance of behavior changes beyond the duration of the intervention because the
      performance of habitual behaviors is less vulnerable to changes in motivation, mood, or
      extraneous circumstances. Emerging evidence also suggests that habit-development strategies
      are (a) effective across a range of behaviors (e.g., dental flossing, physical activity, and
      dietary behaviors); (b) effective in low doses; and (c) deliverable via multiple formats
      (e.g., paper or electronic). Such strategies could therefore be feasibly implemented in a
      range of settings to target the development of healthful physical activity and dietary
      habits. Nonetheless, these concepts and methods have yet to be fully tested to determine
      their feasibility as a treatment modality for promoting healthful lifestyle behavior changes.

      The long-term goal of the larger research project of which this is a part is to disseminate
      an affordable and effective intervention adaptable to a variety of healthcare settings for
      fostering healthful physical activity and dietary habits, thereby reducing the burden of
      related chronic diseases on affected individuals and society. The short-term objective of the
      proposed research is to test the feasibility of a habit-focused intervention in a sample of
      80 African American adults ages 40 and older with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The overarching
      hypothesis is that a habit-focused approach will be feasible to implement and acceptable to
      intervention recipients. Rooted in habit theory and informed by the
      information-motivation-behavioral (IBM) model, the brief 8-week intervention consists of one
      face-to-face consultation, four bi-weekly individual tele-coaching sessions, and the use of
      ambulatory momentary assessments (via a smartphone application) to support the development of
      healthy dietary intake and physical activity habits and improve key health outcomes. The two
      specific aims of the study are:

        1. To evaluate intervention feasibility and acceptability. Determine if the intervention
           used in the proposed project is feasible. By tracking time, effort, costs, adherence to
           recommendations, participant recruitment and retention rates, and intervention
           satisfaction, it is expected that we will obtain data that both support the feasibility
           of the intervention and help improve it for a subsequent study.

        2. To estimate intervention effect sizes for the primary outcome measures of habit
           development and for the secondary outcome measures of blood pressure, BMI, and waist
           circumference. Habit development and anthropometry will be measured using the four-item
           Self-Reported Behavioral Automaticity Index (Gardner et al., 2012) biweekly during the
           active intervention, weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.

    <description>Participants are asked to participate in five health-coaching sessions and to return in Week 20 for follow-up data collection. The initial face-to-face coaching session lasts approximately 90 minutes with subsequent telephone sessions lasting approximately 20 minutes. Coaching sessions will include education about MetS, weight loss, dietary and physical activity recommendations, and the principles of habit development, guidance in forming implementation intentions for each self-selected habit, and identifying routines and contextual cues that could be modified to support habit development Coaching sessions are augmented with a participant workbook. Participants' also receive individually tailored study text messages to maintain their motivation.</description>
