    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter prospective controlled trial of percutaneous laser ablation(PLA) versus
      conventional surgery for the treatment of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PLA is the acronym for &quot;Percutaneous Laser Ablation&quot;. The treatment consists in the
      destruction (ablation) of Papillary Thyroid Micro Carcinoma by means of optical fibers that
      deliver high-energy light (laser) into the lesion through skin puncturing (percutaneous). The
      procedure is performed under ultrasound imaging guidance (ultrasound-guided). The destruction
      of the lesion occurs through overheating and coagulation. PLA, however, still needs a
      large-scale validation trial in order to be considered as an effective alternative to both
      surgery or follow-up for low-risk PTMC in elderly patients and/or in patients with
      co-morbidities that might expose the patients to a high surgical risk.

      After a comprehensive information, patients will be consecutively assigned to Group 1
      (surgery, preferentially lobectomy) or to Group 2 (percutaneous laser ablation, performed
      according to the attached procedure).Peri and post-operative complications, need of drug
      treatment, length of hospital admission and customer satisfaction will be registered.

      The aims of this study are as follows: 1.To establish the rate of cure or partial ablation;
      2.To compare the complication rate, time expenditure and costs of two procedures; 3.To assess
      changes in thyroid function and the need of substitution therapy with two procedures; 4.To
      assess the tolerability of the procedure, the customer satisfaction and the impact on the
      quality of life of the patients between conventional surgery and PLA.

    <description>Eligible participants with PTMC will be randomly assigned to this group and undergo percutaneous laser ablation(PLA). All the process is under the detection of real-time ultrasound.After surgery, all the patients will accept contrast-enhanced ultrasound(CEUS), regular ultrasound follow-up, thyroid functional detection, fine-needle aspiration biopsy(FNAB), neck CT.Per and post-operative complications, need of drug treatment, length of hospital admission and customer satisfaction will be registered.</description>

    <description>During the PLA, the patient is in supine position with head extended: the physician, ultrasound assistant and trained nurse work within the sterile field. Under constant ultrasound image guidance and after local anesthesia by means of 2% xylocaine infiltration, thin needles (21G) are positioned in the thyroid lesion, within safety distance from the surrounding anatomical structures. A plane-cut tip fiber optics is inserted into the PTMC through the needle. The laser at 1064 nm wavelength is turned on for 10 minutes until the pre-established energy dose is attained. There is usually no pain or very limited pain.</description>

    <description>Patients are routinely disinfected and spread the drapes after general anesthesia. Neck skin, fat, placenta muscle are incised successively. The flap is separated to the upper edge of thyroid cartilage, neck white line is incised and anterior muscle group is separated. Then both sides thyroid lobes are exposed. Cut off the isthmus, ligature the thyroid artery, cut off the upper pole. Ligature and cut off the ipsilateral thyroid vein. Reveal and protect the ipsilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid gland during the entire process. Finally patient is performed total thyroidectomy or subtotal thyroidectomy.</description>
