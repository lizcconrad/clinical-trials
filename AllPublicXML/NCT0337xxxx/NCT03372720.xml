  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies how well fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser therapy
      works in minimizing genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in gynecological cancer
      survivors. Fractional CO2 laser therapy may reduce symptoms of GSM in survivors of
      gynecologic cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a pilot trial to estimate the proportion of gynecologic cancer patients with
      vaginal dryness or dyspareunia, who will have an improvement in their symptoms with vaginal
      laser therapy compared to sham treatment based on the Vaginal Assessment Scale (VAS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity associated with vaginal laser therapy in this population.

      II. To determine how many women with the defined patient eligibility will complete all
      treatments.

      III. To determine the feasibility of the crossover design for potential use in a phase III
      trial.

      IV. To determine improvement in objective findings of vaginal atrophy with vaginal laser
      therapy versus sham treatment.

      V. To determine improvement in sexual function as measured by Female Sexual Function Index
      (FSFI), Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS), and scales for sexual satisfaction and
      behavior with vaginal laser therapy versus sham treatment.

      VI. To determine improvement in urinary symptoms of urogenital atrophy with vaginal laser
      therapy versus sham treatment using the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI).

      VII. To demonstrate satisfaction with vaginal fractional CO2 laser therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized in to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo fractional CO2 laser therapy at 3 time points 30 days apart.

      ARM II: Patients undergo sham laser therapy at 3 time points 30 days apart. Patients may then
      crossover to Arm I.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <description>Will be assessed by the Vaginal Assessment Scale (VAS). Will be summarized and compared between the treatment arms using a two-sample t-test or a Wilcoxon rank sum test, with a two-sided alternative for each. Will also analyze this endpoint graphically by plotting the VAS scores through time by treatment arm. Additionally, will correlate the scores from the VAS with other validated measures using a Spearman's correlation coefficient in an exploratory manner.</description>
