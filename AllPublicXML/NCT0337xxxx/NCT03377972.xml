    <textblock>
      Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) is currently the main method of treatment of early
      esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions. Therefore, the investigators are looking forward
      to conduct a cohort study on early esophageal cancer patients undergoing endoscopic treatment
      collected from Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, comparing the WHO standard with Japanese
      standard of endoscopic therapy diagnosis. In additionï¼Œthe investigators will collect
      patients' detailed informations and analyze the risk factors for metastasis and recurrence of
      early esophageal cancer.
