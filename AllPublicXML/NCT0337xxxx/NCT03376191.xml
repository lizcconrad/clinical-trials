      To explore the efficacy and safety of apatinib in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in
      the real-world.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-interventional clinical study. The number of patients that
      planned to be recruited is: from May 2017 to April 2019, the actual number of cases recruited
      into this study.

      If the clinicians thought the patient is suitable to take apatinib treatment, and give the
      patient apatinib treatment, the patient can be recruited into this study. Clinicians chose
      the initial dose of apatinib according to the patient's physical condition. Besides the
      clinicians adjusted the dose according to the patient's tolerance during the medication. The
      dosage was demanded not higher than 750 milligram (mg) per day. The patients received
      apatinib continuously, 28 days for a period, until intolerance, no longer getting benefits or
      patient wanted stop.

      During the course of the study, the researchers will not intervene the treatment of the
      patients, but only record the efficacy and adverse reactions.

      Main evaluation criteria: PFS Secondary evaluation criteria: OS,DCR and ORR (according to
      RECIST1.1). Main safety indicators：AE, SAE (according to NCI CTCAE V4.0) and QOL scores
      (Quality of Life Questionnaire-lung cancer).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: ≥ 18 years old;

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced or stage IV non-squamous,
             non-small cell lung cancer;

          3. Regardless of the past anti-tumor treatments (no limited to the number of past
