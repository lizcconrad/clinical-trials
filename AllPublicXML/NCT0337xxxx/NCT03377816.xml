  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine two mechanistic changes: emotion processing
      (awareness, expression and acceptance) and cholinergic anti-inflammatory processes (HRV and
      cytokine expression) through which an Art Therapy (AT) intervention reduces depression, pain
      and fatigue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled study with careful controls. Our study population is
      comprised of 240 BC patients in palliative and curative care (comprised of 50% Jewish and 50%
      Arab). This population will be randomized to receive a standard art therapy intervention or a
      comparison group. The AT intervention is an 8-week group intervention comprised of 8 1.5 hour
      weekly sessions conducted by an experienced Art Therapist The comparison group will engage in
      the coloring of prefabricated shapes (mandalas) and will receive Psychoeducation on topics
      related to coping with BC, identical to the topics of the AT group. This design will allow
      the study to test the mechanism of AT that is beyond the effects of time with a group, focus
      on a task and engagement with art materials.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed using the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), a 14-item self-report measure designed to assess the severity of fatigue on an 11-point scales (0=not at all fatigued; 10=as fatigued as I could be) that assess most, least, and average fatigue in the past week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>4 pain specific items to assess pain from the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) Symptom Scales. Pain is measured with 42 items on a 5-point Likert scale, 0 - not at all, 4 - extremely, scores range from 0-210. In addition, we will use the 6 items for pain from the PROMIS Pain Impact Scale measuring how much pain interfered with different aspects of life in the past 4 weeks. Scores range from 0-to-60, higher scores indicating higher levels of pain or its interference with functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Awareness</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale is a written performance index of ability to express emotion in a differentiated and complex way. Subjects write about their anticipated feelings and those of another person in response to 10 short vignettes. Responses are scored on a 1 - 4 range according to the degree of specificity in the terms used and the range of emotions described, higher scores indicating higher levels of awareness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional Expression</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>. Emotional Approach Coping scales (e.g., emotional processing- range 4-16, emotional expression, range 4-16) higher scores indicating more expression and processing of emotions and COPE avoidance-oriented coping subscales range 10-40, higher scores indicating more denial based coping, (e.g., denial, mental disengagement), all completed with reference to women's experience of breast cancer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptance of Emotions</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Acceptance of Emotions Scale assesses the extent to which subjects are accepting and nurturing toward their feelings, ranging 0-100, higher scores indicate higher acceptance of emotion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be measured from baseline, after 4 weeks and at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>20 minutes of resting ECG data will be recorded. The participants will be given instructions not to drink coffee or smoke for 3 hours before the lab visit as well as to sit quietly without talking or moving during the ECG recording.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes will be measured from baseline, after 4 weeks and at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will collect 10 ccs of blood in order to measure immune dysregulation (pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, TNF-α), anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) and regulatory cytokine (TGF-β).</description>

    <intervention_name>Art Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>In a group setting participants will be encouraged to engage in art making for increased emotional awareness, expression, and acceptance. The role of the art therapist is to encourage a non-judgmental and exploratory approach to artmaking in which the process is emphasized over product. The art therapist obtains these goals by creating an atmosphere that is calm and by remaining tuned in to the verbalizations and body language of participants. If needed she can provide individual attention that is geared toward neutralizing concerns regarding performance during the art making.</description>
