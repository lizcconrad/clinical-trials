  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the project is to reduce the number of unexpected patient deteriorations
      by 50% at Emergency Departments (ED) by investigating if the novel Patient Deterioration
      Warning Systems (PDWS), can improve clinicians' ability to identify deterioration at an
      earlier stage.

      A third of all acute medical patients with normal vital signs at arrival, experience a
      deterioration in vital signs during the 24 first hours. This can potentially lead to dire
      consequences for these patients, as the risk of deterioration is present across all severity
      levels. The utilization of patient monitoring systems in the dispersed and shared working
      environments of EDs and acute wards may help to identify some of the reasons for failure to
      rescue patients. Thus, quantifying the extent to which a patient is being monitored, may be
      an aid to bridge the current gap between usage of automated and manual monitoring as clinical
      work will continue to depend on tacit knowledge and intuition.

      Several systems and protocols have been established to swiftly deal with identified
      deterioration. Most systems struggle with issues of clinical adherence and are difficult to
      assess on-the-fly, and in some cases nurses failed to notice abnormality in 43% of patients
      experiencing deterioration. Although the trajectories of patients' vital signs have been
      identified as more important than the initial scoring value, most of the widely used Track
      and Trigger systems lack a temporal aspect. Furthermore, a limited number of these Track and
      Trigger systems have been integrated into real time clinical decision support systems, which
      has not evolved much in the last decades.

      The PDWS deals with these challenges by aggregating and summarizing all vital values measured
      with the ED's patient monitors in the ongoing admission to intuitively present the state and
      trajectory. The investigators intend to determine if making the PDWS system available to
      nurses and physicians throughout the entire ED improves their ability to identify patients at
      risk of deterioration. To make this assessment, the PDWS will be evaluated in a cluster
      randomized trial (CRT) at two ED facilities in Denmark. The CRT is structured in three 5-week
      intervention, and three 5-week control periods, separated by a washout period of at least one
      week. The primary outcome is in-hospital deterioration - defined as transfer to the intensive
      care unit, heart/respiratory failure or death. The effect the PDWS will be assessed by
      comparing the proportions of events in each study arm using Pearsons's chi-squared test on
      these two samples. Furthermore, the technical and economical effects are evaluated using the
      Technology Acceptance Model, and the Model for Assessment of Telemedicine.
