  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral Health care has been shown to have low priority among nursing personnel, especially
      among personnel with shorter education. As the population gets older and keep their natural
      teeth high up in age, in most cases throughout life, it is of importance to help the older
      maintain a good oral health when the cognitive functions and physical ability decreases. In
      1999, a new dental care system was introduced with the aim to offer elderly with long-term
      need for extensive care, home visits for oral health assessment and, if necessary, be offered
      the necessary dental care. The aim was also to offer nursing personnel education and training
      in dental health and oral care, in order to provide and perform oral care. The effect of the
      education program has never been evaluated.

    <description>A questionnaire, Dental Coping Beliefs Scale (DCBS) will be used to investigate attitudes to, and knowledge of oral health among nursing staff caring for home-dwelling older people. DCBS investigates three dimensions; Locus of control (internal and external), self-efficacy and oral-health care believes.
Apart from descriptive statistics, a logistic regression model will be used to analyze the relationship between the sum scores for the factors Oral health care beliefs, Internal locus of control, External locus of control and background variables (age, work experience and earlier adjunct education).</description>
