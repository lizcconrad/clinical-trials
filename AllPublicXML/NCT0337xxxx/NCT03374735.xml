  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm trial to evaluate the safety and performance
      of SETALUM™ Sealant in sealing suture lines at the anastomosis between native vessels and
      synthetic ePTFE vascular patch used during open vascular surgery.

    <description>The hemostasis is observed by the operating surgeon and timed by an operative room nurse.
Anastomotic hemostasis is defined as an anastomosis not requiring any additional intervention to control bleeding.</description>

    <description>Each Adverse Event was described by the seriouness and the nature of its relationship to the SETALUM™ Sealant or to the surgical procedure. The Data Monitoring Committee reviewed all occurred adverse events and provided a conclusion on the SETALUM™ Sealant safety profile.</description>
