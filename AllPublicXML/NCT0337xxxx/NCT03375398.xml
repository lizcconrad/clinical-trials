      STUDY SUMMARY This study was a partly controlled laboratory-based study comparing the
      short-term postprandial blood glucose and insulin responses produced by three test meals
      containing white rice alone or with SUGARDOWN™ (Galactomannan) in overweight adults. In the
      study, subjects were their own controls. Effects of the two test meals containing SUGARDOWN™
      were compared to the effects produced by test meals containing an equal-carbohydrate portion
      of white rice alone (the control meal). The study used a repeated-measures design, such that
      every subject consumed each meal on two separate occasions, completing a total of six
      separate test sessions. Each subject completed their test sessions on separate weekday
      mornings at a similar time of day, as close as possible to the time they would normally eat
      breakfast.

      SUBJECTS Ten healthy, non-smoking, overweight or obese subjects (4 females, 6 males)
      voluntarily participated in this study. The mean ± SD age of the subjects was 29.2 ± 3.3 yr
      (range: 25.6 - 36.8 yr), and their mean ± SD body mass index value was 27.3 ± 1.1 kg/m2
      (range: 25.5 - 28.7 kg/m2).

      Volunteers were given detailed written and verbal information about all of the study's
      inclusion criteria and experimental procedures. If the volunteers decided that they would
      like to participate in the study, they were asked to come to the research centre on another
      morning, where they completed a detailed screening questionnaire that assessed their current
      health status and medical history. In order to participate in the study, the volunteers had
      to meet the inclusion criteria listed below. All suitable volunteers that were invited to
      participate in the study were required to sign a detailed subject information sheet and a
      consent form before commencing any experimental procedures.
