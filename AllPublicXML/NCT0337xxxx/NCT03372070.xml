  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to gain information on the ability of a continuous negative
      external pressure collar to safely reduce snoring in primary snorers, and if so to determine
      whether the reduction in snoring has benefits for both the snorer and the bed partner. This
      clinical trial will involve both the snorer and his or her bed partner, both of whom must
      qualify and provide informed consent for participation.
