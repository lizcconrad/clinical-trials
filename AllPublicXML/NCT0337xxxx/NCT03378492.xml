  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the use of ultrasound as an aid for epidural
      placement in residents performing all epidural techniques under direct staff anesthesiologist
      supervision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the abilities of the &quot;Accuro&quot; to assist in lumbar
      epidural placement in patients. It is hypothesized that the use of the Accuro will result in
      an increase of first-attempt success rates, defined as successful epidural needle placement
      on the first needle insertion attempt.

    <time_frame>Baseline (at time of procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to landmark identification is defined as the time interval between the start of needle puncture site identification and the time to first needle puncture attempt.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total technical procedure time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (at time of procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Total technical procedure time is defined as the sum of (iv) Time to landmark identification, (v) Time to loss of resistance, and (vi) Time to complete epidural analgesia administration. This technical procedure time measure the time between first placing hands on the patient to the administration of analgesia.</description>

    <measure>Epidural space depth</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (at time of procedure)</time_frame>

    <intervention_name>Ultrasound Guided Epidural</intervention_name>
    <description>Sterile ultrasound gel will be applied to the patient's back and the sterile device will be used to image the lumbar vertebrae in the area of the palpation-derived location. When the device is placed above the vertebral interspace, the 3D image mode will identify the spine midline and the depth from the skin to the epidural space. A single 3D ultrasound video loop of the vertebral interspace will be saved to confirm correct landmark identification. After identification of the vertebral interspace, the skin will be marked with a marking utensil or physical indentation at the point of needle entry indicated by the device. The epidural needle will then be placed in the same fashion as in the standard procedure group. The depth of the epidural needle placement will be measured and recorded following observation of loss of resistance.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Standard Epidural</intervention_name>
    <description>The point of needle entry will be located using the landmarks technique. The specific level of epidural placement will be determined on a per-patient basis at the anesthesiologist's discretion. The spine midline will also be palpated to determine the approximate location of an interlaminar space. The needle will then be inserted at the appropriate location determined by the landmarks technique, and successful epidural placement will be confirmed by observation of loss of resistance and follow-up confirmation of analgesia. The depth of the epidural needle placement will be measured and recorded following observation of loss of resistance. The epidural catheter will be inserted and the procedure will continue according to the standard of care.</description>
