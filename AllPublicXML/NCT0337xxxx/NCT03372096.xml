      Purpose: The purpose of this pilot study is to determine preliminary estimates of the
      parameters related to the distribution of the study endpoints including: International
      Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality of life (QoL) score changes, Qmax (maximum urine
      flow rate) changes, post void residual volume (PVR) changes, percent prostate infarction and
      presence of non-target embolization.

      Participants: 20 adult male subjects with benign hyperplasia will be enrolled in this study.

      Procedures (methods): This will be a multisite, open label pilot study with a small
      population undergoing an investigational intervention (prostatic artery embolization) to
      determine initial safety and potential for efficacy as measured by improvement of lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and decrease in prostate size.

    <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is an 8 Likert questionnaire (7 symptom questions + 1 quality of life question) with scores ranging from 0 to 5, where 0 is less severe. IPSS is a written screening tool used to screen for, rapidly diagnose, track the symptoms of, and suggest management of the symptoms of the disease benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Total scores are determined to be Mild (1-7), Moderate (8-19), or Severe (20-35).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life scores (arbitrary units)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QoL question is a single question included with the IPSS related to the symptoms of the disease benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Lower scores indicate a higher quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in urine flow (mL/s)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Urine flow will be measured to determine the maximum rate of urine flow (Qmax), which is measured in mL per second.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Prostate volume (g)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the prostate size measured in grams.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of prostate infarcted (percentage)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of prostate infarcted will be determined using manual demarcation of non-enhancing areas within the prostate on serial axial slices of post contrast CT images. Segmentation software will then be employed to calculate the volume.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of non-targeted embolization (percentage)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of patients that have non-targeted embolization following the prostatic artery embolization (PAE) procedure. Non-target embolization will be determined by comparing non-contrast CT images from pre- and post-PAE scans. This will be a binary data point and not a calculation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of minor complications (percentage)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of patients that experience minor complications following the PAE procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in IIEF Score (arbitrary units)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in sexual function as determined by an unchanged or improved score on the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. The International Index of Erectile Function is a 15 question tool that measures erectile function (30 max), orgasmic function (10max), sexual desire (10 max), intercourse satisfaction (15 max), and overall satisfaction (10 max). The total maximum score is 75. Higher scores indicated higher levels of sexual function.</description>

    <description>LC Bead LUMI is a spherical polyvinyl alcohol embolic particle that incorporates radiopaque moieties. Once a catheter has been fluoroscopically guided into the target vessel, the beads are then injected, causing obstruction at the arteriole level until the desired degree of embolization has occurred.</description>
