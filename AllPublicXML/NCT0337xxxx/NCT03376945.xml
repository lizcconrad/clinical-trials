    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of ω-3 fatty acid in patients with obstructive jaundice is not known.
      This study provided evidences that ω-3 fatty acid-based parenteral nutrition improved
      postoperative recovery for patients with obstructive jaundice.

    <textblock>
      Lipid emulsion enriched in n-3 fatty acid (FA) has been reported to improve postoperative
      recovery for surgical patients with biliary tract disease, and to improve laboratory and
      clinical outcomes. The role of it for postoperative patients with jaundice is not clear yet.
      The object of this research was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of n-3 fatty acid-based
      parenteral nutrition (PN) for patients with jaundice following Surgical procedure.

      This cohort study was a pragmatic, retrospective, single center, matched, clinical trial from
      May 2014 to June 2017.

        This cohort study was a pragmatic, retrospective, single center, matched, clinical trial
        from May 2014 to June 2017.The trail included obstructive jaundice patients ≥20 years who
        received PN treatment for ≥5 days for maintenance and improvement of their nutrition status
        round the operation period. All patients received PN along with the three macronutrients,
        compounded in an &quot;All-In-One&quot; manner, included amino acids, lipids and glucose,
        electrolytes, and micronutrients (trace elements and vitamins). The administration was
        performed with a perfusion pump through a central line within 24 h.
