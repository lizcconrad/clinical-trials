  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has three parts. Each participant will enroll in one part.

      Part A: The purpose of Part A is to compare study drug LY3298176 solution formulation to a
      powder formulation mixed with water and given subcutaneously (SC) (just under the skin). Part
      A will measure how much of the study drug gets into the blood stream and how long it takes
      the body to get rid of it.

      Part B: The purpose of Part B is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY3298176
      intravenous (IV) formulation when administered into a vein.

      Part C: The purpose of Part C is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LY3298176
      following multiple SC weekly doses of a solution.

      This study will last approximately 70 days for Part A or Part B and 92 days for Part C. This
      does not include screening. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the
      study.
