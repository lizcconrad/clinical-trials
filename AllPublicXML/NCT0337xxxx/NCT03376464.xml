      Background: Xeomin Cosmetic has been used previously in the management of masseteric
      hypertrophy. However, a standardized injection technique has not been established. The goal
      of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two injection techniques in
      the management of masseteric hypertrophy using Xeomin Cosmetic.

      Methods: Thirty female patients with masseteric hypertrophy were recruited and evenly
      randomized to receive bilateral treatments of either 1) a single injection technique (SIT),
      or 2) a multi-injection technique (MIT). Improvement of masseteric hypertrophy was assessed
      at Week 16 using standardized measurements and photographs. Patients completed a 5-point
      satisfaction questionnaire while physicians the global aesthetic improvement scale (GAIS) and
      10-point photonumeric masseter prominence rating scale.
