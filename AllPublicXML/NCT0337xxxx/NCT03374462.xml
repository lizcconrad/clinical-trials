  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the conclusion of this project, investigators will have assessed the effectiveness of
      home-based telemedicine for improving multiple important clinical and patient-centered
      outcomes in a high-risk pediatric cohort with T1D.

      Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that home-based telemedicine is a feasible and acceptable
      method of care delivery for patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes (T1D) currently
      cared for at the University of California, Davis (UCD) Pediatric Endocrinology clinic.
      Specifically:

      A) Patients and families choose to participate in telemedicine visits as a supplement to
      in-person care; B) Patients and families can utilize secure, internet-based platforms to
      upload and share glucose meter data and to establish an audio-video connection with a
      diabetes specialist in their home settings; C) Patients and families are satisfied with the
      experience of home-based telemedicine and would choose to receive future diabetes care via
      this modality.

      Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that using home-based telemedicine, these patients can complete
      more frequent visits with a diabetes specialist than they previously completed via office
      visits alone.

      Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that increased contact with a diabetes specialist via
      home-based telemedicine will lead to significant improvement in glycemic control for these
      patients.

      Aim 4. To evaluate the effects of increased contact with a diabetes specialist via home-based
      telemedicine on high-cost health care utilization - specifically emergency department (ED)
      visits and diabetes-related hospitalizations.
