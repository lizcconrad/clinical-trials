  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis of arterial and venous vessels of any size,
      involving young patients (from 15 to 45 years). BD significantly increases morbidity and
      mortality. Therapeutic management of BD depends on the clinical presentation and organ
      involved. Although colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and topical treatments
      are often sufficient for mucocutaneous and joint involvement, more aggressive approach with
      immunosuppressive agents is warranted for severe manifestations. Early recognition and
      vigorous use of immunosuppressives with high dose steroids have changed the prognosis of
      patients with severe BD. BD is a severe systemic vasculitis leading to blindness in up to 20%
      at 4 years and a 5-year mortality rate of 15% in patients with major vessel or neurological
      involvement. Cyclophosphamide has been used for life-threatening BD for 40 years. However,
      the outcome of severe complications of BD is poor. The European League Against Rheumatism
      (EULAR) recommendation for the management of BD advocated cyclophosphamide plus
      glucocorticoids for life-threatening manifestations (i.e neurological and/or major vessel
      involvement). TNFa antagonists have been used with success in severe and/or resistant cases.
      In addition, the incidence of blindness in BD has been dramatically reduced in the recent
      years with the use of anti-TNF. However, there is no firm evidence or randomized controlled
      trials directly addressing the best induction immunosuppressive therapy in severe BD
      manifestations. The investigators therefore aimed to assess the best induction therapy in
      severe and difficult to treat BD patients. The investigators hypothesize that up to 70% of
      the patients with life-threatening manifestations of BD receiving these compounds [anti-TNFa
      or cyclophosphamide] will achieve a complete remission of BD at 6 months and with less than
      0.1 mg/kg/day of prednisone.

      ITAC, is the first randomized prospective, head to head study, comparing infliximab, to
      cyclophosphamide in severe manifestations of BD. There is no firm evidence or randomized
      controlled trials directly addressing the best induction immunosuppressive therapy in severe
      BD. Cyclophosphamide failed to demonstrate sustainable remission over 70 % of life
      threatening BD cases. There is little published information on use of immunosuppressants
      other than cyclophosphamide for severe BD. TNFa antagonists have been used with success in
      severe and/or resistant cases. TNFa expression correlates with BD activity and other
      immunological data provide a strong rationale for targeting BD with biologics. Despite a
      strong rationale, these compounds are not yet approved in BD, which guarantees the innovative
      nature of this study that aims selecting or dropping any arm when evidence of efficacy
      already exists.

          -  Age ≥ 12 years old

          -  Written inform consent (Informed Consent should be obtained from the legal guardian in
             accordance with regional laws or regulations for patients 12 to 17 years of age)

          -  Diagnosis of BD according to international criteria for BD (ICBD) (see Appendix 1).

          -  Life threatening active BD defined as 1 of the following disease categories and
             according to the validated international definition:

               -  Major vessel disease: arterial aneurysms or arterial stenosis, myocarditis and/or
                  major deep vein thrombosis (i.e. inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, cardiac
                  cavity thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, supra-hepatic vessels, renal and
                  mesenteric vessels). Diagnosis of major vessel involvement will be done using
                  vascular doppler sonography, echocardiography, angio-CT scan and/or cardiac
                  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

               -  Central nervous system involvement: encephalitis or meningoencephalitis or
                  myelitis. The diagnosis of neuro-Behçet's (CNS involvement) will be based on
                  objective neurological symptoms that were associated with neuroimaging (CNS
                  and/or medullar MRI) findings suggestive of BD-related CNS involvement.
                  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings showing aseptic inflammation may be
                  associated.

          -  Chest X-ray results (postero-anterior and lateral) within 12 weeks prior to inclusion
             with no evidence of active Tuberculosis, active infection, or malignancy

          -  For female subjects of child-bearing age, a negative pregnancy test

          -  For subjects with reproductive potential, a willingness to use contraceptive measures
             adequate to prevent the subject or the subject's partner from becoming pregnant during
             the study and 6 months after stopping therapy. Adequate contraceptive measures include
             hormonal methods used for two or more cycles prior to Inclusion (e.g., oral
             contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, or contraceptive vaginal ring), barrier
             methods (e.g., contraceptive sponge, diaphragm used in conjunction with contraceptive
             foam or jelly, or condom used in conjunction with contraceptive foam or jelly),
             intrauterine methods (IUD), sterilization (e.g., tubal ligation or a monogamous
             relationship with a vasectomized partner), and abstinence.

          -  A potential subject with a positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) (e.g.,
             QuantiFERON®-TB Gold or T-spot TB® Test) or a positive tuberculin skin test (≤6
             months) is eligible if her/his chest X-ray does not show evidence suggestive of active
             tuberculosis (TB) disease and there are no clinical signs and symptoms of pulmonary
             and/or extra-pulmonary TB disease. These subjects with a latent TB infection who have
             not already received a prophylactic TB treatment must agree in advance to complete
             such a treatment course.

          -  HIV negative serology and negative HBs Ag test (≤1 month)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active Tuberculosis

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Have been taking an oral daily dose of a glucocorticoid of more than 20 mg prednisone
             equivalent for more than 6 weeks continuously prior to the inclusion visit or taking
             more than 3000 mg methylprednisolone 4 weeks prior to the inclusion visit

          -  Alcohol or drug dependance

          -  Severe renal (creatinine clearance &lt;30ml/min/1,73m2) or pre-existing hemorrhagic
             cystitis or liver insufficiency (hepatic encephalopathy, ascites)

          -  Heart failure ≥ stage III / IV NYHA,

          -  History of malignancy within 5 years prior to Inclusion other than carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix or excised basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  History of multiple sclerosis and/or demyelinating disorder

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to cyclophosphamide or infliximab

          -  Infectious disease:

               -  Infection requiring treatment with antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to Inclusion

               -  History of recurrent infection

          -  Laboratory values assessed during Inclusion:

               -  Hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dL

               -  WBC &lt; 2.0 x 103/mm3

               -  Platelet count &lt; 70 x 103/mm3

          -  Use of the following systemic treatments during the specified periods:

               -  Treatment with systemic biologic therapy or with cyclophosphamide within 3 months
                  prior to Inclusion

                  inclusion, these drugs must be withdrawn prior to receiving the cyclophosphamide
                  or infliximab dose on Day 1

          -  Any live (attenuated) vaccine within 4 weeks prior inclusion; recombinant or killed
             virus vaccines are permitted.
