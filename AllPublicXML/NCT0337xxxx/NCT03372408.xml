  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Toronto Ontario, the Parkdale Community Health Centre operates a community outreach
      program entitled Parkdale Parents' Primary Prevention Project (5P's). The 5P's provides
      weekly pre- and post-natal support and education programs for clients. This includes an
      infant feeding program for mothers with infants 0-6 months (Feeding Tiny Souls). The 5P's has
      a diverse client-base; the program is aimed at women who are in challenging life
      circumstances, therefore, clients may include low-income or single mothers and newcomers to
      Canada.

      It is important to know who is accessing community programs and what the drivers of program
      utilization are in order to better support the women who are enrolled and to target those who
      are not. The aim of this project is twofold: 1) to investigate what socio-demographic and
      psychosocial characteristics predict level of participation in a prenatal community outreach
      program targeting vulnerable mothers and 2) based on utilization of a prenatal program, are
      there differences in the use of a postnatal program? This study will be conducted through a
      retrospective chart review. The study population will consist of women who enrolled in 5P's
      prenatally. The hypothesis is that more vulnerable women will not attend programming as
      frequently.
