      Brief Summary:

      The study is a prospective, randomized controlled phase III trial aimed to test the efficacy
      and safety of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) in combination with gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel, for front line treatment of locally-advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.The
      device is an experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic administration of
      alternating electric fields (termed TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by
      means of surface, insulated electrode arrays.

      PAST PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:

      The effect of the electric fields (TTFields, TTF) has demonstrated significant activity in in
      vitro and in vivo pancreatic adenocarcinoma pre-clinical models both as a single modality
      treatment and in combination with chemotherapies. TTFields have been demonstrated to act
      synergistically with taxanes and have been shown to be additive when combined with other
      chemotherapies including gemcitabine. In addition, TTFields have shown to inhibit metastatic
      spread of malignant melanoma in in vivo experiment.

      In a pilot study, 40 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      received gemcitabine together with TTFields (150 kHz) or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel
      together with TTFields (150 kHz) applied to the abdomen until disease progression. The
      combination was well tolerated and the only device-related adverse event was contact
      dermatitis.

      In addition, a phase III trial of Optune® (200 kHz) as monotherapy compared to active
      chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients showed TTFields to be equivalent to active
      chemotherapy in extending survival, associated with minimal toxicity, good quality of life,
      and activity within the brain (14% response rate) (Stupp R., et al., EJC 2012). Finally, a
      phase III trial of Optune® combined with maintenance temozolomide compared to maintenance
      temozolomide alone has shown that combined therapy led to a significant improvement in both
      progression free survival and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma
      without the addition of high grade toxicity and without decline in quality of life (Stupp R.,
      et al., JAMA 2017).

      DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:

      All patients included in this trial are patients with locally advanced pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. In addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

        1. Patients receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in combination with TTFields using the
           NovoTTF-100L(P) System.

        2. Patients receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel without TTFields.

      Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio. Baseline tests will be performed in patients
      enrolled in both arms. If assigned to the NovoTTF-100L(P) group, the patients will be treated
      continuously with the device until progression in the abdomen. On both arms, patients who
      have progression outside the abdomen will switch to a second line treatment according to
      local practice.

      SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:

      Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on
      metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of
      electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic
      particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.

      Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues.
      TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their
      direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (150
      thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects
      on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the
      intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.

      The breakthrough finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very
      low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in
      the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are
      multiplying, TTFields cause electrically-charged cellular components of these cells to change
      their location within the dividing cell, disrupting their normal function and ultimately
      leading to cell death. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which
      act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields
      interfere with the normal orientation of these tiny motors related to other cellular
      components since they are electrically-charged as well. As a result of these two effects,
      tumor cell division is slowed, results in cellular death or reverses after continuous
      exposure to TTFields.

      Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells
      since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to
      a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach. Finally, the
      frequency of TTFields applied to each type of cancer is specific and may not damage normally
      dividing cells in healthy tissues.

      In conclusion, TTFields hold the promise of serving as a brand new treatment for pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma with very few side effects.
