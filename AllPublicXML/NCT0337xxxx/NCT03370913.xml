  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to learn more about a potential treatment
      (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) for people with severe hemophilia A. This research study will
      test and confirm the safety and effectiveness of the 6E13 vg/kg dose of the study drug
      (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) that contains the correct gene to make Factor VIII so that the
      body can make its own Factor VIII that functions properly. Only one dose of valoctocogene
      roxaparvovec is being given in this study, and this dose has been previously studied in
      another clinical trial in patients with hemophilia A. This is a phase 3 study which is meant
      to show that the study drug is safe and works to help treat hemophilia A. The study will see
      if liver cells are able to make Factor VIII that functions properly after receiving this
      study drug. The study will also examine the effects that the study drug has on how much
      Factor VIII concentrates patients have to inject into their veins and on their bleeding
      episodes after the study drug has been administered. Finally, the study will see if and how
      the body responds to the study drug - for example, whether liver cells become inflamed or
      whether the body makes antibodies (something the immune system makes to protect itself
      against things like bacteria and viruses) against the vector or the new Factor VIII gene.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males ≥ 18 years of age with hemophilia A and residual FVIII levels ≤ 1 IU/dL as
             evidenced by medical history, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Must have been on prophylactic FVIII replacement therapy for at least 12 months prior
             to study entry. High-quality, well-documented historical data concerning bleeding
             episodes and FVIII usage over the previous 12 months must be available.

          -  Treated/exposed to FVIII concentrates or cryoprecipitate for a minimum of 150 exposure

             modification of less than 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU) on 2 consecutive occasions (the most
             recent one of which should be tested at the central laboratory) at least one week
             apart within the past 12 months

          -  HIV positive patients may be enrolled, only if the patient has a CD4 count &gt; 200/mm3
             and an undetectable viral load.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Detectable pre-existing antibodies to the AAV5 capsid.

          -  Any evidence of active infection or any immunosuppressive disorder, except for HIV
             infection as described in the inclusion criterion above.

          -  Significant liver dysfunction with any of the following abnormal laboratory results:

               -  ALT (alanine transaminase) or AST &gt;2X ULN;

               -  Total bilirubin &gt;2X ULN;

               -  INR (international normalized ratio) ≥ 1.4.

        Subjects whose liver laboratory assessments fall outside of these ranges may undergo repeat
        testing and, if eligibility criteria are met on retest, may be enrolled after confirmation
        by the Medical Monitor. In addition, subjects with abnormal laboratory results related to
        confirmed benign liver conditions (eg, Gilbert's syndrome) are considered eligible for the
        study notwithstanding their abnormal laboratory results and may be enrolled after
        discussion with the Medical Monitor.

          -  Prior liver biopsy showing significant fibrosis of 3 or 4 as rated on a scale of 0-4
             on the Batts-Ludwig (Batts 1995) or METAVIR (Bedossa 1996) scoring systems, or an
             equivalent grade of fibrosis if an alternative scale is used.

          -  Evidence of any bleeding disorder not related to hemophilia A.

             the interpretation of serological test results in the Laboratory Manual.

          -  Active Hepatitis C as evidenced by detectable HCV RNA or currently on antiviral
             therapy.

          -  Active malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  History of hepatic malignancy.

          -  History of arterial or venous thromboembolic events (eg, deep vein thrombosis,
             nonhemorrhagic stroke, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, arterial embolus),
             with the exception of catheter-associated thrombosis for which anti-thrombotic
             treatment is not currently ongoing.
