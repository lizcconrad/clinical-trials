    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 study of duvelisib, an orally
      bioavailable dual inhibitor of PI3K-δ,γ, in patients with CLL/SLL who have previously been
      treated with ibrutinib or another Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (BTKi) and relapsed or
      were refractory to such therapy or discontinued such therapy due to toxicity.
