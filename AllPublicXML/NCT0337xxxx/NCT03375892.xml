      This study aims to discover more about radiation techniques for people treated for left-sided
      breast cancer that minimizes exposure to the heart, as noted by mean heart dose. Both prone
      (lying face down) radiation and DIBH (Deep Inspiration Breath Hold) are more labor-intensive
      and usually require longer treatment times for patients than traditional supine (lying face
      up) free-breathing radiation treatments. Thus, identifying people that benefit most from
      these techniques can better utilize resources. This study compares supine and prone
      positioning, with or without DIBH, to further assess which positioning technique will achieve
      the lowest cardiac radiation doses.

      A pilot portion of this trial will determine the presence or absence of echo abnormalities
      and EKG findings predictive of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction in breast
      cancer patients prior to, soon after, and in follow-up after radiation therapy for breast
      cancer. Ejection fractions are expected to be normal in study patients but there may be
      evidence of risk markers after radiation.

      This study will measure mitochondrial function in leukocytes (peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells) from patients prior to and after undergoing radiation therapy, and a gradual decline
      in mitochondrial energy biomarkers over time after radiation therapy is expected.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a pathologically proven diagnosis of left-sided invasive breast
             cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ receiving breast/chestwall irradiation +/- regional
             nodal irradiation, or a right-sided invasive ductal cancer status post-mastectomy or
             lumpectomy who will be receiving breast/chest wall and nodal irradiation.

          -  Patients must have undergone breast conserving surgery (i.e. lumpectomy, partial
             mastectomy) or mastectomy prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Study entry must be prior to CT simulation.

          -  Per MCW Department of Radiation Oncology Standard of Care, women of childbearing
             potential must be non-pregnant and non-lactating and willing to use medically
             acceptable forms of contraception during radiation therapy. Patients under age 50 with
             a uterus and ovaries must have a negative serum pregnancy test within one week of
             planned CT simulation per Radiation Oncology Departmental guidelines prior to CT
             simulation.

          -  Patients must provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry.

          -  Patients must be able to hold their breath long enough to undergo CT simulation in
             DIBH (ten to fifteen seconds). The patient should also affirm they can lie in the
             prone position. This will be determined by the treating radiation oncologist, as per
             current standard of care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable to hold their breath long enough to undergo CT simulation in
             DIBH. While this may affect patients with COPD and/or other respiratory conditions,
             the presence of these comorbidities alone will not exclude patients from enrollment so
             long as they can maintain breath hold long enough to perform DIBH.
