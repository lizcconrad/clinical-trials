    <textblock>
      Non-specific low back pain is a common condition. Exercise is effective treatment for chronic
      low back pain. We hypothesized the functional exercise group will present pain reduction and
      functional improvement.

      The purpose of this study is investigated the effectiveness of an functional exercise program
      for people with nonspecific chronic low back pain. Patients will be randomly divided into 2
      groups: control group (minimal intervention - mini back school and analgesic) and group will
      receive a functional exercise protocol associated with minimal intervention.

    <description>It will be measured by the Brazilian version of the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) 11 points. The NPRS goes from 0 to 10, where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;the worst pain imaginable.&quot; Participants will be asked to answer about their pain levels based on the last seven days. Change in pain score or an improvement of 2 levels or more is accepted as clinically relevant.</description>

    <description>It will be evaluated based on the global perceived effect by the Likert Scale Score. The Likert scale, used to evaluate the patient's global perceived effect with treatment. The patients answered the question 'After starting the treatment, how do you think your low back is?' with one of the following statements: much worse, a little worse, unchanged, a little better, much better.</description>
