  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feeding is one of the most common problems encountered by preterm infants. Besides, effective
      and safe feeding is one of the important discharge criteria. Feeding problems of premature
      infants lead to prolonged hospitalization and increased healthcare cost. SINC feeding
      protocol was developed based on evidence-based feeding protocol (such as cue-based,
      infant-driven feeding) and individualized developmental care.

      The aim of the study is to determine the effect of the SINC feeding protocol on weight gain,
      transition to oral feeding and the length of hospitalization in premature infants according
      to traditional feeding method.

      Randomized controlled study, including 30 infants of 24-32+6 weeks gestation receiving either
      Standard Feeding or SINC Feeding Protocol.
