  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to develop an evidence based exercise programme for the
      management of knee osteoarthritis which is feasible and acceptable to patients and healthcare
      professionals in Malaysia. The chosen programme was identified through a systematic
      literature search and is the programme developed by Hurley et al. in 2007. This programme
      will be evaluated through mixed-methods sequential exploratory design research study guided
      by the United Kingdom (UK) Medical Research Council guidance and framework. It involves two
      phases of data collection. The first phase (already completed) comprised a qualitative study
      aimed at exploring the beliefs and attitudes of Malaysian people that would need to be taken
      into account when adapting the evidence based ESCAPE-pain (acronym for 'Enabling
      Self-management and Coping with Arthritic pain using Exercise) programme for implementation
      in the context of Malaysian healthcare system. The second phase will be conducted to evaluate
      the feasibility of trialling ESCAPE-pain programme in Malaysia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Malaysia, functional limitations and impaired daily living activities affect patients with
      knee osteoarthritis (OA) in such a way that they tend to refrain from hospital visits. This
      may may lead to depression and reduced quality of life, which may then impact on increases in
      health care costs. The service provided by hospitals to these patients, is under-utilised by
      the multi-ethnic people that make up the population. Through the researcher's previous
      clinical experience, it was observed that patients were complaining of difficulty in getting
      to the hospital, long waiting times, and also increasing transport costs. Thus, adoption of
      self-care and early prevention has been suggested as a solution for the OA affected Malaysian
      community. In addition, there is no home based exercise programme for patients with knee OA
      in current health practice in Malaysia. Although some of these patients in Malaysia are
      prescribed with home-based exercises, a fully comprehensive self-management programme is
      lacking for patients generally. Therefore, there is a need for a home based self-management
      exercise programme for people with knee OA which can be implemented in community setting
      without frequent involvement of the hospitals. The UK Medical Research Council Guidance and
      Framework on developing and evaluating complex interventions will be used to facilitate the
      process of developing a complex intervention. A systematic review of the literature
      identified an exercise programme called ESCAPE-Pain as the programme with the best evidence
      for adaptation as a self-management programme to implement in Malaysia.

      In phase 1, (already conducted), the investigators have undertaken interviews with patients
      and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Malaysia to identify their beliefs and attitudes
      towards the ESCAPE-pain programme. Preliminary analysis reveals that patients with knee OA
      and HCPs have positive views towards the implementation of the programme with integration of
      a few new components.

      In this phase, the investigators propose to undertake a feasibility randomised controlled
      trial in which the investigators compare the modified ESCAPE-pain programme for the Malaysian
      context, versus usual care in Malaysian OA patients. ESCAPE-pain is a rehabilitation
      programme that helps people with osteoarthritis (OA) and/or chronic joint pain to self
      -manage their condition. The programme aims to increase physical function and improve quality
      of life. The ESCAPE-pain programme, will be run over six weeks, with participants attending
      for one hour session, twice a week. Each session contains around a 20 minutes themed
      discussion focused on helping to support self-management and followed by about 45 minutes of
      exercise. The sessions will be led by the researcher who trained in how to deliver the
      ESCAPE-pain programme.

      This feasibility study is required to identify the best methods for a definitive trial in the
      future, to test recruitment and other trial procedures, the acceptability of the intervention
      and the way it is implemented and to provide insight into appropriateness of our outcome
      measures, including providing data to permit estimation of effect size to be used in sample
      size calculations for a definitive trial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at 6 and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after intervention completion at week 6, and at week 12 of intervention for follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument, developed to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated problems. KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</description>

    <measure>Change of Baseline Timed up and Go Test at 6 and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after intervention completion at week 6, and at week 12 of intervention for follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose is to measure lower limb strength and balance while moving. A chair will be placed next to a wall and the marker 8 feet will be marked with a cone in front of the chair. The path between the chair and the marker will be cleared from any obstacle. The participant will be started with fully seated with hands resting on the knees and feet flat on the ground. On the command, &quot;Go,&quot; timing will be started and the subject stands and walks (no running) as quickly as possible (and safely) to and around the cone, returning to the chair to sit down. The time will be stopped as they sit down. It will be performed two trials. Participants will be given a chance to do practice trial before actual time measured. The average time will be recorded to the nearest 1/10th second.</description>

    <measure>Change of Baseline Health Beliefs and Self-efficacy for exercise at 6 and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after intervention completion at week 6, and at week 12 of intervention for follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>A simple outcome measure that captures the benefit people attain from exercise. It is by altering their ability to exercise effectively and their beliefs towards exercise.A 17-items questionnaires to reflect the beliefs about one's ability to exercise (self-efficacy for exercise) (4 items), barriers to exercise (3 items), benefits of exercise (3 items), and impact of exercise on arthritis (7 items). The items use a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree, to indicate their beliefs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Baseline The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS) at 6 and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after intervention completion at week 6, and at week 12 of intervention for follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>SWEMWBS is used in the context of projects and programmes to enable self-reflection as a prelude to involvement with health enhancing activities. It does seem to be sensitive to changes in mental wellbeing at the individual level. Each of the 7 statement responses in SWEMWBS are scored from 1 to 5, from 'none of the time' to 'all of the time'. A total score is calculated by summing the 7 individual statement scores. The minimum score is 7 and the maximum is 35.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Baseline Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) at 6 and 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after intervention completion at week 6, and at week 12 of intervention for follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The short Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) is a validated and reliable 7-item tool which measures confidence in performing a range of activities of daily living without falling. This scale has recently been modified to maximise its suitability for a range of different languages and cultures (Yardley et al. 2005). Participants will be asked to rate, on a four-point Likert scale,their concerns about the possibility of falling when performing 7 activities. Participants will be instructed to rate each activity regardless of whether they actually perform it. The scores are added up to calculate a total score that ranges from 7 to 28 for the short FES-I. A higher score indicates a greater fear of falling.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12 of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS) is an assessment measuring tool to assess adherence to prescribed home exercise. It consists of 6 statements that best describes how participants do their recommended exercises/activities. The EARS is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (0 - completely agree to 4 - completely disagree). Items 1, 4 and 6 are reverse scored, resulting in a possible score of between 0 and 24. A higher score indicates better adherence.</description>
