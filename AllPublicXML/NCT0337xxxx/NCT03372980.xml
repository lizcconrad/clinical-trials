  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Takayasu arteritis is a chronic vasculitis mainly involving the aorta and its main branches
      such as the brachiocephalic, carotid, subclavian, vertebral, and renal arteries, as well as
      the coronary and pulmonary arteries. Inflammation causes segments of the vessels to become
      narrowed, blocked, or even stretched, possibly resulting in aneurysms. The disease is very
      rare but most commonly occurs in young Asian women. However, there is a considerable lack of
      understanding of the disease mechanism of Takayasu arteritis. Initially, the disease remains
      clinically silent (or remains undetected) until the patients present with vascular occlusion.
      Additionally, many individuals with Takayasu arteritis, however, have no apparent symptoms
      despite disease activity. Therefore, biomarkers for diagnosis and monitor disease activity in
      individuals with Takayasu arteritis are needed. In this study, the investigators therefore to
      use different methods to identify new biomarkers for diagnosing or monitoring the disease
      activity in individuals with Takayasu arteritis. These biomarkers may provide valuable
      insights into the underlying biochemical processes and aid the understanding of the
      pathophysiology of this disease.

    <description>Criteria for Disease Activity：Criteria for active disease are detection of new vascular lesion or lesions in arteries on vascular Imaging in participants who had undergone magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) examination in the month before evaluation, or at least 2 of the following: 1) new onset of carotodynia or pain over large vessels, 2) transient ischemic episodes not attributable to other factors, 3) new bruit or new asymmetry in pulses or blood pressure determination, 4) ischemic symptoms (including new-onset claudication), and 5) fever in absence of infection.
Criteria defined inactive disease: 1) absence of the features of active disease for at least the previous 3 months; 2) absence of new vascular lesions and stability or improvement of previous vascular lesion or lesions on an imaging study performed up to 1 month before evaluation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 classification criteria for
        Takayasu arteritis:

          1. Age of onset ≤40 years,

          2. Claudication of upper or lower extremities,

          3. Decreased pulsation of 1 or both brachial arteries,

          4. Difference of ≥ 10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure between arms,

          5. Bruit over subclavian arteries or aorta,

          6. *Arteriographic evidence showing a branch of the aorta stenosis or occlusion.

        Meeting more than 3 of 6 criteria suggests the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis.

        *Angiography in this study was replaced by vascular magnetic resonance angiography(MRA)or
        computed tomography angiography(CTA).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Arteriographic lesions that could be entirely due to atherosclerosis,

          2. Suffer from other autoimmune diseases (eg, ANCA-associated vasculitis, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, etc.) besides Takayasu arteritis,

          3. Cogan's syndrome,

          4. Behcet's disease,

          5. Subjects with any serious acute or chronic infection,

          6. Giant cell arteritis (large vessel vasculitis and at least 50 years old) or other
             infectious forms of large vessel vasculitis.
