    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay for the
      improvement of near vision in presbyopes implanted under a corneal flap or within a
      small-incision pocket.

      Patients must require a reading add from +1.5 to +2.5 D, and both emmetropes as well as
      ametropes (requiring concurrent LASIK) are included in the investigation. Suitable patients
      will undergo implantation of the Raindrop inlay in the non-dominant eye to improve near
      vision. If necessary, a LASIK excimer ablation will first be performed to optimize
      postoperative vision at near and distance. Patients will follow a one-month regimen of strong
      steroid, at a minimum, after corneal inlay implantation to facilitate healing and visual
      recovery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1.1.1 Patients require a near reading add from +1.5 to +2.5 D in the non-dominant eye.

        1.1.2 Patients have a photopic pupil size of at least 3.0 mm in the non-dominant eye.

        1.1.3 Patients have a central corneal thickness ≥ 500 microns in the non-dominant eye.

        1.1.4 Patients have corrected distance and near visual acuity of 20/25 or better in each
        eye.

        1.1.5 Patients have uncorrected near acuity of 20/40 or worse in the non-dominant eye.

        1.1.6 Patients are willing and able to understand and sign a written Informed Consent Form
        prior to any study-specific procedures.

        1.1.7 Patients are willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations for 24
        months after corneal inlay implantation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1.1.1 Patients with clinically significant dry eye (i.e., significant diffuse punctate
        staining with fluorescein and a tear breakup time less than 8 s) in either eye.

        1.1.2 Patients with a planned corneal residual bed thickness that is less than 250 microns
        (corneal thickness - (intended flap thickness + intended ablation depth)).

        1.1.3 Patients with macular pathology based on dilated fundus exam and/or optical coherence
        tomography (OCT) image.

        1.1.4 Patients who would be co-managed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is not
        approved as a ReVision Optics investigator.

        1.1.5 Patients with ocular pathology or disease (including pupil pathology such as fixed
        pupils) that might confound the outcome or increase the risk of adverse event.
