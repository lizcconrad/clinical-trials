  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study examines the impact of oxytocin (OXT) and Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT)
      on the development of language, social, and play skills in young children with Autism
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of OXT as an
      enhancer of response to PRT. Participants will be randomly assigned to either an intranasal
      OXT group or a placebo group. Neither the research team nor the participants will know or
      choose which group the participant is assigned to. Children in both groups will participate
      in a 16-week trial of PRT. The trial will test the hypothesis that children with lower levels
      of activity in and functional connectivity among certain PRT-response brain regions will
      benefit more from the administration of OXT vs. placebo as an enhancer to a 16-week trial of
      PRT.

      This project investigates the effectiveness of a new intervention approach for Autism
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to optimize the effects of an evidence-based behavioral intervention,
      Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) by attempting to enhance it with oxytocin (OXT). We will
      integrate fMRI, eye tracking, and behavioral outcomes to measure how OXT may create a neural
      background for individuals with ASD to bolster their motivation to interact socially and
      facilitate their biological preparedness for learning social communication skills during
      behavioral treatments.
