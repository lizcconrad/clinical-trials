    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, multi-country, multi-centre cohort study based on existing data
      from medical records of patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC treated with
      afatinib (Gi(l)otrif®) as the first-line treatment followed by osimertinib in case the T790M
      resistance mutation was developed.

        Study is planned that around 65 study centres in 11 countries will be participating in this
        noninterventional study and at least 190 consecutive eligible patients will be enrolled to
        the study. Every patient who fulfils inclusion and exclusion criteria and agree to
        participate in the study (if a written informed consent is required for this NIS by local
        regulation and legal requirement) will be selected until the required sample size is
        achieved.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

          -  The tumour harbours common EGFR mutations (Del19, L858R) at start of first-line
             treatment

          -  Patients who initiated second-line osimertinib treatment for acquired T790M mutation
             at least 10 months prior to data entry, AND who were treated with afatinib
             (Gi(l)otrif®) in the first-line

          -  Patients treated with osimertinib within an EAP/CUP or regular clinical practice

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent per regulations (Exemption of a written
             informed consent for NIS based on existing data in countries per local regulations and
             legal requirements)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who received drug(s) other than osimertinib as the second-line treatment
             and/or patients who received drug(s) other than afatinib (Gi(l)otrif®) as the
             first-line treatment

          -  Patients with active brain metastases at start of treatment (either
             afatinib/Gi(l)otrif® or osimertinib)
