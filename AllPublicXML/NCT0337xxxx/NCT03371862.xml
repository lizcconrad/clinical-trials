        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Short bowel (≤200cm) as a result of major intestinal resection (e.g. due to injury,
             volvulus, vascular disease, Crohn's disease).

          2. Jejunostomy patients only

          3. 12 continuous months of parenteral support (PS) dependency prior to enrolment.

          4. PS required at least 3 times per week to meet their caloric, fluid or electrolyte
             needs due to on-going malabsorption.

          5. Stable PS for at least 4 consecutive weeks immediately prior to first dose of
             liraglutide. Stability is described as:

               1. Actual PS usage should match prescribed PS;

               2. Baseline 48-hour urine output is 1-2 L/24 hours.

          6. Body mass index ≥ 19.5 kg/m2.

          7. Adequate hepatic and renal function:

               1. Total bilirubin within the normal range;

               2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5x upper limit of normal;

               3. Serum creatinine ≤1.5x upper limit of normal.

          8. Stable dosage for &gt; 4 weeks, prior to baseline evaluations, of anti-motility and
             anti-diarrhoeal agents, H2 antagonists, proton pump inhibitors, bile sequestering
             agents and oral rehydration solutions.

          9. Female subjects must be on acceptable method of contraception for a minimum of 4 weeks
             prior to the start of the trial; Acceptable methods of contraception would be a
             barrier form of contraception, oral contraceptive pill, contraceptive injection or
             implant or intrauterine implanted device.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             as aged 55 years or older and/or at least 2 years have elapsed since the last menses)
             or who are not using medically acceptable methods of birth control during and for 30
             days after the treatment period. Acceptable methods of contraception would be a
             barrier form of contraception, oral contraceptive pill, contraceptive injection or
             implant or intrauterine implanted device.

          -  Raised serum calcitonin (a biomarker for medullary thyroid cancer) at beginning of
             trial period

          -  History of cardiac failure

          -  Concurrent use of diuretics

          -  Previous history of pancreatitis

          -  Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse in last year

          -  &gt; 4 hospitalisations related to short bowel or its treatment over the previous year

          -  Any hospitalisation 30 days prior to screening

          -  Introduction or dose adjustment of immunosuppressant for inflammatory bowel disease
             within 6 months, or treatment with biologics within the past 6 months (systemic
             corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, MMF, infliximab,
             adalimumab, vedolizumab)

          -  BMI &lt; 19 kg/m2 or &gt; 27kg/m2 (An upper cut-off BMI of &gt; 27kg/m2 has been chosen, as in
             these patients, there is often a desire to reduce BMI which will conflict with the
             study design by adding another variable)

          -  Scleroderma/radiation enteritis/coeliacs disease/refractory or tropical sprue

          -  Liver and renal function outside the inclusion range
