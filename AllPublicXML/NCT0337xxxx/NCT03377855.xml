  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risk of long-term opioid dependence increases with initial opioid dose/duration, but despite
      recent CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)-endorsed minimum doses for initial
      opioid prescription, primary care providers are likely to overprescribe. In this quality
      improvement project, primary care departments at Weill Cornell and the Institute for Family
      Health (NYC-based FQHC) will implement an unobtrusive &quot;nudge&quot; in their electronic prescribing
      software to promote the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)-endorsed low doses
      for all opioids. In the evaluation, we will employ a quasi-experimental design with rigorous
      interrupted time series analysis methods to assess the effect of the &quot;nudge&quot; on prescribing
      rates. The analysis will be performed at the provider level, with deidentified physician data
      and a limited data set (fully deidentified except for date of prescription) of patient-level
      data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two participating institutions, WCMC (Weill Cornell Medical College) and IFH (Institute
      for Family Health), intend to redesign the e-prescribing interface to create a minor &quot;nudge&quot;
      to encourage prescribers to prescribe the minimum dose set by the 2016 CDC guideline for
      opioid-naive patients in 2018. The change to the e-prescribing system is that after a
      prescriber chooses the drug they wish to prescribe, the minimum recommended dosage from the
      CDC guidelines will be displayed. The prescriber can choose to change the dosage by
      overwriting in the field box. The changes to the prescriber system will be implemented at two
      Weill Cornell clinical organizations: Weill Cornell Internal Medicine Associates (WCIMA) and
      Weill Cornell Medical Associates (CMA), and at all locations at our collaborating institution
      IFH (Institute for Family Health). Weill Cornell and IFH will provide data for the analysis,
      which will be conducted by the co-investigators on this protocol. The project will assess
      data pre- and post- implementation to study prescribing patterns.
