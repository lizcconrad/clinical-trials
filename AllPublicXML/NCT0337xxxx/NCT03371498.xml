  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unresolved ARDS is defined by the persistence of ARDS criteria at the end of the first week
      of evolution despite an appropriate treatment of the cause of ARDS. A persistent ARDS is
      associated with an increased mortality and prolonged lengths of mechanical ventilation, ICU
      stay and hospitalization. Persistent ARDS is characterized by ongoing inflammation,
      parenchymal-cell proliferation, and fibroproliferation leading to disordered deposition of
      collagen. All of these pathways may be responsive to corticosteroid therapy.

      Only two randomized controlled double-blinded trials assessed the use of corticosteroids for
      persistent ARDS. In 24 patients, Meduri et al. reported an improvement of lung function and
      survival (1). In 180 patients, Steinberg et al showed no effect of corticosteroids on
      survival (2). A lower risk of death was observed when corticosteroids were started before 14
      days after the onset of ARDS (2).

      Alveolar procollagen III is validated as a biomarker of active fibroproliferation. Alveolar
      procollagen III &gt; 9 µg/L is associated to fibroproliferation (3).

      As mortality was lower in patients who received corticosteroids while presenting a high
      alveolar level of procollagen III on inclusion, Steinberg et al. showed that patients
      presenting with a low level of procollagen III and treated with corticosteroids had an
      increased risk of death (2).

      Investigatores hypothesize that the use of procollagen III could improve personalized
      decision-making regarding steroid treatment in patients presenting with persistent ARDS. The
      future of anti-fibrotic treatment, including corticosteroids, in persistent ARDS might
      propose to individualize the therapy according to the presence of an active
      fibroproliferative phase (precision or personalized medicine).
