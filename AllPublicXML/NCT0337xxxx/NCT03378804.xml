  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare programmed intermittent bolus application and continuous
      epidural infusion with regard to additionally applied patient-controlled volume of local
      anesthesia and quality of analgesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Usually, patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) is performed with a constant background
      infusion and patient-controlled bolus applications. An alternative approach is to give
      boluses at a regular rate for basic medication, instead of the continuous background
      infusion, maintaining the same amount of medication delivered per hour, (Programmed
      Intermittent Epidural Bolus injection; PIEB). In both cases, the patient has the option to
      trigger additional boluses. PIEB has been applied successfully in pain relief for lumbar
      epidural anesthesia in obstetrics, with better quality of analgesia and less total volume of
      local anesthetic required. It is assumed that the higher pressure in the epidural space with
      bolus injection results in a better and more uniform spread of the local anesthetic. In this
      study the PIEB-mode will be applied in major gynecological and abdominal surgery. In order to
      address the possibility that the different types of surgery result in different degrees of
      postoperative pain, the patients are stratified in three groups and randomized within these
      groups (Wertheim, Whipple, major colon surgery).
