      Does active piano practice help recover hand dexterity in older adults, or does social
      interaction and music-listening alone affect motor performance? Researchers hypothesized
      improved dexterity after active piano playing, but not after passive piano listening. 15
      residents of a retirement community were partnered together and completed 2 two-week piano
      training modules. In module 1, one partner played piano exercises and songs while the other
      listened. In module 2, partners switched roles. The Purdue Pegboard Test and Box and Block
      Test assessed fine and gross motor dexterity, before, between, and after the training
      modules. A repeated measures ANOVA showed a main effect of time on overall fine and gross
      motor function, but there was no main effect of playing versus listening. Results did not
      support the hypothesis, but indicate that piano-based therapy requires greater than 2 weeks
      to begin improving dexterity and may influenced co-occurring socialization.

      The primary finding of this study is that older adults demonstrate improvements in manual
      dexterity after four weeks of piano training, but do not improve significantly after just two
      weeks. Furthermore, it does not matter whether the participants actively play for the first
      part and passively listen for the second part or vice versa.

      Of the three proposed mechanisms of Music Supported Therapy (MST) explained in the
      introduction, the findings of this study may be best explained by the emotion-motivation
      mechanism. Though dexterity scores were organized by whether the scores followed an active
      playing module, all participants experienced the same amount of music-listening and social
      interaction. Whether the participant was playing the music him/herself or observing, both
      groups were always hearing the same songs and scales for the same amount of time. The
      emotion-motivation mechanism states that this music-listening alone may increase cognitive
      processes like working memory and boost both mood and motivation. Therefore, these findings
      may mean that listening to piano music helps dexterity performance in older adults; but it
      does so if and only if the participants experience the music-listening module for a
      sufficient duration of time.

      Along with music-listening, social interaction was consistent between active and passive
      groups throughout the study. This interpersonal interaction may also have had an effect on
      mood and motivation, as piano instructors provided high levels of encouragement and
      complimented the participants' progress often. Relationship quality between patient and
      therapist is correlated with efficacy of therapy. This concept of increased socialization
      contributing to dexterity improvements is also supported by a study that identified social
      participation as a preventative factor of perceptual speed decline in older adults.

      Not finding the hypothesized effect of active versus passive condition on dexterity could be
      due to dexterous activities that the participants were engaged in outside of the training
      modules. For example, three of the 15 participants reported that they currently play piano in
      their free time, so it can be conjectured that those participants were engaged in active
      piano playing even when they were in the passive listening module. Other activities enjoyed
      by participants include exercise classes and paintingâ€”both of which could have been improving
      or maintaining their dexterity throughout the study.

    <description>Piano Curriculum. Participants were all trained on one of four 88-key pianos located in the assisted living facility. Piano instructors were 6 undergraduate Music Education and Music Performance majors. Each lesson of the week had a different focus: right and left hands separately, bimanually coupled, and bimanually uncoupled (Loehrer et al., 2016). Each week of the module had a different focus as well: notes played one step apart, notes played multiple steps apart (intervals), and tones played together (two-note chords) (van Vugt et al., 2016; Villeneuve et al., 2014). Each session began with skill exercises and ended with learning a simple, recognizable song. Two participants with extensive piano experience progressed to playing duets with the instructor and hymns out of a hymnal after mastery of the study curriculum. These training protocols were based on those of Schneider and colleagues' 2007 study.</description>
