  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CHF6366 is a novel bifunctional compound displaying both muscarinic receptor antagonist and
      β2-adrenergic receptor agonist properties (MABA), with the potential to deliver optimal
      bronchodilation after inhalation dosing via two validated mechanisms in one molecule.

      The study will consist of three parts:

      Part 1 will consit of two cohorts of healthy male subjects to assess the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of Single Ascending Dose (SAD) of CHF 6366

      Part 2 will consist of four cohorts of asthmatic subjects to assess the saftey, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) of CHF6366

      Part 3 will consist of one cohort of COPD patients to asess safety, tolerability of a single
      dose of CHF6366 in an active and placebo controlled design
