      The lymphatics regulate the interstitial fluid by removing excessive fluid. It represents an
      extremely important step in the prevention of edema. The Fontan-Kreutzer procedure has
      revolutionized the treatment of univentricular hearts. However, it is associated with severe
      complications such as protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and peripheral edema that may involve
      the lymphatic circulation.

      Our hypothesis is that patients with a univentricular circulation have a reduced
      functionality of the lymphatic vasculature, which predisposes them to developing
      complications such as edema and PLE.

      The functional state of lymphatics is investigated using near infrared fluorescence imaging,
      NIRF. The anatomy is described using non-contrast MRI and the capillary filtration rate is
      measured using plethysmography.

      Background:

      The lymphatics regulate the interstitial fluid by removing excessive fluid. It represents an
      extremely important step in the prevention of edema. The Fontan-Kreutzer procedure has
      revolutionized the treatment of univentricular hearts. However, it is associated with severe
      complications such as protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) and peripheral edema that may involve
      the lymphatic circulation.

      Hypothesis:

      Patients with a univentricular circulation have a reduced functionality of the lymphatic
      vasculature, which predisposes them to developing complications such as edema and PLE.

      Material and Methods:

      The functional state of lymphatics is investigated using near infrared fluorescence imaging,
      NIRF. The anatomy is described using non-contrast MRI and the capillary filtration rate is
      measured using plethysmography. The study population is patients with Fontan-Kreutzer
      circulation operated at Aarhus University hospital. Exclusion criteria is BMI&gt;30 and age
      (years) &lt; 18. The Fontan-Kreutzer group will be compared with an age, gender and weight
      matched control group of healthy volunteers.

    <description>Occlusion of lymphatic flow by inflating a cuff (Hokanson E20 Rapid cuff inflator, Hokanson AG101 air source) to 70mmHg and then reducing the pressure with 5mmHg each 5th minute. The highest pressure under which the fluorescent dye is able to cross the inflatable cuff is labelled Ppump.</description>

    <time_frame>25 min</time_frame>
    <description>A 5-step 20-min venous congestion protocol will be used to measure capillary filtration. The capillary filtration rate (µl·100 ml-1 ·min-1 ) is measured as the slope of the time-volume change (%) curve at steady state at the end of each pressure phase.</description>
