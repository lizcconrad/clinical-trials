    <textblock>
      This study compares the movement of Belatacept drug products, whose active pharmaceutical
      ingredient has been manufactured by 2 different processes, into, through and out of the body
      (pharmacokinetics/PK) of healthy volunteers. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of two groups, and will receive a single dose of a belatacept product once during a
      4-day stay at a study site.
