    <textblock>
      A phase III prospective study with the primary objective to compare the efficacy and safety
      of HIPEC( Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy). The target population for this study is
      patients with primary or recurrence ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers undergoing
      CRS( Cytoreductive Surgery). Patients will be divided into two groups. Group A will undergo
      CRS plus HIPEC and then go on to receive standard platinum-based combination doublet
      intravenous chemotherapy. Group B will undergo CRS and then go on to intravenous
      chemotherapy.

      This is a phase III prospective study with the primary objective to compare the efficacy and
      safety of HIPEC. The target population for this study is patients with primary or recurrence
      ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers undergoing CRS. 'Platinum-sensitive' recurrence
      is defined as recurrence 6 months after the completion of the primary platinum-based
      chemotherapy. A single dose of lobaplatin 40mg/m2 will be administered via HIPEC , and will
      be administered at the time of surgery, 3 days after surgery and 5 days after surgery.
      Patients of group A will undergo CRS plus HIPEC and then go on to receive standard
      platinum-based combination doublet intravenous chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel,
      carboplatin and gemcitabine, or carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin) for 6 cycles. Patients
      of group B will undergo CRS and then go on to intravenous chemotherapy.

    <description>Patients will undergo a CRS plus HIPEC and IVCT. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a procedure in which the abdominal cavity is bathed in a warm solution of anti-cancer medications for 60 minutes.
A single drug lobaplatin(30mg/m2)will be administered in normal saline via HIPEC and it will be continued for 60 minutes in the hyperthermic phase (41°C-43°C). HIPEC will be performed at the 1st, 3rd and 5th day after CRS. The intravenous chemotherapy(IVCT) will start from 7th-14th day after CRS.</description>

    <description>Patients consenting to this protocol will undergo their scheduled surgical procedure. After cytoreductive surgery (CRS) to a residual disease ≤ 2.5 mm, a single dose of lobaplatin (30 mg/m2) will be administered in normal saline via intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion using the closed-abdomen technique. HIPEC will be continued for 60 minutes in the hyperthermic phase (43℃±0.5℃). And HIPEC will be repeated at the 3 and 5 day after the day of CRS plus HIPEC.</description>
