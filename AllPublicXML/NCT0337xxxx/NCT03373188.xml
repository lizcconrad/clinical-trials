  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I trial studies how well anti-semaphorin 4D (anti-SEMA4D) monoclonal
      antibody VX15/2503 with or without ipilimumab or nivolumab work in treating patients with
      stage I-III pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery or stage IV colorectal cancer
      that has spread to the liver and can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503, ipilimumab, and nivolumab, may interfere with the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To evaluate the effect of the anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 (VX15/2503) alone and
      VX15/2503 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, on the
      immune profile in the tumor microenvironment and in peripheral blood.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      To extend the previously reported safety profile of single agent VX15/2503 to the combination
      of VX15/2503 and immune checkpoint inhibitors, ipilimumab or nivolumab, in patients with
      pancreatic and colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes on day 1. Patients then proceed to surgery 22-36 days after drug administration.

      ARM III: Patients receive anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and
      ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients then proceed to surgery 22-36 days after
      drug administration.

      ARM IV: Patients receive anti-SEMA4D monoclonal antibody VX15/2503 IV over 60 minutes and
      nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Patients then proceed to surgery 22-36 days after drug
      administration.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days and then every 12
      weeks thereafter.
