  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to identify biomarkers allowing the distinction between invasive
      and non-invasive strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. This distinction is important to
      determine if the patient is infected and, as a consequence, if an antibiotic treatment is
      required.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the hospital, a large proportion of bacteraemia and implantable medical device infections
      are caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. This microorganism is the most abundant on human
      skin and all patients are carriers. Its remarkable ability to form biofilms on most materials
      explains that catheter-related infections are by far the most common.

      S. epidermidis infections are difficult to treat because most strains are multi-resistant and
      antibiotics are less effective in the presence of biofilms.

      In addition, S. epidermidis poses a major diagnostic problem because it is also the first
      source of contamination of blood culture sample and intraoperative samples (in case of
      suspected infection of orthopedic material in particular). Thus, when a sample is positive
      for S. epidermidis, there is less than a 25% chance that it reflects true bacteremia in the
      patient and 30% of patients would inappropriately receive vancomycin following contaminated
      blood cultures. Differentiating a contamination of a blood or intraoperative sample from true
      S. epidermidis infection is therefore crucial for patient management because unnecessary
      antibiotic therapy is potentially responsible for the emergence of resistant strains,
      toxicity and additional costs.

      The objective of this study is to identify the genetic markers that make it possible to
      differentiate the strains causing infections from the strains causing contamination by
      comparing their genomes using high throughput sequencing.
