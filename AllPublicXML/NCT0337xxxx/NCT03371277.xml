  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder affecting 1-2% of the
      population over 65 years-old. In addition to the motor impairment characterized by resting
      tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability, patients suffer with non-motor
      symptoms such as dysautonomia syndrome, sleep disturbances, depressive disorders, delusional
      disorders and cognitive disorders. Research and management of these non-motor symptoms is
      essential because these can be disabling and have a negative impact on the quality of life of
      patients. Among cognitive functions, social cognition is defined as the aspect that is
      dedicated to process social information for adaptive functioning. More specifically, it
      refers to an intricate set of higher-order neuropsychological domains that allow for adaptive
      behaviors in response to others. Four dimensions are usually included in this construct:
      theory of mind (ToM), emotion processing, social perception and social knowledge, and
      attributional style. Recently, different categories of social cognition have been studied in
      patients suffering from PD, such as the ToM or the recognition of facial emotions. Other
      aspects of social cognition that seem relevant in this population are still poorly studied;
      the attributional style is a cognitive bias defined as &quot;the way we explain the causes of the
      positive or negative events that occur&quot;. Indeed, different causes can be attributed to an
      event, and this attribution is shared between oneself, others and other factors related to
      the situation. People with attribution bias may mistakenly attribute to one cause all the
      situations. For example, when an individual blame the others for an event, he may develop a
      feeling of hostility that may lead to maladaptive behavior such as aggression and thus affect
      his social functioning. The impact of PD treatments, particularly deep brain stimulation
      (DBS), on the ToM has been studied, showing a deficit after stimulation. No study has
      assessed the impact of therapeutics on the attributional style of PD patients. In this
      context, it seems relevant to evaluate the effect of deep brain stimulation on the
      attributional style in this population.

      To explore attribution bias in PD population, the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility
      Questionnaire (AIHQ) developed by Combs (2007) will be used. The participants will be asked
      to read 15 vignettes, to imagine the scenario happening to her or him (e.g., ''You walk past
      a bunch of teenagers at a mall and you hear them start to laugh''), and to write down the
      reason why the other person (or persons) acted that way toward you. Two independent raters
      will subsequently code this written response for the purpose of computing a ''hostility
      index'' (described below). The participant will then rate, on Likert scales, whether the
      other person (or persons) performed the action on purpose (1 ''definitely no'' to 6
      ''definitely yes''), how angry it would make them feel (1 ''not at all angry'' to 5 ''very
      angry''), and how much they would blame the other person (or persons) (1 ''not at all'' to 5
      ''very much''). Finally, the participant will be asked to write down how she or he would
      respond to the situation, which will be later coded by two independent raters to compute an
      ''aggression index'' (described in Combs, 2007).

      Socio-demographic data, subsyndromic symptoms of depression and anxiety, paranoia symptoms
      and cognitive functions will also be assessed to explore the confounding factors.
