  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenic role of type I interferons (IFNs) in the development of different autoimmune
      diseases has been extensively described in the literature. Since plasmacytoid dendritic cells
      (pDCs) are the main source of type I IFNs, there is evidence of the involvement of pDCs in
      autoimmune diseases. The CD303 surface protein (also called BDCA-2) is specifically expressed
      by the pDCs.

      The hypothesis leading to the realization of this study is to observe, in vitro, an
      inhibition of the secretion of the type I IFNs by pDCs in the peripheral blood in patients
      with autoimmune disease, thanks to the action of the anti-CD303 antibody Developed by the LFB
      Group, which could reduce the inflammatory response and improve patients with autoimmune
      disease
