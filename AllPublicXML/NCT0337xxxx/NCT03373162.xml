  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The injection of BOTOX into peripheral muscles has been shown to have therapeutic effects in
      a growing number of indications including disorders involving skeletal muscle (e.g.,
      strabismus, blepharospasm, cervical dystonia, spasticity, cosmetic), smooth muscle (e.g.,
      bladder), glands (axillary hyperhidrosis) and nociceptive pain (e.g. migraine) (Brin. 2014).
      Recently, several studies have suggested that peripheral BOTOX injections in the region of
      the glabellar lines (muscles around the eyes) may be effective in treating major depression
      and chronic migraine. However, the mechanism underlying the effect of peripheral BOTOX
      injections on the brain is not well understood. Therefore, the Investigators propose to
      further explore the functional effects of BOTOX injections on brain in healthy controls. The
      approach will involve the measurement of brain metabolites in the brainstem using MRS as well
      as an investigation of the functioning and connectivity between regions of the brain using
      resting state MRI and high resolution fMRI.

      Participants will receive one MRI scan session prior to a standardized, clinical dose of
      BOTOX injected into the forehead per FDA-approved procedures. Participants will then undergo
      a second MRI scan session 2-3 weeks later, after the BOTOX has taken maximal effect.
      Examining fMRI of the brainstem and the functional connectivity of the brainstem and
      connections to cortex, may provide additional insight into the effects of BOTOX on neurologic
      and psychiatric disorders.
