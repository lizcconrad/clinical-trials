  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to determine the feasibility of delivering a comprehensive behavioral
      lifestyle intervention including dietary and exercise components via an evidence based,
      internet-delivered telehealth coaching platform. Further, investigators will gather
      preliminary data on the change in multiple sclerosis clinical outcomes and cardiometabolic
      risk factors after participation in the intervention. The outcomes will inform the design of
      a larger randomized controlled trial.
