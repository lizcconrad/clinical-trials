  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hamstring muscle injuries are a common pathology in sports mainly present in sprint and
      acceleration sports, accounting for about 12% of all football injuries. Because of their
      frequency, risk of reinjury and financial cost, they can be considered as a public health
      problem. Improving knowledge of the pathophysiology of hamstring muscle injury appears to be
      a relevant research focus for prevention purposes.
