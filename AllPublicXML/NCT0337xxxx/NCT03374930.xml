  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate, in a prospective cohort, the link between
      preoperative contractile reserve of oesophagus evaluated by high resolution manometry (HRM)
      and the occurrence of post operative dysphagia after anti-reflux surgery.
