    <textblock>
      Analysis of kinetics of phosphatidylcholine and specific surfactant proteins, total body
      water and water turnover in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients by using non radioactive isotopes as deuterium and
      Carbon-13.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have low concentrations of
      disaturated-phosphatidylcholine and surfactant protein-B and C in bronchoalveolar lavage
      fluid and altered fluid metabolism.

      Injection of stable isotopes such as 13 Carbon Leucine and deuterated water allows the
      analysis of disaturated-phosphatidylcholine and surfactant protein-B and C kinetics, total
      body water and water turnover in patients with ARDS and in human adults with normal lungs
      (controls).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria were:

          -  adult patients older than 18 years

          -  expected intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay greater than 120 hours from the
             onset of acute respiratory failure, defined according to the acute respiratory
             syndrome (ARDS) Berlin criteria or patients admitted for acute neurological failure
             defined as Glasgow coma scale &lt; 8.

          -  All patients with ARDS also had sepsis syndrome or septic shock according to the
             surviving sepsis campaign criteria at the admission to the ICU, while no patients with
             acute neurological failure was septic.

        At the start of the study, patients with ARDS/sepsis fulfilled also the following criteria:

          -  start of the study within 72 hours from the onset of the respiratory failure;

          -  stable hemodynamic conditions, defined as no need of fluid boluses for at least 6
             hours before the start of the study;

          -  serum urea and creatinine within the normal ranges.

        Patients with acute neurological failure fulfilled the following inclusion criteria:

          -  normal chest radiograph;

          -  arterial partial pressure of oxygen / fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &gt;300;

          -  no evidence of sepsis, according to body temperature, C reactive protein, white cell
             count and differential count within normal ranges;

          -  intubation and mechanical ventilation started within 72 h before the beginning of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for all study subjects were:

          -  presence of liver failure or renal failure (transaminases &gt; 3 and creatinine &gt; 2 times
             the normal values),

          -  burns &gt; 30% of body surface bone marrow or lung transplantation,

          -  need of fluid boluses to maintain hemodynamic conditions during the study or
             extracorporeal circulatory support.
