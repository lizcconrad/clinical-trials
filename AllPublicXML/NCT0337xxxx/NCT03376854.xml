      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a serious condition that occurs as a
      complication of medical and surgical diseases, has a mortality of ~40%, and has no known
      treatment other than optimization of support. Data from basic research, animal models, and
      retrospective studies, case series, and small prospective studies suggest that therapeutic
      hypothermia (TH) similar to that used for cardiac arrest may be lung protective in patients
      with ARDS; however, shivering and its metabolic impact is a major complication of TH, often
      requiring neuromuscular blockade (NMB) to control. NMB has now become part of standard of
      care for patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Since many of these patients are already
      receiving the ultimate anti-shivering therapy, the investigators reasoned that such patients
      would provide an ideal population for an RCT of TH in ARDS. The investigators have completed
      a retrospective study of patients with ARDS on NMB and an open label pilot study of TH in 8
      such patients that demonstrated feasibility and safety of performing such an RCT.
      Furthermore, a comparison of the subjects in the open-label study with the historical
      controls from the retrospective study suggested that TH will be beneficial in patients with
      ARDS. To generate further support for grant applications to support a Phase IIb multicenter
      RCT, the investigators plan on performing a small pilot single center RCT of TH (core
      temperature 34-35°C) for 48h vs. standard of care in patients with ARDS who are receiving
      NMB. Primary outcome will be 28 day ventilator-free days and secondary outcomes will include
      physiologic measures, mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay, and serum biomarkers
      collected on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.

      Background:

      Despite recent advances in supportive care for patients with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS), mortality remains &gt;40%. Fever worsens and hypothermia mitigates animal
      models of ALI. A small non-randomized controlled trial of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) in
      moribund patients with septic shock and ARDS showed improved survival (3 of 9 vs. 0 of 10) in
      the TH group. However, the study preceded modern ARDS definition and management and mortality
      in both groups was much higher than current experience. Since oxygen utilization decreases
      ~10% per 1°C reduction in core temperature, TH may reduce injury in part by allowing lower
      levels of assisted ventilation. TH likely exerts additional lung protective effects by
      directly modifying temperature-dependent cellular processes in endothelium, epithelium, and
      leukocytes. However, cooling in critically ill patients is complicated by shivering and its
      adverse metabolic consequences. Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is increasingly used in patients
      with ARDS to facilitate low tidal volume ventilation and prone positioning and based on
      results of the ACURASYS trial. Since NMB is the ultimate anti-shivering treatment, such
      patients offer a convenient population for an initial study of TH in ARDS. A retrospective
      study of 58 ARDS patients treated with NMB showed that NMB alone does not cause hypothermia.
      An open-label study of 8 ARDS patients showed that studying TH in NMB-treated ARDS patients
      was feasible. In this study, the TH-treated patients had greater 28-day ventilator-free days
      (VFDs), ICU-free days (ICU-FDs) and hospital survival (75% vs. 25%; p = 0.027) than
      historical controls. Within the limits of historical comparisons, these results support
      further study of TH in ARDS.

      Focus of Study: The focus of the Cooling to Help Injured Lungs (CHILL) program is to test the
      central hypothesis that TH reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with ARDS in a Phase
      III randomized control trial (RCT). CHILL-RCT-pilot, a single-site Phase IIb RCT of TH vs
      usual temperature management in NMB-treated ARDS patients is the next step toward achieving
      this objective. CHILL-RCT-pilot has been started as a self-funded pilot with plans to
      transition to an NHLBI R33/61-funded phase contingent on grant funding. The data from the
      single-center study will provide additional data to support and plan a larger, more
      definitive multicenter Phase IIb or III trial.

      Primary and secondary objectives: The primary objective is to assess in an RCT whether mild
      TH is beneficial in patients with ARDS. The single-center pilot will provide information for
      planning a multicenter Phase IIb RCT TH vs. usual temperature management in patients with
      moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2:FIO2 (P/F) ratio&lt;150) who are receiving NMB as part of their
      clinical management.

      Study design: The CHILL trial is a single center RCT.

      Intervention: The study intervention is TH to core temperature 34°-35°C for 48h using surface
      cooling devices. As a prerequisite for randomization, all patients will receive deep
      sedation, continuous infusion of cisatracurium and mechanical ventilation for at least 48h.
      Decisions about transition to unassisted breathing, extubation, and transfer from ICU will be
      based on criteria in the CHILL study protocol.

      TH arm: Once sedation and NMB are confirmed, TH to 34°-35°C will be initiated using either
      cooling blankets or Arctic Sun Device based on availability. Temperature will be measured
      from a central probe. Once target temperature is reached, TH will be maintained for 48h.
      Patients will then be rewarmed to 35.5°C by 0.3°C/h and the cooling devices removed. Post-TH
      fever suppression is not part of the CHILL protocol. Following ~54h treatment period,
      patients will receive antipyretics and surface cooling or warming at the discretion of the
      primary ICU team. Early stopping rules for TH include: persistent severe bradycardia,
      uncontrolled bleeding, and intractable arrhythmias.

      Usual temperature management arm: Patients will receive sedation and NMB as described for the
      TH arm. During the 54h post-randomization/NMB treatment period, acetaminophen will be given
      for core temperature &gt;38°C and surface cooling will be initiated if core temperature remains
      &gt;38°C within ≥45 minutes of receiving acetaminophen and adjusted to maintain core temperature
      ≤38°C. Patients in the usual temperature management arm with core temperature &lt;36.5°C will
      receive surface warming to restore core temperature to 37°C. Following the 54h treatment
      period, patients will receive antipyretics and surface cooling or warming at the discretion
      of the primary ICU team.

      Concomitant Treatment: Since prone positioning independently improves survival in ARDS,
      starting and stopping rules for prone positioning have been protocolized.

      Primary and Secondary Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint: 28-day VFDs. Decisions about transition to unassisted breathing will be
      made based on criteria in the CHILL protocol. The 28-day VFDs will be calculated at day 28.

      Intermediate endpoint: The low and high core temperatures in each 2-hour period will be
      recorded and the mean core temperature for each of the first four study days will be
      calculated.

      Secondary endpoints:

      Clinical: (a) 28-day ICU-FDs: Decisions about transfer out of the ICU will be made based on
      criteria in the CHILL protocol. The 28-day ICU-FDs will be calculated at day 28 and recorded
      on the Day 28 case report form (CRF); (b) day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 non-neurologic SOFA score;
      (c) Glasgow coma score at hospital discharge; (d) 60- and 90-day survival; (e) 60- and 90-day
      functional status. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tool (MOCA) will be administered at ICU
      and hospital discharge.

      Physiologic: (a) day-3 and day-7 driving pressure and change vs baseline; (b) day-3 and day-7
      oxygen saturation index (OSI) and change vs. baseline OSI. These measurements will be
      performed at the same time of day as the baseline values.

      Plasma Biomarker: Day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 plasma IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, soluble-RAGE,
      surfactant protein-D, soluble ICAM-1, MMP8, and soluble TNFRI.

        1. For the first 54h: (a) continuous cardiac monitoring for bradycardia with associated
           hypotension requiring i.v. fluid or vasopressors; (b) every 6h blood glucose
           measurement; (c) every 12 h potassium, magnesium and phosphate; (d) significant bleeding
           event (requiring 2u packed red blood cells or surgical or interventional radiologic
           intervention)

        2. First 7 days: (a) Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP); (b) other secondary infections;
           (c) monitor for SAEs

           Study population: Adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS based on Berlin criteria
           &lt;48h in duration and who are receiving NMB for ≤12h at time of randomization.

           Data Analysis: The group difference on the primary outcome variable, 28-day, will be
           tested with a permutation test for the difference in group means with alpha = 0.05
           (two-tailed). For secondary clinical outcomes, t-tests, Wilcoxon, or chi-square tests
           for the comparison of two proportions will be used as appropriate. Mean differences will
           be estimated using 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes to further inform the
           decision whether to recommend proceeding to as well as to plan for a multicenter Phase
           IIb or Phase III trial.

           Data Management: Data for this pilot RCT will be recorded on paper CRFs by Drs. Hasday,
           Shanholtz, or their designees. Completion of all fields will be checked in real-time by
           Drs. Hasday and Shanholtz. The forms have been designed to allow smooth transition to
           electronic data management to be provided by Axio Research, LLC once funding is
           approved.

           Randomization Plan: The investigators will use a randomization protocol stratified for
           proning status using pre-generated random assignment lists. Assignments will be made
           using an in-house Excel-based assignment tool, which blinds the observer to the
           assignment list.

           Subject Participation Duration: The duration of intervention, TH vs. usual temperature
           management, is 48h, followed by rewarming for 3-6h in the TH group. NMB can be stopped
           52h after enrollment in the usual temperature management control group and when subjects
           are rewarmed to core temperature ≥35.5°C in the TH group. Physiologic and clinical
           parameters will be collected through study day 7. In hospital follow-up up to 90 days
           will include determination of 28-day VFDs and ICU-FDs, and day of hospital discharge.
           When the patient regains competence, consent for continued participation will be
           obtained

           Study Duration: Completion of enrollment is anticipated within 2 years.
