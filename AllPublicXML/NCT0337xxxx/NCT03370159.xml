      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic
      acid (CPI-613) when given together with docetaxel and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as CPI-613 and docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerate dose (MTD) of CPI-613 when used in combination with
      docetaxel therapy in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase1) II. To
      evaluate the response rate in patients receiving CPI-613 in combination with docetaxel
      therapy. (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of CPI-613 addition to docetaxel therapy. II. To determine the
      progression-free survival with CPI-613 in combination with docetaxel therapy at 27 weeks.

      III. To determine the median progression-free survival with CPI-613 in combination with
      docetaxel therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of CPI-613 followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive CPI-613 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 3, and docetaxel IV on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients that achieve stable disease after 6 courses
      then receive CPI-613 alone on days 1and 3. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then
      periodically for 2 years.
