  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men over 50 years old and the third leading
      cause of cancer death. Because of the variety of prostate cancers, different treatments
      exist.

      Several criteria guide this management in daily practice: PSA level; TNM stage (digital
      rectal examination, trans-rectal ultrasound and classical visual imaging) and pathological
      differentiation with the Gleason score, to which can be added other prognostic criteria:
      growth and doubling time of the serum PSA, number of positive biopsies and percentage of
      cancer lesions by biopsy.

      Functional imaging by PET and MRI is increasingly used in daily clinical practice to
      characterize prostate cancer, either during initial discovery or during recurrence. In this
      context, it is the qualitative visual analysis that is mainly used. Quantitative image
      analysis could add new criteria to guide patient management.

      Consequently, the objective of this study were:

        -  Optimization of 18F-choline PET/CT Acquisition in Prostate Cancer

        -  Comparison the quantitative parameters obtained by 18F-Choline PET / CT and both
           perfusion MRI and histological parameters.
