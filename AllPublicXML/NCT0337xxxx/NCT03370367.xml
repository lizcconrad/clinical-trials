  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial the investigators propose to utilize 13-cRA to prevent dysplastic changes and
      second malignancies in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck regions who
      have a high probability of cure from their primary cancer. Comparisons between patients
      treated by 13-cRA and patients receiving placebo will include:

        1. The time to diagnosis of second primary for the treatment versus control groups.

        2. Survival time for the treatment versus control groups.

        3. Secondarily, the cost-benefit ratio for 13-cRA will be analyzed by assessing the
           toxicities of 13-cis retinoic acid treated patients in comparison to those experienced
           by placebo treated patients.
