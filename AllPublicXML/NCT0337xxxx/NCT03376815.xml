  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to establish large tissue sections for 10 kinds of tumors. in order
      to observe the tumor landscape on microscope. The tumors including esophageal
      carcinoma,gastric carcinoma,hepatocellular carcinoma etc.200 cases of each tumor will be
      compared by traditional sample method and landscape sample method to testify the clinical
      value and significance of tumor landscape pathological diagnosis .
