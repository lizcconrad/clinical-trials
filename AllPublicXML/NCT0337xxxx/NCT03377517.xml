  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if a delivery of a single high dose of radiation therapy
      to a small area of the pituitary gland and pituitary stalk in a highly precise manner may be
      helpful in reducing intractable pain from bone metastases.

      Although not currently standard of care, small series suggest both safety and efficacy of
      radiosurgical hypophysectomy in reducing cancer pain from bone metastases. In spite of the
      demonstrated feasibility in meeting normal tissue constraints and preliminary data suggestive
      of both safety and efficacy, radiosurgical hypophysectomy is rarely performed in clinical
      practice, and many radiation oncologists are not even aware of its potential to reduce
      intractable cancer pain. This is likely because, to date, well-designed prospective studies
      have not been performed to further explore both the safety and efficacy of the intervention.
      This single arm pilot study is designed to fill that void. If successful, the investigators
      plan to utilize the data to support the proposal of a larger scale follow-up clinical trial.
