  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an experimental anti-cancer immunotherapy called NKR-2
      (modified T cells), to treat colorectal cancer with unresectable liver metastases. The trial
      will test three dose levels (dose escalation). At each dose, the patients will receive three
      successive hepatic transarterial administrations, two weeks apart, of NKR-2 cells. The study
      will enroll up to 18 patients.
