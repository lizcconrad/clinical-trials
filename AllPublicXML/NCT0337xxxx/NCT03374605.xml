  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral adaptation is particularly relevant to anxiety and related disorders, where
      exposure-based therapies rely on such adaptation as part of behavior therapy.. However, while
      initial fear reactions generalize easily across contexts, subsequent adaption of behavior
      through learning is context-specific. The primary goal of this study is to investigate
      whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to acutely impact
      generalization of subsequent learning across contexts in an experimental paradigm. As part of
      this study, participants will complete a clinical interview and questionnaires, as well as a
      computer task asking them to make choices between stimuli on the screen and during which they
      may or may not receive tDCS.
