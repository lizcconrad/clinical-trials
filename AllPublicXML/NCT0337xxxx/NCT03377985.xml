    <textblock>
      The current study focused on ultrasound guided brachial plexus block (BPB) which plays an
      important role in patients with hand trauma either in pain control or for surgical
      intervention. The brachial plexus can be blocked by several techniques but the most commonly
      used are the supraclavicular (SCB) and axillary (AXB) blocks. Aim of this study is to compare
      between the two techniques as regard performance time, needling time, anesthesia related
      time, block related complications, number of needle pass, and block related pain. 80 patients
      were allocated randomly into two equal groups, under ultrasound guidance the SCB and AXB were
      done for the two groups respectively. The needling time, performance time, anesthesia related
      time, onset time, number of 1st needle pass in each group and block related complications
      were noted.

    <description>Patients placed in the supine position with arm to be blocked abducted and externally rotated. After sterilization of the axilla ultrasound device with high frequency of 8-12 MHZ, linear transducer was put parallel to the anterior axillary fold at axilla to identify the axillary artery, lateral, medial and posterior cords of the brachial plexus in relation to the axillary artery. Lidocaine 1% was infiltrated subcutaneously 1 cm lateral to the probe, 7-10 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% was injected around each cord of the brachial plexus</description>

    <description>patients placed in the supine position with the head of the bed elevated 30 degrees and patient's head turned away from the side to be blocked after skin disinfection, ultrasound device was put transversely parallel to and above the middle third of the clavicle, the probe was tilted till identification of the subclavian artery, 1st rib, pleura and brachial plexus lateral to the subclavian artery and above the 1st rib. Lidocaine 1% was infiltrated subcutaneously 1 cm lateral to the lateral side of the probe. A needle was inserted in plane 1 cm lateral to the probe when adjacent to brachial plexus 25 ml of bubivacaine 0.5% was injected around the brachial plexus</description>
