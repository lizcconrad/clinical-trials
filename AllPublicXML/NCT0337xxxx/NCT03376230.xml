  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      multifactorial diseases leading to chronic inflammation of intestinal mucosa. Their etiology
      is still unknown. Recently, major advances in the understanding of their pathophysiology have
      allowed to define them as heterogenic polygenic diseases, occurring in genetically
      susceptible patients. However, the whole genetic susceptibility does not explain the
      development of IBD and several data argue in favor of the involvement of environmental
      factors, which remain to be identified.

      The aims of this clinical trial are:

        1. As main objective: To determine the effects of environmental pollutants on intestinal
           homeostasis and particularly on inflammatory process and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

        2. As secondary objective, to assess in human the genetic susceptibility of intestinal
           mucosa to environmental chemical compounds (I.e. xenobiotics), its interindividual
           variability, and its potential involvement in the pathogenesis of IBD.
