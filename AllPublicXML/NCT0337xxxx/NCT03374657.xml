  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CPK850 is a recombinant adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) vector containing the human RLBP1
      gene. The purpose of this first-in-human study is to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of CPK850 as determined by the single ascending dose ranging portion of the study. This study
      will also evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of CPK850 on improving visual function
      in patients with decreased visual function from RLBP1 retinitis pigmentosa due to biallelic
      mutations in the RLBP1 gene.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will potentially include 5 cohorts with a minimum of 3 patients per cohort, with
      an optional cohort of up to 6 patients. This trial design uses a staggered patient enrollment
      with continuous data reviews to limit as much unforeseen risk as possible prior to enrolling
      each patient in each cohort or initiating another cohort. Only one eye (designated as the
      study or treated eye) will be dosed per patient. Each patient will be followed for 5 years
      after the subretinal injection of CPK850.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a non-confirmatory, open-label single ascending dose gene replacement-therapy study to assess safety, tolerability and efficacy of CPK850 in patients with RLBP1 retinitis pigmentosa due to biallelic mutations in the RLBP1 gene.

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a partially masked study. The patients will not be masked. The treating physicians and personnel at the surgical location (surgeons, anesthesiologist, operating room personnel and others) will not be masked.
At the clinical sites, there will be an unmasked ophthalmologist. The remaining assessors at the clinical sites (ophthalmologist, study nurse, ophthalmic technician, etc) doing the ophthalmic examinations should be masked to the study (treated) eye.
The following unmasked sponsor roles are required for this study:
Sponsor clinical staff required to assist in the management and re-supply of investigational drug product.
The independent committee assessing unmasked interim results and the independent analysis team.
All other sponsor staff will stay masked to treatment assignments</masking_description>
