  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of repeat
      doses of BOS161721 (20 milligrams [mg], 60 mg, and 120 mg) administered subcutaneously in
      adult participants with moderately to severely active Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) on
      limited background standard of care treatment, in order to estimate the optimal dose.

      BOS161721 at the chosen dose will be compared to placebo for response on the SLE Responder
      Index 4, with sustained reduction of oral corticosteroids, in the same participant
      population.

    <measure>Phase 1: Incidence of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 270</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence experienced by a study participant, whether or not considered drug related by the principal investigator. AEs are unfavorable changes in a general condition, subjective or objective signs or symptoms, worsening of pre-existing concomitant disease, and clinically significant abnormality in laboratory parameters observed in a participant in the course of a clinical study. Non-serious Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) manifestations or abnormal laboratory results related to SLE disease activity will not be recorded as AEs unless they meet the definition of serious AEs (SAEs).</description>

    <measure>Phase 1: Number of participants with a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 270</time_frame>
    <description>For the purpose of dose escalation, pre-defined AEs occurring after study drug administration, which are attributable to the study drug, will be considered DLTs.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2: Number of participants who achieve treatment response as measured by the SLE Responder Index 4 (SRI-4) at Day 210, along with a sustained reduction of oral corticosteroid (≤ 10 milligrams [mg]/day and ≤ Day 0 dose) between Day 120 and Day 210</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 210</time_frame>
    <description>The SRI-4 is a composite index of SLE disease improvement that consists of scores derived from the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) and the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) 2004 Index. Each participant, after providing their Day 210 visit SRI-4 response, will be evaluated as either a responder or non-responder. Response based on the SRI-4 is defined by: 1) ≥ 4-point reduction in the SLEDAI-2K global score; 2) no new severe disease activity (BILAG A organ score) or more than 1 new moderate organ score (BILAG B); and 3) no deterioration from baseline in the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) by ≥ 0.3 points. The SRI-4 response in participants with moderate to severe SLE is associated with broad improvements in clinical and participant-reported outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Number of participants who achieve treatment response as measured by the SRI-5 and SRI-6 at Day 210, along with a sustained reduction of oral corticosteroid (≤ 10 mg/day and ≤ Day 0 dose) between Day 120 and Day 210</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 210</time_frame>
    <description>SRI-5 and SRI-6 are composite indices of SLE disease improvement that consist of scores derived from the SLEDAI-2K and the BILAG 2004 Index. The SRI-5 and SRI-6 are computed with a minimal three-point or five-point improvement in SLEDAI-2K being required, respectively.</description>

    <description>The BILAG-2004 index is an organ-specific 97-question assessment based on the principle of the doctor's intent to treat. Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease activity are recorded and based on the participant's condition in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 4 weeks. BILAG A is the score for severe arthritis manifested by observed active synovitis in ≥ 2 joints with marked loss of functional range of movements and significant impairment of basic activities of daily living that has been present on several days cumulatively over the past 4 weeks, including at the time of the screening visit.</description>

    <time_frame>up to Day 270</time_frame>
    <description>The BILAG-2004 index is an organ-specific 97-question assessment based on the principle of the doctor's intent to treat. Only clinical features attributable to SLE disease activity are recorded and based on the participant's condition in the last 4 weeks compared with the previous 4 weeks. BILAG B is the score for moderate arthritis, tendonitis or tenosynovitis in ≥ 1 joint, (observed or throughout history), with some loss of functional range of movements which lead to some loss of functional range of motion as manifested by effects on instrumental activities of daily living.</description>

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of

             inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  Investigational site staff members directly involved in the conduct of the trial and
             their family members, site staff members otherwise supervised by the investigator, or
