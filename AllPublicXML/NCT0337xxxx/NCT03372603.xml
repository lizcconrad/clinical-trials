  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2798745 is a potent and selective transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel
      blocker being investigated for the treatment of chronic cough. This is a multi-center,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period crossover study with a purpose to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of GSK2798745. Each subject will have 2 treatment periods, and
      will be randomized to one of the following treatments in each period: A) Placebo matching to
      GSK2798745 once daily for 7 days. B) 4.8 milligrams (mg) GSK2798745 on Day 1, followed by 2.4
      mg GSK2798745 once daily for 6 days. There will be a washout period of 14 to 21 days between
      the treatment periods. A maximum of 48 subjects will be enrolled in the study and the total
      duration of participation in the study will be maximum of 10 and a half weeks including
      follow-up visit.
