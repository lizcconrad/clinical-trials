  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2013, the National Guard reported a suicide rate that was substantially higher than both
      the general population and the active duty component of the United States military. The
      prototypical National Guard suicide decedent appears to be a young male firearm owner not
      currently deployed who dies using his own gun. Prior research within the military has
      revealed that soldiers are unlikely to seek out or engage in mental health services. In sum,
      current best practices in suicide risk assessment are poorly equipped to identify the
      individuals most likely to die by suicide. This study aims to examine the acceptability,
      feasibility, and utility of a single lethal means counseling session as part of a suicide
      prevention approach targeting demographic groups overrepresented in National Guard firearm
      suicides. 232 firearm-owning male National Guard personnel will be randomized to one of four
      conditions, each of which requires a single 15-25 minute session: (1) lethal means counseling
      (2) lethal means counseling plus the provision of free gun locks (3) health and stress
      control condition (4) health and stress control condition plus the provision of free gun
      locks. The investigators anticipate that those who receive lethal means counseling will
      subsequently store their personal firearms more safely and report being more willing to store
      their firearms away from the home during any hypothetical future suicidal crisis. The
      overarching goal of each hypothesis is to examine the extent to which gun owning young male
      National Guard personnel at varying levels of suicide risk are willing to engage in means
      safety.

      feasibility, and utility of a single lethal means counseling session as part of a suicide
      prevention approach targeting demographic groups overrepresented in National Guard firearm
      suicides. The study will utilize a 2x2 Factorial Design: Intervention (Lethal Means
      Counseling, Health and Stress Control) X Gun-Lock (Provided, Not Provided). Participants will
      be 232 firearm owning male National Guard personnel under the age of 30. Lethal Means
      Counseling comprises education on risk factors for suicide, information on preventative
      resources, and encouragement to store guns safely and to temporarily remove guns during high
      risk periods. The Health and Stress Program is designed to control for effects of general
      mental and physical health education in the active condition. Each condition utilizes a
      motivational interviewing framework. The overarching goal of each hypothesis is to examine
      the extent to which gun owning young male National Guard personnel at varying levels of
      suicide risk are willing to engage in safety planning and find means safety approaches
      acceptable

    <description>National Guard Personnel will receive a single 15-25 minute session of lethal means counseling. The session will focus on increasing the safety of current storage practices for personal firearms (e.g., storing unloaded in a secure location separate from ammunition) as well as planning to voluntarily and temporarily store firearms away from the home during any future hypothetical suicidal crisis. This intervention utilizes a motivational interviewing framework in an effort to remain sensitive to the views and culture of firearm owners.</description>
