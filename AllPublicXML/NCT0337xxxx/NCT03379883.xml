  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The social impact of degenerative diseases such as articular cartilage pathology and
      osteoarthritis (OA) is steadily increasing, because of the continued rise in the mean age of
      the active population. A variety of noninvasive solutions have been proposed for pain
      treatment, improvement in function and disability, and ultimately, modification of the course
      of severe cartilage lesions and OA, with variable success rates. Intra articular and
      genicular nerves radiofrequency (RF) is a minimally invasive technique that usually aims at
      the neuropathic pain. One important mechanism for the chronic pain mediated by OA is
      peripheral sensitization, which increases the transmission of pain signals. Through
      conduction block in pain-transmitting nerve fibers by thermal damage, RF could ease pain
      without destroying the antennal nerve. The role of growth factors (GFs) in chondral repair is
      now widely investigated in vitro and in vivo.

      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a simple, low cost, and minimally invasive method that allows
      one to obtain from the blood a natural concentrate of autologous GFs.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of intra articular Platelet Rich Plasma
      (PRP) injection versus combined ultrasound guided intra articular and genicular nerve pulsed
      radiofrequency on chronic knee pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

      The regeneration capacity of cartilage is limited because of its isolation from systemic
      regulation and its lack of vessels and nerve supply. Osteoarthritis (OA) has a major impact
      on functioning and independence and ranks among the top 10 causes of disability worldwide

    <description>The intensity of pain at rest will be measured with a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS-pain). (VAS) identifying 0 as no pain and 10 as worst imaginable pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knee function</measure>
    <time_frame>For 6 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective knee functionality will be evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMaster's Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index.WOMAC Index assesses disability in three subscales, including pain, severity of physical function and joint stiffness. This scale consists of 24 items: five items for pain assessment, two items for assessment of the severity of joint stiffness and 17 items for assessment of physical function. The patient answers the questions and then receives a cumulative score in each of the 3 areas (pain, 0-20; stiffness, 0-8; physical function, 0-68). Higher scores are representative of greater pain and stiffness as well as worsened physical capability.</description>
