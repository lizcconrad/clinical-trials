  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) is a regional block that anesthetizes the femoral,
      obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves around the hip. The purpose of this study is
      to determine whether FICB can reduce postoperative pain and increase progress with physical
      therapy after total hip arthroplasty (THA). This randomized, double-blind, clinical trial
      will randomize patients to receive either a FICB or placebo after THA. The primary outcomes
      will be pain scores reported by the patient post-operatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FICB is a regional block that anesthetizes the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral
      cutaneous nerves around the hip joint. There have been numerous study assessing it's ability
      to control pain in the pre and post operative period in patients with hip fractures. However,
      there is a limited amount of literature on its efficacy after total hip arthroplasty, and no
      data when a posterior surgical approach to the hip was utilized. Because regional blocks have
      been shown to decrease pain post operatively after total knee arthroplasty, we hypothesize
      that the FICB will decrease pain and narcotic use in patients after total hip arthroplasty.
      This study will aim to recruit 120 patients that will be randomized to receive a FICB or
      placebo in the recovery room within 30 minutes of leaving the OR. Once the intervention is
      complete we will collect data on the patients' pain levels, morphine equivalents of narcotic
      that they used, and how well they worked with physical therapy during their inpatient stay.
