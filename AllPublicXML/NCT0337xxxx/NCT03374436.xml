  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged sitting has been shown to impair metabolism and vascular function. The overall
      purpose of this study is to determine if breaking up prolonged (9 hours) of sitting with
      brief (~20 second) stair climbing exercise &quot;snacks&quot; can improve markers of metabolic control
      and vascular health in healthy young male participants. An additional purpose is to determine
      if saliva insulin can be used as a valid indicator of blood insulin when measured throughout
      the day in sedentary and active conditions and when diets with different amounts of
      carbohydrates are consumed.
