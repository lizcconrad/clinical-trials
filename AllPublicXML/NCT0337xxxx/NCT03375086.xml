  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation oncology study of APX3330 in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 (APE1/Ref-1) is a protein that regulates
      multiple transcription factors involved in cancer cell signaling and APX3330 is a highly
      selective inhibitor of APE1/Ref-1 redox function.

      The anti-tumor effect of APX330 has been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models and
      the human safety profile of APX3330 was established in prior clinical studies. Apexian
      Pharmaceuticals is developing APX3330 as an orally administered anti-cancer agent targeting
      the APE1/Ref-1 protein.

      APX_CLN_0011 is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation oncology study in
      patients with advanced solid tumors. The study primary objective is to determine the
      recommended Phase 2 study dose of APX3330. Secondary objectives include assessment of APX3330
      safety, anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.

    <description>APX3330 will be supplied as 60 and 120 mg orally administered tablets. Patients will receive a fixed dose of APX3330 twice daily (i.e., bid) each day of a 21-day cycle. The starting dose of APX3330 will be a daily dose of 240 mg (i.e., 120 mg/dose bid). Doses will be increased until identification of a maximum tolerated dose or bio-effective dose, whichever is lower.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent must be obtained from the patient.

          2. Patient must be &gt; 18 years of age.

          3. Patient must have recurrent or advanced cancer (i.e., solid tumors) for whom standard
             therapy offers no curative potential.

          4. Evaluable disease by RECIST v1.1.

          5. Performance status (PS) of 0-2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.
             Note: PS 2 patients can only participate if, in the assessment of the clinical
             investigator, and with the consent of the medical monitor, the patient has the ability
             to participate in the clinical study for a minimum of at least 2 cycles.

          6. &gt; 21 days from therapeutic radiation or chemotherapy (&gt;6 weeks from nitrosoureas and
             mitomycin C) and recovery to (NCI CTCAE v4.03) Grade ≤ 1 from all clinically
             significant toxicities related to prior therapies.

          7. Must have adequate organ function defined as:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L.

               2. Platelet ≥ 100 x 10^9/L.
