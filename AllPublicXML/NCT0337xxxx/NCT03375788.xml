  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common in individuals with obesity and is a
      significant threat to public health, because it can lead to impaired liver function and liver
      failure. Growth hormone is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland that helps regulate
      metabolism and growth. Individuals with obesity, on average, secrete less growth hormone than
      individuals without obesity. There are data to suggest that growth hormone may help to reduce
      the amount of fat in the liver, and may also reduce inflammation in the liver, both of which
      would be helpful to individuals with NAFLD. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      whether treatment with a drug called tesamorelin, which is a growth hormone releasing hormone
      analogue, will decrease liver fat and improve liver inflammation and scarring in obese
      individuals with NAFLD.

             performed within 12 months of the baseline visit, without &gt;10% reduction in body
             weight or addition of medications to treat fatty liver, or b) liver fat fraction ≥5%
