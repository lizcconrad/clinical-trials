    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the video-based rehabilitation
      program on pain, functionality and quality of life in the conservative treatment of partial
      tears of the rotator cuff whether it was as successful as the physiotherapist-supervised
      rehabilitation program.

    <textblock>
      In our study a common exercise program, which can be used in conservative treatment of a
      partial rotator cuff tear, is applied with two different methods; a video-based
      rehabilitation program and physiotherapist-supervised rehabilitation program. Video-based
      rehabilitation program was developed to investigate whether this program is effective on
      pain, functionality and quality of life and as successful as a physiotherapist-supervised
      rehabilitation program.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Shoulder Range of Motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Shoulder range of motion evaluation was performed first time at baseline and second time after 6 weeks rehabilitation program. After treatment &quot;change&quot; was assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>The shoulder flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation ROM were evaluated with goniometer while the patient was in supine position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation was performed before treatment and after 6 weeks rehabilitation program. Patients were asked to evaluate their pain status with a 10-point scale and high scores are positively correlated with pain.</time_frame>
    <description>The levels of pain felt at rest / activity / night were measured using visual analogue scale (VAS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ASES (The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment) Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation was performed before treatment and after 6 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>ASES is an assessment form prepared by shoulder and elbow surgeons with objective and subjective sections. The total score is at least 0 and at most 100, and the high scores are positively correlated with the normal function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation was performed before treatment and after 6 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>DASH questionnaire inquires about the activities of a person in daily life, the degree of participation in recreational activities, the symptom and psychosocial state that affects their pain, emotional state and sleep quality. The total score is at least 0 and at most 100, and the high scores are positively correlated with the increased functional impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form 12 (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation was performed before treatment and after 6 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 was used to assess physical and mental health-related quality of life. The total score is at least 0 and at most 100, and the high scores are positively correlated with high quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change (GRC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluation was performed after 6 weeks rehabilitation program.</time_frame>
    <description>Global Rating of Change (GRC) scale was used to assess the overall satisfaction levels of the patients. Patients were asked to evaluate their post-treatment status with a 5-point likert scale and high scores are positively correlated with satisfaction.</description>

    <description>In both groups, a program consisting of exercises used in conservative treatment of rotator cuff tears was performed. A video record was made by the physiotherapist to a patient where each exercise was described in detail and the patient correctly performed the exercises according to the verbal and visual commands of the physiotherapist. This video record watched by the patients who come to the clinic and patients were asked to do the exercises in the video. Patients did the exercises under control of the physiotherapist in the clinic.</description>
