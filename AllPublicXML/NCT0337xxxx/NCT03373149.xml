      In this study, the investigators will assess the efficacy of growth hormone co-stimulation to
      GnRH antagonist regimen in poor responders to COH for IVF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, a limited number of studies have been performed in order to assess whether the
      addition of GH can improve the probability of pregnancy in poor responders undergoing ovarian
      stimulation for IVF. Moreover, the existing studies are underpowered and, thus, inconclusive.

      In this study, the investigators will assess the efficacy of growth hormone co-stimulation to
      GnRH antagonist regimen in poor responders to COH for IVF.

    <description>Growth hormone (Somatropin, Sedico, Egypt) [4 IU/day] and highly purified urinary FSH (HPuFSH) (Fostimon,IBSA, Switzerland) [300 IU/day] will be started on cycle day 3 and will be continued until and including the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) administration. Starting from cycle day 8, the dose of HPuFSH will be adjusted individually according to ovarian response which will be monitored using transvaginal ultrasound and serum estradiol (E2).
GnRH antagonist (Cetrorelix acetate) (Cetrotide; Serono International S.A., Geneva, Switzerland) 0.25 mg S.C. once daily will be started when the leading follicle is 14 mm in mean diameter and will be continued until and including the day of HCG administration.</description>
