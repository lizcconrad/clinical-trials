  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of increasing amino acid and energy intake
      during parenteral and enteral nutrition with and without the stimulation of the infant's
      physical activity, on growth of extremely low birth weight infants .

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing protein and energy intake above the anabolic capacity of a given individual may
      result in increased lipogenesis and excessive fat deposition. Adults with reduced mobility or
      with neuromuscular conditions will develop excessive fat deposition if they receive normal to
      high protein and energy intakes. Excessive fat deposition have been demonstrated in preterm
      infants receiving high energy intakes. Given that physical activity in preterms is often
      reduced for the prematurity itself, the associated sickness and the numerous medications, the
      investigators speculate that physical stimulation may have a beneficial effect on protein
      accretion and on lean mass accretion. The investigators further hypothesize that today's
      recommended daily intakes of proteins and energy cannot be fully incorporated into lean body
      mass without a concomitant physical activity. In spite of the fact that this notion is well
      accepted in adult physiology and in the elderly, it has never been tested in preterm infants.

      This factorial randomised controlled trial will evaluate the effect of increasing amino acid
      intake (by 1 g/kg/d) and energy intake (by 20 kcal/kg/d) during parenteral nutrition and also
      of increasing protein intake and energy intake by an extra 1 g/kg/d during enteral nutrition,
      with and without the stimulation of the infant's physical activity, on growth of extremely
      low birth weight infants. The investigators aim at demonstrating that increasing energy and
      protein intake above the standard of care intakes will result in better growth only in
      association with adequate physical activity, in particular in relation to body composition
      and lean mass accretion.

    <description>Different levels of activity are assigned according to the Bruck's activity scale as described by Freymond et al. (24 hour continuous recording using a video camera). Levels of activity are defined as follows: 0, no body, arm, or leg movement, facial movement present or not with eyes closed or open; 1, arm or leg movement with eyes closed or open; 2, total body movement with eyes closed or open; 3, crying. Levels of activity in each group are expressed as percentage of time spent during the day in each level.</description>
