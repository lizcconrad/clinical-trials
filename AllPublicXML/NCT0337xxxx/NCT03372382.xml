      Postpartum patients delivered by cesarean section will be randomized to NSAIDS Vs NSAIDS plus
      opioid

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women will be approached priors to discharge from the hospital, if they meet inclusion
      criteria and consent for the study, they will be randomized to one of two possible analgesic
      regimens. They will be followed at 1-2 weeks and 4-6 weeks after discharge to assess pain
      level.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>pain level</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>pain level measured by objective and subjective scales.
Objective scale: visual analogue pain score (VAS). It is a 10 cm line, patients will be instructed to mark a point in the line that represents their pain level. A point towards the left will mean &quot;less pain&quot; and a point towards the right will mean &quot;more pain&quot;. After the patient makes a selection, the research team will measure where the selected point is (in cm). minimum measurement =0cm = no pain. maximum measurement=10cm=worst pain
subjective scale: wong baker faces pain scale, patients will me allowed to choose from numerical values paired with face values. A score of 10 or saddest face is the worst, a score of 0 or happiest face is the best.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>patient satisfaction as measured by previously described scale. Our research team previously completed a prospective data collection on postpartum patient satisfaction using the best scale : 1(very dissatisfied) 2(somewhat dissatisfied) 3(neutral) 4(satisfied) 5(very dissatisfied)</description>
