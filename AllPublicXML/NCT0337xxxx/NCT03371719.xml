  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radiation therapy with or without apalutamide works in
      treating patients with stage III-IV prostate cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-ray
      to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Androgen can cause the growth of prostate cancer
      cells. Drugs, such as apalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgen made by the body. Giving
      radiation therapy and apalutamide may work better at treating prostate cancer than radiation
      alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether, in men with post-prostatectomy PSA recurrences, salvage radiation
      (SRT) with enhanced anti-androgen therapy with apalutamide will improve biochemical
      progression-free survival (bPFS) compared to SRT alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether molecular stratification by the PAM50 gene expression clustering will
      identify subsets of prostate cancer (luminal A or basal, luminal B) which derive the greatest
      benefit from anti-androgen therapy.

      II. To assess overall survival. III. To assess cancer-specific mortality. IV. To assess
      metastasis-free survival. V. To assess distant metastasis. VI. To assess local-regional
      progression. VII. To assess PSA nadir during first year of treatment and prior to initiation
      of any hormonal salvage therapy.

      VIII. To assess initiation of salvage hormonal therapy. IX. To assess PSA with a non-castrate
      testosterone at 1 and 3 years post randomization: PSA &lt; 0.1 ng/ml and testosterone &gt;= 50
      ng/dl.

      X. To assess acute and late physician-reported morbidity (per the Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 4) after SRT +/- apalutamide.

      XI. To assess acute and late patient-reported morbidity (per the patient reported outcomes
      [PRO]-CTCAE) after SRT +/- apalutamide.

      XII. To assess testosterone levels at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 36 months post randomization.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM 1: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy on Day 1 for 7.5 weeks. Beginning on
      Day 1 of radiation therapy, patients receive placebo orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days
      1-30. Treatment repeats every 30 days for up to 6 courses (6 months) in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy on Day 1 for 7.5 weeks. Beginning on
      Day 1 of radiation therapy, patients receive apalutamide PO QD on Days 1-30. Treatment
      repeats every 30 days for up to 6 courses (6 months) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly thereafter.

    <time_frame>From randomization to the first occurrence of a rise in PSA, clinical or radiographic local, regional, or distant metastases, or death from any cause, assessed up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>bPFS curves will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier (1958) method and compared between the two treatment arms using a one-sided logrank test at the alpha = 0.12 significance level. Analysis will include evaluation of a potential predictive biomarker (molecular subtype) to inform the design of a subsequent, phase III clinical trial. In addition, a multivariable Cox (1972) regression model will be fit incorporating the three stratification factors used in the randomization (surgical margins, pre-salvage radiation (SRT) PSA, and molecular subtype) as covariates to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) between the two treatment groups. Additional regression models will be fit including other pretreatment characteristics as covariates.</description>

             prostatectomy must have been performed within 10 years prior to Step 1 registration
             and any type of radical prostatectomy is permitted, including retropubic, perineal,

             study entry (within 90 days of Step 1 registration) and at least one of the following:

               -  Gleason score 7-10 (International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade
                  group 2 to 5)

               -  ISUP grade group:

                    -  Grade Group 1: Gleason score ≤ 6,

                    -  Grade Group 2: Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7,

                    -  Grade Group 3: Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7,

                    -  Grade Group 4: Gleason score 8,

                    -  Grade Group 5: Gleason scores 9 and 10

          -  pN0 or pNx

          -  History/physical examination within 90 days prior to Step 1 registration

          -  Karnofsky performance status of 70-100 within 90 days prior to Step 1 registration

             days prior to Step 1 registration and given for ≤ 90 days duration

               -  For example: patients on prior LHRH analogs (post-prostatectomy), the
                  discontinuation date should be calculated based on the expected duration of the
                  sustained release injection, not simply the injection date of the drug; for
                  instance, if a 22.5 mg sustained release dose of leuprolide acetate is given (3
                  month duration), then the expected duration of such a dose would be 90 days after
                  the injection date; for a 7.5 mg leuprolide (1 month duration), the
                  discontinuation date would be 30 days after the injection date

               -  Please note: finasteride or dutasteride must be stopped before treatment starts

             effective method of birth control if he is having sex with a woman of childbearing
             potential or agree to use a condom if he is having sex with a woman who is pregnant
             while on study drug and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug

          -  The patient must agree not to donate sperm during the study treatment and for 3 months
