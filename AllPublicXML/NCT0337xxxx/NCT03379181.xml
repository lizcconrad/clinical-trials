    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the HEAT study is to determine the acute effect of propranolol on
      energy expenditure in patients suffering from hyperthyroidism and to evaluate the
      consequences of the change of hyper- to euthyroidism on metabolism during the course of
      treatment, especially with regard to the reaction to cold ambient temperatures.
