  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator assisted individuals (VAIs) living at home are frail and generally cannot perform
      most daily activities. Although these individuals prefer to live at home, the family members
      who care for them often experience stress and poor health. Peer support can mitigate health
      declines by decreasing caregivers' isolation/stress and increasing their sense of control.
      However, no peer support programs are designed to meet these caregivers' complex and unique
      needs. Online support delivery is especially beneficial for caregivers given the geographic
      and time limitations they face. The proposed research aims to develop and conduct an RCT of
      online peer support program for VAI caregivers. A group of caregivers will be trained to act
      as peer mentors. This training program will be evaluated for its impact on caregivers'
      mentoring abilities. At the end of the 12-week program, caregiving participants will be asked
      about the online delivery of the program, how helpful/satisfactory it was, and if it affected
      their health and well-being. The health outcomes of the control and intervention group will
      be compared. This peer support program can improve the well-being of caregivers and allow
      them to better care for their family members.

    <description>The online peer support program will entail: 1) Informational links; 2) A discussion forum (open to all participants and allowing for asynchronous contact between caregivers &amp; peer mentors); 3) A weekly live chat; 4) Private messaging (audio, video, and text options); and 5) &quot;Ask-a-mentor&quot; (A short video/blurb profiling each caregiving mentor will be posted including details such as gender, age, duration of care, relationship to care-recipient, and illness that care-recipient suffers from). Caregiving participants can then self-match to a peer mentor they feel is best-positioned to address their support needs.</description>
