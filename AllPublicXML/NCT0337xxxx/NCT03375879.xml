      This study is being conducted to determine whether the use of bandage contact lens after
      ptosis surgery provides any benefits for the patient or is unnecessary. The investigators
      hope to show through questionnaires based on the patient's experience after their surgery to
      see if the bandage contact lens has provided any benefit for the patient. This is a
      randomized control trial in which patients undergoing bilateral ptosis surgery (Fasanella
      servat procedure) will have one of their eyes randomized to receive a bandage contact lens
      after surgery while the other eye will not receive anything.In this randomized control trial,
      patients requiring surgery with bilateral ptosis will have one eye randomized to receive a
      bandage contact lens whereas the other eye will not after their surgery. Follow up will occur
      in one week where the outcomes will be obtained through questionnaires.

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators will place a contact lens on both eyes and immediately take it off from one (this will be the sham lens eye). Randomization of the lens placement will be determined by a flip of a coin (heads - keep lens on right eye. Tails - keep lens on left eye). Investigator will randomly generate for each patient whether the contact lens will be kept on right or left eye, sham contact lens will be placed on other eye, placing it and immediately removing it. Therefore, the patient will not know which eye has a lens.</intervention_model_description>
