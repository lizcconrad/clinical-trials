  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to conduct a double-blinded single-centre randomized controlled clinical trial of
      application of topical dose of tranexamic acid (TA) versus the usual intravenous TA in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the Hamilton General Hospital. This pilot study will
      assess the feasibility to perform a large randomized international trial exploring this
      objective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative bleeding related to open cardiac surgery increases the rates of complications
      and mortality. It results from the blood thinners that are needed for use. Intravenous
      tranexamic acid (TA) has become a mainstay in cardiac surgical procedures for decreasing
      bleeding and minimizing transfusion requirements. Although intravenous TA is usually well
      tolerated, there is a well-known risk (1 to 4%) of postoperative seizures. This is due to the
      similarity between TA and the brain tissues. The aim is to eliminate the risk of seizures but
      to maintain the protection against bleeding. When TA is used directly on the tissues
      (topically) for other type of surgeries (joints), TA is effective to reduce blood loss and
      transfusions. The aim is to prove that direct application of TA on the heart can eliminate
      postoperative seizures and reduce the amount of blood transfusions in patients who have
      cardiac surgery.

    <masking_description>The pharmacy will prepare 1 syringe of 50 ml of topical TA (5 g) or placebo. They will also prepare for the same patient 2 syringes of 50 ml (5 g) for intravenous (i.v.) injection or placebo. TA is similar in all aspects to normal saline. Blinding of both teams will be easy. The syringes will be prepared and randomized in pharmacy before the surgery.</masking_description>
