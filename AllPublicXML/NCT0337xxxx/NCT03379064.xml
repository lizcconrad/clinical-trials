  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional bowel disorder routinely
      encountered by healthcare providers although it's not life-threatening, this chronic disorder
      has ability to reduce patients' quality of life and imposes a significant economic burden to
      the healthcare system.Despite the high prevalence of IBS and its association with disability
      and adverse effect on health related quality of life we are not aware of any published trial
      of psychological intervention for IBS from Pakistan. We aim to test the feasibility and
      acceptability of culturally adapted Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for the management of
      IBS in Karachi, Pakistan compared to treatment as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A systematic review suggested no overall difference in the rates of IBS in East and West . In
      a population based study from Pakistan. Prevalence of IBS was assessed using Rome II criteria
      in relation to psychological distress, disability and life events in men and women
      separately. The prevalence of Rome II IBS was 13.3% which was higher than most
      population-based studies in Asia using Rome II criteria and similar to reports from Turkey
      and Malaysia.The findings also suggest equal sex ratio of IBS in urban Pakistan which may be
      because of the close association between marked distress and IBS in men similar to that found
      in women in the west.The results indicated that diarrhea-predominant IBS was associated with
      less disability compared to the constipation-predominant IBS which was associated with marked
      disability. This might be explained by the explanatory models; constipation is considered
      harmful as toxins or other harmful substances are retained within the body whereas diarrhea
      is not considered harmful as any toxins etc are removed from the body. Distress and life
      events contributed independently to high disability. In psychological treatments there is an
      assumption that there are some critical features which need to be addressed in the treatment
      process such as stress and anxiety; it also suggests that stress has a major role in
      increasing IBS symptoms as well as stress reactivity which results in IBS symptoms. The goal
      of cognitive-behavioral treatments is to increase awareness regarding the association between
      stress, thoughts, and IBS symptoms, it is important to identify and modify cognitive
      appraisals and to change depressive and/or anxiety-based schema. These interventions play a
      major role in decreasing IBS symptoms severity and associated anxiety and depression when
      compared to no treatment or standard medical care.

    <measure>IBS-symptom severity scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change to baseline at 3rd Month</time_frame>
    <description>The score of this system is based on five items (severity and duration of pain, abdominal distension, bowel satisfaction, and interference with life in general) and uses visual analogue scales. Patients can be categorized as having mild (75-175), moderate (175-300), or severe (&gt;300) IBS.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; 3rd Month</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS-Qol is a 34-item measure of the degree to which IBS symptoms affect lives (5-point scale) The individual responses to the 34 items are summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS specific quality of life. There are also eight subscale scores for the IBS-QOL (Dysphoria, Interference with Activity, Body Image, Health Worry, Food Avoidance, Social Reaction, Sexual, Relationships).</description>

    <measure>IBS pain scale-Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; 3rd Month</time_frame>
    <description>This 16-item measure will be used to assess pain awareness on a 0-5 point scale, tapping into constructs of awareness, vigilance, preoccupation, and observation of pain. Participants will rate a number of statements from 0 (Never) to 5 (Always) such as; I keep track of my pain level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Disability Questionnaire (BDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline &amp; 3rd Month</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be assessed using the cross-culturally validated BDQ, which includes 6 items from the SF-36, asking subjects whether they had been limited in various everyday activities during the last month and four ques-tions concerning daily functioning. Total scores across items 1-6 are considered to indicate 'moderate' and 'severe' disability for score ranges 8-13 and 14-22 respectively. Additionally, participants were asked to estimate how many days over the prior few weeks they were unable to carry out their usual daily activities thus providing an estimate of 'functional disability'.</description>

    <measure>Global Improvement Scale (GIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3rd month</time_frame>
    <description>Global Improvement will be assessed with the Global Improvement Scale (GIS).This scale asks participants &quot;Compared to the way you felt before you entered the study, have your IBS symptoms over the past 7 days been from (1) = substantially worse, to (7) = substantially improved. Global improvement is noted for patients endorsing moderately or substantially improved status.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 3rd month</time_frame>
    <description>It is a generic measure in which health status is defined in terms of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.Each dimension has three qualifying levels of response roughly corresponding to 'no problems', 'some difficulties/problems', and 'extreme difficulties. The scale has been already used in Pakistan.</description>

It is a short structured diagnostic interview, for DSM-IV and ICD- 10 psychiatric disorders. With an administration time of approximately 15 minutes, it was designed to meet the need for a short but accurate structured psychiatric interview for multicenter clinical trials and epidemiology studies and to be used as a first step in outcome tracking in non research clinical settings.</description>
