    <textblock>
      The study employs an interventional, prospective, single arm, open label, global,
      multicenter,non-randomized trial design to monitor and assess the safety profile of the
      crushed deferasirox FCT in pediatric patients between age ≥2 to &lt;6 with transfusional
      hemosiderosis over 24 weeks. This study will aim to enroll at least 40 patients.

      -  The study will include a screening period (from Day 0-14) with two visits at least 7
           days apart to assess eligibility of patients that are chelation naïve or on a prior iron
           chelator treatment other than DFX. For Patients on DFX treatment prior to study entry
           only one screening visit (screening visit 1) will occur to determine eligibility. Any
           current chelation therapy except deferasirox will be discontinued to undergo a 5-day
           washout period prior to commencing a 24 week treatment period with crushed deferasirox
           FCT.

        -  All patients will have weekly visits for the first month to monitor renal function.
           Hepaticfunction will be assessed biweekly during the first month. Thereafter, monthly
           safety assessments will be performed, including the monitoring of serum ferritin values
           and trends in order to adapt patient treatment.

      Eligibility, application of dosing standards and adjustments, as well as safety and serum
      ferritin assessments as specified in the protocol, will occur in accordance with the EU label
      throughout the study.

      - Patients will continue therapy up to 24 weeks.

             exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

         17. Significant medical condition interfering with the ability to partake in this study
             (e.g.

             uncontrolled hypertension, unstable cardiac disease not controlled by standard medical
             therapy, systemic disease: cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.).
