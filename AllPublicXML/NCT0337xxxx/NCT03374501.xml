      This study was a partly controlled laboratory-based study comparing the glycemic and
      insulinemic indices of 3 test meals containing soft drink alone or with SUGARDOWN™
      (Galactomannan) in overweight adults.

      STUDY SUMMARY This study was a partly controlled, laboratory-based study comparing the
      short-term postprandial glucose and insulin responses produced by three test meals containing
      soft drink consumed alone or with SUGARDOWN™, relative to the responses produced by an
      equal-carbohydrate portion of glucose solution (the reference food). The study used a
      repeated measures design, such that every subject consumed the reference food and each test
      food on two separate occasions, completing a total of eight separate test sessions. Each
      subject completed their test sessions on separate weekday mornings at a similar time each
      day, as close as possible to the time they would normally eat breakfast.

      SUBJECTS Ten healthy, non-smoking, overweight or obese subjects (6 females and 4 males)
      voluntarily participated in this study. The mean ± SD age of the subjects was 32.4 ± 10.9 yr
      (range: 18.7 - 55.6 yr), and their mean ± body mass index value was 27.4 ± 2.6 kg/m2 (range:
      25.3 - 32.3 kg/m2).

      Volunteers were given detailed written and verbal information about all of the study's
      inclusion criteria and experimental procedures. If the volunteers decided that they would
      like to participate in the study, they were asked to come to the research centre on another
      morning, where they completed a detailed screening questionnaire that assessed their current
      health status and medical history. In order to participate in the study, the volunteers had
      to meet the inclusion criteria. All suitable volunteers that were invited to participate in
      the study were required to sign a detailed subject information sheet and a consent form
      before commencing any experimental procedures.
