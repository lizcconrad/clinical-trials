  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to find out whether the intubation success rates of
      Kingvision video laryngoscope is better than that of the conventional laryngoscopes in
      children &lt; 1 year of age?

    <textblock>
      Securing the airway by tracheal intubation is one of the most critical steps during
      administration of general anesthesia to infants. Failure or a delay in tracheal intubation
      leads to severe hypoxic insult to infants as the oxygen consumption is high in them when
      compared to adults.Smaller caliber of the pediatric airway, relatively large tongue,
      anteriorly located larynx, floppy and relatively large epiglottis predispose young children
      to airway obstruction during Anaesthesia. In addition, the large occiput of the infant places
      the head and neck in the flexed position when the patient is placed recumbent, further
      exacerbating airway obstruction

      Direct laryngoscopy requires a direct line of sight for proper glottis visualization which is
      achieved by proper alignment of airway axes (oral-pharyngeal-laryngeal). These manipulations
      can lead to significant hemodynamic disturbance, cervical instability, injury to oral and
      pharyngeal tissues and dental damage. In contrast to direct laryngoscopy, video laryngoscope
      utilizes indirect laryngoscopy via its camera and helps improve glottic visualization,
      thereby minimizing complications

      New age videolaryngoscopes with their unique design provide better glottis visualization
      without the requirement of proper alignment of oral-pharyngeal-laryngeal axes, thereby
      minimizing the complications associated with excessive manipulation and hence provide a
      decent edge over the conventional indirect laryngoscopes routinely used. With the above
      mentioned advantages these videolaryngoscopes can be efficiently used in both elective as
      well as emergencysettings in infants for intubation The investigators in this study will be
      evaluating the efficacy of King vision video laryngoscope when compared to the conventional
      laryngoscopes in routine use for infants.

    <time_frame>0 - 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of first attempt intubation success rate of King vision videolaryngoscope and the Macintosh laryngoscope in children &lt; 1 year. A total of two laryngoscopy attempts each lasting not more than 60 secs will be allowed. Inability to secure the airway by means of successful orotracheal intubation within the 2 attempts will be taken as a failure. Success rates of both the devices will be compared in the study.</description>

    <measure>Cormack-Lehane grading (CL grade)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of Cormack-Lehane grading using King vision and Macintosh laryngoscope. CL grading is a 4 point grading system used to classify the glottic view obtained while performing laryngoscopy (CL 1,2,3,4). A better CL grade obtained is associated with a higher success rate. CL grade obtained with both the devices will be compared in the study.</description>
