  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase IIa/IIb dose ranging study is to generate human data in the
      intended patient population with IgAN to establish clinical proof-of-concept and to evaluate
      dose responses to support dose selection for subsequent clinical development of LNP023 for
      IgAN and potentially other indications

    <intervention_model_description>The primary variable is the change from baseline of log transformed UPCR derived from the 24h urine collections at baseline and day 90.
An interim analysis will be performed once the last patient has completed treatment in Part 1. The intention of this analysis is to provide preliminary evidence of dose-response relationship for proteinuria, to determine the sample size for Part 2, and to determine the treatment arms to be studied in Part 2.</intervention_model_description>

             in case of participation in the study. The Investigator should make this determination
             in consideration of the subject's medical history and/or clinical or laboratory
             evidence of any of the following:

                  disorder other than IgNA that is associated with hematuria at screening and
                  before dosing; [If necessary, laboratory testing may be repeated on one occasion
                  (as soon as possible) prior to randomization, to rule out any laboratory error]

          7. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.

          8. A history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, or any of the following ECG
             abnormalities at screening or baseline:

               -  PR &gt; 200 msec

               -  QRS complex &gt; 120 msec

                  Pointes

               -  Use of agents known to prolong the QT interval unless they can be permanently
                  discontinued for the duration of the study

         10. Plasma donation (&gt; 200mL) within 30 days prior to first dosing.

         11. Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within eight (8) weeks prior to initial
             dosing, or longer if required by local regulation

         12. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 1 week after stopping of investigational drug. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence from heterosexual intercourse (when this is in line with the
                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g.,
                  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
                  not acceptable methods of contraception.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking investigational drug. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment.

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  subject.

               -  Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods
                  of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine
                  system (IUS) or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable
                  efficacy (failure &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                  contraception In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable
                  on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking investigational drug.

             If local regulations deviate from the contraception methods listed above and require
             more extensive measures to prevent pregnancy, local regulations apply and will be
             described in the ICF.

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she
             considered not of child bearing potential.

         13. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell carcinoma
             of the skin or in-situ cervical cancer), treated or untreated, within the past 5
             years, regardless of whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases

         14. History of any porphyria metabolic disorder

         15. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing, or evidence of
             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during screening and
             baseline.

         16. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study treatments or excipients or to drugs
             of similar chemical classes
