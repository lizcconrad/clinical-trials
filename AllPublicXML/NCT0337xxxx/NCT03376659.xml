    <textblock>
      This is a dual arm, open label phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity
      of the combination of durvalumab with CV301 in combination with maintenance chemotherapy for
      patients with metastatic colorectal or pancreatic cancer whose disease is stable on, or
      responding to 1st line therapy for metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic colorectal or
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma who still have an adequate performance status and normal hepatic
      and renal function will be eligible.
