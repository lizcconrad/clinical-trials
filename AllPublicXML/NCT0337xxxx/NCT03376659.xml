    <textblock>
      This is a dual arm, open label phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity
      of the combination of durvalumab with CV301 in combination with maintenance chemotherapy for
      patients with metastatic colorectal or pancreatic cancer whose disease is stable on, or
      responding to 1st line therapy for metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic colorectal or
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma who still have an adequate performance status and normal hepatic
      and renal function will be eligible.

             scan as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          2. Stable on, or responding to 1st line therapy for metastatic disease

               1. At least 8 and not more than 16 weeks after initiating 1st line therapy for

             completion of adjuvant therapy and the start of first line therapy

          4. Disease that is amenable to serial biopsies

          5. ECOG performance status 0-1

          6. Age &gt;= 18 years

          7. Blood pressure &lt;160/100 mmHg

          8. Adequate hepatic, bone marrow, and renal function:

               1. Bone Marrow: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3; Platelets ≥

                  creatinine levels above institutional normal. Creatinine clearance should be
                  determined by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (below) or by 24-hour urine collection
                  for determination of creatinine clearance:

             between warfarin and capecitabine, alternate anticoagulation should be considered.
