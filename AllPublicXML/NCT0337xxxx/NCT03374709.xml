  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the affect Oxtellar XR (Extended Release) has on neurology patients with
      trigeminal neuralgia (TN), and if it impacts their quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxcarbazepine has been used off-label for TN for many years, but has a twice daily dosing.
      With the once daily dosing it should theoretically help with patient adherence and possibly
      decrease side effects, which is common with extended release formulations. Specifically the
      investigators are looking at how well tolerated Oxtellar XR is, and if it has the same
      efficacy as standard treatments. It is a pilot study, so it will be difficult to gather data
      and have powerful outcomes, but this will give pilot data for future trials. Patients will be
      screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria and after will participate in 3 visits
      following the initial one. Various tests will be administered to measure treatment
      satisfaction and tolerability throughout the visits. The patients will not have to pay for
      any of the study visits or medications. A parking voucher will be provided as needed.
