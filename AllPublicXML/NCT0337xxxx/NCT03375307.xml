  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib works in treating patients with urothelial
      cancer with DNA-repair defects that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot
      be cured or controlled with treatment. Olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of olaparib in two cohorts of patients with metastatic/advanced
      urothelial carcinoma (UC) pre-selected by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair defects as
      measured by overall response rate (ORR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the effect of therapy on progression free survival (PFS). II. To describe the
      effect of therapy on overall survival (OS). III. To describe the safety/tolerability and
      drug-related toxicities of olaparib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients with DNA-repair pathway-mutated genes in
      metastatic UC (patient cohort referred for screening).

      II. To explore tumor-mutational profiles in metastatic tumor biopsies, saliva &quot;normal&quot; DNA,
      changes in tumor or peripheral immune characteristics, or tumor associated somatic mutation
      load in blood DNA in response to treatment.

      III. To explore changes in plasma cytokines and correlate with clinical response.

      IV. To correlate levels of circulating endothelial cells with clinical outcome. V. To
      correlate levels of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with clinical outcome. VI. To correlate
      peripheral immune and DNA damage response transcriptional signatures with clinical outcomes.

      VII. To determine the effectiveness of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify
      DNA-repair pathway gene defects in tumor samples and circulating DNA and identify patients
      with UC suitable for PARP inhibition.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for
      1 year, and annually thereafter.
