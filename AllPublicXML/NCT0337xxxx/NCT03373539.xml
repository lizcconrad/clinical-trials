      Important developmental processes continue until the completion of 40 weeks gestation. Even
      during fetal life, intrinsic and environmental factors determine the balance between health
      and the onset and development of diseases. Thus, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms
      that regulate normal development and the pathways that contribute to disease pathogenesis.

      Neurotrophins are a family of four proteins that support the growth and survival of neurons.
      Their secretion increases during brain development, when new neurons are being formed and
      existing ones are branching to assemble complex neuronal circuits. In addition to their role
      in promoting neuron growth and development, neurotrophins are also a product of neuronal
      activity. Neurotrophins are also responsible for the maintenance of peripheral sensory
      neurons, including those in the lungs. Airway innervation is responsible for many aspects of
      lung function including the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone, mucus secretion, and
      reactivity; therefore, a physiological expression of neurotrophins in the lungs is required
      for normal lung function.

      Currently, there is no reliable method to identify infants who will have poor
      neurodevelopmental and respiratory outcomes. The ability to make such predictions would be
      beneficial for both making care decisions in the neonatal intensive care unit and for
      identifying infants who require earlier and more intense intervention. We intend to determine
      if neurotrophins can be utilized to predict an infant's long-term outcomes. Neurotrophins are
      a family of four proteins that support the growth and survival of neurons. Their levels have
      been shown to increase with brain development and decrease with brain injury. Neurotrophins
      have also been associated with development of airway injury in the neonate and later
      respiratory disease such as asthma. We plan to correlate serum neurotrophin levels with
      respiratory outcomes and neurological outcomes.
