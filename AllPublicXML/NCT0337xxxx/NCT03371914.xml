  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to measure the costs associated with HIV prevention service delivery to
      female sex workers (FSW) in Nigeria, as well as examine the relationship between management
      practices at the community-based organizations (CBOs) and costs. To complete these goals, the
      study will collect both retrospective and prospective data from CBOs and from centralized
      information from study partners (Society for Family Health, SFH). In the prospective section
      of the study, CBOs will be sampled and assigned to either treatment or control groups. Data
      collected at the CBOs will be aggregated by the CBO managers, and those in the treatment
      group will receive feedback on their performance on a monthly basis. Those in the treatment
      group will additionally receive a management training to guide their management practices.
      Researchers hypothesize that there will be improvements in management indicators and
      therefore decreases in costs at CBOs in the treatment group. Results will be disseminated to
      local, national, and international stakeholders.

    <description>The treatment group in the study will receive a 5-day training. The first two days of the training will consist of introducing the data collection tools and collecting baseline data. Days three through five of the training will consist of a variety of management topics.
On a monthly basis, the treatment group will receive data visualizations that will compare their site's performance that month to pervious performance and to other sites in the study. Both treatment and control groups will collect information regarding input costs and number of services provided on a monthly basis.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive only a 2-day training which will focus on data collection alone. Both treatment and control groups will collect information regarding input costs and number of services provided on a monthly basis.</description>

    <description>The management training will consist of a variety of management topics, such as financial, workplace and staff management. The training will include a number of tools that the managers will be expected to bring back with them and use regularly at their site. There will be monthly refresher trainings for the managers via an online platform, where participants will interact about the topics covered in the training and others relevant to their work as managers. Participants will also receive monthly visualizations that compare the data that they enter via tablet monthly to both (1) their baseline data, and (2) to other sites' data. Outcomes that will be measured and reported back to sites include cost per client tested, number of condoms distributed, and number of FSW reached by educational interventions.</description>
