  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major limitation of liver transplantation is organ shortage. To avoid exposing patients to
      death on the waiting list, organs are used that would have been discarded few years ago.
      Graft allocation is regulated by the &quot;agence de biomedecine&quot; which establishes a national
      score. Each liver graft is proposed to the patient presenting the higher score. Acceptance or
      rejection of the graft only depends on the decision of each centre. We propose to submit a
      more efficient allocation model (enabling each proposed liver graft to be transplanted in the
      candidate whose transplantation will afford the greatest survival benefit after
      registration), by collecting and analysing variables from donors and candidates/recipients.
