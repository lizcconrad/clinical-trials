  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes patients with relapsed acute leukemia who have previously been treated
      with standard treatment that is still present and there is no curative treatment option
      available. Researchers are studying whether the drug Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin, followed by an
      infusion of blood cells called leukocytes from a donor, can stimulate the immune system to
      potentially fight the leukemia. Gemtuzmab ozogamicin is a class of drugs known as an antibody
      drug conjugate. The drug is given on days 1,4,7. It is infused, attaches to cells with a
      certain marker on the surface (the majority of which would be leukemia cells). The drug is
      then internalized and the chemotherapy drug becomes activated. Gemtuzumab is currently FDA
      approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

      The infusion of leukocytes to stimulate the immune system to fight your leukemia is
      investigational and has not been proven to cure cancer. This combination of Gemtuzumab
      Ozogamicin and donor leukocytes is not an FDA approved treatment and is investigational.

      Initially a total of 6 patients will be included in the study to assess the safety of the
      treatment. Once 6 patients have been treated and no unacceptable toxicities are seen, more
      patients will be enrolled. The study will treat up to 18 patients on the study.
