  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric flexible flatfoot is sometimes asymptomatic but it can also cause physical
      impairment, pain, and difficulty walking. We evaluate the radiographic effectiveness of
      intervention of subtalar arthroereisis with endorthesis for pediatric flexible flatfoot with
      final follow-up at skeletal maturity.

    <description>American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot scale. It is a measure of ankle and hidfoot function. It comprises nine questions and covers three categories: pain (40 points), function (50 points) and alignment (10 points). These are all summed together for a maximun score of 100 points (best otucome) and a minimum score of 0 (worst outcome). It includes a mixture of questions that are both subjective and objective in nature.</description>
