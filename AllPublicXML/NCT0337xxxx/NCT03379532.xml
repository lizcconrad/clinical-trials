  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients with severe upper limb movement deficits have limited treatment options and
      often remain severely handicapped at the chronic stage.

      Recent findings have suggested that poor motor recovery can be due to severe damage of the
      cortico-spinal tract (CST), the neural fibres connecting the movement regions of the brain to
      the spinal cord. Hence, to improve recovery of upper limb movements it will be crucial to
      re-establish and strengthen CST projections.

      Recent studies provided evidence that closed-loop brain computer interface-driven electrical
      stimulation of the paretic muscles can induce clinically important and lasting recovery of
      upper limb function, even in patients with chronic, severe motor affection. In this treatment
      approach, movement intentions of the patients are detected with electroencephalography and
      real-time analyses. This triggers an electrical stimulation of affected upper limb muscles.

      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)
      applied contingent to voluntary activation of primary motor cortex, as detected by a
      brain-computer interface (BCI), can help restore CST projections. This might improve recovery
      of patients with severe upper limb movement deficits. Treatment will be started within the
      first 8 weeks after stroke onset.
