      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well topical keratin works in treating
      radiation dermatitis in patients with breast cancer. Radiation dermatitis is a skin condition
      that is a common side effect of radiation therapy. The affected skin becomes painful, red,
      itchy, and blistered. Topical keratin may help to improve skin appearance and hydration in
      patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine a preliminary estimate of the improvement of skin's natural barrier, decrease
      of dehydration, and reduction in the appearance of inflammation associated with radiation
      therapy (RT) skin toxicity as well as patients' satisfaction with their skin after the
      application of the medical device topical keratin (KeraStat Cream) during RT in breast cancer
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive topical keratin topically at least twice daily (BID) until the end
      of radiation therapy (approximately 3-6 weeks).

      GROUP II: Patients receive standard of care as directed by radiation oncologist until the end
      of radiation therapy (approximately 3-6 weeks).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks.
