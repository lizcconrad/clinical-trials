      Background

      Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a platelet P2Y12 inhibitor is mandatory in
      patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). For patients with stable coronary
      artery disease (SCAD) and unstable angina (UA), clopidogrel is the most widely used P2Y12
      inhibitor with class I recommendation. However, clopidogrel is a pro-drug which has highly
      variable antiplatelet effect. Hypo-responsiveness to clopidogrel was associated with
      increased risk of thrombotic events after PCI.

      Increasing the dose of aspirin could not reduce thrombotic risk but resulted in elevated
      bleeding risk. Although new P2Y12 inhibitors have more potent antiplatelet effect and did
      reduce thrombotic risk compared with clopidogrel, the benefit was only demonstrated in
      patients undergoing PCI for moderate to high risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary
      syndrome (NSTE-ACS) or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was also
      associated with increased bleeding risk. Therefore, how to improve the antiplatelet therapy
      in patients taking aspirin and clopidogrel after elective PCI for SCAD or UA remains unclear.

      Berberine is an isoquinoline plant alkaloid which has anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant,
      anti-microbial and anti-tumoral properties, as well as anti-hypertensive, hypo-glycemic and
      cholesterol-lowering effects. In small studies conducted in patients with hypertension,
      hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, berberine with a daily dose of 600-1000 mg for 12 weeks
      had good safety profile and was well tolerated.

      In addition, berberine demonstrated antiplatelet effect. After in vivo administration in
      animals, berberine inhibited ex vivo platelet activation mediated by P2Y12 receptor and ex
      vivo platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid (AA),
      collagen, and thrombin, et al. After ex vivo administration, berberine inhibited ex vivo
      thromboxane B2 (TXB2) synthesis induced by ADP, AA, and collagen in animal platelets, as well
      as ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by collagen in a dose-dependent manner in platelets
      from healthy human volunteers. However, the antiplatelet effect of berberine has never been
      investigated in patients on DAPT after PCI.

      Design

      The APLABE-PCI is a single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled, dose-escalating,
      parallel-group study, which is designed to assess the anti-platelet effect of berberine in
      approximately 64 patients on aspirin and clopidogrel who are at &gt; 4 but ≤ 12 weeks after
      elective PCI for SCAD or UA.

      The total study duration is expected to be approximately 19 weeks per patient, including a
      screening period, a 12±1 week treatment period, and a 4±1 week follow-up period.

      The visit schedule will be as follows:

        -  Visit 0 (V0): Day -21 to day -1, Screening/Enrolment;

        -  Visit 1 (V1): Day 1, Randomization/First dose;

        -  Visit 2 (V2): Week 4±1, Dose adjustment 1;

        -  Visit 3 (V3): Week 8±1, Dose adjustment 2;

        -  Visit 4 (V4): Week 12±1, End of Treatment (EOT) /Last dose;

        -  Visit 5 (V5): Week 16±1, Safety visit.

      The screening period will be up to 21 days. Once each patient has signed the informed
      consent, the eligibility of the patient will be evaluated and related laboratory assessments
      will be taken (Visit 0). All patients will continue taking aspirin and clopidogrel in the
      morning during the screening period.

      On the first day of the treatment period (Visit 1), eligible patients will return to the
      study center and be randomized into the Berberine Arm and the Control Arm. In the Berberine
      Arm, patients will receive berberine 200 mg twice daily for 4±1 weeks (Stage 1); then, 300 mg
      twice daily for 4±1 weeks (Stage 2); then, 400 mg twice daily for 4±1 weeks (Stage 3) in
      addition to standard treatment. In the Control Arm, patients will receive standard treatment
      for 12±1 weeks. During the treatment period, patients in both arms will also take aspirin 100
      mg once daily and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily for 12±1 weeks.

      The total daily dose of berberine will be taken separately in the morning and in the evening
      in approximately a 12-hour interval. On the first day of the treatment period (Visit 1), the
      morning dose (first dose) of berberine will be given 2-4 hour after aspirin and clopidogrel
      are taken in the morning and immediately after the blood and urine samples for baseline
      platelet function tests are collected. Since the second day of the treatment period, the
      morning dose of berberine will be taken simultaneously with aspirin and clopidogrel in the
      morning.

      At the ends of Stage 1 (Visit 2), Stage 2 (Visit 3), and Stage 3 (Visit 4) (end of treatment,
      EOT), patients will return to the study center. During each stage, the last morning doses of
      all antiplatelet agents, including berberine, aspirin, and clopidogrel in the Berberine Arm,
      as well as aspirin and clopidogrel in the Control Arm, will be administered simultaneously at
      the study center in the morning on Visit 2, Visit 3, and Visit 4, respectively.

      In the Berberine Arm, the blood and urine samples for platelet function tests will be
      obtained before the first morning dose of berberine on Visit 1, as well as 2-4 hours after
      the last morning dose of berberine on Visit 2, Visit 3, and Visit 4, respectively. In the
      Control Arm, the blood and urine samples for platelet function tests will be collected 2-4
      hours after aspirin and clopidogrel are given on Visit 1, Visit 2, Visit 3, and Visit 4,
      respectively.

      A follow-up period will begin on the next day after Visit 4 and will continue for 4±1 weeks.
      During the follow-up period, patients in both arms will continue taking aspirin and
      clopidogrel. At the end of the follow-up period, patients will return to the study center for
      a safety visit (Visit 5).

      The blood and urine samples for safety assessment will be collected at Visit 0, Visit 2,
      Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5, respectively. Adverse events will be collected on Visit 1,
      Visit 2, Visit 3, Visit 4, and Visit 5, respectively. Cardiac ischemic events and bleeding
      events will be collected on Visit 2, Visit 3, and Visit 4, respectively.

      The primary endpoint of the study is the P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) assessed by VerifyNow
      assay 2-4 h after all the antiplatelet agents are taken simultaneously in the morning at the
      end of the treatment period (Visit 4, EOT), i.e., the 12th (11th-13th) week of treatment.

      Conclusions

      The APLABE-PCI study will assess the anti-platelet effect of berberine in patients who are on
      aspirin and clopidogrel after elective PCI for SCAD or UA. The result of the present study
      will provide pharmacodynamical data for the design of future outcome studies.

             the patient to participate in this study. For example, conditions which may put the
             patient at risk, e.g., liver or kidney dysfunction, et al; or increase the risk of
             non-compliance to study protocol or follow-up, e.g., history of drug addiction or
             alcohol abuse, et al; or influence the result of the study, e.g., active cancer, et
             al.

         11. Patients who has previously been randomized in this study.
