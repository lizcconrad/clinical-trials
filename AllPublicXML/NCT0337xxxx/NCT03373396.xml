  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chlordecone is known to induce liver damage in rat and mice but no data exists in human
      being. However chlordecone was used until 1993 in French West Indies for banana fields, it is
      important to test what damage can be induced now, for patients exposed. We should consider
      chlordecone as a potential cofactor of liver fibrosis. So we have chosen to compare two
      populations of chronic hepatitis B, C or alcoholic, with cirrhosis or without fibrosis due to
      active hepatitis, who had been exposed to chlordecone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actually, there is no data concerning the impact of chlordecone on the evolution of fibrosis
      to cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis whereas many studies have been reported liver damage in
      mice. The goal of this study is to know if co-exposition to chlordecone can induce evolution
      to cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis due to alcohol or viral hepatitis. At first, we will assess
      a group of patients with chronic hepatitis B, C or due to alcohol without fibrosis. And they
      will be compared to patients with cirrhosis exposed to chlordecone too. Patients will be
      included in 2 hospital centers. All these patients should have an active liver disease. The
      activity will be defined by histology or elevated transaminases (&gt;2N), fibrosis will be
      defined by histology or an association of fibroscan and biological markers. Exposition to
      chlordecone will be evaluated by a blood chlordecone measure for every patient.

    <description>: Chlordecone level will be compared among the two groups (patients with or without significant fibrosis) in order to determine the impact of chlordecone on the evolution of fibrosis. Patients of each group will be paired according to the age, sex, origin of the liver disease. Analysis will be performed using SPSS software.</description>
