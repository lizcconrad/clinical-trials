  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two drug options for pain control in patients
      following wrist injury. Participants will be randomized to one of the 2 pain relief
      treatments to determine what treatment provides the most effective pain relief
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this noninferiority randomized clinical trial are to determine whether: 1.
      the most commonly used non-narcotic analgesic (ibuprofen 600 mg + acetaminophen 500 mg)
      provides pain relief that is not unacceptably worse than the most commonly prescribed
      narcotic (hydrocodone 5 mg + acetaminophen 500 mg) in patients with a hand or wrist fracture.
      2. the following covariates affect pain outcomes: sex/gender, age, gender-related pain
      expectations, paid/unpaid work roles, comorbid health status, baseline pain intensity, and
      employment status.

They will also be asked what medication they thought they were taking so we can assess how this impacts on their preference, and to discern whether patients were aware of their allocation</description>
