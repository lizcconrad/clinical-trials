  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a frequent pathology, involving elderly patients with many co-morbidities ;
      therefore, post-operative morbidity and mortality is high. It is reported that
      intra-operative hemodynamics correlate with post-operative complications such as myocardial
      injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) or acute kidney injury (AKI) ; that is why elderly
      patients undergoing hip fracture surgery should benefit from a better hemodynamic stability.

      Low-dose hypobaric lateral spinal anesthesia with a reduced dose of local anesthetic has been
      shown to have better hemodynamic stability than conventional spinal anesthesia. It has also
      been reported that general anesthesia and conventional spinal anesthesia in elderly patients
      undergoing hip fracture surgery have the same hemodynamic effect. However, no published study
      has compared low-dose hypobaric lateral spinal anesthesia to general anesthesia with regards
      to hemodynamic effects.

      The aim of the present study is to compare the intra-operative hemodynamics of low-dose
      hypobaric lateral spinal anesthesia with that of general anesthesia in elderly patients
      undergoing hip fracture surgery.
