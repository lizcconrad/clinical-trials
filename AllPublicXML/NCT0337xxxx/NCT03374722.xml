  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most critically ill patients encounter pain and distress from acute illness, medical
      procedures and devices as well as routine care in the intensive care units (ICU). Opioids are
      principal analgesics that alleviate moderate to severe pain and facilitate patients to
      co-operate the course of treatment. However, prolong administration of opioids especially in
      mechanically ventilated patients can cause withdrawal symptoms if analgesics are rapidly
      weaning or acutely disruption. The opioid withdrawal symptoms (OWS) are well reported in
      critically ill children that cause discomfort and prolong weaning from mechanical
      ventilation. Weaning opioids and treatment of withdrawal symptoms are needed in order to
      decrease ventilator days, ICU and hospital length of stay. Conversely, there is lack of
      knowledge about incidence, clinical presentation, time course and appropriated assessment
      tool for withdrawal detection. Therefore, we conduct the study to explore an incidence of
      OWS, to identify factors associated OWS, to establish the assessment tool for OWS, and to
      report efficacy of the pharmacological treatment for OWS, in adult critically ill patients.

      The primary objective of the study is to explore incidence of OWS in adult critically ill
      patients. The secondary objectives are 1) to identify factor associated OWS, 2) establish the
      assessment tool for OWS for adults and 3) to report efficacy of the pharmacological treatment
      in OWS in adults patients.
