  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy, safety and related mechanism of
      probiotics as a add-on treatment in improving the antipsychotic induced weight gain, the
      cognitive impairment, and psychotic syndrome in first episode schizophrenia patients. The
      study will recruit 40 first episode schizophrenia patients who meet the criteria of DSM-5,
      and then randomized to probiotics group or control group for a 8-weeks clinical trail. The
      specific aims are to compare probiotics group versus controls on: 1) clinical core symptoms;
      2) cognition;3)metabolic related markers.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy, safety and related mechanism of
      probiotics as a add-on treatment in improving the antipsychotic induced weight gain, the
      cognitive impairment, and psychotic syndrome in first episode schizophrenia patients. The
      study will recruit 40 first episode schizophrenia patients who meet the criteria of DSM-5,
      and then randomized to probiotics group or control group(20 patients per arm) for a 8-weeks
      clinical trail. Clinical efficacy and safety assessment will be done at screen/baseline, 4
      week, 8week. The specific aims are to compare probiotics group versus controls on: 1)
      clinical core symptoms; 2) cognition; 3) metabolic related markers. Biological samples also
      will be collected, and stored to research related mechanisms. Clinical symptoms will be
      measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale,. Cognitive function will be assessed by
      the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery.

      The investigators hypothesize that: 1) probiotics may improve cognitive impairment of
      patients with schizophrenia; 2) probiotics could prevent the cognitive decline of patients
      with schizophrenia; 3)probiotics may prevent the antipsychotics induced weight gain in
      patients with schizophrenia.4)probiotics may alter oxidative stress indexes or inflammatory
      biomarkers thus influence the oxidative and inflammatory mechanism.
