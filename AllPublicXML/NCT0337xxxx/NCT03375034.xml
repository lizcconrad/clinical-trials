  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain affects about 7% of the general population in European countries.
      Meta-analyses indicate that only a minority of neuropathic pain patients has adequate
      response to drug therapy and management of neuropathic pain is still an unmet medical need.
      New insights into the contribution of defined subtypes of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) to the
      different clinical effects of benzodiazepines, including analgesia, have suggested that
      α1-sparing selective benzodiazepines, such as N-desmethylclobazam (NDMC), may be a new
      realistic alternative for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Results from our previous study
      in healthy volunteers assessing the antihyperalgesic and sedative effects of benzodiazepines
      on a UVB-induced pain model of central sensitization showed that, at the time of maximum
      effect, clobazam and clonazepam antihyperalgesic effect was greater than placebo by
      respectively 15.7% (95% CI 0.8 - 30.5) and 28.6% (95% CI 4.5 - 52.6), p&lt;0.05. Moreover
      difference in sedation (VAS), as compared to placebo, was only significant for clonazepam
      26.3mm (95%CI 15.0-37.7), p&lt;0.001. Our preclinical data also demonstrate that, in recombinant
      receptors, NDMC has a better α2- over α1GABAARs activity ratio than clobazam and diazepam.
      And, unlike diazepam, NDMC caused no or modest sedation at antihyperalgesic doses in two
      strains of wild-type mice. In addition NDMC α2/α1 in vitro activity profile and long term
      clinical experience from its marketed parent compound (clobazam) make it an advisable
      clinical candidate for further proof-of-concept assessments in human. Therefore the Geneva
      University Hospitals have manufactured a new chemical entity and initiated a drug development
      program for NDMC starting with this proof-of-concept phase 1b randomized double-blind
      crossover (4 arms) study that will assess the analgesic and sedative effects of NDMC 20mg and
      60mg compared to clonazepam 1.5 mg or placebo on a UVB-induced erythema pain model in healthy
      volunteers.

    <measure>Change in the area of secondary hyperalgesia from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 1, Hour 2, Hour 3, Hour 4, Hour 5, Hour 6, Hour 7, Hour 8, Hour 9, Hour 10 following drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The mapping of the area of secondary hyperalgesia is determined by pricking the skin surrounding the erythema with a hand-held von Frey filament (235 mN), normally felt as non-painful.
The punctuated probe is moved along the 8 radial lines defined by the center (erythema) and the corners of a regular octagon. Testing starts outside the hyperalgesic area and the probe is moved towards the center in steps of 5 mm. The position is marked where the pin-prick sensation changes to become painful. Once complete boundaries had been defined, the areas are transcribed onto clear film and weighed. The surface area will then be calculated based on a standard measure of the weight of an area of 100cm2.</description>

    <measure>Change in static mechanical pain threshold (SMPT) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 1, Hour 2, Hour 3, Hour 4, Hour 5, Hour 6, Hour 7, Hour 8, Hour 9, Hour 10 following drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Increasing pressure will be manually delivered at a constant rate of 10 g / sec with a von Frey electronic device (Bioseb, Id-Tech Bioseb, Chaville, France). SMPT is defined as the lowest pressure that produces a sensation of pain. This threshold will be determined at DAY1 before UVB exposition and at DAY2 on the primary area of hyperalgesia prior to the administration of the study drug to document hyperalgesia/allodynia.</description>

    <measure>Change in dynamic mechanical sensory VAS (DMSV) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 1, Hour 2, Hour 3, Hour 4, Hour 5, Hour 6, Hour 7, Hour 8, Hour 9, Hour 10 following drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic mechanical sensory is a good correlate of central sensitization and will be determined by gently stroking a hand-held cotton wool tip on the skin at a rate of approximately 1 cm/sec. Following a series of 10 strokes, the subject will be asked to score the intensity of the tactile sensation he experienced on a visual analogue scale (VAS; 0-100mm). This parameter will be determined at DAY1 before UVB exposition to document the integrity of the nociceptive fibres and at DAY2 on the primary area of hyperalgesia prior to the administration of the study drug to document hyperalgesia/allodynia.</description>

    <time_frame>Hour 1, Hour 2, Hour 3, Hour 4, Hour 5, Hour 6, Hour 7, Hour 8, Hour 9, Hour 10 following drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective degree of sedation will be evaluated on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The subject is asked to rate on a 100 mm scale (0=not at all and100 extremely) his level of drowsiness: &quot;How sleepy do you feel now?&quot;</description>
