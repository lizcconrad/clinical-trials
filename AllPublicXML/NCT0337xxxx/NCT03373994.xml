    <textblock>
      Perfusion and hypoxia were independent prognositic parameters for tumor patients. Developing
      a method that can evaluate tumor perfusion and hypoxia noninvasively and conveniently was in
      urgent need. 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging could reflect tumor hypoxia in 60min balanced imaging was
      proved and accepted. Moreover, FDG could diffuse out of the vasculature and through cell
      membranes passively and rapidly due to its lipophilicity, its regional uptake at initial
      times is expected to reflect tumor perfusion. So, investigators want to use 18F-FDG PET/CT
      imaging to evaluate tumor perfusion and hypoxia simutaniouslyï¼Œin order to guide the clinical
      diagnosis and treatment.
