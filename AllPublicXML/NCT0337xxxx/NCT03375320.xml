    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies cabozantinib S-malate to see how well it works
      compared with placebo in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumors previously treated with
      everolimus that have spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes, have spread to other places in
      the body, or cannot be removed by surgery. Cabozantinib S-malate is a chemotherapy drug known
      as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and it targets specific tyrosine kinase receptors, that when
      blocked, may slow tumor growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether cabozantinib S-malate (cabozantinib) can significantly improve
      progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors (NET) whose disease has progressed after treatment with everolimus.

      II. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve progression-free survival
      (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has
      progressed after treatment with everolimus.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared
      to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after
      treatment with everolimus.

      II. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS)
      compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed
      after treatment with everolimus.

      III. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with
      advanced pancreatic NET using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (PRO-CTCAE).

      IV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with
      advanced carcinoid tumors using CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE.

      V. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in
      patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after treatment with
      everolimus.

      VI. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in
      patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after treatment with
      everolimus.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Results of the primary analysis will be examined for consistency, while taking into
      account the stratification factors and/or covariates of baseline quality of life (QOL) and
      fatigue.

      II. To compare overall quality of life, disease-related symptoms, and other domains between
      the two treatment groups (cabozantinib versus [vs.] placebo) within each cohort of patients
      (pancreatic NET vs. carcinoid tumor). (Quality of Life Substudy Objective - A021602-HO1)

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks until disease
      progression or start of new anticancer therapy, and then every 6 months until 8 years after
      registration.

    <time_frame>From randomization to the first radiographic documentation of disease progression, or death from any cause, assessed for up to 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be compared between treatment arms using the stratified log rank test at one-sided level 0.025. The stratification factors will be used for the analysis. The hazard ratio (HR) for PFS will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the HR will be provided. Results from an unstratified analysis will also be provided. Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment arm, and Kaplan-Meier curves will be produced. Brookmeyer Crowley methodology will be used to construct the 95% CI for the median PFS for each treatment arm.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to death, from any cause, assessed for up to 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>The analyses for OS will follow intent-to-treat (ITT) principle and will be conducted separately within each cohort (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor [NET] and carcinoid tumor). The distribution of OS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. The median OS, along with the 95% CI, will be estimated by the two treatment groups. Overall survival will be compared between treatment arms using the stratified log-rank test at a one-sided cumulative 2.5% level of significance. The stratified Cox regression will be used to estimate the HR of OS, along with the 95% CI. A hierarchical approach will be used to control for family-wise type-I error rate, therefore OS will be formally statistically tested only if the primary efficacy endpoint, PFS, is statistically significantly different between the two treatment groups.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>For CTCAE data, the frequency tables will be reviewed to determine the patterns. The overall adverse event rates will be compared between treatment groups using Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test if the data in contingency table is sparse). PRO-CTCAE data will, at minimum, be analyzed similarly to CTCAE data. The initial analysis of each PRO-CTCAE item will use all available scores in an analysis which mirrors the approach used for the CTCAE data. Supplemental analysis will use model-based multiple imputation incorporating baseline patient characteristics and physician-rated performance status. CTCAE data may be incorporated as auxiliary data into multiple imputation models for AEs which are captured by both PRO-CTCAE and CTCAE. Results from supplemental analysis will be descriptively compared to the results of the initial analysis to assess the robustness of results to missing data. Additional analyses of PRO-CTCAE data beyond those specified above may be undertaken.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic response rate defined as the proportion of patients in each arm whose best response is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic response rate for both cohorts: the analyses for radiographic response rate will follow the ITT principle and will be conducted separately within each cohort (pancreatic NET and carcinoid tumor). The proportion of patients with either CR or PR as their best response will be estimated using point estimates and 95% confidence intervals according to the methods in Duffy and Santner. Radiographic response rate will be compared between treatment arms using the 2-sample z-test to compare sample proportion at a one-sided 2.5% level of significance.</description>
