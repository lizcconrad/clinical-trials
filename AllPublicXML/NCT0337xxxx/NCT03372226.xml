  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines the effectiveness of a computer-based self-help-program for individuals
      with problematic or pathological gambling behavior.The main objective of the study is to
      investigate the extent to which the online program leads to a significant reduction in
      pathological gambling (primary outcome), depression and gambling-specific dysfunctional
      thoughts. The program is expected to lead to a significant reduction regarding all measures
      when compared to a control group. The study is conducted as a randomized-controlled trial
      with one intervention group and one wait-list control group.

      The study examines the effectiveness of a computer-based self-help-program for individuals
      with problematic and pathological gambling behavior. The main objective of the study is to
      investigate the extent to which the online program leads to a significant reduction in
      pathological gambling. The primary outcome is the PG-Y-BOCS as a measure of the severity of
      pathological gambling symptoms. Secondary outcomes are rates of depression, measured with the
      PHQ-9 as well as gambling-specific cognitive biases, measured with the GABS. The program is
      expected to lead to a significant reduction in problematic/pathological gambling behavior
      (PG-Y-BOCS) and also to declines in both depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) and gambling-specific
      cognitive biases (GABS). The study is conducted as a randomized-controlled trial with one
      intervention group and one wait-list control group. The intervention group receives the login
      data directly following the baseline survey and can use the program over a period of 8 weeks,
      whereas the wait-list control group receives access to the program after completion of the
      post-survey.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a randomly controlled study with 2 conditions: Condition 1: Online Intervention Program (treatment of emotional and gambling-related symptoms), condition 2: Wait-list control group (access to the online program after the post-assessment).
Two assessments-points, the intervention period (pre-post) is eight weeks. At both measuring points sociodemographic and pathological data are obtained with an internet survey on Unipark®.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pathological Gambling Adaptation of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PG-Y-BOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The total score consists of ten items that measure the severity of gambling symptoms within the past week. The first five questions assess urges and thoughts associated with gambling, whereas the last five questions assess the behavioral component of the disorder. The sum score of each subscale ranges from 0-20. Each subscale can be analyzed separately as well as together as a total score (primary outcome). The total score can be interpreted as follows: 0-7 sub-clinical, 8-15 mild, 16-23 moderate, 24-31 severe and 32-40 extreme gambling symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 depression module (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 depression module is a self-rating measure of depressive symptom severity. The psychometric properties of the PHQ-9 are very good, with high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = .86 - .89; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001). Its sum score ranges from 0 to 27, with scores from 0-4 indicating minimal depression, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression and 15-27 severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gambling Attitudes and Beliefs Survey (GABS)</measure>
    <time_frame>time of assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The GABS is a self-report questionnaire which explores gambling-related dysfunctional beliefs. In this study, we use a 15-item version of the GABS. Responses can be given on a four-point Likert scale (from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree').</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>20-items self-report measure to screen for engagement in gambling activities and gambling-related problems. A score between 0-2 corresponds to non-problematic gambling, a score of 3-4 to at-risk gambling, and a score of 5-20 to probable pathological gambling.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The intervention group receives the login data for the online program directly following the baseline assessment. The program consists of 10 modules with many interactional exercises and homework-sheets.
Themes that are addressed in the online-program are for example self-esteem, sleep hygiene, problem solving strategies, mindfulness-based relaxation and attention exercises as well as gambling-specific topics such as money/debt management and impulse control. In addition, the user learns to modify negative and gambling-specific thought distortions, to integrate positive activities into his/her daily routine, strategies to deal with the urge to play as well as ways to regulate debts and to prevent relapse.</description>

    <description>The participants of the wait-list control condition do not receive any new intervention during the intervention period of 8 weeks, but may continue any treatment that has already been started before, including medication. Participants in the wait-list control condition receive full access to the program after completion of the post-assessment.</description>
