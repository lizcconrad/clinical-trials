  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      physiological end-point, incidence of adverse events, and changes in psychological status.

      In the past, physiological goals, major morbidity and mortality were used as indicators of
      recovery after surgery. However, major morbidity and mortality rates were extremely low due
      to the development of surgery and anesthesia techniques, and measurements of these indicators
      do not adequately reflect postoperative recovery. On the other hand, the measurement of the
      patient's health status or quality of life has become an important metric in many clinical
      studies. The Quality of Recovery 40 Questionnaire (QoR-40) is a multidimensional tool that
      specifically assesses and develops anesthetic and postoperative health conditions. Severance
      Hospital is conducting an anesthesiologist-led prayer for the patient only for the desired
      patient before anesthesia. Although it may be expected that this preoperative airway may
      improve the quality of recovery after anesthesia / surgery by reducing patient anxiety, there
      is no objective study on this. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
      preoperative preoperative airway on the quality of postoperative recovery in patients who
      underwent thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer. I want to see. In addition, we will investigate
      whether preoperative airway affects sympathetic nervous system during surgery.
