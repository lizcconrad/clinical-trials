  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D), and to characterize PK of TAK-228 administered once daily or once weekly to East
      Asian participants with advanced nonhematological malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-228. TAK-228 is being tested to treat East
      Asian participants with advanced nonhematological malignancies for whom standard anticancer
      treatment is not available or is no longer effective. This study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, PK and will determine the RP2Ds of TAK-228.

      The study will enroll approximately 46 participants, including at least 6 Japanese
      participants at RP2D dose level. Participants will be assigned to one of the following
      treatment arms:

        -  TAK-228 Once Daily

        -  TAK-228 Once Weekly

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. The overall time
      to participate in this study is up to 12 months, unless in the opinion of the investigator
      and sponsor the participant would derive benefit from continued therapy beyond 12 months.
      Participants will be followed for 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <description>The clinical benefit rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) guidelines (Version 1.1),. CR is defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 millimeter [mm]). No new lesions. PR is defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, progressive disease (PD).</description>
