  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (P-ESWL) is recommended as the first-line
      treatment for pancreatic stones. However, how well P-ESWL performs in geriatric patients
      remains unclear. The investigators aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of P-ESWL for
      geriatric patients with chronic pancreatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study was conducted in patients with painful chronic
      pancreatitis who underwent P-ESWL. Patients aged over 65 years were included in the geriatric
      group; patients aged under 65 years who underwent P-ESWL in the same period were assigned to
      the control group. For investigation of long-term follow-up, the geriatric group were matched
      with patients from the control group in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcomes were P-ESWL
      complications and pain relief. The secondary outcomes included: stone clearance, physical and
      mental health, quality of life score, and body weight.

    <measure>P-ESWL complications</measure>
    <time_frame>April 30, 2016</time_frame>
    <description>The complications after P-ESWL. Including post-ESWL pancreatitis, bleeding, infection, steinstrasse, and perforation. The degree of these complications will also be measured.</description>

    <measure>Pain relief by the end of follow-up period</measure>
    <time_frame>April 30, 2018</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be followed up annually either by return visit or telephone call. Condition of abdominal pain or acute pancreatitis attack during follow-up will be measured. Pain relief at the end of the follow-up period was classified as complete relief (Izbicki pain score≤10) or partial relief (Izbicki pain score &gt;10 after a decrease of &gt;50%)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stone clearance as assessed by ERCP performed post-ESWL</measure>
    <time_frame>April 30, 2016</time_frame>
    <description>Stone clearance was evaluated at the ERCP performed post-ESWL, with complete clearance defined as clearance of &gt;90% of the main pancreatic duct stone volume, whereas partial clearance was defined as clearance of 50%-90% of the stone volume.</description>
