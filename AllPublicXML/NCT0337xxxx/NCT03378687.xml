      Phase 1: The first part of study is a multi-center, retrospect study involving 38 hospitals.
      The program is a national epidemiological study on status epilepticus in Chinese children.The
      aims of the epidemiological study include:

        1. to obtain national epidemiological data on the etiology, diagnosis,treatment,evaluation,
           risk factors , outcome and analyze the burden of disease.

        2. to build a Collaborative Network in pediatric status epilepticus research.

        3. to establish a national clinical database of pediatric status epilepticus.

        4. to lay the foundation for the further prospective study.

      Phase 2: The second part of study is a multi-center, prospective study involving 38
      hospitals. The aim of the study is to set up guideline of Children with SE in China.

      Methods:

        1. Case retrieval: The investigators query cases with a diagnostic code of SE via usage of
           the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) code G41.

        2. Data collection:The subjects will be recruited from all hospitals.The investigators
           collect detailed information by a standardized questionnaire ,which contains each
           patient's age, gender, the date of occurrence of SE, past history of SE and seizures,
           etiology of SE, developmental history, underlying diseases, family history of seizures,
           duration of SE, seizure types of SE, laboratory data,EEG findings during SE and/or after
           SE, cranial CT and/or MRI findings after SE, medical treatment during the acute period
           and the outcome.The outcome include neurological sequelae, recurrence and death
           following SE.

        3. The establishment of the database and data entry :The investigators established a
           database according the standardized questionnaire. Then the information will be put in
           the database by the responsible person of each hospital.

        4. The standardized management of the database and quality control:There is a special
           person administrating the database and controlling the quality of data.
