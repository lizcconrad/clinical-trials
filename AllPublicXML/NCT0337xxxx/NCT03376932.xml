  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common, chronic respiratory disease affecting 1-18 percent of the population. It
      is accepted that much of the uncontrolled asthma is due to poor adherence and asthma outcomes
      in such cases may improve simply by increasing adherence to available treatments.
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has developed a sensor, which clips on to the ELLIPTA® dry powder
      inhaler (DPI). This will inform subjects if/when they have taken their medication that is in
      the ELLIPTA inhaler, as well as other information, including: asthma management strategies,
      tracking of symptoms, asthma triggers, medication reminders and daily asthma forecasts. The
      sensors, application (app), and provider portal that provide data are subsequently described
      as the CIS. The combination of once-daily FF/UMEC/VI with the CIS will improve the disease
      management and adherence. Thus, this study is designed to study the effectiveness and
      adherence of single inhaler triple therapy (SITT) of FF/UMEC/VI with the CIS as compared to
      multiple inhaler triple therapy (MITT) of the combination of FP/SAL plus TIO without CIS in
      subjects with inadequately controlled asthma. The study randomization will be stratified by
      pre-study inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) dosage strength (mid- or high-dose). Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either FF/UMEC/VI delivered via the ELLIPTA DPI with the
      CIS or FP/SAL delivered via the DISKUS® DPI (with sensor only) plus TIO delivered via the
      RESPIMAT inhaler (without sensor). The maximum study duration will be approximately 29 weeks,
      which comprised of prescreen/ screening/ randomization period of up to 4 weeks, 24-week
      treatment period and a 1-week follow-up period. Approximately 1006 subjects will be
      randomized in the study. ELLIPTA and DISKUS are registered trademarks of GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) group of companies.

    <measure>Percentage of subjects who have an asthma control test (ACT) total score of &gt;=20</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ACT is a self-administered tool to identify subjects with poorly controlled asthma. It is a 5-item questionnaire measuring the frequency of shortness of breath, general asthma symptoms, use of rescue medications, the effect of asthma on daily functioning, and overall assessment of asthma control. The response options for all these questions consist of a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (all the time or not controlled at all for symptoms/activities) to 5 (not at all or completely controlled).</description>

    <measure>Annualized rate of moderate and/or severe asthma exacerbations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Annualized rate of moderate/severe asthma exacerbations will be compared to evaluate the effectiveness of FF/UMEC/VI with CIS on improving asthma control compared with FP/SAL+TIO after 24 weeks of treatment. Moderate asthma exacerbation is defined as deterioration in asthma symptoms, deterioration in lung function, or increased rescue bronchodilator use lasting for at least 2 days or more. Severe asthma exacerbation is defined as the deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids, or an increase from a stable maintenance dose, for at least 3 days or an inpatient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids.</description>
