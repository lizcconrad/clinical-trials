      This study is to determine if patients following prolapse repair including vaginal vault
      suspension have decreased pain measured via a visual analog scale (VAS) on postoperative day
      one and just prior to discharge when exposed to the diad of music and positive images
      compared to patients receiving standard care.

    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, interest has grown in improving the patient experience. As part of this
      movement, studies have sought to evaluate the mechanisms by which the postoperative
      environment affects a patient's outcome and perception of healing.

      Literature review reveals efforts by both medical and design teams towards improving the
      experience of the patient and developing an environment that promotes healing. Changes to the
      physical environment have been shown to have an impact on satisfaction. These parameters have
      included music and art. Considering the effort that is now going into improving the patient
      experience and developing this theory of healing spaces, there has yet to be a randomized
      controlled trial evaluating these alternative therapies in the urogynecologic patient
      population. Although each of these modalities appears beneficial, we believe that a
      combination of these would be even more useful. Indeed, these treatments are also relatively
      easy to implement without undue cost or burden to the hospital. This study seeks to determine
      the influence of applying music and art to the post operative environment for patients
      recovering from major urogynecologic surgery on pain.
