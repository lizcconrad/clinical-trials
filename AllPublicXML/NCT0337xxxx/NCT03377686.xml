    <textblock>
      In this study new hand-held devices for measuring exhaled breath will be tested in children
      with asthma, CF, and healthy controls. Main objectives will be feasibility and discriminative
      value of these techniques.

      Rationale: Assessment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is a new recently developed
      non-invasive technique to assess airway inflammation. The non-invasive character makes it
      highly suitable for use in (preschool) children. However, the analysis of VOCs by gas
      chromatography mass spectrometry technique (GC-MS), the gold standard, is expensive and time
      consuming. Therefore, new hand-held devices (such as electronic Noses (eNoses) and Ion
      Mobility Spectrometer techniques) have been developed. However, these new point-of-care
      instruments have not been studied in children.

      Objectives: 1) To test whether new point-of-care instruments for the measurement of VOCs in
      exhaled breath are feasible for use in children aged 6 to 16 years; 2) To explore whether
      these techniques can differentiate between healthy children, asthmatic children and children
      with Cystic Fibrosis (CF).

      Study design: Cross-sectional study design. Several VOCs tests will be performed in all
      participants.Besides, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and inflammatory markers in
      exhaled breath condensate (EBC) will be measured.

      Study population: Three groups of children aged 6 to 16 years: 20 healthy children, 20
      children with doctor's diagnosed asthma, 20 children with CF.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Each technique will be evaluated for its use and feasibility
      in children. For each technique, VOC profiles between study groups will be evaluated for its
      discriminative power.

    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events directly related to the various point-of-care tests used</measure>
    <time_frame>Questionnaire will be done directly after specific test (1 day). No long term (S)AE is expected and measurement of each test is only performed once.</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse event of any kind will be noted. Furthermore, each participant will be asked whether the test was easy to perform. This question can be answered on a 5-point scale (0=totally agree that test was easy to perform, 4= totally disagree that test was easy to perform)</description>

    <description>Aeonose eNose measurements will be analysed by in house software program (Aethena) developed by eNose company (Zutphen, Netherlands). To test sensitivity and specificity, first an area under the receiver operating curve must be calculated with the aforementioned software program. Hereafter sensitivity and specificity of the eNose can be calculated.</description>
