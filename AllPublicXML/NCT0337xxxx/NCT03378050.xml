  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first randomized controlled trial exploring the implementation of a
      multi-component individualized telephone-based support intervention for adult-child
      caregivers caring for parents with dementia in China. Results hold the potential to inform
      the further development of family caregiver supportive services.

    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a
      multi-component individualized telephone-based support intervention (HEART) for adult-child
      caregivers caring for parents with dementia in China.

      The primary hypothesis to test is whether the HEART is more efficacious in reducing caregiver
      burden than the follow-up as usual (FU) in dementia adult-child caregivers.

      Secondary hypotheses include the following:

        1. The HEART is more efficacious in improving health related quality of life than the FU in
           dementia adult-child caregivers.

        2. The HEART is more efficacious in protecting reciprocal Filial Piety than the FU in
           dementia adult-child caregivers.

        3. The HEART is more efficacious in relieving CR's behavioral and psychological symptoms of
           dementia (BPSD) than the FU in dementia adult-child caregivers.

        4. The HEART group has a higher satisfaction with the intervention than the FU group.

      In addition, two research questions will be answered by qualitative data from process
      evaluation for the feasibility of the HEART intervention. The research questions are as
      follows:

        1. To what extent can the HEART intervention be delivered as planned?

        2. What are the barriers to and facilitators of the HEART intervention?

    <description>Caregiver burden will be assessed using the 12-item version of Zarit Burden Interview (12-item ZBI) to measure caregiver burden (Bédard, 2001; Zarit, 1980). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) though 4 (nearly always), yielding a possible range of 0 to 48. Higher scores indicate greater levels of caregiver burden. This short version and The Chinese version of 12-item ZBI has excellent internal consistency (Cronbachα= 0.87); and is highly correlated with the full measure (r = 0.952) (Lin, 2017; Wang, Yand, &amp; Hou, 2006).</description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL will be measured using the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), which is wildly used and has proved its feasibility in both self-administered and telephone interview (Lungenhausen et al., 2007; Ware Jr, Kosinski, &amp; Keller, 1996). SF-12 consists of the mental component summary (MCS) and the physical component summary (PCS) with scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores correspond to higher HRQoL. The Chinese version of SF-12 has been proved satisfactory for measuring and evaluating the quality of life for Chinese (Lam, Eileen, &amp; Gandek, 2005).</description>

    <description>The 8-item Reciprocal Filial Piety Scale (RFPS) (Yeh and Bedford, 2003) will used to measure RFP of adult children caring for their parents. This instrument uses a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6(strongly agree), yielding a total RFPS ranging from 8 to 48. Higher scores indicate greater RFP. Coefﬁcient (Cronbach) α for RFPS was 0.92, suggesting excellent reliability in this sample.</description>

    <description>Caregivers' behavioral symptoms and caregivers' behavior-related reactions will be measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) (Kaufer et al., 2000), which covers 12 neuropsychiatric symptom domains. A &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; screening question is used for each of the symptom. If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, caregivers are asked to rate the severity and distress of the symptoms in the last 4 weeks. The severity of the symptom is assessed in terms of on 3-point scale (1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe), yielding a possible range of 0 to 36. Caregiver distress associated with the symptom is rated by a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (mild) to 5(extreme), yielding a possible range of 0 to 60. The psychometric properties of English and Chinese versions are validated (Kaufer et al., 2000; Xie, Wang, &amp; Yu, 2005).</description>
