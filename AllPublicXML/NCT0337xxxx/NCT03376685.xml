  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is well established to decrease the risk of cardiometabolic
      diseases, however these beneficial effects are largely dependent on the type of exercise
      protocol conducted. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the efficacy of
      endurance (END), sprint (SIT), or combined endurance-sprint (COMB) training in respect to
      reducing clinically relevant cardiometabolic risk factors in pre-diabetic individuals. It is
      hypothesized that:

        1. END and COMB will elicit favourable cardiovascular adaptations, which will be absent in
           response to SIT.

        2. END and COMB protocols of greater frequency will markedly improve metabolic health in
           comparison to a lower frequency SIT protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Involvement in regular physical activity is known to elicit systemic adaptations and reduce
      the risk of cardiometabolic diseases, including hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and
      hyperglycemia. Traditional physical activity recommendations suggested 150 minutes of
      moderate-intensity continuous endurance (END) exercise dispersed over 5 days per week was
      sufficient to improve physical fitness in adults. However, given the commonly cited barrier
      of &quot;lack of time,&quot; literature has recently focused on time effective sprint interval training
      (SIT), obtaining equivalent increases in aerobic capacity and acute glycemic regulation
      compared to classical END exercise. Despite these similarities, END is conducive to daily
      sessions not feasible of SIT training. As many clinically relevant risk factors are transient
      in nature, it remains imperative to assess the implications of variable frequency exercise
      regimes. An additional notable and novel discrepancy between protocols includes the improved
      arterial compliance in response to END while these adaptations have largely been absent
      following interval training. This parameter, representing relevant cardiovascular risk
      reduction, warrants further attention especially when assessing clinical populations.

      While current research has largely centred on distinct END or SIT protocols, an application
      includes integrating both types of exercise into a combined endurance-sprint (COMB) protocol
      to achieve a greater frequency while maintaining some sessions at a higher intensity. As END
      and SIT may induce opposing cardiovascular outcomes, a combination may mitigate these
      SIT-induced effects and prove to be an ideal exercise prescription. Investigating the
      cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations in response to END, SIT, and COMB protocols will
      provide an integrated analysis of relevant health parameters in clinical populations. This
      research will assist in establishing an optimal exercise protocol for preventative and
      treatment approaches in individuals who are at risk for developing chronic health conditions.
