  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the effect of protein intake immediately after resistance exercise on
      lean mass, strength, and functional capacity gains in postmenopausal women. Participants were
      randomly assigned to protein-carbohydrate group (PC) (n=17), that ingested 30 g of whey
      protein immediately after exercise and 30 g of maltodextrin in the afternoon; and to
      carbohydrate-protein group (CP) (n=17), that ingested 30 g of maltodextrin immediately after
      exercise and 30 g of whey protein in the afternoon. Both groups performed the same resistance
      training protocol in the morning.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both groups performed the same training protocol, differing only the time of protein or
      carbohydrate supplementation. The dietary assessment was made through the 24-hour food
      recall, being conducted at the beginning, middle and end of the intervention. Resistance
      exercises for upper and lower limbs will be performed, at 70% of one repetition maximum. One
      maximum repetition (1-RM), handgrip strength and 1-mile walk were performed.
