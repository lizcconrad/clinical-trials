  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug
      neratinib in combination with a standard chemotherapy drug called capecitabine at different
      doses to find out what effects, if any, it has on people. Capecitabine (Xeloda®) is approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for advanced breast cancer treatment. Neratinib is
      an investigational drug, meaning the FDA has not approved the use of this drug for advanced
      breast cancer. The combination of capecitabine and neratinib has been studied before in
      another study where capecitabine was administered using the standard dosing schedule. In this
      study, the investigators want to find out if a different dosing schedule of capecitabine
      combined with neratinib is safer. This different dosing schedule is experimental, meaning the
      administration schedule of capecitabine and neratinib is not FDA approved for treatment for
      HER2 positive advanced breast cancer.

    <description>If 0 of the 3 patients entered at a dose level experiences a DLT, another 3 patients will be treated at the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3 patients in a cohort experiences a DLT, then up to 3 additional patients will be treated at the same dose level. If none of these 3 additional patients experience a DLT, then the dose will be escalated to the next higher dose level. If &gt; 2 of the initial 3 or 6 patients at a dose level experience a DLT, then the MTD will have been exceeded, and de-escalation is warranted. De-escalation will continue if &gt; 2 of the initial 3 or 6 patients in a dose level cohort experience a DLT. There will be 2 dose de-escalation levels (dose levels -1 and -2) and one dose escalation (dose level +1) as shown in the table below. If &lt; 1 of 6 patients, at that dose level, experience a DLT, then that dose level will be confirmed as the MTD.</description>

    <description>In the phase I portion of the study, a 3+3 design will be used. Once the MTD is reached, the phase II portion will enroll up to 24 patients. Capecitabine will be taken orally in AM and PM (at the assigned dose per cohort) 7 days on and 7 days off. Neratinib is given as 240 mg daily continuously without stopping. A cycle is 28 days. Patients will be seen on Day 1 of each cycle (+/- 3 days).</description>
