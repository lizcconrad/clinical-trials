  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of dose tracking in conjunction with reminder
      notifications and motivational/adaptive messages on treatment adherence behavior in subjects
      with COPD. The effect will be measured over 24 weeks on the subject's on time treatment
      adherence and total treatment adherence. The dose tracking is done by the Concept2 inhaler
      and the reminder notifications, feedback on inhaler use and motivational messages are sent by
      the patient application.

      This study will evaluate the effect of dose tracking in conjunction with reminder
      notifications and motivational/adaptive messages on treatment adherence behavior in subjects
      with COPD. The effect will be measured over 24 weeks on the subject's on time treatment
      adherence (+/- 2 hours of patients preferred inhalation time) and total treatment adherence
      (days when patient inhaled at least one dose). The dose tracking is done by the Concept2
      inhaler and the reminder notifications, feedback on inhaler use and motivational messages are
      sent by the patient application.

      The study population will consist of approximately 146 male and female adult patients, 18
      years or older with a clinical diagnosis of COPD, a smoking history of 10 pack years,
      receiving Ultibro Breezhaler treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening and poor
      treatment adherence.

      After 6 weeks of screening patients will be randomized to either the Usual Care group in
      which they will continue to receive Ultibro Breezhaler treatment via the Concept2, or the
      Telehealth group in which they will additionally receive a tablet device pre-installed with a
      patient app.

      In addition to on time treatment adherence and total treatment adherence, illness and
      treatment beliefs will be collected via a questionnaire and patient's health status from the
      EQ5D-5L and SGRQ-C Questionnaire. Key safety assessments are COPD exacerbation and AE/SAE,
      device deficiencies and device events, drug administration errors, physical exam, vital signs
      and urine pregnancy test.

    <description>Change from baseline in subject's on time treatment adherence at 24 weeks. The on-time adherence is calculated as the number of days with at least one dose/inhaler use recorded via the Concept2 inhaler within (±) 2 hours of planned subject's Preferred Inhalation Time (PIT), divided by the number of days the subject had the Concept2 inhaler over 24 weeks. Baseline on-time adherence will be calculated from the 6 weeks Screening period. The number of days in the denominator will be defined as: Days between Visit 1 (exclusive) and Visit 110 (inclusive). A minimum of 35 days in the screening are required for a baseline adherence calculation to be performed. Days when subject was taken off Ultibro® Breezhaler® treatment/inhaler use by investigator will be excluded from adherence calculation (for both Screening and Interventional period).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in subject's total treatment adherence at 24 weeks. Total adherence is calculated as the sum of on-time adherence and off-time adherence. Off-time adherence will be calculated as the number of days the subject did not inhale the daily dose within (±) 2 hours of the predefined subject's Preferred Inhalation Time (PIT), divided by the number of days the subject had the Concept2 inhaler over 24 weeks. Baseline on-time adherence will be calculated from the 6 weeks Screening period. The number of days in the denominator will be defined as: Days between Visit 1 (exclusive) and Visit 110 (inclusive). A minimum of 35 days in the screening are required for a baseline adherence calculation to be performed. Days when subject was taken off Ultibro® Breezhaler® treatment/inhaler use by investigator will be excluded from adherence calculation (for both Screening and Interventional period).</description>

    <measure>On time treatment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in subject's on time treatment adherence over the last 4 weeks. The on-time adherence is calculated as the number of days with at least one dose/inhaler use recorded via the Concept2 inhaler within (±) 2 hours of planned subject's Preferred Inhalation Time (PIT), divided by the number of days the subject had the Concept2 inhaler over 24 weeks. Baseline on-time adherence will be calculated from the 6 weeks Screening period. The number of days in the denominator will be defined as: Days between Visit 1 (exclusive) and Visit 110 (inclusive). A minimum of 35 days in the screening are required for a baseline adherence calculation to be performed.

    <description>Change from baseline in subject's total treatment adherence over the last 4 weeks. Total adherence is calculated as the sum of on-time adherence and off-time adherence. Off-time adherence will be calculated as the number of days the subject did not inhale the daily dose within (±) 2 hours of the predefined subject's Preferred Inhalation Time (PIT), divided by the number of days the subject had the Concept2 inhaler over 24 weeks. Baseline on-time adherence will be calculated from the 6 weeks Screening period. The number of days in the denominator will be defined as: Days between Visit 1 (exclusive) and Visit 110 (inclusive).
