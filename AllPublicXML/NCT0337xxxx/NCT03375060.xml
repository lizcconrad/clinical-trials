  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at a cohort of patients who have undergone treatment for Barrett's
      Esophagus (BE) and who have experienced complete eradication of the disease. The aim of the
      proposed study is to evaluate the histologic features of the neosquamous epithelium (NSE)
      following complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) in patients undergoing
      routine surveillance biopsies and compare these data to a direct measure of reflux using 24hr
      pH impedance, to determine the correlation between histology and persistent reflux. These
      data will allow us to more accurately risk stratify patients for recurrence of BE following
      EET.

    <description>A composite histologic score made up of the following criteria:
Eosinophil infiltration (0: none, 1: scattered or focal, 2: diffuse or multifocal)
Dilated intercellular spaces (0: none, 0.5: intercellular spaces seen at 40x focal, 1: intercellular spaces seen at 40x diffuse, 1.5: intercellular spaces seen at 10x focal, 2: intercellular spaces seen at 10x diffuse)
Parakaratosis (0: absent, 2: present)
Ballooning degeneration (0: none, 1: focal, 2: extensive)
Basal cell hyperplasia (0: &lt;15% of total thickness, 1: 15-33% of total thickness, 1.5: 33-66% of total thickness, 2: &gt;66% of total thickness)
Columnar differentiation (0: no columnar mucosa present, 2: columnar mucosa adjacent to squamous)
Ulceration/erosion (0: absent, 1: present)
