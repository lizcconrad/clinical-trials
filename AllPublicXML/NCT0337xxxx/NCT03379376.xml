  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial determines how well eHealth mindful movement and breathing works to improve
      outcomes in participants undergoing gynecologic surgery. Supportive therapy, such as eHealth
      mindful movement and breathing, uses techniques that include gentle movements, breathing, and
      relaxation techniques which may help participants cope with and improve their surgical
      experiences.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To field-test implementation strategies of the mindful movement and breathing (eMMB)
      intervention that has been adapted to the eHealth Format.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive a self-directed 20-minute eMMB video and are instructed to practice eMMB
      at least once before surgery and daily for 2 weeks after surgery. Participants may also
      request additional guidance from a yoga instructor via telephone and video conference before
      surgery and again 1 day after surgery or as soon as feasible.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 4 weeks from surgery.

    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To be determined by tracking the number of screened participants, those who are eligible, and the percent who agree to participate. For those not meeting the eligibility criteria, reasons will be summarized. The proportion of participants and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for participants who participated in the Mindful Movement and Breathing (eMMB) sessions and those who completed all assessments will be computed.</description>
