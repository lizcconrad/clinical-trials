  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a technique using cone beam CT perfusion (CBCTP) imaging with an
      acetazolamide challenge as a potential diagnostic tool to detect a defect in cerebral
      autoregulation at a time when it has not yet caused clinically apparent signs or symptoms.
      The Acetazolamide or vasodilatory challenge should identify subjects having a abnormal
      cerebrovascular reactivity capacity at a time before this response is needed i.e. before
      significant vasospasm has occurred. More specifically, after receiving the drug there will
      not be the expected increase in cerebral blood flow in some of the subjects because they are
      already suffering from a disturbance in the vasculature's ability to respond to the signal
      for vasodilation. The investigators believe that ultimately the presence of this deficit will
      be helpful in identifying patients who are at risk for potential brain ischemia due to this
      decreased capacity to autoregulate if/when clinically significant vasospasm occurs. The
      investigators predict that the technique described will be more sensitive in this regard than
      the presently available methods e.g. the severity of subarachnoid bleeding. If this is
      correct, the cone beam CT perfusion measurements would be a better predictor of those
      patients at risk for cerebral infarction due to delayed vasospasm. Identifying these
      individuals prior to the onset of clinically apparent symptoms would result in modification
      of their management and potentially provide the opportunity to reduce the morbidity and
      mortality associated with ischemic brain injury.

      The objective of this proposal is to conduct a feasibility study of acetazolamide activated
      C-arm cone beam CT perfusion (CBCTP) to determine its application in the prediction of
      symptomatic cerebral vasospasm (i.e. ischemia or stroke) in patients with aneurysmal
      subarachnoid hemorrhage. The initial plan is to obtain C-arm CBCTP pre- and post-intravenous
      infusion of 1g acetazolamide within 24 hours of symptom onset in aneurysmal subarachnoid
      hemorrhage patients. The hypothesis is that some of these patients that will later develop
      clinical vasospasm of a degree sufficient to cause cerebral ischemia. These, we believe, will
      demonstrate altered cerebrovascular reactivity during the acetazolamide challenge at a time
      before there is either angiographic evidence of vasospasm or clinical evidence of abnormal
      perfusion. The pilot study will enroll 10 subjects. If analysis of this data demonstrates
      that C-arm CBCTP with an acetazolamide challenge yields reproducible data and can be obtained
      with clinical ease and safety then a proposal for further research in a larger cohort will be
      submitted. This will aim to assess the utility of the CBCT perfusion measurement with an
      acetazolamide challenge to serve as a screening diagnostic tool to predict the subsequent
      occurrence of delayed vasospasm in subjects with an acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

    <description>Subjects entered into the study as a cohort, will because of their participation, undergo only two additional digital subtraction angiogram (DSA) imaging acquisitions. These will be done in conjunction with their standard diagnostic DSA evaluation and consist of two CBCTPs, one before and one after administration of 1 g acetazolamide through a peripheral IV line. Each CBCTP will require administration of 75-100 mL iodinated contrast medium also through an intravenous line. Neither of these imaging studies will be used for clinical decision making, but would be processed and evaluated at later date for a formal analysis of the results. Following completion of diagnostic imaging subjects will receive the usual standard of care for treatment of their ruptured aneurysm i.e. endovascular embolization or open surgical clipping.</description>
