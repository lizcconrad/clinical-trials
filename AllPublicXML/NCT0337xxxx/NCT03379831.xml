  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital malformations. The right
      ventricle in the sub-aortic position, or &quot;systemic right ventricle&quot; is one of these complex
      cardiac diseases. Several studies show that adults with CHD and especially systemic right
      ventricle have reduced exercise capacity. In addition, studies have shown that there is a
      correlation between alteration of aerobic physical capacity and alteration of right
      ventricular systolic function.

      Understanding and assessing the determinants of the physical capacity of patients with
      systemic right ventricles and evaluating their quality of life could allows us to improve
      their therapeutic management and also to expand patient indications to a program cardiac
      rehabilitation. This can benefit them on their exercise capacity, their tolerance to exercise
      and their quality of life.

      The aim is to study the correlation between the quality of life and the aerobic physical
      fitness of patients with a systemic right ventricle and to determine the clinical and
      paraclinical parameters that have an impact on the aerobic physical fitness of these
      patients. The quality of life of patients with a systemic right ventricle will be compared to
      that of the general population.

      100 patients will be enrolled in this study. 25 sites will participate to the enrollment,
      belonging to the French national network for complex congenital heart diseases (M3C) .

      Patient is included during his annual medical check-up. Quality of life questionnaire and
      other examinations are performed during this site visit. Its is a part of his usual care. No
      supplementary visit, directly related to the research, are necessary.
