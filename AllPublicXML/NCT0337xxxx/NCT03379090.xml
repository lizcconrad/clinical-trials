  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parental constraint of outdoor play may be fueling unhealthy emotional and physical
      development in today's children and adolescents. Time spent outdoors is a key determinant of
      unstructured play and overall physical activity levels, both of which are crucial to optimal
      development in youth. Modern barriers - such as crime, poor social ties among neighbors, and
      unsafe physical environments - constrain parental practices and reduce opportunities for
      outdoor play in children and youth. Low levels of perceived collective efficacy, a measure of
      perceived neighborhood cohesion and the collective capacity to solve neighborhood problems,
      has been proposed as a social environmental factor that constrains outdoor play by parents
      either attempting to avoid potentially dangerous situations or using defensive behavior by
      upgrading security measures. Moreover, incivilities in the neighborhood physical environment
      (e.g. litter, graffiti, blighted property) may influence parents' perceived collective
      efficacy. Consequently, a child's ability to achieve the recommended minimum of 60 minutes of
      daily physical activity may be limited by a complex interaction between neighborhood social
      and physical environmental factors and the extent to which parents respond by constraining
      offspring outdoor play. The central hypothesis of this research is that modifiable factors in
      the neighborhood social and physical environment result in parental constraint of offspring
      outdoor play, which reduces overall physical activity during critical years of development.
      This research will use qualitative methods to generate a comprehensive understanding of how
      and which environmental factors play a crucial role in parental constraint of outdoor play
      and promote low levels of within-neighborhood physical activity. This ancillary study will
      recruit 32 parents/guardians of participants from the parent study, Translational
      Investigation of Growth and Everyday Routines in Kids (TIGER Kids) Study (USDA
      3092-51000-056-04A), to participate in in-depth interviews. My ultimate goal is to use
      knowledge gained from this ancillary study to generate community-based interventions that
      will target neighborhood factors to successfully reduce parental constraints on outdoor play.

    <ipd_description>There is currently no plan to share IPD. Qualitative data may be difficult to prepare to ensure privacy of the participant. Furthermore, we do not see the benefit of sharing IPD from this study as qualitative data cannot be easily reanalyzed to validate study findings, combined with other datasets, and has a high risk of being analyzed using invalid/non-rigorous methods.</ipd_description>
