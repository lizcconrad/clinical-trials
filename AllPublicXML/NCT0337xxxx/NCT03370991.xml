  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      largely due to accelerated aging-related modifications to vascular health following
      menopause. The vascular endothelium is responsible for producing chemicals that are essential
      for proper vasodilation and blood flow and therefore is involved in maintaining normal blood
      pressure. A major modification that occurs during aging and is accelerated during menopause
      is termed vascular endothelial dysfunction which is characterized by impaired
      endothelium-dependent dilation. This can lead to increased blood pressure, atherosclerosis,
      and increased risk of CVD and death. Nitric oxide (NO) is a chemical produced by the
      endothelium and is essential for normal endothelial function and cardiovascular health.
      Vascular endothelial dysfunction is primarily caused by reduced NO bioavailability secondary
      to excessive oxidative stress. Approximately 3/4 of postmenopausal women have elevated blood
      pressure or hypertension which further worsens endothelial function and increases CVD risk
      through increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Blueberries are rich in phytochemicals
      including anthocyanins, phenolic acids, and pterostilbene. These phytochemicals and their
      metabolites are known to attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation. The overall goal of the
      current study is to assess the efficacy of blueberries to improve vascular endothelial
      dysfunction in this high-risk population and to gain insight into underlying mechanisms. 58
      postmenopausal women with elevated blood pressure and stage 1-HTN and vascular endothelial
      dysfunction at the screening visit will be asked to consume 22 grams freeze-dried blueberry
      powder or placebo powder per day for 12 weeks. Vascular endothelial function will be assessed
      at baseline and 12 weeks. Measurements indicative of vascular nitric oxide production,
      oxidative stress, inflammation, cardiometabolic health, cognitive function, and blueberry
      phytochemical metabolism will be measured at baseline and 12 weeks. Blood pressure will be
      assessed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
