  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disease characterized by repeated partial or complete
      upper airway collapse during sleep, accompanied by arousals or oxygen desaturation. It was
      reported to affect 5.7 %~9.6 % of pediatric population in western countries and 5.5 %~7.8 %
      in China. Children's physical developing and brain functioning as well as quality of life
      (QoL) could be greatly impaired if the disease was left untreated.

      Polysomnography (PSG) was recognized as gold standard for diagnosing OSA. However, for
      pediatric OSA, there exists dispute on the PSG diagnostic criteria.

      Pediatric OSA was mostly caused by hypertrophy of adenoid or palatine tonsillar. For those
      PSG validated patients, nonsurgical management was often prescribed, in addition, surgical
      intervention, i.e. adenotonsillectomy was also commonly applied and had been proved efficient
      both in terms of PSG and in terms of symptoms, behaviors and QoL rated by caregivers.
      However, for children with controversial diagnoses by ATS and ICSD-3, little was known about
      whether surgical or nonsurgical management was effective.

      We aim at investigating the effect of adenotonsillectomy versus nonsurgical management on QoL
      in these subjects. And the hypothesis is that adenotonsillectomy improves QoL better than
      nonsurgical management in children with controversial diagnoses of OSA by ATS and ICSD-3.

      Polysomnography (PSG) was recognized as gold standard for diagnosing OSA. However, for
      pediatric OSA, there exists dispute on the PSG diagnostic criteria. The American Thoracic
      Society standard (ATS) treated children with AHI &gt; 5/H or obstructive apnea index (OAI) &gt; 1/H
      as abnormal, while the International Classification of Sleep Disorder standard (ICSD-3) used
      obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) ≥ 1/H. Due to the differences of the above criteria,
      there were a set of children whose diagnoses were controversial, making the treatment
      decision rather thorny.

    <description>A quality of life questionnaire OSA-18 was used. It was presented by Franco RA and colleagues, and proven good test-retest reliability and internal consistency and widely used for evaluating QoL of snoring children. In this study, QoL was assessed by OSA-18. It was filled by the caregivers with the assistance of designated medical staff before PSG monitoring as well as when subjects were followed up. The questionnaire consisted of 18 items and 5 domains: sleep disturbance, physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, daytime function, and caregiver concerns. Each item was scored 1 to 7, and the total score ranged from 18 to 126 (the higher the score, the more severe the situation).</description>
