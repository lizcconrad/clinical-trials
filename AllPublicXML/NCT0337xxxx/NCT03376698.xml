      This study is designed to investigate dose-dependent effects of low dose colchicine on
      inflammatory responses, endothelial function in type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery
      disease and leukocyte activation. This study also tested the relationship between doses and
      safety issue such as incidence of diarrhea. Eligible patients will be randomly allocated to
      three treatment group: colchicine at 0.5mg per day, 0.25mg per day or placebo for 12 weeks in
      a double blind , parallel group design. High sensitive-CRP at 4 weeks as primary end point
      and flow mediated vasodilatation at 12 weeks as the secondary end point will be measured.

    <textblock>
      Mortality rate in Japanese coronary artery disease (CAD) patients has been deemed the lowest
      among developed countries for the long time. However, cohort study of the investigators based
      on the registry of 8000 patients with CAD and type 2 diabetes has shown that cardiovascular
      mortality of such patients even under the optimized standard therapy and relatively intensive
      control of risk factors was higher than the investigators thought. Given substantial
      experimental evidence suggesting roles of inflammation as a key player in the development of
      atherosclerosis and significant association of enhanced inflammatory reaction and
      cardiovascular events in registry-based cohort of the investigators, the investigators are
      planning of phase 3 trial of colchicine, which is an ancient anti-inflammatory drug, for the
      regulatory approval as a drug preventing of cardiovascular events in diabetic CAD patients
      with enhanced inflammatory reaction. To develop appropriate study protocol of phase 3 trial,
      a dose-finding study is apparently warranted since our pharmacokinetics study and
      pharmacokinetics /pharmacodynamics study showed that colchicine stays in leukocytes with a
      long half life being more than 40 hours and showed consistent inhibition of leukocyte
      activation for more than 48 hours. In terms of safety issue, 0.5mg of colchicine, which has
      been frequently used in several cardiovascular trials, is associated with high incidence of
      diarrhea. As dose-dependency is assumed regarding diarrhea, a dose finding study for safety
      issue is also needed. The investigators, thus, conduct a double-blind randomized controlled
      trial to investigate dose-dependent effects on inflammatory responses using highly
      sensitive-CRP as an indicator, endothelial function using FMD, and incidence of diarrhea
      comparing once daily oral administration of 0.5 mg, 0.25 mg of colchicine and placebo for 12
      weeks in CAD patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and leukocyte activation. The
      investigators focus on patients with type 2 diabetes and leukocyte activation among CAD
      patients for regulatory approval because it is likely that such patients are at highest risk
      and respond well to colchicine.
