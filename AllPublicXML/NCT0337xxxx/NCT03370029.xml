  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary ciliary dyskinesia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal
      ciliary movement and disrupted mucociliary clearance. In uncleaned airways, microorganisms
      and respiratory irritants cause inflammation and infection. Permanent rhinitis and chronic
      sputum cough are typical features in primary ciliary dyskinesia patients. Primary ciliary
      dyskinesia is a disease that threatens lung function from pre-school age. One of the main
      causes of respiratory muscle weakness in chronic lung diseases diseases is worsening of lung
      function. Such a weakness causes alveolar hypoventilation, microatelectasis, reduction of the
      cough strength .The cough strength is important for airway cleaning.

      Exercise capacity is affected in chronic lung diseases. Assessment of exercise capacity in
      chronic lung diseases is prognostically important. Reduced exercise capacity and pulmonary
      function in PCD cause decrease in physical activity level. PCD patients have low quality of
      life and early recognition has been found to affect the quality of life positively. Children
      with chronic illness have higher level of depression than healthy children.

      In literature, no study investigated respiratory muscle strength, exercise capacity and
      physical activity PCD patients. Therefore, the investigators aimed to compare aforementioned
      outcomes in PCD patients and healthy controls.

      According to sample size calculation 26 diagnosed primary ciliary dyskinesia patients and 26
      healthy individuals will be included. Respiratory muscle strength, anaerobic and aerobic
      exercise capacity, physical activity, pulmonary functions, peripheral muscle strength, cough
      strength, respiratory muscle endurance, activity dyspnea perception, quality of life and
      depression will be evaluated. Primary outcome measurements are respiratory muscle strength,
      exercise capacity, physical activity; secondary outcomes are pulmonary functions, peripheral
      muscle strength, cough strength, respiratory muscle endurance, activity dyspnea perception,
      quality of life and depression.
