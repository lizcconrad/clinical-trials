      To collect retrospective clinical outcomes related to acute decompensated heart failure
      cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock and compare current versus
      historical survival rates.

      To collect Inova Heart and Vascular Institute (IHVI) site specific outcomes before and after
      initiation of the Cardiogenic Shock team on January 1, 2017.

      To collect outcomes related to implementation of mechanical circulatory support versus no
      circulatory intervention and type of intervention (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
      versus intracorporeal axial-flow (Impella).

      â€¢ Assess survival at three time points.

      Any patient with cardiogenic shock, whether inpatient or transferred from another facility,
      treated at the Inova Heart and Vascular Institute shall be included in this registry. This
      includes adults with and without decision making capacity over the age of 18 years old.

      The primary investigator (PI) will designate the data points to be included in the database
      in order to assess the efficiency of procedures and protocols in the treatment of cardiogenic
      shock at the IHVI as administered by the Shock team, to identify relationships between
      treatment and negative morbidity and mortality outcomes, and to monitor and improve quality
      of care delivered.
