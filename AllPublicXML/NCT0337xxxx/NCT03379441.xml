      This is an Italian multi-center randomized phase II trial (randomization 2:1) of intravenous
      (IV) MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) versus observation as a maintenance therapy after
      chemo-radiotherapy (either concomitant or sequential, regardless of the type of chemotherapy
      used) in unresectable stage IIIA-IIIB non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.

          -  Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.

          -  Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core, trucut biopsy or excisional
             biopsy of a tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6
             weeks (42 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom
             newly-obtained samples cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety
             concern) may submit an archived specimen only upon agreement from the PI.

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function , all screening labs should be performed within 10
             days of treatment initiation.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Section
             8.14.2). Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically
             sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          -  Has a known history of active Bacillus Tuberculosis (TB)

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., â‰¤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis, or has evidence of interstitial lung disease.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.
