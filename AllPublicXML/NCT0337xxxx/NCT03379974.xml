  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with mild hemophilia A (MHA) bleed infrequently but can in the setting of trauma
      which often is when participating in sports/exercise. Although both exercise and DDAVP
      (desmopressin) can raise Factor 8/Von Willebrand Factor (FVIII/VWF levels), it is not clear
      whether the pathophysiological mechanism is the same. Consequently it is not known if DDAVP
      and exercise would have additive effects in raising FVIII:C and VWF levels or if one would
      one negate the effect of the other. The aim of this 2 center (Sickkids and Nationwide
      Children's), prospective, cross-over design study is to compare the impact of exercise vs.
      DDAVP on hemostasis in patients with MHA and also to investigate the impact of sequentially
      administering these interventions on their hemostatic indices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with mild hemophilia A (MHA) (defined as having a FVIII level of &gt;5% to ≈50%) bleed
      infrequently but can in the setting of trauma which can often is in the context of
      participating in sports/exercise. FVIII levels temporarily rise with stress, exercise and
      with DDAVP (1-desamino-8-Darginine vasopressin, desmopressin). In the case of DDAVP, the
      Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) Hemophilia Team and others have shown that FVIII and
      VWF levels rise by 2-4 fold with DDAVP. Consequently many persons with MHA in an attempt to
      reduce their risk of bleeding take intranasal (IN) DDAVP prior to sports activities/exercise.
      IN DDAVP is reasonably expensive ($300/bottle of Octistim® in Canada and $700/bottle of
      Stimate® in USA), requires fluid restriction, and may be associated with nausea, vomiting,
      seizures and tachyphylaxis.

      Recently, our group completed a pilot/feasibility study to evaluate the impact of a
      prescribed, moderate intensity aerobic exercise regimen on hemostatic indices in 30 children
      with hemophilia A [HA] or B [HB] (all severities) and documented a significant improvement in
      multiple coagulation parameters (platelet count, FVIII:C and von Willebrand factor [VWF])
      with exercise. This improvement was particularly pronounced in 13 post-adolescent males with
      mild-moderate HA. In this sub-cohort, the investigators noted a mean 2.3 fold increase in
      FVIII:C immediately after exercise, which remained significantly elevated at 1.9 fold,1 hour
      after completion of exercise

      These changes in hemostatic variables associated with aerobic exercise may be protective
      against bleeding, and may negate the need to administer IN DDAVP immediately prior to sports
      participation.

      Although both exercise and DDAVP can raise FVIII/VWF levels, it is not clear whether the
      pathophysiological mechanism in which they do this is the same. Consequently it is not known
      if DDAVP and exercise would augment each other's effects in raising FVIII:C and VWF levels or
      if one would one negate the effect of the other. Herein, the investigators propose a
      prospective, interventional study of exercise vs IN DDAVP in 40-50 post adolescent (13-21 yr)
      males with MHA to compare their impact on hemostasis and also to investigate the impact of
      sequentially administering these interventions on hemostatic indices.

    <description>For the exercise intervention the participant will exercise on a stationary cycle-ergometer using the previously-validated, progressively-incremental Godfrey protocol. Per the Godfrey protocol, the participant starts cycling on the calibrated cycle-ergometer with an initial exercise load that is dependent on their height. The workload is increased every minute in standard increments also based on the participant's height. All participants will exercise till they complete 3-minutes of cycling at 85% of their maximum predicted heart rate or till exhaustion (whichever comes first). Upon completion of planned exercise, work load will be decreased to zero watts and participants will be instructed to continue cycling at this cool-down rate for additional 3-minutes, before getting of the ergometer.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Patients of ≥13 years of age and ≤21 years of age with MHA (FVIII:C level of ≥6% to
             ≤50%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A currently circulating or a history of inhibitor (0.5 BU on two or more occasions).
             Inhibitor development is rare in MHA.

          2. History of FVIII infusion (both standard-acting and extended half-life products) or
             DDAVP use in preceding 1 week. Patients will be instructed to hold factor use or DDAVP
             for 1-week prior to participation in study, except for management of acute bleeds, in
             which case they will be instructed to inform the PI via telephone or e-mail.

          3. Patients with severe arthropathy (as determined by the principal investigator)
             interfering with ability to exercise. Severe arthropathy is rare in MHA.

          4. Patients on beta-blockers, anti-platelet agents or regular non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. Celebrex).

          5. Patients who are active smokers (cigarettes, marijuana).

          6. Patients with a history of a recent bleed (in preceding 2 weeks) in any location or a
             joint/muscle bleed in the lower limbs in the preceding 4 weeks.

          7. Co-existence of a congenital bleeding disorder other than MHA (e.g. VWD).

          8. Patients with an active infectious or inflammatory condition. This includes previously
             identified HIV, active hepatitis B or C as reflected in elevated AST, ALT, RNA
             positivity for hepatitis B or C. HIV, hepatitis B and C are very rare in the age group
             (13-21 years) we hope to accrue in the proposed study.

          9. Patients who for medical reasons should not receive DDAVP [those with renal or CNS
             disease (e.g. brain tumor)] or have previously experienced adverse events with DDAVP
             (e.g. hypotensive event, seizure).

    <ipd_description>To ensure the safety of patients and to confirm the validity of our hypothesis, we plan to:
Meet after the first 10 patients have completed the study.
Analyze data from first 10 patients. This includes safety data as well as results of the blood tests including the standard hemostasis testing (FVIII;C, VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, VWF:CBA, VWF:pp), platelet function (PFA), Thromboelastography (TEG) and Thrombin generation.
Determine whether there are measurable outcomes justifying further enrollment and DSMB will be able to make recommendations regarding terminating the study or amending the protocol if they deem that there are safety issues.
If any of the first 10 subjects develops any unexpected medical complication we will suspend recruitment pending re-evaluation of the study by the DSMB.</ipd_description>
