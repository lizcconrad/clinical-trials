  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective chart review using TriHealth Electronic Privacy Identification Center
      (EPIC) to determine whether gynecologic surgeons at a large community hospital are already
      meeting the recently recommended best practice of supporting the vaginal apex.

      The prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in the United States is estimated to be between
      40-50% with an anticipated increase over the next several decades. Approximately 300,000
      women undergo surgeries to repair POP in the United States every year. Following pelvic
      reconstructive surgery, recurrence rates of symptomatic prolapse range between 6-30%. Our
      understanding of pelvic anatomy and its support has been significantly improved over recent
      decades, with many researchers reporting on details and mechanics previously not understood.

      In November 2017, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a new
      practice bulletin outlining the current standard of care for the treatment of women with
      pelvic organ prolapse. In this bulletin, they state that a hysterectomy alone is not adequate
      treatment for pelvic organ prolapse, and further that any woman having a hysterectomy for
      pelvic organ prolapse should undergo a concurrent apical suspension procedure as a standard
      of care.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of patients already meeting the
      recently recommended best practice of supporting the vaginal apex at the time of hysterectomy
      for pelvic organ prolapse among the population who underwent the surgery performed at a
      TriHealth facility between October 2012 and October 2017.
