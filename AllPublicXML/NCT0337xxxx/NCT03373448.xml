      By each clinician participating in the study; 40 patients (20+20) diagnosed with mild to
      moderate peri-implantitis, defined as 2-4 mm peri-implant bone loss, will be randomized to
      either test treatment with Labrida BioClean® or control treatment with titanium curettes. In
      total 240 patients (120 test and 120 controls) treated by 6 clinicians at 6 centers will be
      included in the study.

      4.1 Study design The study will be a prospective multicentre randomized, examiner blinded
      controlled clinical trial of 24 months duration. Change in mucosal inflammation will be
      reported after 6 months while the true endpoint parameters i.e., peri-implant attachment will
      be reported after 1 and 2 years.

      4.2 Treatment allocation and blinding Patients will be allocated either to test (Labrida
      BioClean® or control (titanium curettes) treatment by computer-generated block randomization
      to ensure equal sample sizes. The examiners will be blinded to the treatment allocation.

      4.3 Study setting In total six centres will be included. Patient screening, inclusions and
      all clinical examinations will be performed by a board-certified specialist in
      periodontology, registered dental hygienist or specialist in prosthetics at each centre.
      Treatments will be performed by a dental hygienist or a board-certified specialist in
      periodontology.

      4.4 Patients 40 patients (20+20) diagnosed with mild to moderate peri-implantitis, defined as
      peri-implant bone loss 2 -4 mm, will be included by each clinician participating in the
      study.

      4.5 Recruitment of patients

      Patients referred to or seeking care in the included clinics will be screened for inclusion.

    <description>Labrida BioClean- chitosan device.The brush bristles of the test device (Labrida BioClean® LABRIDA AS, Oslo Norway) are made of the biopolymer chitosan. Any debris left from the chitosan bristles is completely biocompatible and will dissolve or be resorbed thus not causing harm to the tissues surrounding the implant. Chitosan is made from chitin derived from shell of marine crustaceans such as shrimp and crab, however chemically modified and thus not even considered to be animally derived. Chitosan has been approved for use in e.g., surgical bandages, as a haemostatic agent and as dietary supplement used in a wide range of nutritional and health products. Chitosan has also been documented to be non-allergenic and it has been suggested that chitosan has anti-inflammatory properties.</description>

The treatment will be repeated every three months until the terminal examination after 24 months. Debridement is performed with local anaesthesia as needed. Healthy sites will not be retreated.</description>
