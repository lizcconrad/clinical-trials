  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intended to investigate the effect of imagining a movement task on dynamic balance
      of sedentary university students. Two groups with good mental imaging ability were studied;
      one group receiving instructions on mental imagery and the other served as a control
      receiving no particular intervention. Any improvement in the balance ability was measured
      using the star excursion balance test (SEBT); for it has good to excellent test-retest
      reliability and validity as established by several researchers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor imagery (MI) refers to a cognitive process during which the representation of a
      specific motor action is internally simulated without producing an overt body movement. Motor
      imagery is now widely used as a technique to enhance motor learning and to enhance recovery
      during rehabilitation of various conditions such as sports injuries, stroke, etc. Several
      studies have also shown improvement in strength, function, and use of both upper and lower
      extremities in chronic stroke. Present study aimed to identify its effectiveness in improving
      dynamic balance of individuals without any clinical problem. Such improvement, if any, may be
      useful in early balance and proprioceptive training during the maximum protection phase of
      joint injuries, fractures, or even rehabilitation of other clinical conditions affecting
      balance. It may have benefits in maintaining / improving movements in athletes after injuries
      as well as the general less active population, including the elderly population.

    <description>Those meeting the inclusion criteria were selected (n=22). Each participant was necessary to complete the Movement Imagery Questionnaire in a quiet room. Finally, each participant assigned a score by using a 7-point scale regarding the ease/difficulty associated with representing each movement mentally. Next their baseline balance measurement was performed using the SEBT. Later this group had 9 motor imagery sessions, each session for 15 minutes, 3 sessions (alternate days) per week for a total of 3 weeks. Reassessment of balance was done after every 3 sessions.</description>
