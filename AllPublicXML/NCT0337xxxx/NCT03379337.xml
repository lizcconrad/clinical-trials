  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to use the principle of fluorescence to identify oral diseases
      not readily visible to the naked eye. A imaging device with a removable and modular head
      consisting of arrays of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) with differing wavelengths (405nm,450nm
      or white) was used to image teeth to detect fluorescent biomarkers such as porphyrins
      associated with poor oral health (plaque). The process utilizes illumination of the teeth and
      gums using a specific array of LEDs in the visible and near-visible spectrum and is
      non-invasive. Successful implementation of the device would provide proof-of- concept
      validation for its use as a safe, rapidly deployable solution to assess oral hygiene.

      To use the device, an interchangeable head with a specific LED wavelength was selected (to
      target a specific oral disease). The optical filter can be exchanged for another if necessary
      (this is done prior to the subject visit as to not prolong the time of the visit). During
      operation, LED intensity can be altered using the rotary dimmer switch. The procedure took
      place during a routine dental visit once consent was obtained. The device was covered in a
      clear disposable plastic sheath (Consolidated Plastics, Stow, OH) or equivalent sterile
      disposable camera bag. After both the subject and clinician wore UV protective eyeware, a
      series of images and videos were taken. These included detailed frames of all 4 incisors and
      all 4 canines. A video of the camera aperture passing over the select teeth was also taken.
      Additional images focusing on areas of interest to the clinician were taken, with area of
      capture and device mode recorded. The total time required to capture all images and video is
      expected to be approximately 5 minutes. As a control, an Acteon Soprocare a commercial device
      operating under the same fluorescence principle was also used. Images and video of the
      aforementioned eight target teeth in each mode were similarly captured for comparison to the
      test device.

    <description>The target teeth positions for imaging included 4 incisors and all 4 canines. Only the vestibular and interproximal regions were of interest. Images were taken of these target teeth positions regardless of whether or not they exhibited plaque, consisted of full or partial restorations, contained major cracks/fractures, chips, or were missing. Other captured images included any abnormality of the tooth or gum exhibiting red fluorescence physically accessible by the devices.</description>
