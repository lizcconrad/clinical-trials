  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ensuring follow-up for patients after discharge from the emergency department (ED) has long
      been a concern for ED care providers. The current technology of text messaging may be able to
      assist us in improving follow-up rates. In addition, having a quick and easy communication
      tool to be in touch with providers may improve overall patient satisfaction. This study is
      designed to evaluate the usage of text messaging to improve follow-up appointment compliance
      from the Emergency Department. In this study, a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      will be performed (involving patients scheduled by Emergency Department Nurse Navigators to
      follow up with Family Medicine) in which patients will be randomized to a texting appointment
      reminder versus standard-of-care (no texting reminder) group. Texted patients will receive
      reminders 3 days and 1 day prior to their follow-up appointment. In addition, the patients
      will have the ability to text back-and-forth with the Nurse Navigators in order to ask
      questions/request clarification if needed. Chart review will be performed of both groups to
      evaluate the number of follow-up appointments that patients attended versus rescheduled
      versus did not attend/reschedule. These values will then be compared to the retrospective
      chart review previously performed to evaluate for non-inferiority of text messaging as a
      means of improving patient attendance at follow-up appointments.

    <description>To communicate with intervention patients after discharge from the ED, we will use a bidirectional text messaging service provided by another physician's research group within the University of Iowa. The nurse navigator will enter the patient's study identification number, first and last name and cell phone onto a secure study website established by this research group.
Patients will, as previously mentioned, have had their cell phone number tested in the text messaging system prior to leaving the Emergency Department (this includes the control group).
Patient's will receive a text message 3 days, and 1 day, prior to their scheduled follow-up appointment with Family Medicine (this appointment having been scheduled through the Emergency Department Nurse Navigators). Each text message will remind the patient of the date/time of their appointment, and provide them a link containing a map with the location of their appointment.</description>
