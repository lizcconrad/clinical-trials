  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of removal of spores and dirt from the
      skin using a single cloth bath against a cloth bath with extra rinse step, to establish
      whether the extra rinse stage will lead to the removal of a higher level of spores and dirt.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the ability of two test materials to
      remove Clostridium difficile (ATCC #700057) spores with a tripartite soil load from subjects'
      forearms. For this study, removal of Clostridium difficile and the associated organic soil
      load will be used as an indicator of potential removal efficacy for difficult-to-remove
      microorganisms and associated organic matter from human skin.

      All test materials are currently marketed products
