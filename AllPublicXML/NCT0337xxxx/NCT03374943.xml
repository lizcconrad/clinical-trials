  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of drug KB004 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Eligible
      patients with measurable tumours will receive an initial trace (5mg) dose of zirconium
      labelled KB004 (89ZrKB004) on day 1 followed by sequential Positron emission tomography (PET)
      imaging over 1 week to determine its biodistribution into GBM and normal tissues. Safety
      assessments and pharmacokinetic (movement of drug) sampling will also be undertaken over this
      time. On Day 8, patients commence weekly KB004 infusions over 2 hours with standard
      premedications. Three cohorts are planned in this study (3.5mg/kg, 5.25 mg/kg, 7.9 mg/kg;
      additional dose levels may be explored based on toxicity, efficacy and biodistribution data
      as determined by the safety monitoring committee). On day 36, patients receive both 89ZrKB004
      and KB004, allowing assessment of receptor occupancy to guide recommended phase two dose
      (RPTD) determination. Response rate (RANO) and survival data will be collected and patients
      benefiting may continue KB004 treatment until disease progression. Primary objective: to
      determine the toxicity and recommended phase two dose (RPTD) of KB004 in patients with
      advanced Glioblastoma (GBM).

      Secondary objectives: to determine the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of 89ZrKB004; to
      determine frequency of EphA3 (ephrin receptor A3) positive glioblastoma in archival specimens
      and by 89ZrKB004 scans, and correlate with known biomarkers; to describe response rates per
      RANO criteria (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria) and pharmacodynamics following
      KB004 infusion; Exploratory objectives: to perform exploratory analysis between clinical
      outcomes and biodistribution/Pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) data, including from
      matched biopsies.

    <description>Three patients are recruited per dose level, 3 dose levels. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) defined as Grade 4 neutropenia &gt; 7 day duration Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia &gt; 7 day duration Grade 4 anaemia &gt; 7 day duration Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic adverse events which do not resolve within 48 hours with maximal supportive care.
Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 infusion reactions despite maximal supportive care and dose reductions Significant intracranial haemorrhage not reasonably attributed to other cause More than 14 days of treatment delay due to attributable toxicity Other toxicities as determined by the investigators. In the absence of any dose limiting toxicity in a cohort, escalate to the next dose level. If one DLT is seen in the first three patients of a cohort, an additional three patients will be recruited to that cohort. If two or more DLT's are seen in any cohort, that cohort will be deemed the maximum tolerated dose.</description>
