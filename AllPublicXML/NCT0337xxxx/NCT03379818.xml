  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies regarding word learning have focused on understanding when and how infants learn
      words. At 24 months, typically developing infants know between 200 and 300 words and add new
      words to their vocabularies at a rapid rate. It is also during the first years of life that
      some principles that promote vocabulary learning are developed. The shape bias, which is a
      tendency to infer that objects that share the same shape will also share the same name, is
      the one that has been studied the most. At 24 months, typically developing infants use this
      principle as a strategy to learn novel words. In contrast, Late Talkers (children with a
      language delay in the absence of a physiological, cognitive or genetic disorder that may
      account for this delay) do not exhibit this preference. It has been found that teaching
      typically developing infants a shape bias prior to the end of the second year of life can
      boosts their word learning. Despite this, the possibility of teaching Late Talkers this
      principle and its effect on their vocabulary and language development has not been explored.

      Over a series of 9 weekly sessions, Late Talkers (diagnosed by Language Therapists from the
      Birmingham Community Healthcare National Health Services Foundation Trust, United Kingdom)
      will be introduced to one of two possible interventions: a shape bias intervention and a more
      conventional intervention called &quot;specific word intervention&quot;. Both interventions will be
      compared after 9 weeks. One year later, a follow up study will be conducted to assess the
      long-term effects each intervention has in word learning. Participants will be referred by a
      Speech and Language Therapists from the Birmingham Community Healthcare National Health
      Services Foundation Trust, United Kingdom, and all assessments and interventions will take
      place at the Infant and Child Lab at the University of Birmingham, United Kingdom.

      The objectives of the present study are:

      A. To investigate whether it is possible to teach Late Talkers to attend to objects' shapes
      as a useful property for learning and generalizing novel object labels.

      B. To assess the benefits that this intervention programme has on Late Talkers' short-term
      vocabulary development compared to an intervention where infants will be taught specific
      words ('specific word' intervention).

      C. Assess whether the success of teaching Late Talkers a shape bias for noun extension is
      related to their sensitivity to object shape similarities.

      D. Assess whether the success of teaching Late Talkers a shape bias for noun extension is
      related to their ability of sustain their attention to novel objects that are presented to
      them.

      E. To assess the benefits of the intervention programme on language and cognitive development
      one year after the intervention compared to the 'specific word' intervention

    <intervention_model_description>Over a series of 9 weekly sessions, children diagnosed as Late Talkers will be assessed in different tasks that can be divided into 5 phases: Vocabulary and developmental assessments, initial cognitive assessments, training sessions, word learning test 1, and word learning test 2. Each group (shape training group and specific word training group) will receive a different training programme, however the other assessments will be identical across the groups. In the shape training group, participants will be taught to attend to shape when learning and extending novel labels. In the specific word training group, participants will be taught specific words that they do not know. Before and after the intervention, participants vocabulary will be assessed to compare which intervention enhances word learning. One year later, all participants will be assessed with a language test and a cognitive test. The same assessments will be used in both groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two posible groups. In both groups, they will receive an intervention, however participants and their parents will not know which one.

    <time_frame>This will be done at week 8 and 9 after starting the intervention.</time_frame>

    <measure>Efficacy of each intervention programme</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be done by assessing infants before (week 1) and after (week 9 ) the intervention programmes.</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess the benefits of each intervention programme in the infants' general vocabulary development, parents/guardians will fill in a vocabulary checklist filled in before and an intervention (for both types). We will compare the vocabulary growth in the group of children that took part in the shape bias intervention programme with that of the group of children that took part in the 'specific word' intervention. A significant larger increase in the shape bias intervention compared to the 'specific word' intervention will provide information regarding the success or efficacy of the shape bias intervention.</description>

    <description>This training programme will be similar to a typical word learning intervention. Infants will be introduced to 28 real objects and their names (e.g. biscuit, trousers). These objects will be divided into 7 sets of four words, and during each session, infants will be presented with one of this sets. Each session will consist of a 15 min play session in which each object will be presented at least 10 times and each object name will be mentioned at least 10 times. Additionally, techniques such as focused stimulation and modelling target words, which have proved to be useful for word learning, will be used.</description>

    <description>In the shape training intervention, infants will be presented with four novel words paired with four novel sets of objects. Each set consists of two exemplars with the same shape but with different colors and textures, and a contrasting object. Each set will be presented in a play session, and the name of the objects will be mentioned at least 10 times. The other three sets of exemplars will be presented in the same way. Each session will last 15 minutes. This intervention is based on a study conducted by Smith and colleagues (2002), where they found that typically developing infants that are taught to attend to shape at 17 months old, can enhance significantly their word learning.</description>

    <description>In this intervention, participants will be taught the names of 28 real objects. The target words have been selected from the &quot;Wordbank database&quot;, which is an open database that lists the proportion of children that know a specific word at a specific age. Twenty-eight words that are understood by 80% of the total child population at 25 months were randomly selected as target words. Techniques such as focused stimulation and modelling target words, which have proved to be useful for word learning, will be used.</description>
