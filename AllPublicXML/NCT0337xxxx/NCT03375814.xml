      The effect of Crocina on the production of IL-4, IL-1 bet, IL-17, IL-10 and TGF-beta: The
      effect of crocina on gene expression of transcription factors T-bet, GATA-3. FOXP3, ROR-γt,;
      The effect of helper T cells type one and two, regulatory T cells and T helper type 17 cells;
      the effect of crocina on the reduction of pain and joint inflammation. Design: Randomized,
      Double-blind and Placebo controlled; Study population: Patients with Osteoarthritis; Volume:
      40 persons; Method: Osteoarthritis patients will be divided into two groups according to age
      and sex; Crocina tablets will be prescribed to the first group a tablet 15 mg daily along

      with the conventional medicines; Blood sampling of patients will be done before drug
      administering and four months after treatment. Major Inclusion Criteria: Osteoarthritis
      patients with age 40-75 years; The severity of joint damage between grade 2 and 3; Patients
      without history of injury; Patients with body mass index less than 30. Major Exclusion
      Criteria: Osteoarthritis patients with age 40-75 years; The severity of joint damage in grade
      one and four; Patients with history of injury and body mass index 30 or more. Intervention:
      Treatment with prescription of drug at dose of 15 mg daily crocin in the study group and
      placebo in the control group. Time: 4 months; Main outcome Measures: Osteoarthritis, Pain,
      Inflammation, Crocina, IL-4, IL-1 beta, IL-17, IL-10, TGF- beta, Cell surface protein CD127,
      The expression of T-bet, GATA-3, FOXP3, ROR-γt and the number of Th1, Th2, T-regulatory and

      Osteoarthritis patients will be divided into two groups according to age and sex; Crocina
      tablets will be prescribed to the first group a tablet 15 mg daily along with the
      conventional medicines. 30 pills of crocina or placebo in cans quite similar and be encoded
      with Excel Software will be given to the patients completely random; The distributor and the
      patient will have no knowledge of the contents of the cans; After the end of each month, the
      patients will receive similar to their previous code. Blood sampling of patients will be done
      before drug administering and four months after the treatment. Major Inclusion Criteria:
      Osteoarthritis patients with age 40 to 75 years; The severity of joint damage between grade 2
      and 3; Patients without history of injury; Patients with the Body Mass Index (BMI) less than
      30. Major Exclusion Criteria: Osteoarthritis patients with age less than 40 and more than 75;
      The severity of joint damage in the grade one and four; Patients with history of injury and
      body mass index 30 or more. Intervention: Treatment with prescription of drug at dose of 15
      mg daily crocin in the study group and placebo in the control group; Time: 4 months. Main
      Outcome Measures: Osteoarthritis, Pain, Inflammation, Crocin, IL-4, IL-1 beta, IL-17, IL-10,
