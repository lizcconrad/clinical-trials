  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that the eosinophilic inflammation of nasal mucosa is
      associated with the uncontrolled condition of chronic rhinosinusitis after surgery. However,
      the definition of the eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis is not very clear. Japanese
      researchers have designed a scoring system to diagnose eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis.
      In this study, the investigators hope to examine the practicability of this scoring system
      and have a better knowledge of eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis in china.The retrospective
      study was conducted in a tertiary hospital. Participants received functional endoscopic sinus
      surgery more than 1 years were called back for evaluation. A diagnosis cut off value of
      eosinophil count was determined by the surgery prognosis. Then different factors were
      compared between participants with eosinophilic CRS and those with non-eosinophilic CRS to
      establish the appropriated diagnosis approach for eosinophilic CRS.
