  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MAPA is the reference method to estimate the PA during the SAHOS. The MAPA can be
      recommended over 48 hours: indeed, the PA falls at the beginning of every apnea then
      increases gradually up to a pressif peak arising at the time of the ventilatoire resumption.
      These variations arise under the influence of 4 stimulus: the désaturation in O2, the rise of
      the PaCO2, the increase of the respiratory effort and the microawakening of the end of apnea
      who are at the origin of a sympathetic stimulation.

      Consequently a better diagnostic approach of the HTA (confirmation of a resistant HTA, an
      identification of the masked HTA and the patients &quot; not dipper &quot; by the MAPA), the
      identification of the SAHOS, and a better coverage) of the associated cardiovascular risk
      factors are essential and establish a stake in public health.

      To investigator's knowledge, no datum or study on the association HTA-SAHOS and its
      consequences was until then realized in the French overseas departments.

      In Guadeloupe, data on the relationships between arterial hypertension and obstructive sleep
      apnea are unavailable. The aim of this study was: to assess the frequency of hypertension and
      non-dipper pattern evaluated by 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in an adult
      population identified obstructive sleep apnea/non-obstructive sleep apnea during overnight
      polygraphy ; to determine the cardio-metabolic factors associated with obstructive sleep
      apnea.

The control of the material and its tolerance, the data supplied by the service providers (bodies of ventilation at home) will be estimated by the investigator of the service of pneumology. IDE the unity of cardiovascular explorations will plan and will realize a 2nd one MAPA after 3 months of ventilation in PPC.</description>
