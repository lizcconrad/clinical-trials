          5. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1

          6. Willing to undergo core needle or incisional biopsy to obtain fresh tumor tissue
             specimens

          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function as evidenced by laboratory testing

          2. Has received pembrolizumab, or prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1,

             pituitary insufficiency, etc) is not considered a form of systemic treatment

         11. Has evidence of interstitial lung disease, history of non-infectious pneumonitis that
             required steroids, or current pneumonitis

         12. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 200 mmHg
             and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 120 mmHg) on more than one occasion in the month
             before planned day of infusion

         13. Currently taking 3 or more anti-hypertensive medications

         14. Prior history of hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy

             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment

         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (positive for HIV p24
             antigen or HIV 1/2 antibodies)

         18. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
