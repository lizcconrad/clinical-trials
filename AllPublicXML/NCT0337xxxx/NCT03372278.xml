      The objectives of this study are to confirm the safety and performance of the Zimmer Maxera
      Cup mated with either a BIOLOX® delta or BIOLOX® OPTION femoral head when used in primary
      total hip arthroplasty.

      In total 250 patients will be enrolled into the study at up to 10 sites.All potential study
      subjects will be required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.

          -  Patient is skeletally mature.

          -  Patient qualifies for primary unilateral or simultaneous bilateral total hip
             arthroplasty (THA) based on physical exam and medical history including at least one
             of the following:

               -  Osteoarthritis

               -  Avascular necrosis (AVN)

               -  Inflammatory arthritis

               -  Rheumatoid arthritis with adequate bone quality

               -  Post-traumatic arthritis

               -  Congenital hip dysplasia.

          -  Patient has no history of previous total hip replacement or arthrodesis of the
             affected hip joint(s). Patient has a Harris Hip Score &lt;70 in the affected hip and a
             Harris Hip pain rating of moderate, marked, or disabled.

          -  Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Patient is willing and able to cooperate in the required post-operative therapy.

          -  Patient is willing and able to complete scheduled follow-up evaluations as described
             in the Informed Consent.

          -  Patient has participated in the Informed Consent process and has signed the Ethics
             Committee approved informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is:

               -  A prisoner

               -  Mentally incompetent or unable to understand what participation in the study
                  entails.

               -  Anticipated to be non-compliant

          -  The patient has a neuromuscular disorder, vascular disorder or other condition that

          -  The patient has local bone tumors and/or cysts in the portion of bone to be retained
             in the operative hip that could inhibit implant fixation.

          -  The patient has insufficient bone stock or poor bone quality to fix the component.
             Insufficient bone stock exists in the presence of metabolic bone disease (i.e.

             absorption seen on x-ray.

          -  The patient has osteoradionecrosis in the affected hip.

          -  The patient has a neuromuscular condition in the ipsilateral or contralateral limb
             which affects lower limb function.

          -  The patient has loss of abductor musculature in the affected hip.

          -  The patient has a vascular (large and small vessel disease) insufficiency.

          -  The patient has had previous prosthetic hip replacement device (any type, including
             surface replacement arthroplasty, endoprosthesis, etc.) in the joint to be operated.

          -  The patient has had previous girdlestone procedure (resection arthroplasty) or
             surgical fusion of the hip to be operated.

          -  The patient has an acute femoral neck fracture in the operative hip.

          -  The patient has had a procedure on the operative hip in the last 6 months (i.e.
             arthroscopy, ORIF femoral neck fracture, etc).

          -  The patient has undergone a total hip replacement, endoprosthesis, or surface
             arthroplasty of the contralateral (opposite side) hip within the past 6 months
             regardless of whether the previous hip was enrolled in this clinical study.

          -  The patient has a moderate to severe limb length discrepancy greater than 3.2 cm.

          -  The patient has an active, old or remote infection in or about the affected hip joint
             or an infection distant from the hip joint that may spread to the hip hematogenously.

          -  The patient has poor skin coverage around the affected hip joint.

          -  The patient has a diagnosed systemic disease that could affect his/her safety or the
             study outcome.

          -  The patient is currently receiving, or within the past three months, has received any
             drug known to potentially interfere with bone/soft tissue healing (e.g. long-term
             chronic systemic steroid or inhaler steroid therapy).

          -  The patient has received an investigational drug or device within the previous 6
             months.

          -  The patient is known to be pregnant.

          -  The patient is unwilling or unable to give informed consent, or to comply with the
             followup program.

          -  The patient is known to have a highly communicable disease that may limit follow-up.

          -  The patient has a known sensitivity or allergic reaction to one or more of the
             implanted materials which include metal and ceramic.
