  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium is characterized by encroachment of a ﬂeshy fibrovascular tissue from the bulbar
      conjunctiva on to the cornea. Although previously thought to be a solely degenerative
      disease, a new evidence has demonstrated the role of cell proliferation and inflammation in
      the pathogenesis of pterygium , and also by the clinical data that steroids are beneﬁcial in
      halting progression of impending recurrent pterygium . Many techniques have been developed
      for pterygium surgery over time. The simple method of removing the head and body of pterygium
      and leaving the sclera uncovered, the so-called bare-sclera technique, has been associated
      with high recurrence rates of 32-88% . To reduce the recurrence rate after pterygium surgery
      with a bare-sclera technique, various adjunctive modalities have been used such as chemical
      agents including mitomycin C , 5-ﬂuorouracil . Furthermore, when removal of pterygium is
      accompanied with a graft, such as conjunctival autograft or amniotic membrane transplantation
      , lower recurrence rates have been achieved . However, it remains unclear why the bare sclera
      technique has poorer outcome with higher recurrence rate than other procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the factors that may have a role in the outcome of pterygium surgery is postoperative
      conjunctival inflammation , treatment of which has been demonstrated to improve the ﬁnal
      outcome . It has been shown that persistent conjunctival inflammation around the surgical
      site after pterygium surgery is present in 31-84% of cases with amniotic membrane
      transplantation, and in 15% of eyes with conjunctival autograft . However, the rate of
      conjunctival inflammation after pterygium surgery with a bare-sclera technique has not been
      reported in literature . Also, it has been suggested that higher recurrence rate after
      pterygium with amniotic membrane transplantation compared with conjunctival autograft may be
      due to higher rate of postoperative conjunctival inflammation . Therefore, it may be
      speculated that higher recurrence rate after pterygium surgery with a bare-sclera technique
      is partly due to higher rate of postoperative conjunctival inflammation .

    <description>it is a grade to follow up the recurrence of pterygium which classifies pterygium excision outcome from grades 1 to 4:
Grade 1 : indicates a normal appearance of the operated site .
Grade 2 : indicates the presence of fine episcleral vessels in the excised area, extending to the limbus but without any fibrous tissue .
Grade 3 : indicates fibrovascular tissue in the excised area, reaching to the limbus but not invading the cornea and significant conjunctival recurrence .
Grade 4: indicates a true corneal recurrence with fibrovascular tissue invading the cornea.</description>
