  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance is an increasingly serious problem in Switzerland which is associated
      with the exposure and overall uptake of antibiotics in a population. Reduced antibiotic
      prescribing for outpatients is paralleled by a decrease in antibiotic resistance rates.

      In a recent pragmatic trial the investigators found only promising yet not very conclusive
      results as those were present only in some groups. This nationwide antibiotic stewardship
      program with routine feedback on antibiotic prescribing was not associated with an overall
      change of antibiotic use. In older children, adolescents, and younger adults less antibiotics
      were prescribed, but not consistently over the entire intervention period.

      Hence, the investigators now aim to evaluate a better tailored program to obtain a better
      understanding of the effects on patient-relevant outcomes, on antibiotic resistance, and of
      the underlying mechanisms leading to different effects in certain subgroups of patients.

      The investigators plan to evaluate a nationwide antibiotic stewardship program combining
      routine prescription feedback with the provision of physician and patient education material
      in primary care physician in Switzerland. The project is conducted within the framework of
      the National Program on antimicrobial resistance by the Swiss National Science Foundation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized pragmatic controlled trial in all primary care physicians in Switzerland
      e.g. the top 75% antibiotic prescribers. The trial is based on routinely collected individual
      reimbursement claims data of the three largest Swiss health insurers covering an estimated
      number of 3.8 million Swiss residents, and on routinely collected surveillance data on
      antibiotic resistance. A pragmatic trial design is used. Physicians in the intervention group
      will not have to provide informed consent but they may opt out and decline receiving any
      interventional information. Physicians in the control group will not be notified. This
      approach is justifiable and has previously been approved by all Swiss ethical committees.
      Investigators will take any measures to guarantee the confidentiality of all collected data.
      Data provided by health insurers on physicians and patients will be completely anonymized.

      This is a nationwide study enrolling all registered primary care physicians (general internal
      medicine and pediatrics) with more than 100 patient contacts in the year prior to the start
      of the trial. All primary care providers with shared ZSR (Zahlstellenregister) numbers (e.g.
      ambulatory settings in hospitals where individual physicians cannot be identified) and with
      less than 100 patient contacts per year will be excluded.
