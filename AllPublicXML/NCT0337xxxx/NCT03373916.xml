  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amid consistently worsening suicide rates, in 2012 the U.S.Surgeon General's National
      Strategy for Suicide Prevention proposed to &quot;change the narrative&quot; about suicide prevention
      to include a focus on promoting hope and belongingness. Despite hopelessness and thwarted
      belongingness being among the most replicated risk factors for suicide, many widely
      implemented suicide prevention efforts instead emphasize the identification of acute suicide
      risk and referral to mental health treatment services. However, there are very few health
      service interventions known to reduce suicides among those identified as high risk. Those
      interventions shown to be effective have not achieved the wide scale implementation necessary
      to alter the trend of increasing suicide deaths. New interventions are needed, and one
      promising, scalable intervention with a novel approach to addressing the risk factors
      advocated by the Surgeon General is peer mentorship. A peer mentorship intervention, PREVAIL,
      has been piloted in a two-site randomized controlled trial (N=70) and is acceptable and
      feasible with enrollment of nearly half of eligible high-risk patients, mean completion of
      over 6 mentorship sessions, and 85% of sessions meeting fidelity standards for addressing the
      intended targets of hope and belongingness.

      The aims of this hybrid effectiveness-implementation study are:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of the PREVAIL peer mentorship intervention for
      reducing suicide attempts and suicidal ideation among recently hospitalized adult psychiatric
      patients at high risk for suicide.

      Specific Aim 2: Examine the mechanisms of peer mentorship by measuring the effects of PREVAIL
      on potential mediators,including hope and belongingness.

      Specific Aim 3: Identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of PREVAIL.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicide attempts (measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Any suicide attempt as measured according to an electronic self-report version of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSR-S). The definition of suicide attempt for the primary outcome will consist of any actual suicide attempt, aborted suicide attempt, or interrupted suicide attempt according to the CSSR-S.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in suicidal ideation (measured by the Beck Suicide Scale (BSS))</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's current suicidal ideation as measured by the Beck Suicide Scale (BSS). The BSS is a self-report 19-item scale preceded by five screening items. The BSS and its screening items assess thoughts, plans and intent to commit suicide. All 24 items are rated on a three-point scale (0 to 2). Total scores could range from 0 to 48 (if the screening items are included). No specific cut-off scores exist to classify severity. Increasing scores reflect greater suicide risk.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicide attempts (measured by the medical record)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Any suicide attempt as notated in the patients electronic medical record. The definition of suicide attempt for the primary outcome will consist of any actual suicide attempt, aborted suicide attempt, or interrupted suicide attempt.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self efficacy to avoid suicidal action (measured by the Self Efficacy to Avoid Suicidal Action Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient's self efficacy to avoid suicidal action, as measured by the Self Efficacy to Avoid Suicidal Action Scale (SEASA). To indicate level of confidence, respondents rate each item on a 6-point scale (0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%). Lower scores on the SEASA were found to be associated with a higher incidence and greater severity of suicide attempts.</description>

    <description>A 12-item measure that contains two sub-scales reflecting respondents' personal capacity for change (agency) and knowledge regarding how to achieve change (pathways).

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (measured by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF))</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) consists of 14 items, assesses satisfaction with a variety of life domains such as physical health, work, and social relationships. The scoring of the Q-LES-Q-SF involves summing only the first 14 items to yield a raw total score. The last two items are not included in the total score but are standalone items. The raw total score ranges from 14 to 70. Higher level of enjoyment and satisfaction with life are reflected in higher scores.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functional Status (measured by the SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 covers domains including: (1) physical functioning; (2) role-physical; (3) bodily pain; (4) general health; (5) vitality; (6) social functioning; (7) role emotional; and (8) mental health. Summary scores are calculated by summing factor-weighted scores across all 8 subscales, with factor weights derived from a US-based general population sample. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hopelessness (measured by the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS))</measure>

    <description>Measure of patients' negative attitudes about the future and will be the primary measure of hopelessness. The BHS consists of 20 true-false statements that measure the degree of pessimism and negativity about the future. Summed scores range from 0 to 20. Scores provide a measure of the severity of self-reported hopelessness: 0-3 minimal, 4-8 mild, 9-14 moderate, and 15-20 severe.</description>

    <description>A Peer Specialist will be making weekly follow-up contact with study participants in the community or by telephone for 3 months following hospital discharge. The content of the peer mentorship interactions will be based on the manual developed by the study team and will address protective factors such as hope and belongingness.</description>

    <description>The EUC condition will consist of a &quot;caring message&quot; from the study team via e-mail or text message (based on the participant's preference) 24-72 hours after discharge. An example message is, &quot;We hope things are going well for you since you left the hospital. If you wish to reply, we'd be glad to hear from you&quot;. A list of local mental health resources will be available if participants reply and during the 3 and 6-month follow-up assessments. The EUC condition is modeled on prior studies of caring letters and brief contacts by health professionals after suicidal crisis and national recommendations to provide post-crisis follow-up contacts.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Peer mentorship</intervention_name>
    <description>The peer mentor will meet with the participant for the first time while the participant is still in the hospital. Sessions will be scheduled according to the participant's preferences, with a suggested maximum frequency of twice weekly for the first two weeks, weekly for weeks 3 to 8, and then every other week for the last month. Allowable meeting locations include public places in the community (e.g., coffee shop, park), the participant's home, or a research clinic space or by phone. Session content is flexible and allows for the peer mentor to provide general supportive listening, validation, and sharing. Session duration is on average 1 hour with at least 15 minutes discussing hope or belongingness according to semi-structured conversation guides. The session structure and content are intentionally highly flexible to allow for genuineness in the peer relationship, thereby increasing acceptability and implicit belongingness.</description>
