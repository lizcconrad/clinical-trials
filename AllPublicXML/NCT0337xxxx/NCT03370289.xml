      The drug being tested in this study is called BLB-750 that is a vaccine for influenza
      infection. This study will look at immunogenicity and safety of two intramuscular
      vaccinations with BLB-750 at 3-week intervals in healthy Japanese adults. The study will
      enroll 55 participants. BLB-750 will be administered in opened manner:

      - Two intramuscular vaccinations of BLB-750 at 3-week intervals, 0.5 mL

      This trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study will be
      43 days, starting on the day of initial vaccination. Participants will make multiple visits
      to the clinic, including 21 days after the initial vaccination and 21 days after the second
      vaccination.
