  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective post-operative pain control can reduce patient morbidity and affect the patient
      outcome. Brachial plexus block is one of them, a popular and widely employed regional nerve
      block technique for perioperative anesthesia and analgesia for surgery of the upper
      extremity.

      Different drugs have been used as adjuvants with local anesthetics in brachial plexus block
      to achieve quick, dense and prolonged block like Morphine, Pethidine, Clonidine,
      Dexmedetomidine.

      Naloxone is opioid antagonists which could selectively block the excitatory effects of
      opioids. it release endorphins and also displace endorphins from receptor site .it also
      reduce the opioid induced side effects, such as vomiting, nausea, pruritus, and respiratory
      depression.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of ultra-low dose of naloxone when added to
      bupivacaine %.05 in supraclavicular brachial plexus block in orthopedic upper limb surgery
      and if it enhances the anti-nociceptive effect of post-operative opioid

      Effect of naloxone on anti-nociceptive criteria of post -operative opioid will be estimated
      by detecting the interval between each analgesic dose of post-operative opioid.
